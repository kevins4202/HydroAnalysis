8030,study region the current study was applied on two extensive and important regional aquifers the first is the shallow aquifer of gaza coastal aquifer gca palestine and the second is the deep aquifer of the nile delta nda egypt the two sites are suffering from high stress water resource and contamination by saltwater intrusion swi swi is natural phenomena that damage the fresh groundwater in two sites and increase the aquifer shallow and deep aquifer plays a natural role for keeping the quality of freshwater from swi in costal aquifers this study aims to compare different methods for aquifer protection from swi by analyzing their efficiency using numerical groundwater models in the two sites study focus the finite difference for density dependent groundwater flow model seawat was used on two sites to investigate the extension of swi without management base case and the four methods to control swi the numerical models were calibrated for the base case using the other studies and field data to simulate the intrusion in gca and nda the investigated four methods focused on 1 subsurface physical barriers of cut off walls 2 subsurface physical barriers of subsurface dams 3 the hydraulic method including treatment and recharge of collected wastewater abstraction and desalination of low salinity by brackish water and 4 the land reclamation using earth fill method new hydrological insights for the region the simulated results indicated for the base cases that the intrusion salt mass nacl reached 6068 103 kg for gca and 8863 1010 kg for nda moreover the percentage of aquifer salt mass was decreased and reached 17 60 23 30 7 85 and 6 20 in for shallow aquifer while it reached 2 05 0 90 5 30 and 0 80 in deep aquifer for the physical subsurface dam of cut off wall subsurface dam hydraulic method and land reclamation technique respectively on the other side the control methods in shallow aquifers is more effective than the deep one the subsurface barriers and land fill method isn t effective for deep aquifer while the hydraulic of trad method has a positive effect on swi in shallow and deep aquifers the current study could be carried out around the world in different coastal hydrological groundwater thickness using the effective method to increase the mitigation of swi and increase the fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifers keywords seawater intrusion subsurface barriers hydraulic methods land reclamation seawat nile delta gaza strip 1 introduction the intensively exploited regions around the world generally locate within the world coastal aquifers with around 70 bear 1979 over pumping and groundwater contamination by natural and artificial activities are depletion of fresh groundwater body variable density models of porous media are simulated to investigate the situation of the groundwater quantity and quality istok 1989 groundwater contamination is damage by four sources environmental domestic industrial and agriculture bear 1979 saltwater intrusion swi is a natural process which degrades groundwater quality by increasing the freshwater salinity in costal aquifer to exceed the acceptable standards abd elhamid et al 2016 also increased by human impact make clear that there are needs to manage aquifer use and to predict future conditions under consideration of various management strategies the aquifers groundwater pollution by swi has a major impact on groundwater also the management of swi interface in the coastal regions is environmental issue and sustains the fresh groundwater resources abd elaty et al 2019a different methods were developed to control swi in costal aquifer including abstraction well constrains or optimize the abstraction using optimization models abd elaty et al 2021a also todd 1974 presented the methods to manage and control swi in costal aquifer including optimizing the pumping rates reduction and relocation freshwater recharges using natural and artificial techniques subsurface barriers brackish and saline water abstraction and combination between the abstraction and the recharge techniques optimization of pumping rates by reduction in abstraction and changing the location the wells is applied for managing the coastal aquifer swi zhou et al 2003 simulated the groundwater levels by applying a 3 d code in spatial and temporal distribution amaziane et al 2004 used combination of the genetic algorithm with the boundary element method to optimize the pumping rates to prevent swi the study changed the location of pumping wells to remain the groundwater storage and increase groundwater level ofelia et al 2004 simulated a management study for protecting the freshwater system in santa fe argentina the study was turned off the current production wells and carried out a new anew abstraction wells this method isn t applicable because the abstraction is difficult to manage due to restrictions by increasing water shortages and the demands also relocation of wells is difficult to achieve due to the wells growth in shortage area subsurface physical barriers method used to reduce the aquifer permeability to control the saline water inflow into the basin the barriers are impervious structures which constructed to manage the sea water inflow and increase the groundwater storage or potentiality in a coastal aquifer these physical barriers can be divided into two types based on the position of groundwater flow opening towards the coast the first is cut off wall which is installed perpendicular to the aquifer flow direction the second are subsurface dams which are imbedded on the aquifer bedrock as are storage dams roger et al 2010 the construction materials of barriers are using the sheet piles and the cement or chemical grout barsi 2001 optimized the construction cost of subsurface barrier through the width and location and showed that the subsurface dam function is increased by the groundwater storage and retard swi by rainfall harvesting and recharge into the coastal aquifers ru et al 2001 simulated the swi using 3d model and identify the efficiency of the subsurface dam construction for protecting the fresh groundwater resources abd elhamid and javadi 2008a indicated that the subsurface barriers construction operation maintenance and monitoring could be costly to control of swi and isn t efficient for deep aquifers abd elhamid et al 2015 used a diaphragm wall for mitigating the future influences of raising the sea level on the north coastal zones egypt abd elaty et al 2019b evaluated the subsurface physical barriers efficiency to manage swi the study showed that the cut off walls more effective for swi management than the sub surface dams abstraction recharge process ar

of using different scnarios of abstraction rates with aquifer recharge in sardinia italy rastogi et al 2004 indicated that freshwater recharge and brackish water abstraction is effective to control of swi than using single method narayan et al 2006 showed that the artificial recharge costly and ineffective in over pumping regions also the study showed that the wells depths locations and rates are important to control swi abd elhamid and javadi 2008 developed adr methodology including abstraction desalination and recharge of the brakish water to mitigate the swi and avoiding the limitations of ar method by technical economic and environmental aspects abd elhamid and abd elaty 2017 developed the trad methodology including treatment and recharge of wastewater abstraction and desalination of brackish water the study presented that trad method is an effective tool to mitigate swi more economical less environmental impacts and more sustainable in coastal areas abd elaty et al 2021b investigated and managed the swi using different wells systems in the nda egypt the study indicated that swi management was reached 19 5 6 2 5 9 and 21 3 for applying the increasing the fresh groundwater recharge decreeing the current fresh groundwater abstraction rates increasing the abstraction of brackish water and combine of the three techniques respectively moreover the climate change over population and civilization are leading to increase the water demands and technology of brackish and sea water desalination abd elaty et al 2021c land reclamation technique is using the land fill which impacts on the freshwater resources in coastal areas guo and jiao 2007 this technique is changing and increasing the groundwater flow and the discharges in coastal direction jiao et al 2006 the reclamation areas around the worlds are supporting the agriculture demands and land use in the coastal regions hu and jiao 2010 stuyfzand 1995 showed that the groundwater quality may changes using the reclaimed lakes in netherlands chen and jiao 2007 showed that the transition zone can be move in costal aquifer by reducing groundwater pumping and coastal reclamation guo and jiao 2007 investigated the changing of freshwater heads and transition zone respect to land reclamation using analytical solutions also the study showed that the intrusion depends on the permeability of the filling material jiao et al 2006 2008 showed that extensive urbanization changed groundwater system while the land reclamation was increased the groundwater heads for a coastal region of hong kong hu and jiao 2010 used feflow code to investigate the effect of earth land fill on the fresh groundwater resources in the shekou peninsula china from 1983 to 2007 the results showed that the groundwater heads and discharge were increased after reclamation also the study was simulated between 2007 and 2025 and showed that land reclamation affects the aquifer system and is a long lasting process abd elhamid et al 2020 applied seawat for mitigation of swi using coastal land reclamation the results presented that increasing the fill width by 150 m 300 m and 465 m retards the swi length by 32 3 60 50 and 91 3 in the case of biscayne aquifer usa in this study a new comparison for swi management in shallow and deep aquifer is investigated 3 d of variable density of seawat is applied for control of swi in two sites the first site is the nile delta egypt for deep aquifer the second is gaza costal aquifer palestine for shallow one different scenarios of control have been considered by using the physical subsurface barriers for the cut off walls and the subsurface dams hydraulic method using the abstraction and recharge technique and the land reclamation using earth fill the impact of these scenarios on seawater intrusion is investigated and intrusion length was developed the impact of aquifer depth was detected and the intrusion in the aquifer is estimated for these cases 2 numerical model the 3

calibration of nda was done by the calculated values from seawat versus the observed by the field data fig 5 is presented the salinity distribution for the tds contamination in the vertical cross section from the north mediterranean sea to the south the total length is 150 km and the depth ranges from 200 to 1000 m the variable density model was used the same solution method in shallow in gca the initial time of 0 001 day the step time of 200 days and the model took about 1825000 days to reach the steady state condition the nda intrusion length for the equi concentration line 35000 ppm reached 70 10 km while the equi concentration line 1000 ppm intruded to 97 25 km calculated from shore line the mediterranean sea with transition zone of 27 10 km the developed model results were compared with nofal et al 2015 and abd elaty et al 2021b these studies were used monitoring points in nda to calibrate the current model the current model results were given a good agreement with these studies and observed in the middle vertical cross section 3 3 proposed modelling scenarios the seawat was carried out for the two case studies the first is the shallow aquifer of gca and the second is deep aquifer of nda using four methods to mitigate the swi in high stress water shortage the first scenario was applied the physical barriers of cut off wall using depths ratio of 42 to reach 75 m and 400 m for gca and nda respectively see fig 6a the second scenario was installed the subsurface dam using the same values used in the cutoff wall scenarios by dam highest of 75 and 400 m respectively see fig 6b the third is applied the abstraction and recharge wells technique by rates of 10 from the total aquifer abstraction rates to be 2 06 and 763270 m3 day 1 m 1 for the two cases respectively see fig 6c the fours scenario was used the earth fill by 1 km for two aquifers in the sea direction see fig 6d 4 results 4 1 control of swi in shallow and deep aquifer seawat code was applied to study the identify the efficiency of different methods to control of swi using subsurface physical barriers for the cut off wall and subsurface dam the hydraulic method using abstraction and recharge technique and land reclamation using land fill reclamation on swi in the costal aquifers for the two case studies including the shallow of gaza coastal aquifer gca palestine and the deep of the nile delta aquifer nda egypt and 4 2 control of swi using cut off wall the cut off wall was installed using horizontal flow barrier hfb package to carry out barriers to flow by reduction in permeability of wall such as slurry walls the physical subsurface barriers was fixed at depth of 75 from 180 m of total depth as a shallow aquifer of gca while the wall depth reached 400 m from the total aquifer depth of 959 with ratio 42 by for nda as a deep aquifer respectively see fig 7a and c the vertical distribution of tds in the gca and nda was presented in fig 8b and d where the intrusion results for the gca reached 2730 and 3426 m from shore line the mediterranean sea for equi concentration line 35000 ppm and 1000 ppm see7b also a new interface was detected where the intrusion length of equi concentration line 35000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached to 68 90 km and 97 km from shore line respectively for the nda see fig 7d the results indicated that using the cut off wall was decreased the swi in shallow coastal aquifers while it have low effect on decreasing swi in deep coastal aquifers compare with the 4 3 control of swi using subsurface dams fig 8a and c shows the installing of subsurface dam by the same ratio that applied by the cut off wall using height of 75 m for shallow aquifer and 400 m for deep aquifer the intrusion results in shallow gca for equi concentration line 35000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached 2007 m and 3015 m while the intrusion reached 68 95 km and 96 60 km from shore line in deep aquifer of the nda as shown in fig 8b and d respectively the results showed that installing of subsurface dam have effective in control swi in shallow aquifers gca more than deep one nda on the other word the subsurface dam has no effect in deep coastal aquifers 4 4 control of swi using abstraction and recharge technique this hydraulic method is presented by brackish water abstraction and treated wastewater or desalinated abstracted groundwater recharge to mitigate the swi in shallow and deep coastal aquifers fig 9a and c shows the distribution of the abstraction and recharge wells in the two aquifers moreover the gca was applied using one well for abstraction and one well recharge the same ratio for the abstraction well distances were used in two aquifers by 27 from the total aquifer length 9000 m to reach 2430 m while it reached 42 for recharge well to reach 3780 m the abstraction and recharge rates were used by 10 from total recharge 20 75 m3day 1m 1 to be 2 06 m3 day 1 per meter length of aquifer in deep aquifer of the nile delta the method was applied using two rows of abstraction wells by 2 km for the distance between the well and 10 km between the two rows the distance between the first row and shoreline was applied 30 km while the recharge wells was installed at two rows using 2 km between the wells and 5 km between the two rows also the distance between the abstraction and recharge wells rows was installed by 22 50 km also the rates of abstraction and recharge technique were 10 from total study area abstraction 7632700 m3 day 1 to be 763270 m3 day 1 see fig 9c the recharge water will be achieved by collected wastewater and desalination due to the shortage of water supplies in these regions the results showed that the intrusion were reached 3040 m and 3675 m for gca while it reached 67 15 km and 95 40 km for nda for equi concentration line 35 and 1respectivilly as shown in fig 9b and d the results indicated abstraction recharge technique has significant effect on fitting the saltwater intrusion for deep and shallow aquifers 4 5 control of swi using land reclamation method land reclamation of shoreline using earth fill to create new green areas can be achieved by using artificial filling the fill can change the shoreline location at seaside and can changes the interface of saltwater intrusion this method was carried out for gca and nda using earth fill at a distance reached 1 km for the two aquifers from the shoreline in the sea direction as shown in fig 10a and c the results indicated that swi was reached 3365 and 4074 m for gca while it reached 69 80 and 96 75 km respectively for the nda as shown in fig 10b and d the results showed that the land reclamation method is effective in control of swi in shallow aquifers while in deep aquifers it is low effect 5 discussion of results based on the previous results and table 3 for using four techniques to mitigate swi in deep aquifer by the nile delta aquifer and in shallow aquifer using gaza aquifer can have indicated that four using cut off wall in deep and shallow aquifer have no significantly influence on swi moreover the subsurface dam is more effective to control swi for shallow aquifer and slightly effect by deep aquifer also applying abstraction and recharge method have strong effect of swi in deep and shallow aquifer while applying the fill method the swi have a positive impact on swi in deep and shallow aquifer and it is better for slope shore line the salt mass for the base case reached 6 068 106 and 8 863 1013 also using the physical barriers of cutoff wall decreased the salt to 5 106 and 8 683 1013 while it reached 4 653 106 and 8 784 1013 using the subsurface dam moreover the salinity reached 5 593 106 8 40 1013 for applying the abstraction and recharge methods while it reached 5 592 106 and 8 80 1013 for using land reclamation in shallow and deep aquifer respectively moreover the thickness of groundwater strata not only the critical parameters to select the effective method for swi management but also the hydrology of aquifer basin and construction cost of the mitigation technique could be considered in selection these are agreed with the recommendation by abd elaty et al 2021a 6 conclusion saltwater intrusion in costal aquifer has a negative impact on freshwater quality several studies were developed to identify swi in these aquifers this study aims to investigate the swi in deep and shallow aquifers the shallow aquifer is gaza palestine and the deep is nda egypt the numerical software of variable density groundwater flow and solute transport of seawat was used to investigate of swi in two aquifers for base case and four scenarios to control of swi including subsurface flow barriers cutoff wall subsurface dams trad method the study was carried out using the same ratio between the two aquifers the results indicated that the shallow aquifer is more effective to control swi than deep aquifer for cut off wall subsurface dam and earth land fill also the abstraction recharge method is effective for deep and shallow aquifers the current study could be useful to select the effective method for swi management in coastal aquifer before installing the

8030,study region the current study was applied on two extensive and important regional aquifers the first is the shallow aquifer of gaza coastal aquifer gca palestine and the second is the deep aquifer of the nile delta nda egypt the two sites are suffering from high stress water resource and contamination by saltwater intrusion swi swi is natural phenomena that damage the fresh groundwater in two sites and increase the aquifer shallow and deep aquifer plays a natural role for keeping the quality of freshwater from swi in costal aquifers this study aims to compare different methods for aquifer protection from swi by analyzing their efficiency using numerical groundwater models in the two sites study focus the finite difference for density dependent groundwater flow model seawat was used on two sites to investigate the extension of swi without management base case and the four methods to control swi the numerical models were calibrated for the base case using the other studies and field data to simulate the intrusion in gca and nda the investigated four methods focused on 1 subsurface physical barriers of cut off walls 2 subsurface physical barriers of subsurface dams 3 the hydraulic method including treatment and recharge of collected wastewater abstraction and desalination of low salinity by brackish water and 4 the land reclamation using earth fill method new hydrological insights for the region the simulated results indicated for the base cases that the intrusion salt mass nacl reached 6068 103 kg for gca and 8863 1010 kg for nda moreover the percentage of aquifer salt mass was decreased and reached 17 60 23 30 7 85 and 6 20 in for shallow aquifer while it reached 2 05 0 90 5 30 and 0 80 in deep aquifer for the physical subsurface dam of cut off wall subsurface dam hydraulic method and land reclamation technique respectively on the other side the control methods in shallow aquifers is more effective than the deep one the subsurface barriers and land fill method isn t effective for deep aquifer while the hydraulic of trad method has a positive effect on swi in shallow and deep aquifers the current study could be carried out around the world in different coastal hydrological groundwater thickness using the effective method to increase the mitigation of swi and increase the fresh groundwater resources in coastal aquifers keywords seawater intrusion subsurface barriers hydraulic methods land reclamation seawat nile delta gaza strip 1 introduction the intensively exploited regions around the world generally locate within the world coastal aquifers with around 70 bear 1979 over pumping and groundwater contamination by natural and artificial activities are depletion of fresh groundwater body variable density models of porous media are simulated to investigate the situation of the groundwater quantity and quality istok 1989 groundwater contamination is damage by four sources environmental domestic industrial and agriculture bear 1979 saltwater intrusion swi is a natural process which degrades groundwater quality by increasing the freshwater salinity in costal aquifer to exceed the acceptable standards abd elhamid et al 2016 also increased by human impact make clear that there are needs to manage aquifer use and to predict future conditions under consideration of various management strategies the aquifers groundwater pollution by swi has a major impact on groundwater also the management of swi interface in the coastal regions is environmental issue and sustains the fresh groundwater resources abd elaty et al 2019a different methods were developed to control swi in costal aquifer including abstraction well constrains or optimize the abstraction using optimization models abd elaty et al 2021a also todd 1974 presented the methods to manage and control swi in costal aquifer including optimizing the pumping rates reduction and relocation freshwater recharges using natural and artificial techniques subsurface barriers brackish and saline water abstraction and combination between the abstraction and the recharge techniques optimization of pumping rates by reduction in abstraction and changing the location the wells is applied for managing the coastal aquifer swi zhou et al 2003 simulated the groundwater levels by applying a 3 d code in spatial and temporal distribution amaziane et al 2004 used combination of the genetic algorithm with the boundary element method to optimize the pumping rates to prevent swi the study changed the location of pumping wells to remain the groundwater storage and increase groundwater level ofelia et al 2004 simulated a management study for protecting the freshwater system in santa fe argentina the study was turned off the current production wells and carried out a new anew abstraction wells this method isn t applicable because the abstraction is difficult to manage due to restrictions by increasing water shortages and the demands also relocation of wells is difficult to achieve due to the wells growth in shortage area subsurface physical barriers method used to reduce the aquifer permeability to control the saline water inflow into the basin the barriers are impervious structures which constructed to manage the sea water inflow and increase the groundwater storage or potentiality in a coastal aquifer these physical barriers can be divided into two types based on the position of groundwater flow opening towards the coast the first is cut off wall which is installed perpendicular to the aquifer flow direction the second are subsurface dams which are imbedded on the aquifer bedrock as are storage dams roger et al 2010 the construction materials of barriers are using the sheet piles and the cement or chemical grout barsi 2001 optimized the construction cost of subsurface barrier through the width and location and showed that the subsurface dam function is increased by the groundwater storage and retard swi by rainfall harvesting and recharge into the coastal aquifers ru et al 2001 simulated the swi using 3d model and identify the efficiency of the subsurface dam construction for protecting the fresh groundwater resources abd elhamid and javadi 2008a indicated that the subsurface barriers construction operation maintenance and monitoring could be costly to control of swi and isn t efficient for deep aquifers abd elhamid et al 2015 used a diaphragm wall for mitigating the future influences of raising the sea level on the north coastal zones egypt abd elaty et al 2019b evaluated the subsurface physical barriers efficiency to manage swi the study showed that the cut off walls more effective for swi management than the sub surface dams abstraction recharge process ar is a hydraulic technique used to mitigate the costal aquifer swi and retard the variable density interface towards the shore line rastogi et al 2004 mahesha 1996c paniconi et al 2001 simulated the occurrence of swi in the korba coastal plain tunisia and presented the relation between the abstraction wells artificial recharge and aquifer properties sherif and hamza 2001 simulated the abstraction of brackish water to mitigate swi impacts and reused this desalinated freshwater in irrigation process barrocu et al 2004 applied a combination of codesa 3d model and gis tool to investigate influence of using different scnarios of abstraction rates with aquifer recharge in sardinia italy rastogi et al 2004 indicated that freshwater recharge and brackish water abstraction is effective to control of swi than using single method narayan et al 2006 showed that the artificial recharge costly and ineffective in over pumping regions also the study showed that the wells depths locations and rates are important to control swi abd elhamid and javadi 2008 developed adr methodology including abstraction desalination and recharge of the brakish water to mitigate the swi and avoiding the limitations of ar method by technical economic and environmental aspects abd elhamid and abd elaty 2017 developed the trad methodology including treatment and recharge of wastewater abstraction and desalination of brackish water the study presented that trad method is an effective tool to mitigate swi more economical less environmental impacts and more sustainable in coastal areas abd elaty et al 2021b investigated and managed the swi using different wells systems in the nda egypt the study indicated that swi management was reached 19 5 6 2 5 9 and 21 3 for applying the increasing the fresh groundwater recharge decreeing the current fresh groundwater abstraction rates increasing the abstraction of brackish water and combine of the three techniques respectively moreover the climate change over population and civilization are leading to increase the water demands and technology of brackish and sea water desalination abd elaty et al 2021c land reclamation technique is using the land fill which impacts on the freshwater resources in coastal areas guo and jiao 2007 this technique is changing and increasing the groundwater flow and the discharges in coastal direction jiao et al 2006 the reclamation areas around the worlds are supporting the agriculture demands and land use in the coastal regions hu and jiao 2010 stuyfzand 1995 showed that the groundwater quality may changes using the reclaimed lakes in netherlands chen and jiao 2007 showed that the transition zone can be move in costal aquifer by reducing groundwater pumping and coastal reclamation guo and jiao 2007 investigated the changing of freshwater heads and transition zone respect to land reclamation using analytical solutions also the study showed that the intrusion depends on the permeability of the filling material jiao et al 2006 2008 showed that extensive urbanization changed groundwater system while the land reclamation was increased the groundwater heads for a coastal region of hong kong hu and jiao 2010 used feflow code to investigate the effect of earth land fill on the fresh groundwater resources in the shekou peninsula china from 1983 to 2007 the results showed that the groundwater heads and discharge were increased after reclamation also the study was simulated between 2007 and 2025 and showed that land reclamation affects the aquifer system and is a long lasting process abd elhamid et al 2020 applied seawat for mitigation of swi using coastal land reclamation the results presented that increasing the fill width by 150 m 300 m and 465 m retards the swi length by 32 3 60 50 and 91 3 in the case of biscayne aquifer usa in this study a new comparison for swi management in shallow and deep aquifer is investigated 3 d of variable density of seawat is applied for control of swi in two sites the first site is the nile delta egypt for deep aquifer the second is gaza costal aquifer palestine for shallow one different scenarios of control have been considered by using the physical subsurface barriers for the cut off walls and the subsurface dams hydraulic method using the abstraction and recharge technique and the land reclamation using earth fill the impact of these scenarios on seawater intrusion is investigated and intrusion length was developed the impact of aquifer depth was detected and the intrusion in the aquifer is estimated for these cases 2 numerical model the 3 d variable density model using seawat code was applied in the current simulation for the two cases including shallow aquifer of gca and deep aquifer of nda the seawat was combining the modflow and mt3dms the variable density flow vdf process used in seawat is solving the flow equation and expressed by guo and langevin 2002 while the imt integrated mt3dms transport process that solving the solute transport equation and expressed by zheng and wang 1999 the main terms of equations used in the seawat version 4 was published and presented by langevin et al 2008 3 material and methods 3 1

calibration of nda was done by the calculated values from seawat versus the observed by the field data fig 5 is presented the salinity distribution for the tds contamination in the vertical cross section from the north mediterranean sea to the south the total length is 150 km and the depth ranges from 200 to 1000 m the variable density model was used the same solution method in shallow in gca the initial time of 0 001 day the step time of 200 days and the model took about 1825000 days to reach the steady state condition the nda intrusion length for the equi concentration line 35000 ppm reached 70 10 km while the equi concentration line 1000 ppm intruded to 97 25 km calculated from shore line the mediterranean sea with transition zone of 27 10 km the developed model results were compared with nofal et al 2015 and abd elaty et al 2021b these studies were used monitoring points in nda to calibrate the current model the current model results were given a good agreement with these studies and observed in the middle vertical cross section 3 3 proposed modelling scenarios the seawat was carried out for the two case studies the first is the shallow aquifer of gca and the second is deep aquifer of nda using four methods to mitigate the swi in high stress water shortage the first scenario was applied the physical barriers of cut off wall using depths ratio of 42 to reach 75 m and 400 m for gca and nda respectively see fig 6a the second scenario was installed the subsurface dam using the same values used in the cutoff wall scenarios by dam highest of 75 and 400 m respectively see fig 6b the third is applied the abstraction and recharge wells technique by rates of 10 from the total aquifer abstraction rates to be 2 06 and 763270 m3 day 1 m 1 for the two cases respectively see fig 6c the fours scenario was used the earth fill by 1 km for two aquifers in the sea direction see fig 6d 4 results 4 1 control of swi in shallow and deep aquifer seawat code was applied to study the identify the efficiency of different methods to control of swi using subsurface physical barriers for the cut off wall and subsurface dam the hydraulic method using abstraction and recharge technique and land reclamation using land fill reclamation on swi in the costal aquifers for the two case studies including the shallow of gaza coastal aquifer gca palestine and the deep of the nile delta aquifer nda egypt and 4 2 control of swi using cut off wall the cut off wall was installed using horizontal flow barrier hfb package to carry out barriers to flow by reduction in permeability of wall such as slurry walls the physical subsurface barriers was fixed at depth of 75 from 180 m of total depth as a shallow aquifer of gca while the wall depth reached 400 m from the total aquifer depth of 959 with ratio 42 by for nda as a deep aquifer respectively see fig 7a and c the vertical distribution of tds in the gca and nda was presented in fig 8b and d where the intrusion results for the gca reached 2730 and 3426 m from shore line the mediterranean sea for equi concentration line 35000 ppm and 1000 ppm see7b also a new interface was detected where the intrusion length of equi concentration line 35000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached to 68 90 km and 97 km from shore line respectively for the nda see fig 7d the results indicated that using the cut off wall was decreased the swi in shallow coastal aquifers while it have low effect on decreasing swi in deep coastal aquifers compare with the 4 3 control of swi using subsurface dams fig 8a and c shows the installing of subsurface dam by the same ratio that applied by the cut off wall using height of 75 m for shallow aquifer and 400 m for deep aquifer the intrusion results in shallow gca for equi concentration line 35000 ppm and 1000 ppm reached 2007 m and 3015 m while the intrusion reached 68 95 km and 96 60 km from shore line in deep aquifer of the nda as shown in fig 8b and d respectively the results showed that installing of subsurface dam have effective in control swi in shallow aquifers gca more than deep one nda on the other word the subsurface dam has no effect in deep coastal aquifers 4 4 control of swi using abstraction and recharge technique this hydraulic method is presented by brackish water abstraction and treated wastewater or desalinated abstracted groundwater recharge to mitigate the swi in shallow and deep coastal aquifers fig 9a and c shows the distribution of the abstraction and recharge wells in the two aquifers moreover the gca was applied using one well for abstraction and one well recharge the same ratio for the abstraction well distances were used in two aquifers by 27 from the total aquifer length 9000 m to reach 2430 m while it reached 42 for recharge well to reach 3780 m the abstraction and recharge rates were used by 10 from total recharge 20 75 m3day 1m 1 to be 2 06 m3 day 1 per meter length of aquifer in deep aquifer of the nile delta the method was applied using two rows of abstraction wells by 2 km for the distance between the well and 10 km between the two rows the distance between the first row and shoreline was applied 30 km while the recharge wells was installed at two rows using 2 km between the wells and 5 km between the two rows also the distance between the abstraction and recharge wells rows was installed by 22 50 km also the rates of abstraction and recharge technique were 10 from total study area abstraction 7632700 m3 day 1 to be 763270 m3 day 1 see fig 9c the recharge water will be achieved by collected wastewater and desalination due to the shortage of water supplies in these regions the results showed that the intrusion were reached 3040 m and 3675 m for gca while it reached 67 15 km and 95 40 km for nda for equi concentration line 35 and 1respectivilly as shown in fig 9b and d the results indicated abstraction recharge technique has significant effect on fitting the saltwater intrusion for deep and shallow aquifers 4 5 control of swi using land reclamation method land reclamation of shoreline using earth fill to create new green areas can be achieved by using artificial filling the fill can change the shoreline location at seaside and can changes the interface of saltwater intrusion this method was carried out for gca and nda using earth fill at a distance reached 1 km for the two aquifers from the shoreline in the sea direction as shown in fig 10a and c the results indicated that swi was reached 3365 and 4074 m for gca while it reached 69 80 and 96 75 km respectively for the nda as shown in fig 10b and d the results showed that the land reclamation method is effective in control of swi in shallow aquifers while in deep aquifers it is low effect 5 discussion of results based on the previous results and table 3 for using four techniques to mitigate swi in deep aquifer by the nile delta aquifer and in shallow aquifer using gaza aquifer can have indicated that four using cut off wall in deep and shallow aquifer have no significantly influence on swi moreover the subsurface dam is more effective to control swi for shallow aquifer and slightly effect by deep aquifer also applying abstraction and recharge method have strong effect of swi in deep and shallow aquifer while applying the fill method the swi have a positive impact on swi in deep and shallow aquifer and it is better for slope shore line the salt mass for the base case reached 6 068 106 and 8 863 1013 also using the physical barriers of cutoff wall decreased the salt to 5 106 and 8 683 1013 while it reached 4 653 106 and 8 784 1013 using the subsurface dam moreover the salinity reached 5 593 106 8 40 1013 for applying the abstraction and recharge methods while it reached 5 592 106 and 8 80 1013 for using land reclamation in shallow and deep aquifer respectively moreover the thickness of groundwater strata not only the critical parameters to select the effective method for swi management but also the hydrology of aquifer basin and construction cost of the mitigation technique could be considered in selection these are agreed with the recommendation by abd elaty et al 2021a 6 conclusion saltwater intrusion in costal aquifer has a negative impact on freshwater quality several studies were developed to identify swi in these aquifers this study aims to investigate the swi in deep and shallow aquifers the shallow aquifer is gaza palestine and the deep is nda egypt the numerical software of variable density groundwater flow and solute transport of seawat was used to investigate of swi in two aquifers for base case and four scenarios to control of swi including subsurface flow barriers cutoff wall subsurface dams trad method the study was carried out using the same ratio between the two aquifers the results indicated that the shallow aquifer is more effective to control swi than deep aquifer for cut off wall subsurface dam and earth land fill also the abstraction recharge method is effective for deep and shallow aquifers the current study could be useful to select the effective method for swi management in coastal aquifer before installing the

8031,study region this study was conducted at an oil sands operation in the athabasca oil sands region aosr northeastern alberta canada the mine comprises open pit excavation of bituminous sands at two sites mildred lake ml and aurora north an with a single hot water extraction circuit connecting extraction plants at each mine study focus water samples were collected and analyzed regularly over an eight year period to establish inventories of site wide water isotope signatures including seasonal and interannual changes in the recycle water circuit and to permit future application of an isotope balance model to constrain poorly quantified processes such as evaporation losses dewatering of tailings and tailings pond connectivity of the recycle water circuit new hydrological insights for the region sampling of precipitation inputs over an 8 year period was used to constrain a local meteoric water line for the area differences in evaporative isotopic enrichment of tailings ponds at ml and an are attributed to use of athabasca river makeup water at the former site versus basal dewatering sources at the latter with similar atmospheric controls at both a conceptual model is developed summarizing temporal variations in water balance and isotopic signatures within the recycle water circuit including accurate simulation of the unique isotopic enrichment of cooling tower blowdown this study provides foundational evidence for application of stable isotope mass balance to monitor and improve industrial water use efficiency and management keywords isotope hydrology deuterium oxygen 18 isotope mass balance oil sands mine water management tailings management 1 introduction the global mining industry is under increasing pressure by public and governmental agencies to improve the sustainability of its operations tost et al 2018 foremost among sustainability issues is mine water demand and management due to high water consumption rates and the potential risk for contaminants to be transported off site by water and air the mildred lake and aurora north mines operated by syncrude canada ltd syncrude are typical oil sands mining operations located north of fort mcmurray alberta canada in 2019 40 1 million m3 or 13 of water used by syncrude was withdrawn from the athabasca river and the remaining 87 was comprised of recycled water from the process circuit overall freshwater water use intensity was 2 33 m3 per m3 of bitumen production excluding recycled waters syncrude 2019 sustainability fact sheet syncrude does not currently release process affected water to the environment therefore imported water that is not evaporated or chemically consumed in the upgrading process contributes to the existing on site inventory of oil sands process affected waters as of 2017 the estimated volume of stored process water on site in engineered tailings management facilities commonly referred to as tailings ponds was 1 7 gm3 reflecting net accumulation since the start of operations over 50 years ago of this total approximately 200 mm3 occurs as free water whereas the remainder is interstitial tailings porewater w zubot syncrude pers comm 2019 syncrude s recycled process water is drawn from the tailings ponds following settlement of the discharged tailings slurry zubot 2010 the storage supply and recirculation of process water from tailings ponds through upgrading and bitumen extraction facilities is referred to as the recycle water circuit the immensity of these stores and the critical stress on water for mine operations in this region highlight the importance of accurately tracking the water balance for on site water such as the recycle water circuit the infrastructure of tailings management facilities and operational water demand at oil sands mines are constantly evolving relative to mining operations as a result water balance parameters are often difficult to directly measure and so must be routinely modelled or estimated a recent review of water flow tracking at five oil sands mining operations found many differences in how operators track site wide water balances with unique challenges evident for individual operations cosia water epa 2019 this review recommended that site wide water balances could be improved through quantification of meteoric water inputs and evaporative losses for all operations developing new and efficient tools for tracking the rates pathways and distribution of water moving through large scale mining operations is a major research challenge here we explore and evaluate the feasibility of using the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen 18o 2h to track hydrological processes at an operating oil sands mine site and in particular to characterize major controls on isotopic composition and water balance of the recycled water circuit including addition of make up waters and evaporative losses which have been shown to systematically modify isotopic signatures see baer et al 2016 past studies involving 18o and 2h as tracers have been used primarily in gauged watersheds and for a variety of applications including hydrograph separation buttle 1994 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 transit

gonfiantini 1986 case studies in canada have also demonstrated wider application of the technique in cold regions including ungauged lake and river watersheds gibson et al 2019 2016a 2016b gibson and reid 2014 tondu et al 2013 turner et al 2014 turner wolfe and edwards 2010 while much progress has been made in basic research within natural systems the application of isotope tracing to mine water management has been less extensive a small number of studies have used stable isotopes for mine related applications including characterization of recharge rates or water movement through mine waste and tracing of off site mine water migration allen and voormeij 2002 gammons et al 2010 barbour et al 2016 dompierre and barbour 2016 characterization of 18o and 2h signatures within the oil sands first began as part of a geochemical characterization pilot study performed by gibson et al 2011 this was the first oil sands study to hypothesize that process affected water signatures were not necessarily controlled by pond water balance alone as is the case at natural lakes to date there has been limited research conducted on why mine waters display their unique isotopic signatures and how these signatures have progressively evolved in response to mining operations to our knowledge this is the first study to publish a multi year dataset of isotopic signatures for an operational recycle water circuit that captures interannual and seasonal variations this dataset builds spatially and temporally on investigations by baer et al 2016 conducted at syncrude operations at mildred lake and includes a new sampling program carried out concurrently at the nearby aurora mine site baer et al 2016 published the first local meteoric water line for the alberta oil sands region and isotopic signatures for a variety of mine site waters the study concluded that the contributions of cooling tower blowdown to the recycle water circuit and open water evaporation from tailings ponds were the primary controls on the unique isotopic signatures of oil sands process water herein we incorporate the findings of baer et al 2016 and describe results from a high frequency i e bi weekly isotope monitoring survey of site wide waters at both the mildred lake and aurora north mine sites characterization of the isotopic evolution of site wide waters was designed to further understanding of how naturally occurring waters e g meteoric waters and river import mix with current process water inventories to establish whether waters are systematically labelled across the mine site and to assess whether these isotopic signals can be employed to investigate and quantify water balance of reservoirs within the recycle water circuit the specific research objectives for this study were as follows to characterize seasonal and interannual trends of 2h and 18o signatures within the source waters and process affected water stores of the recycle water circuit and to develop a conceptual model characterizing the relative effects of operational and hydrological processes contributing to the isotopic evolution of the recycle water circuit at the outset of this study we expected that the temporal evolution of isotopic signatures observed from tailings ponds would mimic the seasonality of natural systems within the region i e lakes in a highly seasonal climate and that mining processes such as the use of evaporative cooling towers or dewatering of enriched tailings porewater were expected to modify these seasonal patterns therefore we anticipated that operational water demands would likely control the residence time of process water within individual tailings ponds and might dampen the build up of evaporatively enriched waters 1 1 study site oil sands mining operations began in 1978 at the mildred lake ml mine situated 40 km northwest of fort mcmurray and in 2000 at the aurora north an mine located 35 km to the northeast of mildred lake operated by syncrude canada ltd syncrude the mines are situated in the athabasca oil sands region aosr an area characterized by low relief wetland rich boreal forest and a cold highly seasonal climate with long winters and short summers monthly mean air temperature within the region ranges from 19 c for january to 17 c for july with a mean annual temperature near 1 c daily temperatures vary by up to 60 c between winter lows and summer highs annual average precipitation is approximately 450 mm with one third occurring as snow huang et al 2015 the average annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 500 mm per year huang et al 2015 relative humidity follows a seasonal pattern ranging from daily values of 77 for winter months to 65 for high evaporation months of may to october ramp regional aquatic monitoring program 2015 daily bitumen production by syncrude was 294 000 barrels per day in 2019 with a cumulative production exceeding 3 billion barrels since operations began the mine sites occupy an area of 200 km2 of which a variety of landforms are present including active mining pits tailings sand structures overburden dumps above ground and in pit tailings facilities and freshwater reservoirs historically water for bitumen extraction and upgrading has been obtained through the import of athabasca river makeup water as well as use of recycle water primarily for tailings transport and extraction any fresh water that is not consumed during upgrading is added to the recycle water circuit via cooling tower blowdown this study focuses primarily on the recycle water circuit at ml however isotopic data collected from an are presented alongside ml to demonstrate the unique isotopic fingerprints of process water with differing raw water sources both the ml and an mines have their own mining and extraction facilities however the two mines are hydraulically connected process water from the recycle water circuit at ml is sent via a pipeline to an and returned along with hydrotransported bitumen froth for upgrading water export from ml to an decreased from 21 3 mm3 in 2012 8 4 mm3 in 2016 with the majority of water demand at the an site now being provided by basal aquifer pumping w zubot d heisler syncrude pers comm 2019 the average return of process water from an to ml is approximately 3 7 mm3 the five primary tailings ponds at ml mine site are east in pit eip

bitumen rich ore are transported and deposited into tailings ponds as a slurry referred to as fluid tailings as the fluid tailings settle pore water is released and becomes available as clarified process water for reuse in the extraction and hydrotransport of bitumen this clarified water is directed to a centralized location at the ml plant referred to as the recycle pond rp a simplified conceptual diagram of raw water import and process water circulation making up the recycle water circuit at ml mine is provided in fig 2 2 methods 2 1 field sampling water samples were collected in 30 ml hdpe nalgene bottles tightly capped and with minimal headspace to minimize evaporation sampling was conducted primarily by syncrude s environmental group or by site operators sampling locations were selected in consultation with syncrude to accurately represent the recycle circuit water and contributing source waters samples obtained during 2012 2014 were collected as part of the initial characterization study performed by baer et al 2016 primary sampling of the ml and an circuits resumed in 2016 with key components sampled bi weekly to capture seasonal changes this study presents analyses from 220 samples collected at the ml mine including those collected by baer et al 2016 as follows swss n 47 mlsb n 61 swip n 57 and rp n 55 each tailings pond is sampled from the pump line supplying clarified water from the respective pond to the recycle pond the tailings slurry line from the extraction plant was also sampled n 41 sampling at an mine began in 2016 on a biweekly basis these samples included 129 samples collected from three an tailings ponds as follows aepn w n 41 aepn e n 43 and asb n 45 rain samples n 263 were collected over a 9 year period 2009 2018 samples were collected from rain collectors designed to minimize the atmospheric interactions and evaporative effects see baer 2014 the rainfall collectors were located at 7 locations including 5 at the mildred lake site and 2 at the aurora mine site samples were collected after each major rainfall event and depths associated with each isotope sampling event were monitored at on site meteorological stations snow samples n 147 were collected during annual snow depth surveys over the same period snow sampling for this study was performed along several transects and primarily collected from the top and bottom of the snowpack snow samples were sealed in ziploc freezer bags and allowed to melt at room temperature then transferred to water sample bottles a total of 46 samples were collected from four cooling towers used in the processing and upgrading of bitumen initial cooling tower blowdown samples were collected in the spring of 2016 from all cooling towers on site with a more extensive sampling campaign bi weekly initiated in the fall of 2016 only samples from the upgrading cooling tower could be obtained past the initial spring sampling of 2016 samples were also collected from the freshwater storage reservoir at ml known as mildred lake reservoir mlr n 22 as described by baer at al 2016 and athabasca river samples n 522 were obtained from gibson et al 2016c and subsequently from unpublished monthly data based on sampling conducted by alberta environment s long term river network ltrn 2 2 laboratory analysis apart from the athabasca river samples which were analyzed by innotech alberta see gibson et al 2016c all water samples were shipped to the university of saskatchewan saskatoon sk and were analyzed in the saskatchewan isotope laboratory using the methods described by lis et al 2008 an oa icos water isotope analyzer picarro l 2130 is coupled to a ctc lc pal liquid autosampler for simultaneous 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios measurements of h2o the autosampler injected 1 80 μl of h2o into a vapourizer using a 5 μl sge analytical syringe sge 001982 water samples were heated to 110 c with a picarro vapourization module a0211 and the vapour was then analyzed

laboratory standards usgs 46 47 and 48 normalized to vsmow 0 and vslap δ2h 428 and δ18o 55 5 and reported in per mil relative to vsmow error values associated with this method are estimated to be 0 8 for δ2h and 0 3 for δ18o 2 3 cooling tower blowdown fractionation model process units involved in the upgrading facility and other mining processes that require cooling are treated by open circulating evaporative cooling towers whereby water is continuously circulated through heated process units and returned back to the cooling towers hot water is piped into the cooling tower unit and dispersed onto fill media providing maximum surface area for the water to collect as the hot water interacts with ambient air passed through the cooling tower a portion of the water evaporates removing heat from the water the cooled water is collected in a basin at the base of the cooling tower and subsequently recirculated through process units or vessels requiring cooling saturated warm air is expelled through the top of the cooling tower units by fans a conceptual diagram of an evaporative cooling tower is provided in fig 3 further operational details of cooling towers at the site have been summarized by zubot 2010 the efficiency of the cooling towers is evaluated by the ratio of concentration of a dissolved species in the blowdown water c b to the make up water c mu referred to as the cycles of concentration coc c b c mu for example if the cycles of concentration is 10 or greater performance is rated very high and if coc is 2 or less performance is rated as very poor zubot 2010 the amount of water released as blowdown and the commensurate volume of water lost to evaporation can be calculated from the coc with the fraction f of water remaining after evaporation equal to 1 coc the monitored coc can be used to estimate evaporation however the corresponding isotopic fractionation is also governed by temperature t humidity h rh 100 where rh is relative humidity and the 18o and 2h concentrations within the water vapour of the air δ a18 and δ a2 inside the cooling towers calculating fractionation due to evaporative losses would require knowledge of these parameters which are not currently monitored for operational purposes estimates of these unknown parameters t h δ a18 δ a2 can be made to compare the isotopic signatures of blowdown and relate it to the observed coc we found that when the 18o and 2h values of blowdown waters were plotted against the fraction of water remaining f where f 1 coc the enrichment proceeded in a linear relationship similar to that of closed system rayleigh distillation therefore we attempted to constrain t and h by using a closed system fractionation model following criss 1999 1 δ f α tot δ i 1000 f α tot 1 α tot 1 f f where δ i and δ f are the initial and final isotopic composition of the reservoir over the model period f is the residual water fraction v f v 0 and α tot is the total fractionation factor between liquid and vapour calculated by 2 α tot ε ε k 1000 1 where ε and ε k are the equilibrium and kinetic enrichment in per mil calculated based on relationships with temperature and humidity h as outlined in horita et al 2008 the enrichment of the cooling tower blowdown was also modelled using a fraction dependent model that requires δ a values and incorporated a linear resistance model for estimating the isotopic composition of the evaporate craig and gordon 1965 cooling towers were modelled as evaporation only reservoirs i e dv dt e for which δ f was estimated according to gonfiantini 1986 as 3 δ f δ i a b f b a b where 4 a h δ a ε k ε α 1 h ε k and 5 b h ε k ε α 1 h ε k where α is the equilibrium enrichment factor which is empirically predicted based on t as outlined in horita et al 2008 similar isotope balance approaches have been applied to predict isotopic enrichment in drying evaporation pan experiments and shallow evaporative lakes see gibson et al 1999 2002 3 results 3 1 temporal isotopic signatures of precipitation and makeup water 3 1 1 precipitation sampling annual rainfall recorded from 2009 to 2017 ranged from 151 mm in 2011 to 387 mm in 2016 with an annual mean of 310 mm the isotopic composition of rain and snow samples collected across the site are shown in a dual isotope crossplot in fig 4a a total of 263 rainfall samples collected during 2009 2018 ranged between 26 23 and 7 03 in δ18o and 201 62 and 71 3 in δ2h with a weighted average of 14 77 and 120 06 for δ18o and δ2h respectively see table a 1 snow samples n 147 were collected in february march from 2009 2018 see table a 2 the snow water equivalent swe during these surveys ranged from 22 mm 2009 to 80 mm 2017 only a bulk representation of the isotopic composition of snow was possible given the collection methodology the non weighted mean isotopic composition of all snow samples considered representative of input during spring melt were found to be 24 67 and 191 04 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 4 b monthly precipitation values depict seasonality in isotopic composition at the closely located study sites fig 4b estimates of mean annual amount weighted precipitation was calculated using the rainfall amounts and corresponding isotopic composition of rain events for warm months and average snow composition and the measured swe for cold months the mean annual amount weighted precipitation is estimated to be 18 04 for δ18o and 143 54 for δ2h 3 1 2 local meteoric water lines local meteoric water lines lmwls updated to include the 2014 2019 data fig 4a are calculated as follows 6 δ 2 h 7 07 δ 18 o 14 4 amount weighted r squared 0 994 and 7 δ 2 h 6 95 δ 18 o 18 9 unweighted r squared 0 989 as compared to δ 2 h 7 20 δ 18 o 10 3 reported by baer et al 2016 for ml while the slope and intercept are slightly decreased compared to the previous lmwl calculated by baer these lines are essentially indistinguishable from the perspective of defining hydrologic inputs as snow was sampled opportunistically during winter and because bulk swe and average snowpack isotope values were used to amount weight for each month in winter rather than adhering strictly to monthly sampling the resulting lwml should be viewed as a first approximation however generally it appears to confirm differences between isotopic values for precipitation in the aosr as compared to edmonton δ 2 h 7 70 δ 18 o 0 02 or ft smith δ 2 h 6 8 δ 18 o 20 9 see baer et al 2016 3 1 3 athabasca river source water the temporal evolution in athabasca river samples n 524 2002 2020 table a 3 both upstream and downstream of fort mcmurray are shown in fig 5a based on an 18 year record average isotope values were found to be 17 87 and 142 42 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the athabasca river dataset was grouped by month to highlight seasonal patterns that could influence the isotopic composition of the imported waters for extraction with the monthly mean and standard deviations shown in fig 5b there was little variability found in the isotopic signature of athabasca river samples on a monthly basis with the monthly mean of δ18o shifting by only 1 00 and δ2h by 8 00 between the most enriched months mar sept oct and most depleted months june july the coefficient of variation cv for all river samples assessed was 4 30 and 3 35 for 18o and 2h respectively 3 2 temporal isotopic signatures of mine site waters 3 2 1 mildred lake reservoir mlr mlr is used to hold the raw water imported on site from athabasca river and differs from athabasca river due to storage effects which dampen seasonal and interannual variations surface water samples n 22 were collected from mlr over the period of 2012 2017 with the majority of samples collected in 2013 and 2014 see table a 4 fig 5a shows the temporal distribution of δ18o and δ2h from the sampling period the mean of all samples spanning the five year study was 16 72 and 137 49 for 18o and 2h respectively which was more enriched than the average isotopic composition of the athabasca river the isotopic signatures of the reservoir in spring 2013 and 2015 are very similar between each year and appear to be largely influenced by the spring freshet characterized by depleted snowmelt isotopic values isotopic signatures of the reservoir observed during late summer early fall in 2013 and 2014 differ noticeably between the years signatures from 2014 displayed more enriched values for both δ18o and δ2h suggesting the influence of changes in mine water demand on the isotopic signature rather than solely on changes in seasonal water balance components monthly variations and standard deviations are shown for mlr in fig 5b standard deviations were low for the spring and early summer months may july but became much higher in late summer and fall aug oct with isotopic ranges greater than 4 and 15 for 18o and 2h respectively the cvs of all mlr samples were found to be 8 44 and 4 52 respectively 3 2 2 cooling tower blowdown a total of 46 blowdown samples were collected from the cooling tower blowdown streams cap n 2 ue 1 n 2 utility n 2 upgrading n 40 over the period of 2016 2018 see table a 5 of the 46 samples collected the most depleted isotopic signatures were 16 18 and 132 5 for 18o and 2h respectively these signatures occurred on 8 nov 2017 and were collected from the upgrading tower the most enriched values of 10 03 and 95 5 for 18o and 2h respectively were collected from the cap tower on 7 march 2016 mean values for blowdown were 13 37 and 116 25 for 18o and 2h respectively raw water discharge was also measured in april 2016 to characterize the input water before fractionation effects this water had an isotopic signature of 18 32 and 144 4 for 18o and 2h respectively which was similar to relatively stable athabasca river signatures both 18o and 2h of cooling tower blowdown becomes more enriched as cycles of concentration increases fig 6 all the samples collected in this study fell along a similar enrichment trendline with a slope of 5 52 referred to as an evaporation line offset along the evaporation line indicates a higher degree of evaporation loss as confirmed by higher cycles of concentration coc values coc during sampling was typically 1 5 2 0 when sorted by month of collection the samples collected in the cooler months oct may plotted between the local evaporation line for tailings ponds and the lmwl whereas the warmer months june sept plotted below the local evaporation line this may be partly due to seasonal shifts in operating conditions t and possibly h in the cooling towers but must also reflect the influence of seasonal variations in the isotopic composition of ambient atmospheric moisture 3 2 3 recycle water circuit a 6 year record from ml mine 2012 2018 n 220 see table a 6 and a 2 year record from an mine 2016 2018 n 129 see table a 7 are presented in fig 7a up until 2015 all three existing tailings ponds located at ml mine swss swip rp and mlsb tracked closely to each other indicating similar sources and water balance conditions however from the end of 2016 onward the swss became significantly more enriched than mlsb indicating reduced connectivity of the swss to the remaining recycle water circuit leading to a cumulative evaporative enrichment as a result of reduced throughput and increased residence time the enrichment of swss is more evident when plotted in dual isotope space fig 7c overall the mlsb samples plotted closer to the lmwl than the other ponds while the rp samples displayed signatures consistent with a mixture of all tailings ponds predicted mean values and annual ranges for the recycle circuit based on mixture of mlsb swss and rp signatures are provided in table 1 tailings ponds at an mine are found to plot below those of the ml mine fig 7 an initially relied on clarified water supplied by ml for bitumen extraction although water demand decreased from 21 3 mm3 in 2012 8 4 mm3 in 2016 as basal aquifer pumping became the primary source water at the an site an returns an average of 3 7 mm3 of water in the form of bitumen froth to ml annually 18o values are similar to those at ml and display the same magnitude of seasonal enrichment fig 7b however 2h values are consistently lower than those at ml by approximately 10 15 likely due to the effect of basal mcmurray formation aquifer sources with depleted isotopic signatures at an based on 58 samples collected from the basal aquifer mean δ18o and δ2h were found to be 19 92 and 158 76 respectively with standard deviations of 0 76 and 4 20 this contrasts with athabasca river water averaging close to 17 87 for δ18o and 142 42 for δ2h which was the dominant source at ml the enrichment slopes from each mine site calculated by regression analysis of 18o and 2h in dual isotope space are slightly lower for ml 4 20 as compared to the an 4 54 which appears to suggest similar open water evaporative conditions but expectedly based on theoretical considerations also may produce slight convergence of evaporation trajectories at both sites towards similar limiting isotopic enrichment values as predicted from eqs 4 and 5 by a b the latter assertion assumes similar ambient atmospheric moisture controls at both sites 3 2 4 tailings slurry tailings slurry samples n 41 were collected between the years 2013 2018 ranging from 14 82 to 11 75 and 124 10 to 106 90 for 18o and 2h respectively with mean values of 13 58 and 117 89 respectively see table a 8 when plotted temporally the 18o and 2h values of the tailings slurry track closely with the rp values over time although the latter are relatively enriched below the lmwl due to evaporative isotopic enrichment 3 2 5 constraints on cooling tower fractionation one of the goals of this study was to quantify the isotopic signatures of input waters to the recycle water circuit for future isotope tracer studies firstly we utilized a closed system fractionation model eq 1 to estimate the isotopic signature of cooling tower blowdown using operational data provided by syncrude the primary controls affecting fractionation according to eq 1 are the cycles of water recirculation expressed as cycles of concentration coc as well as internal t and h within the cooling tower units coc values for each cooling tower were provided by syncrude but unfortunately t and h were not measured to constrain temperature and humidity and to provide a better indication of potential influence of these internal conditions on the resulting isotopic enrichment a sensitivity analysis was conducted varying temperature from 5 to 65 c and varying h between 0 75 and 0 95 as shown in figs s1 and s2 simulations suggested a best fit to the observed evaporation line slope for h 0 85 and t 35 c as the annual mean outside air temperature on site varied between 35 c and 25 c averaging 3 c we estimate that the cooling towers operated at temperatures that were 30 40 degrees higher than the external ambient atmosphere which notably influences the effective equilibrium fractionations potential sensitivity of the cooling tower enrichment process to ambient atmospheric moisture was also tested by simulating evaporation under a range of δ a values based on eqs 3 5 using best fit values for h and t determined by the previous sensitivity tests figs s1 and s2 as shown in fig s3 the lower boundary for the δ a values δ18o 24 94 δ2h 194 72 was calculated using the total weighted mean value of precipitation from the period may to oct and the assumption that atmospheric moisture is in equilibrium with precipitation following gibson et al 2016b a variety of lower boundary values were then tested in 10 intervals for sensitivity analysis simulations using more enriched values of δ a were found to predict evaporation slopes adequately however the degree of enrichment associated with measured volumetric reduction was greatly overpredicted fig s3 in fact better results were obtained for more depleted values of δ a which we attribute to the atmosphere in cooling towers being derived predominantly from evaporate itself with only minor influence of ambient δa introduced from the outside atmosphere in this case cooling towers can be viewed in a similar way to large lakes or oceans with very high evaporation recycling ratios see jasechko et al 2014 gibson et al 2016b this highlights our initial hypothesis that the cooling towers operated more similar to a closed system and are controlled primarily by temperature and humidity shifts rather than δa while some h gradient is suggested by the fitted enrichment trends the results are consistent with an atmosphere inside the cooling towers with a relative humidity of about 85 the effect of temperature gradients on the fractionation would be limited by the fact that δ a is inside the cooling towers and the main source of atmospheric humidity is the cooling tower source water itself rather than the free atmosphere while further work will be required to test our approach similar near equilibrium fractionation has been shown by ingraham et al 1994 for a cooling tower used at a power generation facility the volume weighted monthly and annual blowdown signatures were calculated for each tower using the reported cycles of concentration values and blowdown values 2002 2017 table a 9 and a 10 assuming a closed system model using raw water values sampled from the discharge line for inputs average isotopic signature for athabasca river and best fit values for t and h based on the sensitivity analysis the monthly range for δ18o δ2h was 13 52 to 11 51 117 84 to 106 24 with a monthly mean blowdown volume of 490 000 m3 the integrated annual signature was calculated as 12 53 and 112 16 for 18o and 2h respectively with an average annual blowdown volume of 5 9 mm3 4 discussion 4 1 tracing meteoric waters through the recycle water circuit isotopic signatures of the sampled meteoric waters displayed consistent seasonal patterns highly enriched precipitation values were observed during mid summer convective events and shifted along the lmwl precipitation in cooler periods e g late season rain and snowfall had more depleted signatures in comparison to warmer months the isotopic composition of snow had the lowest isotope values of all sampled precipitation also shifting along or close to the lmwl the most enriched monthly means occurred in june august and shifted to progressively more negative values over the months of september to november as temperatures cooled table a 1 these seasonal trends can be seen in the distribution of individual precipitation samples plotted in dual isotope space and categorized by month of collection fig 4b meteoric waters entered and mixed with stored process water through direct contact in tailings ponds and as direct surface runoff during spring melt events our observations indicate that the influence of individual precipitation events on the recycle water circuit is minor given the volume and isotopic signatures of individual tailings ponds notwithstanding the influence of the spring freshet was discernable each year by systematic depletion of the tailings ponds signatures cumulative evaporation sublimation and mid winter melting can contribute to enrichment of the snowpack over the winter and spring as melting progresses moser and stichler 1975 clark and fritz 1997 taylor et al 2002 nevertheless little evidence was found for systematic enrichment based on our snowpack measurements as a result we assumed that the average weighted value of snow samples collected was representative of snowmelt input to surficial waters on site this is consistent with lee et al 2010 who found that mean isotopic values of new snow snowpack and meltwater were not significantly different based on observations of temporal variation of the isotopic composition of the evolving snowpack and melt therefore it is considered appropriate to employ the average isotopic composition of the snowpack from the dataset for any future isotopic mass balance work quantifying the influence of snow and snowmelt to the recycle water circuit the intersection of the evaporation line with the lmwl has sometimes been used to estimate the representative isotopic signature of source waters to surface ponds gat 1996 gibson et al 2005 employing this approach for the case of the ml reclaimed areas we find primary source waters to be strongly skewed towards snowmelt runoff from a similar assessment of the lmwl intercepts of three shallow ponds on reclaimed sites at the ml site collected between may and november 2003 2018 we find the estimated source values for the ponds to be 23 2 and 178 5 for 18o and 2h respectively very similar to the average measured values for the snowpack δ18o 24 67 and δ2h 191 04 overall given the close agreement between intercepts and snowpack measurements we can conclude that snowpack was a dominant source anchoring the evaporation line trajectories for reclaimed areas while the influence of rainfall appeared to be relatively minor contrary to this observation evaporation lines developed for the recycle water circuit intersected the lmwl at a more enriched point beyond the cluster of snowpack values despite displaying seasonal depletion during the spring freshet when plotted temporally this observation indicates the greater influence of mining processes affecting isotopic mixing and fractionation within the recycle water circuit over the input of isotopically depleted snow and snowmelt our comprehensive isotope dataset of meteoric waters also reveals a high degree of variability of isotopic composition for individual precipitation events although these perturbations are not necessarily observable in the various mine circuits at the time of the events due to the residence time weighting effect of source waters in the system low residence times are expected in the tailings ponds due to high throughflow rates induced by high onsite water demand while syncrude does not track pumping rates to and from individual tailings ponds we estimate the free water volume of mlsb in 2016 to be 3 4 mm3 syncrude canada ltd 2017 whereas 200 mm3 yr 1 circulates through this pond in a year this suggests a residence time on the order of six days industry monitoring of water demand and exchange between tailings ponds including at a minimum seasonal volume of tailings ponds would greatly improve any attempts at isotope mass balance modelling to assess water balance parameters of the recycle water circuit consequently for isotope mass balance modelling of the mine circuits we recommend use of longer time intervals to buffer potentially short term perturbations in water supply demands which are currently not well quantified for this purpose seasonal or annual calculations using volume weighted averages of the isotopic signature of meteoric waters are recommended 4 2 tracing river import to the recycle water circuit stable isotopic variations in the athabasca river the source of mine makeup water have been monitored monthly over the past two decades under the aep osm long term river network ltrn program isotopic signatures in the river both upstream and downstream of ml have been shown to respond seasonally to variations in timing and proportions of input from snowmelt groundwater surface water and rainfall events as well as routing of water from both local and upstream tributaries and headwaters gibson et al 2016c interannual variations are also observed particularly in response to variations in snowpack extent timing of spring melt and summer storms typical seasonal isotopic variations are found to be in the range of 2 3 for δ18o and 10 15 for δ2h and generally become more depleted during spring melt and then rebound and enrich again during summer and fall winter variations are typified by subtle but progressive isotopic depletions which reflect recession to baseflow as groundwater becomes the dominant source of water under ice compared to isotopic variations noted for the athabasca river on site water reservoirs were found generally to undergo earlier spring melt depletion trends in may june rather than in june july which was typical for athabasca river mlr which is used to store raw water imported on site from athabasca river is operated at an average depth of 5 m d heisler syncrude pers comm 2018 the reservoir receives meteoric water inputs both as direct precipitation and via surface runoff and snowmelt events mlr freezes over during the winter with ice generally persisting from mid november to april may however it continues to receive water from athabasca river and supplies water to the mine site throughout the ice on period 4 3 tracing cooling tower blowdown the largest use of freshwater import from athabasca river is for bitumen upgrading matte 2005 zubot 2010 the majority of this water is heated and ultimately passes through the cooling towers prior to being added to the recycle circuit the isotopic composition of cooling tower blowdown is largely controlled by the number of cycles and resulting evaporative enrichment water has experienced however if the isotopic composition of the input water varies seasonally this signal could be reflected in the blowdown composition the mean annual relative humidity at ml is close to 71 with higher values in winter and lower values in summer initially humidity within the cooling towers was thought to be high and close to saturation i e near 100 our sensitivity analyses and modelling efforts have demonstrated that the cooling tower blowdown signatures are likely sensitive to internal conditions in the cooling towers i e humidity and temperature which affects evaporative fractionation of 18o and 2h but we have also postulated a weak dependence on ambient atmospheric moisture δa and local climate conditions based in part on theoretical considerations but also based on observed isotopic enrichment levels in the blowdown fig s3 these findings appear to be consistent with basic operation of the cooling towers as noted by mine site personnel which involve circulating outside air through the towers to prevent saturation within the chambers a procedure necessary to maintain required evaporation rates for optimal performance as a result it appears that ambient climate conditions may influence the overall extent of enrichment whereas internal humidity and temperature are more influential in determining the isotopic fractionations and the slope of the enrichment trend in dual isotope space overall the cooling towers might best be viewed as partially closed systems we suggest that these reservoirs could be accurately modelled using an isotope mass balance model that accounts for feedback of evaporate to its atmosphere in this case a high degree of feedback 70 80 evaporate provides a suitable fit to the observed evaporative trend noted in cooling tower blowdown we suggest that monitoring of blowdown signatures from all four towers and use of integrated averages both monthly and annually could compliment measured cycles of concentration information to better understand operational conditions at the site as well as to trace the influence of cooling tower blowdown on the water balance of the mine circuits 4 4 isotope mass balance considerations the most common approach taken in isotopic mass balance studies for natural systems is to assume the system is in isotopic and hydrologic steady state annually or to simulate systematic changes based on a series of monthly or short term time steps gibson 2002 gibson reid 2014 gibson et al 2016a although much of the same water is recycled year over year with the exception of water lost to evaporation we show that there are consistent levels of depletion in spring and enrichment in fall for both 18o and 2h each year based on our six years of sampling application of a steady state model using average annual values for various components of the mine water circuits could therefore be useful for providing a first approximation of long term operational variables such as evaporation losses total process water storage and pore water release during tailings self weighted consolidation if seasonal variations are of interest a monthly time series model could be similarly applied to characterize progressive changes in evaporation and water balance over the course of each season although with considerably greater effort at the ml site water samples were collected from the three largest and most active tailings ponds swss mlsb and swip as well as rp clarified process water is drawn from all tailings ponds concurrently and stored in a centralized location the recycle pond to provide recycled water to meet operational demands therefore we suggest that samples collected from rp should be representative of the overall isotopic signature of the recycle water circuit which could simplify monitoring and application of an isotope mass balance approach interestingly monitoring of recycle water could potentially provide a temporal record of proportions of the three main inputs to the recycle water circuit which are meteoric water cooling tower blowdown and pore water released following tailings settlement in addition to monitoring of mean water balance of tailings reservoirs including evaporation and expressed porewater we note that it could be used to track water balance interactions between the two mine sites as ml relies primarily on athabasca river water whereas an relies also on basal mcmurray aquifer sources and these waters are uniquely labelled shifts in isotopic composition due to changes in balance of source waters evaporation from open water and evaporative enrichment inherited from cooling tower blowdown may in fact lead to long term changes that do not mimic natural lakes or watersheds in the region and would be informative for characterizing these differences 4 5 conceptual model development a conceptual model was developed to summarize our current understanding of how water is imported and circulated through syncrude s mildred lake mine a typical oil sands operation from an isotope perspective fig 8 a monthly simulation of isotopic changes in the various mine circuit waters are shown in fig 9 as shown raw water is sourced from athabasca river which has only minor seasonal variations when compared to other mine site waters this water is stored in mlr and is then pumped at varying rates to meet operational water demands our samples indicate that when water demands are high i e high pumping rates from mlr the isotopic signature of the reservoir is reflective of the imported river water due to low residence times however if pumping rates are low during high evaporative months i e late summer there may be observable enrichment resulting from evaporative enrichment evaporation within the cooling towers is the dominant cause of enrichment in imported freshwater prior to input to the recycle water circuit the isotopic signature of the cooling tower blowdown varies depending on the recirculation time of water within the circuit quantified as cycles of concentration the internal conditions within the cooling towers i e temperature and humidity and to a lesser extent ambient atmospheric moisture cooling tower blowdown then mixes with the current stores of clarified process water or recycle water contained within the tailings ponds of the recycle water circuit mixing calculations show minimal response annually in the overall isotopic signature of the recycle water circuit from the addition of enriched cooling tower blowdown likely due to the massive reservoir of process water when compared to the much smaller blowdown volume being added despite this observation it is expected that the cumulative addition of cooling tower blowdown over multiple decades of operations may be a primary driver of unique isotopic signatures in recycled process affected water analysis of isotopic signatures of the clarified process water collected within this study demonstrates that the isotopic signature within the various storage facilities of the recycle water circuit fluctuates seasonally but seems to return to similar values year after year the isotopic composition of the recycle water circuit appears to replicate typical seasonal patterns associated with natural lakes in cold regions depleted process water signatures were observed following the spring melt of depleted snow accumulated on both ponds and across the site a systematic enrichment of process water was observed over the duration of the open water period attributed to evaporative fractionation resulting in isotopic enrichment within the recycle water circuit fig 9 the recycle water circuit remains active throughout the winter despite freeze up of the tailings pond surfaces process water samples collected throughout the ice on period demonstrated progressive isotopic depletion this pattern is believed to be due to higher throughput in the circuit and lack of substantial evaporation but may also be enhanced by formation of ice as ice water fractionation tends to temporarily sequester heavier isotopic species within the ice cover see gibson and prowse 1999 the tailings ponds act as both storage facilities for process water and settling basins for fluid tailings created during the extraction of bitumen from ore process water originally used for extraction is returned to the tailings ponds as a tailings slurry where settling and consolidation of the fluid tailings releases the pore water while young pore water is found to be similar to contemporary process water these relatively immobile waters may be stored for decades within fine tailings deposits and can be viewed as a deep reservoir of archival water associated with its year of deposition dompierre and barbour 2016 measured the isotopic depth profile of fluid tailings placed within a 45 m deep mined out pit and showed that the average signature of the tailings deposited at syncrude from 1994 to 2012 was 12 4 for δ18o and 112 2 for δ2h these values are more enriched than the isotopic signature of today s recycle water circuit as represented by the overall average of the recycle pond samples 13 37 and 115 86 for δ18o and δ2h respectively this is presumed to be the result of higher recycling ratios at present than historically when the tailings were deposited which is a testament to progressive improvements in operational efficiency from an isotope mass balance perspective tailings settlement and pore water release potentially distinguish response of tailings ponds and natural lakes and this effect needs to be considered in any quantitative isotope mass balance assessment one potential opportunity that emerges from this observation is that pore water from known age tailings deposits may serve as a temporal archive that can be used to reconstruct the historical isotopic signatures and related water balance history of a tailings pond or mine water circuit 5 concluding remarks the recycle water circuit is crucial to bitumen extraction and tailings management for oil sands mining operations isotope tracers provide the opportunity to quantify site wide water balance parameters such as meteoric water inputs evaporative losses and potentially infiltration or dewatering which are difficult or costly to directly monitor better understanding of these parameters would aid in improving efficiency of site wide water use and management within this work we characterized both the temporal evolution of the isotopic signatures of source waters to an oil sands mine and the process waters that make up the recycle water circuit based on a bi weekly water isotope monitoring program this builds upon prior studies conducted at syncrude s oil sands mines in the aosr we developed a conceptual model outlining the isotopic evolution of imported water as it transitions from a freshwater signature to one reflective of oil sands mining processes this model highlights the roles of mixing evaporation cooling tower blowdown and water demand which have contributed to the unique and evolving isotopic signatures of process water as they develop distinct characteristics compared to natural surface waters in the region this study has shown that the recycle water circuit exhibits seasonal isotopic patterns characteristic of cold region reservoirs specifically a rapid depletion following the spring freshet which is then followed by systematic enrichment during the open water period interannually the recycle water circuit appears to be close to isotopic steady state with isotopic signatures collected from the late summer and fall i e following prime evaporative months consistently falling between 11 to 12 and 105 to 110 for 18o and 2h respectively expressed pore water released from the settlement of fluid tailings appears to be contributing to a systematic depletion of the clarified process water stores within the recycle water circuit during the ice on period isotopic signatures and temporal trends were found to be similar within the three tailings ponds sampled throughout the recycle water circuit as well as the recycle pond which acts as a storage reservoir for clarified process water to the extraction plant we postulate that interconnectivity between each reservoir in the recycle water circuit and high pumping rates resulting in low residence times of clarified process water in each pond have contributed to an isotopically well mixed system this finding allows for the isotopic signatures collected from the recycle pond the collection point for all clarified process water pumped from ponds to act as a proxy for the entire recycle water circuit overall the systematic nature of the variations measured at the mine sites will enable isotope based quantification of the major water balance parameters operating within the process water circuit quantification of the water balance is indeed the next step in our workplan at the site we also anticipate that future investigations will target water balance of the first demonstration end pit lake a common element included within closure strategies being evaluated by government and industrial

8031,study region this study was conducted at an oil sands operation in the athabasca oil sands region aosr northeastern alberta canada the mine comprises open pit excavation of bituminous sands at two sites mildred lake ml and aurora north an with a single hot water extraction circuit connecting extraction plants at each mine study focus water samples were collected and analyzed regularly over an eight year period to establish inventories of site wide water isotope signatures including seasonal and interannual changes in the recycle water circuit and to permit future application of an isotope balance model to constrain poorly quantified processes such as evaporation losses dewatering of tailings and tailings pond connectivity of the recycle water circuit new hydrological insights for the region sampling of precipitation inputs over an 8 year period was used to constrain a local meteoric water line for the area differences in evaporative isotopic enrichment of tailings ponds at

deuterium oxygen 18 isotope mass balance oil sands mine water management tailings management 1 introduction the global mining industry is under increasing pressure by public and governmental agencies to improve the sustainability of its operations tost et al 2018 foremost among sustainability issues is mine water demand and management due to high water consumption rates and the potential risk for contaminants to be transported off site by water and air the mildred lake and aurora north mines operated by syncrude canada ltd syncrude are typical oil sands mining operations located north of fort mcmurray alberta canada in 2019 40 1 million m3 or 13 of water used by syncrude was withdrawn from the athabasca river and the remaining 87 was comprised of recycled water from the process circuit overall freshwater water use intensity was 2 33 m3 per m3 of bitumen production excluding recycled waters syncrude 2019 sustainability fact sheet syncrude does not currently release process affected water to the environment therefore imported water that is not evaporated or chemically consumed in the upgrading process contributes to the existing on site inventory of oil sands process affected waters as of 2017 the estimated volume of stored process water on site in engineered tailings management facilities commonly referred to as tailings ponds was 1 7 gm3 reflecting net accumulation since the start of operations over 50 years ago of this total approximately 200 mm3 occurs as free water whereas the remainder is interstitial tailings porewater w zubot syncrude pers comm 2019 syncrude s recycled process water is drawn from the tailings ponds following settlement of the discharged tailings slurry zubot 2010 the storage supply and recirculation of process water from tailings ponds through upgrading and bitumen extraction facilities is referred to as the recycle water circuit the immensity of these stores and the critical stress on water for mine operations in this region highlight the importance of accurately tracking the water balance for on site water such as the recycle water circuit the infrastructure of tailings management facilities and operational water demand at oil sands mines are constantly evolving relative to mining operations as a result water balance parameters are often difficult to directly measure and so must be routinely modelled or estimated a recent review of water flow tracking at five oil sands mining operations found many differences in how operators track site wide water balances with unique challenges evident for individual operations cosia water epa 2019 this review recommended that site wide water balances could be improved through quantification of meteoric water inputs and evaporative losses for all operations developing new and efficient tools for tracking the rates pathways and distribution of water moving through large scale mining operations is a major research challenge here we explore and evaluate the feasibility of using the stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen 18o 2h to track hydrological processes at an operating oil sands mine site and in particular to characterize major controls on isotopic composition and water balance of the recycled water circuit including addition of make up waters and evaporative losses which have been shown to systematically modify isotopic signatures see baer et al 2016 past studies involving 18o and 2h as tracers have been used primarily in gauged watersheds and for a variety of applications including hydrograph separation buttle 1994 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 transit

gonfiantini 1986 case studies in canada have also demonstrated wider application of the technique in cold regions including ungauged lake and river watersheds gibson et al 2019 2016a 2016b gibson and reid 2014 tondu et al 2013 turner et al 2014 turner wolfe and edwards 2010 while much progress has been made in basic research within natural systems the application of isotope tracing to mine water management has been less extensive a small number of studies have used stable isotopes for mine related applications including characterization of recharge rates or water movement through mine waste and tracing of off site mine water migration allen and voormeij 2002 gammons et al 2010 barbour et al 2016 dompierre and barbour 2016 characterization of 18o and 2h signatures within the oil sands first began as part of a geochemical characterization pilot study performed by gibson et al 2011 this was the first oil sands study to hypothesize that process affected water signatures were not necessarily controlled by pond water balance alone as is the case at natural lakes to date there has been limited research conducted on why mine waters display their unique isotopic signatures and how these signatures have progressively evolved in response to mining operations to our knowledge this is the first study to publish a multi year dataset of isotopic signatures for an operational recycle water circuit that captures interannual and seasonal variations this dataset builds spatially and temporally on investigations by baer et al 2016 conducted at syncrude operations at mildred lake and includes a new sampling program carried out concurrently at the nearby aurora mine site baer et al 2016 published the first local meteoric water line for the alberta oil sands region and isotopic signatures for a variety of mine site waters the study concluded that the contributions of cooling tower blowdown to the recycle water circuit and open water evaporation from tailings ponds were the primary controls on the unique isotopic signatures of oil sands process water herein we incorporate the findings of baer et al 2016 and describe results from a high frequency i e bi weekly isotope monitoring survey of site wide waters at both the mildred lake and aurora north mine sites characterization of the isotopic evolution of site wide waters was designed to further understanding of how naturally occurring waters e g meteoric waters and river import mix with current process water inventories to establish whether waters are systematically labelled across the mine site and to assess whether these isotopic signals can be employed to investigate and quantify water balance of reservoirs within the recycle water circuit the specific research objectives for this study were as follows to characterize seasonal and interannual trends of 2h and 18o signatures within the source waters and process affected water stores of the recycle water circuit and to develop a conceptual model characterizing the relative effects of operational and hydrological processes contributing to the isotopic evolution of the recycle water circuit at the outset of this study we expected that the temporal evolution of isotopic signatures observed from tailings ponds would mimic the seasonality of natural systems within the region i e lakes in a highly seasonal climate and that mining processes such as the use of evaporative cooling towers or dewatering of enriched tailings porewater were expected to modify these seasonal patterns therefore we anticipated that operational water demands would likely control the residence time of process water within individual tailings ponds and might dampen the build up of evaporatively enriched waters 1 1 study site oil sands mining operations began in 1978 at the mildred lake ml mine situated 40 km northwest of fort mcmurray and in 2000 at the aurora north an mine located 35 km to the northeast of mildred lake operated by syncrude canada ltd syncrude the mines are situated in the athabasca oil sands region aosr an area characterized by low relief wetland rich boreal forest and a cold highly seasonal climate with long winters and short summers monthly mean air temperature within the region ranges from 19 c for january to 17 c for july with a mean annual temperature near 1 c daily temperatures vary by up to 60 c between winter lows and summer highs annual average precipitation is approximately 450 mm with one third occurring as snow huang et al 2015 the average annual potential evapotranspiration is approximately 500 mm per year

program 2015 daily bitumen production by syncrude was 294 000 barrels per day in 2019 with a cumulative production exceeding 3 billion barrels since operations began the mine sites occupy an area of 200 km2 of which a variety of landforms are present including active mining pits tailings sand structures overburden dumps above ground and in pit tailings facilities and freshwater reservoirs historically water for bitumen extraction and upgrading has been obtained through the import of athabasca river makeup water as well as use of recycle water primarily for tailings transport and extraction any fresh water that is not consumed during upgrading is added to the recycle water circuit via cooling tower blowdown this study focuses primarily on the recycle water circuit at ml however isotopic data collected from an are presented alongside ml to demonstrate the unique isotopic fingerprints of process water with differing raw water sources both the ml and an mines have their own mining and extraction facilities however the two mines are hydraulically connected process water from the recycle water circuit at ml is sent via a pipeline to an and returned along with hydrotransported bitumen froth for upgrading water export from ml to an decreased from 21 3 mm3 in 2012 8 4 mm3 in 2016 with the majority of water demand at the an site now being provided by basal

ml hdpe nalgene bottles tightly capped and with minimal headspace to minimize evaporation sampling was conducted primarily by syncrude s environmental group or by site operators sampling locations were selected in consultation with syncrude to accurately represent the recycle circuit water and contributing source waters samples obtained during 2012 2014 were collected as part of the initial characterization study performed by baer et al 2016 primary sampling of the ml and an circuits resumed in 2016 with key components sampled bi weekly to capture seasonal changes this study presents

collected from rain collectors designed to minimize the atmospheric interactions and evaporative effects see baer 2014 the rainfall collectors were located at 7 locations including 5 at the mildred lake site and 2 at the aurora mine site samples were collected after each major rainfall event and depths associated with each isotope sampling event were monitored at on site meteorological stations snow samples n 147 were collected during annual snow depth surveys over the same period snow sampling for this study was performed along several transects and primarily collected from the top and bottom of the snowpack snow samples were sealed in ziploc freezer bags and allowed to melt at room temperature then transferred to water sample bottles a total of 46 samples were collected from four cooling towers used in the processing and upgrading of bitumen initial cooling tower blowdown samples were collected in the spring of 2016 from all cooling towers on site with a more extensive sampling campaign bi weekly initiated in the fall of 2016 only samples from the upgrading cooling tower could be obtained past the initial spring sampling of 2016 samples were also collected from the freshwater storage reservoir at ml known as mildred lake reservoir mlr n 22 as described by baer at al 2016 and athabasca river samples n 522 were obtained from gibson et al 2016c and subsequently

evaporative cooling towers whereby water is continuously circulated through heated process units and returned back to the cooling towers hot water is piped into the cooling tower unit and dispersed onto fill media providing maximum surface area for the water to collect as the hot water interacts with ambient air passed through the cooling tower a portion of the water evaporates removing heat from the water the cooled water is collected in a basin at the base of the cooling tower and subsequently recirculated through process units or vessels requiring cooling saturated warm air is expelled through the top of the cooling tower units by fans a conceptual diagram of an evaporative cooling tower is provided in fig 3 further operational details of cooling towers at the site have been summarized by zubot 2010 the efficiency of the cooling towers is evaluated by the ratio of concentration of a dissolved species in the blowdown water c b to the make up water c mu referred to as the cycles of concentration coc c b c mu for example if the cycles of concentration is 10 or greater performance is rated very high and if coc is 2 or less performance is rated as very poor zubot 2010 the amount of water released as blowdown and the commensurate volume of water lost to evaporation can be calculated from the coc with the fraction f of water remaining after evaporation equal to 1 coc the monitored coc can be used to estimate evaporation however the corresponding isotopic fractionation is also governed by temperature t humidity h rh 100 where rh is relative humidity and the 18o and 2h concentrations within the water vapour of the air δ a18 and δ a2 inside the cooling towers calculating fractionation due to evaporative losses would require knowledge of these parameters which are not currently monitored for operational purposes estimates of these unknown parameters t h δ a18 δ a2 can be made to compare the isotopic signatures of blowdown and relate it to the observed coc we found that when the 18o and 2h values of blowdown waters were plotted against the fraction of water remaining f where f 1 coc the enrichment proceeded in a linear relationship similar to that of closed system rayleigh distillation therefore we attempted to constrain t and h by using a closed system fractionation model following criss 1999 1 δ f α tot δ i 1000 f α tot 1 α tot 1 f f where δ i and δ f are the initial and final isotopic composition of the reservoir over the model period f is the residual water fraction v f v 0 and α tot is the total fractionation factor between liquid and vapour calculated by 2 α tot ε ε k 1000 1 where ε and ε k are the equilibrium and kinetic enrichment in per mil calculated based on relationships with temperature and humidity h as outlined in horita et al 2008 the enrichment of the cooling tower blowdown was also modelled using a fraction dependent model that requires δ a values and incorporated a linear resistance model for estimating the isotopic composition of the evaporate craig and gordon 1965 cooling towers were modelled as evaporation only reservoirs i e dv dt e for which δ f was estimated according to gonfiantini 1986 as 3 δ f δ i a b f

balance approaches have been applied to predict isotopic enrichment in drying evaporation pan experiments and shallow evaporative lakes see gibson et al 1999 2002 3 results 3 1 temporal isotopic signatures of precipitation and makeup water 3 1 1 precipitation sampling annual rainfall recorded from 2009 to 2017 ranged from 151 mm in 2011 to 387 mm in 2016 with an annual mean of 310 mm the isotopic composition of rain and snow samples collected across the site are shown in a dual isotope crossplot in fig 4a a total of 263 rainfall samples collected during 2009 2018 ranged between 26 23 and 7 03 in δ18o and 201 62 and 71 3 in δ2h with a weighted average of 14 77 and 120 06 for δ18o and δ2h respectively see table a 1 snow samples n 147 were collected in february march from 2009 2018 see table a 2 the snow water equivalent swe during these surveys ranged from 22 mm 2009 to 80 mm 2017 only a bulk representation of the isotopic composition of snow was possible given the collection methodology the non weighted mean isotopic composition of all snow samples considered representative of input during spring melt were found to be 24 67 and 191 04 for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 4 b monthly precipitation values depict seasonality in isotopic composition at the closely located study sites fig 4b estimates of mean annual amount weighted precipitation was calculated using the rainfall amounts and corresponding isotopic composition of rain events for warm months and average snow composition and the measured swe for cold months the mean annual amount weighted precipitation is estimated to be 18 04 for δ18o and 143 54 for δ2h 3 1 2 local meteoric water lines local meteoric water lines lmwls updated to include the 2014 2019 data fig 4a are calculated as follows 6 δ 2 h 7 07 δ 18 o 14 4 amount weighted r squared 0 994 and 7 δ 2 h 6 95 δ 18 o 18 9 unweighted r squared 0 989 as compared to δ 2 h 7 20 δ 18 o 10 3 reported by baer et al 2016 for ml while the slope and intercept are slightly decreased compared to the previous lmwl calculated by baer these lines are essentially indistinguishable from the perspective of defining hydrologic inputs as snow was sampled opportunistically during winter and because bulk swe and average snowpack isotope values were used to amount weight for each month in winter rather than adhering strictly to monthly sampling the resulting lwml should be viewed as a first approximation however generally it appears to confirm differences between isotopic values for precipitation in the aosr as compared to edmonton δ 2 h 7 70 δ 18 o 0 02 or ft smith δ 2 h 6 8 δ 18 o 20 9 see baer et al 2016 3 1 3 athabasca river source water the temporal evolution in athabasca river samples n 524 2002 2020 table a 3 both upstream and downstream of fort mcmurray are shown in fig 5a based on an 18 year record average isotope values were found to be 17 87 and 142 42 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the athabasca river dataset was grouped by month to highlight seasonal patterns that could influence the isotopic composition of the imported waters for extraction with the monthly mean and standard deviations shown in fig 5b there was little variability found in the isotopic signature of athabasca river samples on a monthly basis with the monthly mean of δ18o shifting by only 1 00 and δ2h by 8 00 between the most enriched months mar sept oct and most depleted months june july the coefficient of variation cv for all river samples assessed was 4 30 and 3 35 for 18o and 2h respectively 3 2 temporal isotopic signatures of mine site waters 3 2 1 mildred lake reservoir mlr mlr is used to hold the raw water imported on site from athabasca river and differs from athabasca river due to storage effects which dampen seasonal and interannual variations surface water samples n 22 were collected from mlr over the period of 2012 2017 with the majority of samples collected in 2013 and 2014 see table a 4 fig 5a shows the temporal distribution of δ18o and δ2h from the sampling period the mean of all samples spanning the five year study was 16 72 and 137 49 for 18o and 2h respectively which was more enriched than the average isotopic composition of the athabasca river the isotopic signatures of the reservoir in spring 2013 and 2015 are very similar between each year and appear to be largely influenced by the spring freshet characterized by depleted snowmelt isotopic values isotopic signatures of the reservoir observed during late summer early fall in 2013 and 2014 differ noticeably between the years signatures from 2014 displayed more enriched values for both δ18o and δ2h suggesting the influence of changes in mine water demand on the isotopic signature rather than solely on changes in seasonal water balance components monthly variations and standard deviations are shown for mlr in fig 5b standard deviations were low for the spring and early summer months may july but became much higher in late summer and fall aug oct with isotopic ranges greater than 4 and 15 for 18o and 2h respectively the cvs of all mlr samples were found to be 8 44 and 4 52 respectively 3 2 2 cooling tower blowdown a total of 46 blowdown samples were collected from the cooling tower blowdown streams cap n 2 ue 1 n 2 utility n 2 upgrading n 40 over the period of 2016 2018 see table a 5 of the 46 samples collected the most depleted isotopic signatures were 16 18 and 132 5 for 18o and 2h respectively these signatures occurred on 8 nov 2017 and were collected from the upgrading tower the most enriched values of 10 03 and 95 5 for 18o and 2h respectively were collected from the cap tower on 7 march 2016 mean values for blowdown were 13 37 and 116 25 for 18o and 2h respectively raw water discharge was also measured in april 2016 to characterize the input water before fractionation effects this water had an isotopic signature of 18 32 and 144 4 for 18o and 2h respectively which was similar to relatively stable athabasca river signatures both 18o and 2h of cooling tower blowdown becomes more enriched as cycles of concentration increases fig 6 all the samples collected in this study fell along a similar enrichment trendline with a slope of 5 52 referred to as an evaporation line offset along the evaporation line indicates a higher degree of evaporation loss as confirmed by higher cycles of concentration coc values coc during sampling was typically 1 5 2 0 when sorted by month of collection the samples collected in the cooler months oct may plotted between the local evaporation line for tailings ponds and the lmwl whereas the warmer months june sept plotted below the local evaporation line this may be partly due to seasonal shifts in operating conditions t and possibly h in the cooling towers but must also reflect the influence of seasonal variations in the isotopic composition of ambient atmospheric moisture 3 2 3 recycle water circuit a 6 year record from ml mine 2012 2018 n 220 see table a 6 and a 2 year record from an mine 2016 2018 n 129 see table a 7 are presented in fig 7a up until 2015 all three existing tailings ponds located at ml mine swss swip rp and mlsb tracked closely to each other indicating similar sources and water balance conditions however from the end of 2016 onward the swss became significantly more enriched than mlsb indicating reduced connectivity of the swss to the remaining recycle water circuit leading to a cumulative evaporative enrichment as a result of reduced throughput and increased residence time the enrichment of swss is more evident when plotted in dual isotope space fig 7c overall the mlsb samples plotted closer to the lmwl than the other ponds while the rp samples displayed signatures consistent with a mixture of all tailings ponds predicted mean values and annual ranges for the recycle circuit based on mixture of mlsb swss and rp signatures are provided in table 1 tailings ponds at an mine are found to plot below those of the ml mine fig 7 an initially relied on clarified water supplied by ml for bitumen extraction although water demand decreased from 21 3 mm3 in 2012 8 4 mm3 in 2016 as basal aquifer pumping became the primary source water at the an site an returns an average of 3 7 mm3 of water in the form of bitumen froth to ml annually 18o values are similar to those at ml and display the same magnitude of seasonal enrichment fig 7b however 2h values are consistently lower than those at ml by approximately 10 15 likely due to the effect of basal mcmurray formation aquifer sources with depleted isotopic signatures at an based on 58 samples collected from the basal aquifer mean δ18o and δ2h were found to be 19 92 and 158 76 respectively with standard deviations of 0 76 and 4 20 this contrasts with athabasca river water averaging close to 17 87 for δ18o and 142 42 for δ2h which was the dominant source at ml the enrichment slopes from each mine site calculated by regression analysis of 18o and 2h in dual isotope space are slightly lower for ml 4 20 as compared to the an 4 54 which appears to suggest similar open water evaporative conditions but expectedly based on theoretical considerations also may produce slight convergence of evaporation trajectories at both sites towards similar limiting isotopic enrichment values as predicted from eqs 4 and 5 by a b the latter assertion assumes similar ambient atmospheric moisture controls at both sites 3 2 4 tailings slurry tailings slurry samples n 41 were collected between the years 2013 2018 ranging from 14 82 to 11 75 and 124 10 to 106 90 for 18o and 2h respectively with mean values of 13 58 and 117 89 respectively see table a 8 when plotted temporally the 18o and 2h values of the tailings slurry track closely with the rp values over time although the latter are relatively enriched below the lmwl due to evaporative isotopic enrichment 3 2 5 constraints on cooling tower fractionation one of the goals of this study was to quantify the isotopic signatures of input waters to the recycle water circuit for future isotope tracer studies firstly we utilized a closed system fractionation model eq 1 to estimate the isotopic signature of cooling tower blowdown using operational data provided by syncrude the primary controls affecting fractionation according to eq 1 are the cycles of water recirculation expressed as cycles of concentration coc as well as internal t and h within the cooling tower units coc values for each cooling tower were provided by syncrude but unfortunately t and h were not measured to constrain temperature and humidity and to provide a better indication of potential influence of these internal conditions on the resulting isotopic enrichment a sensitivity analysis was conducted varying temperature from 5 to 65 c and varying h between 0 75 and 0 95 as shown in figs s1 and s2 simulations suggested a best fit to the observed evaporation line slope for h 0 85 and t 35 c as the annual mean outside air temperature on site varied between 35 c and 25 c averaging 3 c we estimate that the cooling towers operated at temperatures that were 30 40 degrees higher than the external ambient atmosphere which notably influences the effective equilibrium fractionations potential sensitivity of the cooling tower enrichment process to ambient atmospheric moisture was also tested by simulating evaporation under a range of δ a values based on eqs 3 5 using best fit values for h and t determined by the previous sensitivity tests figs s1 and s2 as shown in fig s3 the lower boundary for the δ a values δ18o 24 94 δ2h 194 72 was calculated using the total weighted mean value of precipitation from the period may to oct and the assumption that atmospheric moisture is in equilibrium with precipitation following gibson et al 2016b a variety of lower boundary values were then tested in 10 intervals for sensitivity analysis simulations using more enriched values of δ a were found to predict evaporation slopes adequately however the degree of enrichment associated with measured volumetric reduction was greatly overpredicted fig s3 in fact better results were obtained for more depleted values of δ a which we attribute to the atmosphere in cooling towers being derived predominantly from evaporate itself with only minor influence of ambient δa introduced from the outside atmosphere in this case cooling towers can be viewed in a similar way to large lakes or oceans with very high evaporation recycling ratios see jasechko et al 2014 gibson et al 2016b this highlights our initial hypothesis that the cooling towers operated more similar to a closed system and are controlled primarily by temperature and humidity shifts rather than δa while some h gradient is suggested by the fitted enrichment trends the results are consistent with an atmosphere inside the cooling towers with a relative humidity of about 85 the effect of temperature gradients on the fractionation would be limited by the fact that δ a is inside the cooling towers and the main source of atmospheric humidity is the cooling tower source water itself rather than the free atmosphere while further work will be required to test our approach similar near equilibrium fractionation has been shown by ingraham et al 1994 for a cooling tower used at a power generation facility the volume weighted monthly and annual blowdown signatures were calculated for each tower using the reported cycles of concentration values and blowdown values 2002 2017 table a 9 and a 10 assuming a closed system model using raw water values sampled from the discharge line for inputs average isotopic signature for athabasca river and best fit values for t and h based on the sensitivity analysis the monthly range for δ18o δ2h was 13 52 to 11 51 117 84 to 106 24 with a monthly mean blowdown volume of 490 000 m3 the integrated annual signature was calculated as 12 53 and 112 16 for 18o and 2h respectively with an average annual blowdown volume of 5 9 mm3 4 discussion 4 1 tracing meteoric waters through the recycle water circuit isotopic signatures of the sampled meteoric waters displayed consistent seasonal patterns highly enriched precipitation values were observed during mid summer convective events and shifted along the lmwl precipitation in cooler periods e g late season rain and snowfall had more depleted signatures in comparison to warmer months the isotopic composition of snow had the lowest isotope values of all sampled precipitation also shifting along or close to the lmwl the most enriched monthly means occurred in june august and shifted to progressively more negative values over the months of september to november as temperatures cooled table a 1 these seasonal trends can be seen in the distribution of individual precipitation samples plotted in dual isotope space and categorized by month of collection fig 4b meteoric waters entered and mixed with stored process water through direct contact in tailings ponds and as direct surface runoff during spring melt events our observations indicate that the influence of individual precipitation events on the recycle water circuit is minor given the volume and isotopic signatures of individual tailings ponds notwithstanding the influence of the spring freshet was discernable each year by systematic depletion of the tailings ponds signatures cumulative evaporation sublimation and mid winter melting can contribute to enrichment of the snowpack over the winter and spring as melting progresses moser and stichler 1975 clark and fritz 1997 taylor et al 2002 nevertheless little evidence was found for systematic enrichment based on our snowpack measurements as a result we assumed that the average weighted value of snow samples collected was representative of snowmelt input to surficial waters on site this is consistent with lee et al 2010 who found that mean isotopic values of new snow snowpack and meltwater were not significantly different based on observations of temporal variation of the isotopic composition of the evolving snowpack and melt therefore it is considered appropriate to employ the average isotopic composition of the snowpack from the dataset for any future isotopic mass balance work quantifying the influence of snow and snowmelt to the recycle water circuit the intersection of the evaporation line with the lmwl has sometimes been used to estimate the representative isotopic signature of source waters to surface ponds gat 1996 gibson et al 2005 employing this approach for the case of the ml reclaimed areas we find primary source waters to be strongly skewed towards snowmelt runoff from a similar assessment of the lmwl intercepts of three shallow ponds on reclaimed sites at the ml site collected between may and november 2003 2018 we find the estimated source values for the ponds to be 23 2 and 178 5 for 18o and 2h respectively very similar to the average measured values for the snowpack δ18o 24 67 and δ2h 191 04 overall given the close agreement between intercepts and snowpack measurements we can conclude that snowpack was a dominant source anchoring the evaporation line trajectories for reclaimed areas while the influence of rainfall appeared to be relatively minor contrary to this observation evaporation lines developed for the recycle water circuit intersected the lmwl at a more enriched point beyond the cluster of snowpack values despite displaying seasonal depletion during the spring freshet when plotted temporally this observation indicates the greater influence of mining processes affecting isotopic mixing and fractionation within the recycle water circuit over the input of isotopically depleted snow and snowmelt our comprehensive isotope dataset of meteoric waters also reveals a high degree of variability of isotopic composition for individual precipitation events although these perturbations are not necessarily observable in the various mine circuits at the time of the events due to the residence time weighting effect of source waters in the system low residence times are expected in the tailings ponds due to high throughflow rates induced by high onsite water demand while syncrude does not track pumping rates to and from individual tailings ponds we estimate the free water volume of mlsb in 2016 to be 3 4 mm3 syncrude canada ltd 2017 whereas 200 mm3 yr 1 circulates through this pond in a year this suggests a residence time on the order of six days industry monitoring of water demand and exchange between tailings ponds including at a minimum seasonal volume of tailings ponds would greatly improve any attempts at isotope mass balance modelling to assess water balance parameters of the recycle water circuit consequently for isotope mass balance modelling of the mine circuits we recommend use of longer time intervals to buffer potentially short term perturbations in water supply demands which are currently not well quantified for this purpose seasonal or annual calculations using volume weighted averages of the isotopic signature of meteoric waters are recommended 4 2 tracing river import to the recycle water circuit stable isotopic variations in the athabasca river the source of mine makeup water have been monitored monthly over the past two decades under the aep osm long term river network ltrn program isotopic signatures in the river both upstream and downstream of ml have been shown to respond seasonally to variations in timing and proportions of input from snowmelt groundwater surface water and rainfall events as well as routing of water from both local and upstream tributaries and headwaters gibson et al 2016c interannual variations are also observed particularly in response to variations in snowpack extent timing of spring melt and summer storms typical seasonal isotopic variations are found to be in the range of 2 3 for δ18o and 10 15 for δ2h and generally become more depleted during spring melt and then rebound and enrich again during summer and fall winter variations are typified by subtle but progressive isotopic depletions which reflect recession to baseflow as groundwater becomes the dominant source of water under ice compared to isotopic variations noted for the athabasca river on site water reservoirs were found generally to undergo earlier spring melt depletion trends in may june rather than in june july which was typical for athabasca river mlr which is used to store raw water imported on site from athabasca river is operated at an average depth of 5 m d heisler syncrude pers comm 2018 the reservoir receives meteoric water inputs both as direct precipitation and via surface runoff and snowmelt events mlr freezes over during the winter with ice generally persisting from mid november to april may however it continues to receive water from athabasca river and supplies water to the mine site throughout the ice on period 4 3 tracing cooling tower blowdown the largest use of freshwater import from athabasca river is for bitumen upgrading matte 2005 zubot 2010 the majority of this water is heated and ultimately passes through the cooling towers prior to being added to the recycle circuit the isotopic composition of cooling tower blowdown is largely controlled by the number of cycles and resulting evaporative enrichment water has experienced however if the isotopic composition of the input water varies seasonally this signal could be reflected in the blowdown composition the mean annual relative humidity at ml is close to 71 with higher values in winter and lower values in summer initially humidity within the cooling towers was thought to be high and close to saturation i e near 100 our sensitivity analyses and modelling efforts have demonstrated that the cooling tower blowdown signatures are likely sensitive to internal conditions in the cooling towers i e humidity and temperature which affects evaporative fractionation of 18o and 2h but we have also postulated a weak dependence on ambient atmospheric moisture δa and local climate conditions based in part on theoretical considerations but also based on observed isotopic enrichment levels in the blowdown fig s3 these findings appear to be consistent with basic operation of the cooling towers as noted by mine site personnel which involve circulating outside air through the towers to prevent saturation within the chambers a procedure necessary to maintain required evaporation rates for optimal performance as a result it appears that ambient climate conditions may influence the overall extent of enrichment whereas internal humidity and temperature are more influential in determining the isotopic fractionations and the slope of the enrichment trend in dual isotope space overall the cooling towers might best be viewed as partially closed systems we suggest that these reservoirs could be accurately modelled using an isotope mass balance model that accounts for feedback of evaporate to its atmosphere in this case a high degree of feedback 70 80 evaporate provides a suitable fit to the observed evaporative trend noted in cooling tower blowdown we suggest that monitoring of blowdown signatures from all four towers and use of integrated averages both monthly and annually could compliment measured cycles of concentration information to better understand operational conditions at the site as well as to trace the influence of cooling tower blowdown on the water balance of the mine circuits 4 4 isotope mass balance considerations the most common approach taken in isotopic mass balance studies for natural systems is to assume the system is in isotopic and hydrologic steady state annually or to simulate systematic changes based on a series of monthly or short term time steps gibson 2002 gibson reid 2014 gibson et al 2016a although much of the same water is recycled year over year with the exception of water lost to evaporation we show that there are consistent levels of depletion in spring and enrichment in fall for both 18o and 2h each year based on our six years of sampling application of a steady state model using average annual values for various components of the mine water circuits could therefore be useful for providing a first approximation of long term operational variables such as evaporation losses total process water storage and pore water release during tailings self weighted consolidation if seasonal variations are of interest a monthly time series model could be similarly applied to characterize progressive changes in evaporation and water balance over the course of each season although with considerably greater effort at the ml site water samples were collected from the three largest and most active tailings ponds swss mlsb and swip as well as rp clarified process water is drawn from all tailings ponds concurrently and stored in a centralized location the recycle pond to provide recycled water to meet operational demands therefore we suggest that samples collected from rp should be representative of the overall isotopic signature of the recycle water circuit which could simplify monitoring and application of an isotope mass balance approach interestingly monitoring of recycle water could potentially provide a temporal record of proportions of the three main inputs to the recycle water circuit which are meteoric water cooling tower blowdown and pore water released following tailings settlement in addition to monitoring of mean water balance of tailings reservoirs including evaporation and expressed porewater we note that it could be used to track water balance interactions between the two mine sites as ml relies primarily on athabasca river water whereas an relies also on basal mcmurray aquifer sources and these waters are uniquely labelled shifts in isotopic composition due to changes in balance of source waters evaporation from open water and evaporative enrichment inherited from cooling tower blowdown may in fact lead to long term changes that do not mimic natural lakes or watersheds in the region and would be informative for characterizing these differences 4 5 conceptual model development a conceptual model was developed to summarize our current understanding of how water is imported and circulated through syncrude s mildred lake mine a typical oil sands operation from an isotope perspective fig 8 a monthly simulation of isotopic changes in the various mine circuit waters are shown in fig 9 as shown raw water is sourced from athabasca river which has only minor seasonal variations when compared to other mine site waters this water is stored in mlr and is then pumped at varying rates to meet operational water demands our samples indicate that when water demands are high i e high pumping rates from mlr the isotopic signature of the reservoir is reflective of the imported river water due to low residence times however if pumping rates are low during high evaporative months i e late summer there may be observable enrichment resulting from evaporative enrichment evaporation within the cooling towers is the dominant cause of enrichment in imported freshwater prior to input to the recycle water circuit the isotopic signature of the cooling tower blowdown varies depending on the recirculation time of water within the circuit quantified as cycles of concentration the internal conditions within the cooling towers i e temperature and humidity and to a lesser extent ambient atmospheric moisture cooling tower blowdown then mixes with the current stores of clarified process water or recycle water contained within the tailings ponds of the recycle water circuit mixing calculations show minimal response annually in the overall isotopic signature of the recycle water circuit from the addition of enriched cooling tower blowdown likely due to the massive reservoir of process water when compared to the much smaller blowdown volume being added despite this observation it is expected that the cumulative addition of cooling tower blowdown over multiple decades of operations may be a primary driver of unique isotopic signatures in recycled process affected water analysis of isotopic signatures of the clarified process water collected within this study demonstrates that the isotopic signature within the various storage facilities of the recycle water circuit fluctuates seasonally but seems to return to similar values year after year the isotopic composition of the recycle water circuit appears to replicate typical seasonal patterns associated with natural lakes in cold regions depleted process water signatures were observed following the spring melt of depleted snow accumulated on both ponds and across the site a systematic enrichment of process water was observed over the duration of the open water period attributed to evaporative fractionation resulting in isotopic enrichment within the recycle water circuit fig 9 the recycle water circuit remains active throughout the winter despite freeze up of the tailings pond surfaces process water samples collected throughout the ice on period demonstrated progressive isotopic depletion this pattern is believed to be due to higher throughput in the circuit and lack of substantial evaporation but may also be enhanced by formation of ice as ice water fractionation tends to temporarily sequester heavier isotopic species within the ice cover see gibson and prowse 1999 the tailings ponds act as both storage facilities for process water and settling basins for fluid tailings created during the extraction of bitumen from ore process water originally used for extraction is returned to the tailings ponds as a tailings slurry where settling and consolidation of the fluid tailings releases the pore water while young pore water is found to be similar to contemporary process water these relatively immobile waters may be stored for decades within fine tailings deposits and can be viewed as a deep reservoir of archival water associated with its year of deposition dompierre and barbour 2016 measured the isotopic depth profile of fluid tailings placed within a 45 m deep mined out pit and showed that the average signature of the tailings deposited at syncrude from 1994 to 2012 was 12 4 for δ18o and 112 2 for δ2h these values are more enriched than the isotopic signature of today s recycle water circuit as represented by the overall average of the recycle pond samples 13 37 and 115 86 for δ18o and δ2h respectively this is presumed to be the result of higher recycling ratios at present than historically when the tailings were deposited which is a testament to progressive improvements in operational efficiency from an isotope mass balance perspective tailings settlement and pore water release potentially distinguish response of tailings ponds and natural lakes and this effect needs to be considered in any quantitative isotope mass balance assessment one potential opportunity that emerges from this observation is that pore water from known age tailings deposits may serve as a temporal archive that can be used to reconstruct the historical isotopic signatures and related water balance history of a tailings pond or mine water circuit 5 concluding remarks the recycle water circuit is crucial to bitumen extraction and tailings management for oil sands mining operations isotope tracers provide the opportunity to quantify site wide water balance parameters such as meteoric water inputs evaporative losses and potentially infiltration or dewatering which are difficult or costly to directly monitor better understanding of these parameters would aid in improving efficiency of site wide water use and management within this work we characterized both the temporal evolution of the isotopic signatures of source waters to an oil sands mine and the process waters that make up the recycle water circuit based on a bi weekly water isotope monitoring program this builds upon prior studies conducted at syncrude s oil sands mines in the aosr we developed a conceptual model outlining the isotopic evolution of imported water as it transitions from a freshwater signature to one reflective of oil sands mining processes this model highlights the roles of mixing evaporation cooling tower blowdown and water demand which have contributed to the unique and evolving isotopic signatures of process water as they develop distinct characteristics compared to natural surface waters in the region this study has shown that the recycle water circuit exhibits seasonal isotopic patterns characteristic of cold region reservoirs specifically a rapid depletion following the spring freshet which is then followed by systematic enrichment during the open water period interannually the recycle water circuit appears to be close to isotopic steady state with isotopic signatures collected from the late summer and fall i e following prime evaporative months consistently falling between 11 to 12 and 105 to 110 for 18o and 2h respectively expressed pore water released from the settlement of fluid tailings appears to be contributing to a systematic depletion of the clarified process water stores within the recycle water circuit during the ice on period isotopic signatures and temporal trends were found to be similar within the three tailings ponds sampled throughout the recycle water circuit as well as the recycle pond which acts as a storage reservoir for clarified process water to the extraction plant we postulate that interconnectivity between each reservoir in the recycle water circuit and high pumping rates resulting in low residence times of clarified process water in each pond have contributed to an isotopically well mixed system this finding allows for the isotopic signatures collected from the recycle pond the collection point for all clarified process water pumped from ponds to act as a proxy for the entire recycle water circuit overall the systematic nature of the variations measured at the mine sites will enable isotope based quantification of the major water balance parameters operating within the process water circuit quantification of the water balance is indeed the next step in our workplan at the site we also anticipate that future investigations will target water balance of the first demonstration end pit lake a common element included within closure strategies being evaluated by government and industrial operators across the mineable oil sands region end pit lakes are excavated water capped reservoirs that essentially allow for submergence or sequestration of tailings intended to store fluid fine

8032,study region six small agricultural watersheds in three tropical climatic regions of ethiopia three regions of contrasting climate highland midland and lowland regions with respectively high middle and low elevations and rainfalls study focus lag time t l and time of concentration t c are two measures of how quickly a stream responds to runoff producing rainfall these parameters are the main inputs used to estimate peak flow under flood conditions in ungauged watersheds many empirical methods have been proposed to estimate t l and t c but the validity of none of them has been tested this study compared 10 commonly used methods by using measured t l and t c new hydrological insights measured median values of t l and t c for 176 rainfall runoff events were used to evaluate the performance of empirical methods for individual watersheds the estimates of t l and t c differed by up to 2 6 h and 4 4 h respectively most of the empirical methods tended to substantially underestimate t l and t c which would lead to overestimation of runoff volume t l and t c computed by two methods that consider both overland and channel flow were closest to the measured values of t l and t c because such mixed flow is typical of tropical climate regions our results show the need for caution when empirical methods developed in regions with a particular climatic and geomorphological conditions are applied elsewhere keywords empirical model peak flow drought prone ungauged watersheds rainfall intensity tropical climate 1 introduction understanding the response time of watershed runoff after rainfall events is at the core of applied hydrology allnutt et al 2020 lag time t l and time of concentration t c are two related measures of how quickly a stream responds to runoff producing rainfall over its watershed mcenroe et al 2016 both are important indices that reflect the hydrological characteristics of a watershed haga et al 2005 and they are critical when using flood hydrographs to determine peak flow and peak time for the planning design and operation of hydraulic infrastructure yoo et al 2019 they can also be used for flood warning to quantify flash flood response time wu et al 2016 these parameters are especially relevant in ungauged basins and have been used in several recently developed hydrological models usace 2001 sanral 2013 neitsch et al 2005 aronica and candela 2007 koutroulis and tsanis 2010 hydrologists have determined these parameters from observed rainfall runoff datasets mccuen 2009 gericke and smithers 2014 2016 and have developed many empirical and semi empirical methods for estimating t l and t c physical methods of determining t l and t c are based on direct observations often using chemical tracers kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 values of t l and t c estimated from measured rainfall runoff data differ according to the definitions of t l and t c the commonly accepted definitions of t l and t c are derived from direct runoff hydrographs where t l is the time from the centroid of rainfall excess dingman 2002 to peak flow of a direct runoff hydrograph and t c is the time between the centroid of rainfall excess and the inflection point of the recession of direct runoff mccuen et al 1984 fig 1 the physical definition of t c is the time required for a runoff particle to travel from the hydraulically most distant watershed boundary along the longest watercourse to the watershed outlet however determination of t c from direct runoff hydrographs is difficult because there are no universally accepted methods of separating either base flow from direct runoff or losses from rainfall mccuen et al 1984 considering the above definitions nrcs 2010 reported that the relationship between the two parameters is t c 1 67 t l t c and t l are directly related to and influenced by hydrometeorological variables e g rainfall and runoff watershed characteristics e g slope land cover soils drainage density and storage and stream channel geomorphology in practice empirical methods are most frequently used to estimate t c and t l from those variables almost all of the methods that have been developed worldwide are empirically based gericke and smithers 2014 by representing a constant characteristic for a given watershed hence the empirical equations to estimate time can be treated as deterministic models wu et al 2016 however simas and hawkins 1996 have argued that the tendency of t l to approach a single value is valid only for large rainfall runoff events the most common practice in empirical methods that relate time parameters to catchment characteristics uses stepwise multiple regression analyses either by taking into consideration overland flow snyder 1938 kerby 1959 faa 1970 or main channel flow williams 1922 kirpich 1940 carter 1961 usbr 1973 or both overland and channel flow espey et al 1966 scs 1985 simas and hawkins 1996 mccuen et al 1984 summarized these methods on the basis of four input parameters slope watershed size flow resistance and water input ragan and duru 1972 have suggested that vegetation cover is the most influential factor in the computation of t l and simas and hawkins 1996 used weighted curve number cn as a land use related variable to estimate lag times for small to medium catchments 15 km2 cn method is widely used for predicting event based surface runoff volume from small watersheds cn values are dimensionless number determined based on soil characteristics land use management practice antecedent soil moisture and slope combinations the cn values are documented in the nrcs national engineering handbook section 4 neh 4 in tables scs 1972 1985 ponce and hawkins 1996 however gericke and smithers 2015 argued that weighted curve numbers represent a linear watershed response and suggested the inclusion of climatological variables e g rainfall as predictor variables that might have greater influence on any non linearity present in the watershed runoff response rao and delleur 1974 suggested that the presence of a dominantly impervious surface in a watershed was an important variable whereas gericke and smithers 2014 indicated that the antecedent soil moisture of a watershed is the most important determinant of the conversion of rainfall to runoff and provides an indication of a soil s initial infiltration rate jung et al 2017 showed that river network type e g parallel pinnate braided dendritic has a direct impact on hydrological behavior within a basin and can be a direct input for hydrological modeling a recent study by allnutt et al 2020 highlighted that neither of the two proportionality ratios currently favored for use in small watersheds t c 1 417 t l and t c 1 667 t l are applicable for larger watersheds meals et al 2010 noted that the magnitude of t l is difficult to predict in specific cases and generalizations are difficult to make gericke and smithers 2014 indicated that there is no single method of estimation of the t l and t c parameters that is superior to all other methods if one considers the wide variety of climatological geomorphological and hydrological responses that are encountered in practice in many situations the causes of erroneous flood estimations are not clearly evident for example because flood hazards are essentially dependent on the temporal and spatial distribution of runoff a given runoff volume may or may not represent a flood hazard that will cause hydraulic infrastructure to fail mccuen 2005 gericke and smithers 2014 have reported that up to 75 of the total error in peak flow estimates at watershed scale can be ascribed to errors in estimations of watershed response times such errors in time parameters could result in either over or under design of hydraulic structures and can have socio economic implications that negate the economic feasibility of agricultural projects a few countries e g south africa malaysia and taiwan have adjusted time parameters according to local biophysical and hydrological features wu et al 2016 abdulkareem et al 2019 allnutt et al 2020 the degree of uncertainty inherent in computations of t c in ungauged areas should be minimized by performing an assessment of the equation s to be used gonzález álvarez et al 2020 in ethiopia several governmental and non governmental organizations have used empirically derived t l and t c to estimate flood in ungauged watersheds to assist with hydraulic design and environmental planning and analysis era drainage design manual 2013 unfortunately none of the globally accepted empirical methods for estimation of t l and t c has been developed or verified using data from ethiopia moreover there are major concerns about the applicability of empirically estimated t l and t c in watersheds other than those in which the method was originally developed most were developed in temperate regions for example runoff mechanisms differ considerably in tropical and temperate regions tilahun et al 2013 sultan et al 2017 in the usa the dominant runoff mechanism is infiltration of excess rainfall whereas in an alternating dry and wet climate such as in the tropical highlands of ethiopia the dominant mechanism is saturated excess runoff steenhuis et al 2009 another constraint on the use of empirically derived t l and t c in ethiopia is a lack of diversity of the available data the inaccuracy of existing models and improper specification of major watershed characteristics in computations has been a drawback in ethiopia sultan et al 2017 consequently many hydraulic structures in ethiopia are at risk hydraulic design practitioners in ethiopia need to be aware of the limitations of the empirical formulae used to calculate t l and t c before applying them to estimate peak flow era drainage design manual 2013 in this study our aim was to provide insight into the reliability of existing methods of estimating t l and t c in tropical regions of ethiopia by evaluating their accuracy when applied to measured data from small agricultural watersheds 2 study area our study was in the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia in three regions of contrasting climate the highland midland and lowland regions fig 2 with respectively high middle and low elevations and rainfalls sultan et al 2018b within each region we selected two adjacent watersheds kasiry and akusity in the guder highland region kecha and laguna in the aba gerima midland region and sahi and bekafa in the dibatie lowland region fig 1 in each of these small agricultural watersheds which drain into the blue nile we monitored rainfall runoff relationships during 2014 2019 averages of annual precipitation in the guder aba gerima and dibatie regions were 2454 1343 and 1022 mm respectively based on daily rainfall data obtained at the nearest rainfall measurement stations during 1984 2016 guder 1962 2016 aba gerima and 1981 2016 dibatie sultan et al 2018b yibeltal et al 2019 table ts1 according to the fao 2006 soil classification system the major soil types in the study areas are as follows ebabu et al 2020 table ts1 at guder acrisols equivalent to ultisols of the united states department of agriculture usda soil taxonomy characterized by low activity i e highly weathered subsoil clay low cation exchange capacity and low base saturation are dominant followed by luvisols i e usda alfisols which are deep well drained soils with clay accumulated in the subsoil at aba gerima luvisols are dominant followed by leptosols i e usda entisols which are shallow soils formed over hard rock and are particularly susceptible to erosion at dibatie vertisols characterized by high clay mineral content that promotes shrinkage and swelling during dry and wet seasons are dominant followed by luvisols mekonnen 2016 in each of the three climatic regions one of the two watersheds we studied is managed under soil and water conservation swc programs the kasiry watershed in guder has been managed under the ethiopian sustainable land management slm program since 2008 with support from the world bank similarly the kecha watershed in aba gerima has been part of the ethiopian slm program since 2011 supported by funds from a swiss development cooperation project although the sahi watershed in dibatie has not received external funding for swc programs a few swc structures have been built since 2008 under governmental extension programs or community campaign based projects the dominant agricultural practices in the watersheds in guder aba gerima and dibatie are mixed crop and livestock farming berihun et al 2019a 2019b 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall and river flow monitoring each pair of adjacent watersheds in the three climatic regions was equipped with an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge hobo data logging rain gauge rg3 m onset computer corporation bourne ma usa these rain gauges tip when their bucket has accumulated 0 2 mm of rainfall and the number of tips recorded are then converted to millimeters per event by assuming that typical tropical rainfall events have durations of at least 15 min and are separated by at least 30 min meshesha et al 2014 sultan et al 2017 after defining each event based on the above criteria we determined the rainfall depth per 10 min interval within the event so as to calculate the centroid of each event and coincide rainfall with runoff measurement river flow runoff was measured at the outlet of each watershed during the main rainy seasons june october from 2014 to 2019 both manual and automated diver measurement techniques were used diver is an instrument length of 125 mm and a diameter of 22 mm for automatic measurement and registration of surface and ground water pressure level two automated pressure meters a td diver and a baro diver mini diver schlumberger water services the netherlands were installed at each monitoring station to record atmospheric and water pressures the td diver measures pressure at the riverbed which is the sum of water column pressure and atmospheric pressure the baro diver measured only atmospheric pressure the td and baro divers took measurements at 10 and 30 min intervals respectively data from the baro diver were used to correct air pressures measured by the td diver to calculate water depth atmospheric pressure measured by the baro diver was subtracted from the pressure measured by the td diver by using diver office software van essen 2006 the height of the water column i e water depth so obtained was then calibrated with manual staff gauge readings we developed rating curves between river flow q m3 s 1 and stream stage h m observations sult an et al 2018a based on the rating curves we converted all depths measured at 10 min intervals to instantaneous river flow discharge records we considered peak flow events observed during rainy seasons for our analysis 3 1 1 determination of river flow parameters for each watershed we matched the rainfall data to the flow hydrograph data by comparing the timing of events evident in both datasets we used continuous rainfall runoff data to select isolated events on the basis of the criteria of gray 1961 and eagleson 1962 that is we selected only hydrographs with a clear single peak followed by an uninterrupted recession rainfall runoff events that showed multiple peaks on hydrographs were discarded in our analyses we used 186 rainfall runoff events that we identified for the period 2014 2019 main rainy season during a rainfall event not all rainfall will become direct runoff at the watershed outlet some of the rainfall will be lost to interception by vegetation and to soil through infiltration therefore excess rainfall contributing to the direct runoff was found by subtracting the abstractions from the total rainfall excess rainfall fig 1 was computed from the initial loss and loss rate function based on phi index method simas and hawkins 1996 dingman 2002 direct event runoff flow was determined by subtracting base flow from total river flow by using the web based hydrograph analysis tool what software of lim et al 2005 microsoft excel microsoft corporation 2018 was used to plot hydrographs and hyetographs for all rainfall events we used two measures of the time of peak flow t l and t c which we calculated for each watershed t l was measured as the time between the centroid of rainfall excess pe and peak flow q p of a direct runoff hydrograph and t c was the time between centroid of rainfall excess pe and the inflection point of the recession of the direct runoff hydrograph mccuen et al 1984 fig 2 the centroid of rainfall was determined by the following equation dingman 2002 1 t wc i 1 n w i t i i 1 n w i t i where t wc is the centroid of rainfall w i is rainfall for period i and t i is time for period i and n is number of 10 min rainfall record within one event for each watershed we used the medians of t l and t c because the median is a measure of central tendency that is not greatly influenced by outliers 3 2 representative biophysical features of each watershed 3 2 1 determination of empirical tl and tc equation variables in order to use empirical equations to estimate t l and t c table 1 section 3 3 we identified several representative geomorphological characteristics for each of the six watersheds in our study table ts1 these included watershed area main channel length or hydraulic length length of the longest watercourse centroid distance mean watershed slope mean slope of the main watercourse watershed width and drainage density these characteristics were extracted from a high resolution 0 5 m 0 5 m digital elevation model purchased from the advanced land observing satellite 2 alos 2 operated by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa http en alos pasco com we used geographic information system software to determine these variables we also used various soil variables determined for each watershed in previous studies sultan et al 2017 2018a 2018b table ts1 land use and land cover lulc data were obtained from remotely sensed images recorded during 2016 2017 1 50 000 aerial photographs and 0 5 3 2 m resolution satellite images sultan et al 2018a berihun et al 2019a 2019b according to berihun a et al 2019a 2019b there was no significant lulc change during the 2014 2017 in our study sites prints of aerial photographs were acquired from the ethiopian mapping agency http www ema gov et and satellite images from airbus defense and space holdings inc https www airbus com space html owing to variability of both the types of datasets and the distributions of lulc data geology and soils in the watershed we used weighted curve numbers cns as representative independent variables to empirically estimate time parameters for each watershed table ts1 the cn values were computed using soil group classifications lulc swc management practices slope antecedent moisture and cn assignments as defined in chapter 9 of the national engineering handbook part 630 hydrology nrcs 2004 the general attributes e g climatological variables watershed geomorphology watershed variables and channel geomorphology of each watershed are provided in table ts1 3 3 comparison of methods of empirical estimation of t l and t c we selected 10 methods to estimate t l and t c table 1 for the six watersheds of our study and compared the results obtained with them to the measured data for those watersheds our selection of methods were based on the breadth of application of the methods we included both local and global methods and the availability of the necessary input data for our six watersheds we also included methods that were designed for application in overland channel and mixed flow regimes three of the selected methods calculate watershed t l and the other seven calculate t c table 1 it was therefore necessary to adjust the empirical equations so that they would compute t c in hours the relationship t l 0 6 t c was used for this purpose mccuen et al 1984 the empirical equations are described in detail in table 1 the estimated values of t l and t c from the ten empirical equations were cross correlated among each other using coefficient of determination r 2 3 4 evaluation of estimated t l and t c to assess the performance of the empirical methods we used the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 2 the ratio of the root mean square error and standard deviation rsr eq 3 and the percent bias pbias eq 4 in eqs 2

100 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of measured tl and tc in our study area of the 176 rainfall runoff events we included in our analyses 40 occurred in highland regions 100 in midland regions and 36 in lowland regions all events produced 100 mm of rainfall and about 80 produced 62 mm the durations of the rainfall events ranged from 0 5 to 14 h and their intensities ranged from 2 to 62 mm h 1 most were 20 mm h 1 fig 3 total rainfalls for the selected rainfall runoff events ranged from 15 to 98 mm and peak runoff flows were 5 121 m3s 1 despite the narrow range of watershed drainage areas among the six watersheds 2 4 4 2 km2 measured t l and t c extended over considerable ranges 13 370 min and 70 840 min respectively table 2 we used the kruskal wallis anova test fig 4 to compare t l among the three climatic regions the median t l at dibatie lowland was significantly higher p 0 05 than those at guder highland and aba gerima midland but there was no significant difference between those at guder and aba gerima fig 4 we attribute these differences to spatial variations of basin characteristics such as soil topography land cover and climate the kruskal wallis anova test results indicate that runoff responds to rainfall faster at guder and aba gerima than at debatie sultan et al 2018b reported that the rainfall threshold for runoff is 6 mm at guder whereas at aba gerima and dibatie it is 9 and 10 mm respectively the lower rainfall thresholds and quicker runoff responses at guder could be further explained by the prolonged availability of soil moisture there owing to a longer rainy season and heavier soils which would together facilitate runoff in all three regions peak flow events with longer lag times had smaller amounts of rainfall than those with shorter lag times there was a nonlinear relationship between lag time and rainfall intensity although the correlation was not strong r 2 0 1 fig 3 this result agrees with the work of seyam et al 2017 who found a slightly stronger relationship between lag time and rainfall intensity r 2 0 2 in humid tropical river basins in malaysia they attributed the moderately strong relationship was due to high hydrological complexity and the interaction of other variables that influence lag time in contrast zhang et al 2007 found a poor correlation between lag time and rainfall intensity in arid and semi arid regions the lowest median measured t l 33 min was in the akusity watershed in the highland region guder whereas the highest median 49 min was in the sahi watershed of the lowland region dibatie table 2 observed lag times were greater for watersheds of greater area higher total stream length and lower basin relief and slope table ts1 our results also demonstrated that the magnitude of measured lag times in the midland aba gerima region vary substantially over the rainy season although the variation of the amount of rainfall per event 15 26 6 mm was small fig 5 for both the kecha and laguna watersheds the lag times for a single rainfall runoff event at the beginning of the rainy season 27 june were longer 68 and 58 min at kecha and laguna respectively than in subsequent months 28 and 23 min respectively on 8 july and 20 min for both watersheds on 25 august the lag times at the end of the rainy season september and october were longer 47 and 58 min at kecha 37 and 40 min at laguna similar trends were evident in the other climatic regions the trend of decreasing and increasing lag time approaching the end of the rainy season can be attributed to the change in soil wetness and biomass cover in the agricultural watersheds the transition from dry to wet season evolved from low runoff when soil moisture was low dry season to enhanced runoff when soil moisture was high wet season with minimal runoff abstractions ebabu et al 2018 reported that sediment transport by runoff events in the upper blue nile basin is higher at the beginning of the rainy season than near its end owing mainly to a greater contribution from bare and loose soil condition at the beginning of rainy season however they noted that as vegetation cover increases during the wet season runoff increases but carries less sediment we also observed clear differences in lag time for watersheds where swc measures were in place table 2 for example for a single rain event 58 mm on 18 june 2015 in the debatie region fig 6 the lag time of peak flow was 85 min for the watershed with swc measures in place sahi and 65 min for the watershed without such measures bekafa the mean lag times for the swc treated watersheds kasiry 43 min kecha 65 min sahi 50 min were longer than those for their adjacent untreated watersheds akusity 36 min laguna 56 min and bekafa 49 min table 2 in the aba gerima region where both the kecha and laguna watersheds had 100 rainfall runoff events with clearly defined runoff peaks table 2 only 29 runoff peaks were delayed in the laguna watershed relative to the adjacent kecha watershed on average peak flows in swc treated watersheds occurred 5 8 min later than in the adjacent untreated watersheds these results accord with those of safaei and mahan 2018 who identified a delay and decline of peak discharge after the introduction of swc measures in the watersheds of northern iran yu et al 2000 also showed that resistance to runoff flow was significantly increased in areas planted with pineapple crops in southeast queensland australia 4 2 relationship of lag time and time of concentration even though our definitions of t l and t c are similar to those of mccuen et al 1984 fig 1 the relationship of lag time to time of concentration that we derived t c 1 46 t l fig 7 differs from that of mccuen et al 1984 tc 1 67 tl this difference probably reflects differences in the biophysical characteristics of the different study sites and watersheds in the regions where the two models were developed mccuen et al 1984 assumed a relatively uniform response to rainfall for smaller watersheds in a region of temperate climate whereas the small agricultural watersheds of tropical ethiopia we studied exhibited considerably higher spatial variability of rainfall and a more heterogeneous distribution of soils and land cover table ts1 such non uniformity within the watershed provide heterogeneous distributions of antecedent soil moisture sultan et al 2018b which we suggest led to the different relationship of t l to t c that we derived on the other hand allnutt et al 2020 demonstrated that for medium to large watersheds in south africa t c is approximately equal to the elapsed time between the commencement of rainfall and peak river flow i e t c t p time to peak allnutt et al 2020 are of the opinion that the tc tl ratios currently favored for use in small watersheds 1 417 or 1 667 may not be appropriate for application in larger watersheds 4 3 comparison of methods of empirical derivation of tl and tc the estimates of t l and t c that we derived for the six watersheds of our study by applying each of the 10 empirical methods described in table 1 are provided in table ts2 the maximum range of the t l and t c obtained by the 10 methods were both in the kecha watershed 2 65 h for t l and 4 43 h for t c table ts2 among the 10 methods of estimation on the six watersheds cross correlations of the results obtained by the kirpich and carter scs velocity and simas and hawkins and usbr and faa methods were strongest r 2 0 9 0 8 and 0 8 respectively table ts2 whereas various cross correlations among the snyder scs lag bransby williams and ventura methods were weak r 2 0 01 0 02 the greatest differences of the values of t l and t c were obtained between the snyder and carter methods the results of our statistical analysis of the performance of the 10 empirical methods are provided in table 3 r2 values for t l ranged from 0 003 carter method to 0 70 simas hawkins method statistical biases for most of the methods were unsatisfactory positive or negative biases of at least 25 the simas hawkins method produced the smallest t l bias pbias 14 00 r 2 0 7 followed by the scs velocity method pbias 24 00 r 2 0 50 these smaller biases were likely achieved because both of these methods consider both channel and overland flow in determining watershed response times it is noteworthy that two of the variables used in the simas hawkins method mean watershed slope and weighted cn had stronger correlations with median t l in all six watersheds of this study fig 8 the simas hawkins method was originally developed using pooled data from 168 watersheds in distinctly different geographical regions of the us including watersheds with various management practices the t l bias of this method might reflect the uncertainties inherent in estimations of basin width and the specification of cn values for example wait and simonton 2015 showed that for a small watershed erroneously using a cn of 55 instead of its actual value of 70 6 in the scs lag method provided only a meager increase of predicted t l from 4 6 to 6 9 min the scs velocity method is a mixed flow approach that incorporates each of the types of flow within a watershed although the method is more physically based it is affected by several uncertainties mainly in the selection and implementation of the flow velocity formulas values for the roughness coefficient and identification of drainage paths although the bransby williams method was originally developed for application in tropical india climatically comparable to our study area its performance was statistically unsatisfactory for estimates of both t l r 2 0 04 rsr 1 43 pbias 25 18 and t c r 2 0 04 rsr 1 03 pbias 26 30 the likely cause of these unsatisfactory results is that the method does not consider mean annual rainfalls lower than 762 mm and was designed for use in a circular watershed williams 1922 in addition salimi et al 2017 noted that in large watersheds watershed area is a key parameter for precise calculation of t c by the bransby williams method six of the methods usbr scs lag faa kirpich carter and ventura methods tended to substantially underestimate t l and t c table 3 which leads to overestimation of stream runoff this can be attributed to their consideration of all available flood events regardless of magnitude during the calibration phase grimaldi et al 2012 such overpredictions of runoff can lead to the use of unnecessarily large hydraulic structures and excessive overestimations of flood heights in turn resulting in unnecessary material and construction costs in contrast the snyder scs velocity bransby williams and simas hawkins methods overestimated t l and t c table 3 the snyder methods is unsatisfactory for the watersheds of our study area because it assumes overland flow to be the main generator of runoff which is not valid for watersheds in the tropics abdulkareem et al 2019 have shown that the high runoff of tropical monsoon rains triggers rapid downstream conveyance of larger volumes of water in channels rather than in overland flow in addition the snyder method provided the largest estimates of t l and t c table ts2 among those methods the catchment storage coefficients or lag factors c t derived in a temperate region for snyder s method ranged from 1 35 to 1 65 application of these coefficients in our tropical watersheds led to the above overestimates of t l and t c underpredictions of peak flow snyder scs velocity bransby williams and simas hawkins methods can also have adverse impacts due to construction of inadequate hydraulic infrastructure such as overtopping or fracturing of hydraulic structures surface erosion and seepage these can also have socioeconomic consequences to evaluate the sensitivities of the equations representing the 10 methods for each of the six watersheds we plotted seven of the input variables drainage area mean watershed slope drainage density weighted curve number circularity ratio main channel length and mean channel slope table ts1 against the corresponding median t l values three of the seven variables mean watershed slope drainage density and weighted curve number of the watersheds showed positive correlations with t l r 2 0 88 0 71 and 0 40 respectively fig 8 on the basis of these correlations we consider that the roles of these three variables are dominant in the equations which in turn suggests that mixed channel and overland flow is the dominant flow regime in the watersheds we studied and that these flows are controlled mainly by soil moisture swc practices and land cover on hillslopes it is often difficult to select an appropriate method for estimation of t l and t c from the many presented in the scientific literature sharifi and hosseini 2011 such analyses can provide design engineers with a measure of confidence when applying estimated t l and t c to design problems such as flood risk analyses urban planning and stream restoration our study has also shown the need to develop general lag time t l and t c equations for particular types of watersheds on the basis of intensive local hydrological monitoring our work suggests that it is necessary to either replace existing methods with new ones or to improve existing methods by calibrating the coefficients based on observed data 5 conclusions most of the published methods for empirical measurement of t l and t c are based on data gathered from a particular geographic region with specific physical attributes and rainfall patterns we compared the performance of 10 of these methods in six small agricultural watersheds in tropical ethiopia majority of methods were developed from watersheds of temperate climate of the united states where rainfall runoff mechanisms differ considerably than tropical regions our study was based on high frequency hydrometric observations in the six watersheds for five consecutive rainy seasons 2014 2019 our results show that values of t l and t c determined for a particular watershed by the various methods varied considerably up to 2 65 h and 4 45 h for t l and t c respectively and without systematic differences according to the method used our statistical analysis of the performance of the 10 methods showed most of them to have positive or negative statistical biases of at least 25 however t l and t c estimated by the simas hawkins and scs velocity methods were closest to the measured values likely because both methods take into consideration the mixed overland and channel flow that is characteristic of tropical regions six of the selected methods greatly underestimated t l and t c and if they were applied in tropical regions could lead to overestimations of peak flow construction of unnecessarily large hydraulic infrastructure and excessively conservative estimations of flood height thus incurring unnecessary material and construction costs for swc projects the comparison of empirical methods we have presented here for estimation of river flow parameters is important information for the design of hydraulic structures in the tropical watersheds of ethiopia the local characteristics of the watersheds soil type topography conservation practices land cover soil moisture and climate affected the estimates of t l and t c which demonstrates the need for caution in the selection of empirical methods for application outside the region in which they were developed the results of our study indicate the need to develop a new methodology for estimation of t l and t c in

8032,study region six small agricultural watersheds in three tropical climatic regions of ethiopia three regions of contrasting climate highland midland and lowland regions with respectively high middle and low elevations and rainfalls study focus lag time t l and time of concentration t c are two measures of how quickly a stream responds to runoff producing rainfall these parameters are the main inputs used to estimate peak flow under flood conditions in ungauged watersheds many empirical methods have been proposed to estimate t l and t c but the validity of none of them has been tested this study compared 10 commonly used methods by using measured t l and t c new hydrological insights measured median values of t l and t c for 176 rainfall runoff events were used to evaluate the performance of empirical methods for individual watersheds the estimates of t l and t c differed by up to 2 6 h and 4 4 h respectively most of the empirical methods tended to substantially underestimate t l and t c which would lead to overestimation of runoff volume t l and t c computed by two methods that consider both overland and channel flow were closest to the measured values of t l and t c because such mixed flow is typical of tropical climate regions our results show the need for caution when empirical methods developed in regions with a particular climatic and geomorphological conditions are applied elsewhere keywords empirical model peak flow drought prone ungauged watersheds rainfall intensity tropical climate 1 introduction understanding the response time of watershed runoff after rainfall events is at the core of applied hydrology allnutt et al 2020 lag time t l and time of concentration t c are two related measures of how quickly a stream responds to runoff producing rainfall over its watershed mcenroe et al 2016 both are important indices that reflect the hydrological characteristics of a watershed haga et al 2005 and they are critical when using flood hydrographs to determine peak flow and peak time for the planning design and operation of hydraulic infrastructure yoo et al 2019 they can also be used for flood warning to quantify flash flood response time wu et al 2016 these parameters are especially relevant in ungauged basins and have been used in several recently developed hydrological models usace 2001 sanral 2013 neitsch et al 2005 aronica and candela 2007 koutroulis and tsanis 2010 hydrologists have determined these parameters from observed rainfall runoff datasets mccuen 2009 gericke and smithers 2014 2016 and have developed many empirical and semi empirical methods for estimating t l and t c physical methods of determining t l and t c are based on direct observations often using chemical tracers kaufmann de almeida et al 2017 values of t l and t c estimated from measured rainfall runoff data differ according to the definitions of t l and t c the commonly accepted definitions of t l and t c are derived from direct runoff hydrographs where t l is the time from the centroid of rainfall excess dingman 2002 to peak flow of a direct runoff hydrograph and t c is the time between the centroid of rainfall excess and the inflection point of the recession of direct runoff mccuen et al 1984 fig 1 the physical definition of t c is the time required for a runoff particle to travel from the hydraulically most distant watershed boundary along the longest watercourse to the watershed outlet however determination of t c from direct runoff hydrographs is difficult because there are no universally accepted methods of separating either base flow from direct runoff or losses from rainfall mccuen et al 1984 considering the above definitions nrcs 2010 reported that the relationship between the two parameters is t c 1 67 t l t c and t l are directly related to and influenced by hydrometeorological variables e g rainfall and runoff watershed characteristics e g slope land cover soils drainage density and storage and stream channel geomorphology in practice empirical methods are most frequently used to estimate t c and t l from those variables almost all of the methods that have been developed worldwide are empirically based gericke and smithers 2014 by representing a constant characteristic for a given watershed hence the empirical equations to estimate time can be treated as deterministic models wu et al 2016 however simas and hawkins 1996 have argued that the tendency of t l to approach a single value is valid only for large rainfall runoff events the most common practice in empirical methods that relate time parameters to catchment characteristics uses stepwise multiple regression analyses either by taking into consideration overland flow snyder 1938 kerby 1959 faa 1970 or main channel flow williams 1922 kirpich 1940 carter 1961 usbr 1973 or both overland and channel flow espey et al 1966 scs 1985 simas and hawkins 1996 mccuen et al 1984 summarized these methods on the basis of four input parameters slope watershed size flow resistance and water input ragan and duru 1972 have suggested that vegetation cover is the most influential factor in the computation of t l and simas and hawkins 1996 used weighted curve number cn as a land use related variable to estimate lag times for small to medium catchments 15 km2 cn method is widely used for predicting event based surface runoff volume from small watersheds cn values are dimensionless number determined based on soil characteristics land use management practice antecedent soil moisture and slope combinations the cn values are documented in the nrcs national engineering handbook section 4 neh 4 in tables scs 1972 1985 ponce and hawkins 1996 however gericke and smithers 2015 argued that weighted curve numbers represent a linear watershed response and suggested the inclusion of climatological variables e g rainfall as predictor variables that might have greater influence on any non linearity present in the watershed runoff response rao and delleur 1974 suggested that the presence of a dominantly impervious surface in a watershed was an important variable whereas gericke and smithers 2014 indicated that the antecedent soil moisture of a watershed is the most important determinant of the conversion of rainfall to runoff and provides an indication of a soil s initial infiltration rate jung et al 2017 showed that river network type e g parallel pinnate braided dendritic has a direct impact on hydrological behavior within a basin and can be a direct input for hydrological modeling a recent study by allnutt et al 2020 highlighted that neither of the two proportionality ratios currently favored for use in small watersheds t c 1 417 t l and t c 1 667 t l are applicable for larger watersheds meals et al 2010 noted that the magnitude of t l is difficult to predict in specific cases and generalizations are difficult to make gericke and smithers 2014 indicated that there is no single method of estimation of the t l and t c parameters that is superior to all other methods if one considers the wide variety of climatological geomorphological and hydrological responses that are encountered in practice in many situations the causes of erroneous flood estimations are not clearly evident for example because flood hazards are essentially dependent on the temporal and spatial distribution of runoff a given runoff volume may or may not represent a flood hazard that will cause hydraulic infrastructure to fail mccuen 2005 gericke and smithers 2014 have reported that up to 75 of the total error in peak flow estimates at watershed scale can be ascribed to errors in estimations of watershed response times such errors in time parameters could result in either over or under design of hydraulic structures and can have socio economic implications that negate the economic feasibility of agricultural projects a few countries e g south africa malaysia and taiwan have adjusted time parameters according to local biophysical and hydrological features wu et al 2016 abdulkareem et al 2019 allnutt et al 2020 the degree of uncertainty inherent in computations of t c in ungauged areas should be minimized by performing an assessment of the equation s to be used gonzález álvarez et al 2020 in ethiopia several governmental and non governmental organizations have used empirically derived t l and t c to estimate flood in ungauged watersheds to assist with hydraulic design and environmental planning and analysis era drainage design manual 2013 unfortunately none of the globally accepted empirical methods for estimation of t l and t c has been developed or verified using data from ethiopia moreover there are major concerns about the applicability of empirically estimated t l and t c in watersheds other than those in which the method was originally developed most were developed in temperate regions for example runoff mechanisms differ considerably in tropical and temperate regions tilahun et al 2013 sultan et al 2017 in the usa the dominant runoff mechanism is infiltration of excess rainfall whereas in an alternating dry and wet climate such as in the tropical highlands of ethiopia the dominant mechanism is saturated excess runoff steenhuis et al 2009 another constraint on the use of empirically derived t l and t c in ethiopia is a lack of diversity of the available data the inaccuracy of existing models and improper specification of major watershed characteristics in computations has been a drawback in ethiopia sultan et al 2017 consequently many hydraulic structures in ethiopia are at risk hydraulic design practitioners in ethiopia need to be aware of the limitations of the empirical formulae used to calculate t l and t c before applying them to estimate peak flow era drainage design manual 2013 in this study our aim was to provide insight into the reliability of existing methods of estimating t l and t c in tropical regions of ethiopia by evaluating their accuracy when applied to measured data from small agricultural watersheds 2 study area our study was in the upper blue nile basin of ethiopia in three regions of contrasting climate the highland midland and lowland regions fig 2 with respectively high middle and low elevations and rainfalls sultan et al 2018b within each region we selected two adjacent watersheds kasiry and akusity in the guder highland region kecha and laguna in the aba gerima midland region and sahi and bekafa in the dibatie lowland region fig 1 in each of these small agricultural watersheds which drain into the blue nile we monitored rainfall runoff relationships during 2014 2019 averages of annual precipitation in the guder aba gerima and dibatie regions were 2454 1343 and 1022 mm respectively based on daily rainfall data obtained at the nearest rainfall measurement stations during 1984 2016 guder 1962 2016 aba gerima and 1981 2016 dibatie sultan et al 2018b yibeltal et al 2019 table ts1 according to the fao 2006 soil classification system the major soil types in the study areas are as follows ebabu et al 2020 table ts1 at guder acrisols equivalent to ultisols of the united states department of agriculture usda soil taxonomy characterized by low activity i e highly weathered subsoil clay low cation exchange capacity and low base saturation are dominant followed by luvisols i e usda alfisols which are deep well drained soils with clay accumulated in the subsoil at aba gerima luvisols are dominant followed by leptosols i e usda entisols which are shallow soils formed over hard rock and are particularly susceptible to erosion at dibatie vertisols characterized by high clay mineral content that promotes shrinkage and swelling during dry and wet seasons are dominant followed by luvisols mekonnen 2016 in each of the three climatic regions one of the two watersheds we studied is managed under soil and water conservation swc programs the kasiry watershed in guder has been managed under the ethiopian sustainable land management slm program since 2008 with support from the world bank similarly the kecha watershed in aba gerima has been part of the ethiopian slm program since 2011 supported by funds from a swiss development cooperation project although the sahi watershed in dibatie has not received external funding for swc programs a few swc structures have been built since 2008 under governmental extension programs or community campaign based projects the dominant agricultural practices in the watersheds in guder aba gerima and dibatie are mixed crop and livestock farming berihun et al 2019a 2019b 3 methodology 3 1 rainfall and river flow monitoring each pair of adjacent watersheds in the three climatic regions was equipped with an automatic tipping bucket rain gauge hobo data logging rain gauge rg3 m onset computer corporation bourne ma usa these rain gauges tip when their bucket has accumulated 0 2 mm of rainfall and the number of tips recorded are then converted to millimeters per event by assuming that typical tropical rainfall events have durations of at least 15 min and are separated by at least 30 min meshesha et al 2014 sultan et al 2017 after defining each event based on the above criteria we determined the rainfall depth per 10 min interval within the event so as to calculate the centroid of each event and coincide rainfall with runoff measurement river flow runoff was measured at the outlet of each watershed during the main rainy seasons june october from 2014 to 2019 both manual and automated diver measurement techniques were used diver is an instrument length of 125 mm and a diameter of 22 mm for automatic measurement and registration of surface and ground water pressure level two automated pressure meters a td diver and a baro diver mini diver schlumberger water services the netherlands were installed at each monitoring station to record atmospheric and water pressures the td diver measures pressure at the riverbed which is the sum of water column pressure and atmospheric pressure the baro diver measured only atmospheric pressure the td and baro divers took measurements at 10 and 30 min intervals respectively data from the baro diver were used to correct air pressures measured by the td diver to calculate water depth atmospheric pressure measured by the baro diver was subtracted from the pressure measured by the td diver by using diver office software van essen 2006 the height of the water column i e water depth so obtained was then calibrated with manual staff gauge readings we developed rating curves between river flow q m3 s 1 and stream stage h m observations sult an et al 2018a based on the rating curves we converted all depths measured at 10 min intervals to instantaneous river flow discharge records we considered peak flow events observed during rainy seasons for our analysis 3 1 1 determination of river flow parameters for each watershed we matched the rainfall data to the flow hydrograph data by comparing the timing of events evident in both datasets we used continuous rainfall runoff data to select isolated events on the basis of the criteria of gray 1961 and eagleson 1962 that is we selected only hydrographs with a clear single peak followed by an uninterrupted recession rainfall runoff events that showed multiple peaks on hydrographs were discarded in our analyses we used 186 rainfall runoff events that we identified for the period 2014 2019 main rainy season during a rainfall event not all rainfall will become direct runoff at the watershed outlet some of the rainfall will be lost to interception by vegetation and to soil through infiltration therefore excess rainfall contributing to the direct runoff was found by subtracting the abstractions from the total rainfall excess rainfall fig 1 was computed from the initial loss and loss rate function based on phi index method simas and hawkins 1996 dingman 2002 direct event runoff flow was determined by subtracting base flow from total river flow by using the web based hydrograph analysis tool what software of lim et al 2005 microsoft excel microsoft corporation 2018 was used to plot hydrographs and hyetographs for all rainfall events we used two measures of the time of peak flow t l and t c which we calculated for each watershed t l was measured as the time between the centroid of rainfall excess pe and peak flow q p of a direct runoff hydrograph and t c was the time between centroid of rainfall excess pe and the inflection point of the recession of the direct runoff hydrograph mccuen et al 1984 fig 2 the centroid of rainfall was determined by the following equation dingman 2002 1 t wc i 1 n w i t i i 1 n w i t i where t wc is the centroid of rainfall w i is rainfall for period i and t i is time for period i and n is number of 10 min rainfall record within one event for each watershed we used the medians of t l and t c because the median is a measure of central tendency that is not greatly influenced by outliers 3 2 representative biophysical features of each watershed 3 2 1 determination of empirical tl and tc equation variables in order to use empirical equations to estimate t l and t c table 1 section 3 3 we identified several representative geomorphological characteristics for each of the six watersheds in our study table ts1 these included watershed area main channel length or hydraulic length length of the longest watercourse centroid distance mean watershed slope mean slope of the main watercourse watershed width and drainage density these characteristics were extracted from a high resolution 0 5 m 0 5 m digital elevation model purchased from the advanced land observing satellite 2 alos 2 operated by the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa http en alos pasco com we used geographic information system software to determine these variables we also used various soil variables determined for each watershed in previous studies sultan et al 2017 2018a 2018b table ts1 land use and land cover lulc data were obtained from remotely sensed images recorded during 2016 2017 1 50 000 aerial photographs and 0 5 3 2 m resolution satellite images sultan et al 2018a berihun et al 2019a 2019b according to berihun a et al 2019a 2019b there was no significant lulc change during the 2014 2017 in our study sites prints of aerial photographs were acquired from the ethiopian mapping agency http www ema gov et and satellite images from airbus defense and space holdings inc https www airbus com space html owing to variability of both the types of datasets and the distributions of lulc data geology and soils in the watershed we used weighted curve numbers cns as representative independent variables to empirically estimate time parameters for each watershed table ts1 the cn values were computed using soil group classifications lulc swc management practices slope antecedent moisture and cn assignments as defined in chapter 9 of the national engineering handbook part 630 hydrology nrcs 2004 the general attributes e g climatological variables watershed geomorphology watershed variables and channel geomorphology of each watershed are provided in table ts1 3 3 comparison of methods of empirical estimation of t l and t c we selected 10 methods to estimate t l and t c table 1 for the six watersheds of our study and compared the results obtained with them to the measured data for those watersheds our selection of methods were based on the breadth of application of the methods we included both local and global methods and the availability of the necessary input data for our six watersheds we also included methods that were designed for application in overland channel and mixed flow regimes three of the selected methods calculate watershed t l and the other seven calculate t c table 1 it was therefore necessary to adjust the empirical equations so that they would compute t c in hours the relationship t l 0 6 t c was used for this purpose mccuen et al 1984 the empirical equations are described in detail in table 1 the estimated values of t l and t c from the ten empirical equations were cross correlated among each other using coefficient of determination r 2 3 4 evaluation of estimated t l and t c to assess the performance of the empirical methods we used the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 2 the ratio of the root mean square error and standard deviation rsr eq 3 and the percent bias pbias eq 4 in eqs 2

100 4 results and discussion 4 1 characteristics of measured tl and tc in our study area of the 176 rainfall runoff events we included in our analyses 40 occurred in highland regions 100 in midland regions and 36 in lowland regions all events produced 100 mm of rainfall and about 80 produced 62 mm the durations of the rainfall events ranged from 0 5 to 14 h and their intensities ranged from 2 to 62 mm h 1 most were 20 mm h 1 fig 3 total rainfalls for the selected rainfall runoff events ranged from 15 to 98 mm and peak runoff flows were 5 121 m3s 1 despite the narrow range of watershed drainage areas among the six watersheds 2 4 4 2 km2 measured t l and t c extended over considerable ranges 13 370 min and 70 840 min respectively table 2 we used the kruskal wallis anova test fig 4 to compare t l among the three climatic regions the median t l at dibatie lowland was significantly higher p 0 05 than those at guder highland and aba gerima midland but there was no significant difference between those at guder and aba gerima fig 4 we attribute these differences to spatial variations of basin characteristics such as soil topography land cover and climate the kruskal wallis anova test results indicate that runoff responds to rainfall faster at guder and aba gerima than at debatie sultan et al 2018b reported that the rainfall threshold for runoff is 6 mm at guder whereas at aba gerima and dibatie it is 9 and 10 mm respectively the lower rainfall thresholds and quicker runoff responses at guder could be further explained by the prolonged availability of soil moisture there owing to a longer rainy season and heavier soils which would together facilitate runoff in all three regions peak flow events with longer lag times had smaller amounts of rainfall than those with shorter lag times there was a nonlinear relationship between lag time and rainfall intensity although the correlation was not strong r 2 0 1 fig 3 this result agrees with the work of seyam et al 2017 who found a slightly stronger relationship between lag time and rainfall intensity r 2 0 2 in humid tropical river basins in malaysia they attributed the moderately strong relationship was due to high hydrological complexity and the interaction of other variables that influence lag time in contrast zhang et al 2007 found a poor correlation between lag time and rainfall intensity in arid and semi arid regions the lowest median measured t l 33 min was in the akusity watershed in the highland region guder whereas the highest median 49 min was in the sahi watershed of the lowland region dibatie table 2 observed lag times were greater for watersheds of greater area higher total stream length and lower basin relief and slope table ts1 our results also demonstrated that the magnitude of measured lag times in the midland aba gerima region vary substantially over the rainy season although the variation of the amount of rainfall per event 15 26 6 mm was small fig 5 for both the kecha and laguna watersheds the lag times for a single rainfall runoff event at the beginning of the rainy season 27 june were longer 68 and 58 min at kecha and laguna respectively than in subsequent months 28 and 23 min respectively on 8 july and 20 min for both watersheds on 25 august the lag times at the end of the rainy season september and october were longer 47 and 58 min at kecha 37 and 40 min at laguna similar trends were evident in the other climatic regions the trend of decreasing and increasing lag time approaching the end of the rainy season can be attributed to the change in soil wetness and biomass cover in the agricultural watersheds the transition from dry to wet season evolved from low runoff when soil moisture was low dry season to enhanced runoff when soil moisture was high wet season with minimal runoff abstractions ebabu et al 2018 reported that sediment transport by runoff events in the upper blue nile basin is higher at the beginning of the rainy season than near its end owing mainly to a greater contribution from bare and loose soil condition at the beginning of rainy season however they noted that as vegetation cover increases during the wet season runoff increases but carries less sediment we also observed clear differences in lag time for watersheds where swc measures were in place table 2 for example for a single rain event 58 mm on 18 june 2015 in the debatie region fig 6 the lag time of peak flow was 85 min for the watershed with swc measures in place sahi and 65 min for the watershed without such measures bekafa the mean lag times for the swc treated watersheds kasiry 43 min kecha 65 min sahi 50 min were longer than those for their adjacent untreated watersheds akusity 36 min laguna 56 min and bekafa 49 min table 2 in the aba gerima region where both the kecha and laguna watersheds had 100 rainfall runoff events with clearly defined runoff peaks table 2 only 29 runoff peaks were delayed in the laguna watershed relative to the adjacent kecha watershed on average peak flows in swc treated watersheds occurred 5 8 min later than in the adjacent untreated watersheds these results accord with those of safaei and mahan 2018 who identified a delay and decline of peak discharge after the introduction of swc measures in the watersheds of northern iran yu et al 2000 also showed that resistance to runoff flow was significantly increased in areas planted with pineapple crops in southeast queensland australia 4 2 relationship of lag time and time of concentration even though our definitions of t l and t c are similar to those of mccuen et al 1984 fig 1 the relationship of lag time to time of concentration that we derived t c 1 46 t l fig 7 differs from that of mccuen et al 1984 tc 1 67 tl this difference probably reflects differences in the biophysical characteristics of the different study sites and watersheds in the regions where the two models were developed mccuen et al 1984 assumed a relatively uniform response to rainfall for smaller watersheds in a region of temperate climate whereas the small agricultural watersheds of tropical ethiopia we studied exhibited considerably higher spatial variability of rainfall and a more heterogeneous distribution of soils and land cover table ts1 such non uniformity within the watershed provide heterogeneous distributions of antecedent soil moisture sultan et al 2018b which we suggest led to the different relationship of t l to t c that we derived on the other hand allnutt et al 2020 demonstrated that for medium to large watersheds in south africa t c is approximately equal to the elapsed time between the commencement of rainfall and peak river flow i e t c t p time to peak allnutt et al 2020 are of the opinion that the tc tl ratios currently favored for use in small watersheds 1 417 or 1 667 may not be appropriate for application in larger watersheds 4 3 comparison of methods of empirical derivation of tl and tc the estimates of t l and t c that we derived for the six watersheds of our study by applying each of the 10 empirical methods described in table 1 are provided in table ts2 the maximum range of the t l and t c obtained by the 10 methods were both in the kecha watershed 2 65 h for t l and 4 43 h for t c table ts2 among the 10 methods of estimation on the six watersheds cross correlations of the results obtained by the kirpich and carter scs velocity and simas and hawkins and usbr and faa methods were strongest r 2 0 9 0 8 and 0 8 respectively table ts2 whereas various cross correlations among the snyder scs lag bransby williams and ventura methods were weak r 2 0 01 0 02 the greatest differences of the values of t l and t c were obtained between the snyder and carter methods the results of our statistical analysis of the performance of the 10 empirical methods are provided in table 3 r2 values for t l ranged from 0 003 carter method to 0 70 simas hawkins method statistical biases for most of the methods were unsatisfactory positive or negative biases of at least 25 the simas hawkins method produced the smallest t l bias pbias 14 00 r 2 0 7 followed by the scs velocity method pbias 24 00 r 2 0 50 these smaller biases were likely achieved because both of these methods consider both channel and overland flow in determining watershed response times it is noteworthy that two of the variables used in the simas hawkins method mean watershed slope and weighted cn had stronger correlations with median t l in all six watersheds of this study fig 8 the simas hawkins method was originally developed using pooled data from 168 watersheds in distinctly different geographical regions of the us including watersheds with various management practices the t l bias of this method might reflect the uncertainties inherent in estimations of basin width and the specification of cn values for example wait and simonton 2015 showed that for a small watershed erroneously using a cn of 55 instead of its actual value of 70 6 in the scs lag method provided only a meager increase of predicted t l from 4 6 to 6 9 min the scs velocity method is a mixed flow approach that incorporates each of the types of flow within a watershed although the method is more physically based it is affected by several uncertainties mainly in the selection and implementation of the flow velocity formulas values for the roughness coefficient and identification of drainage paths although the bransby williams method was originally developed for application in tropical india climatically comparable to our study area its performance was statistically unsatisfactory for estimates of both t l r 2 0 04 rsr 1 43 pbias 25 18 and t c r 2 0 04 rsr 1 03 pbias 26 30 the likely cause of these unsatisfactory results is that the method does not consider mean annual rainfalls lower than 762 mm and was designed for use in a circular watershed williams 1922 in addition salimi et al 2017 noted that in large watersheds watershed area is a key parameter for precise calculation of t c by the bransby williams method six of the methods usbr scs lag faa kirpich carter and ventura methods tended to substantially underestimate t l and t c table 3 which leads to overestimation of stream runoff this can be attributed to their consideration of all available flood events regardless of magnitude during the calibration phase grimaldi et al 2012 such overpredictions of runoff can lead to the use of unnecessarily large hydraulic structures and excessive overestimations of flood heights in turn resulting in unnecessary material and construction costs in contrast the snyder scs velocity bransby williams and simas hawkins methods overestimated t l and t c table 3 the snyder methods is unsatisfactory for the watersheds of our study area because it assumes overland flow to be the main generator of runoff which is not valid for watersheds in the tropics abdulkareem et al 2019 have shown that the high runoff of tropical monsoon rains triggers rapid downstream conveyance of larger volumes of water in channels rather than in overland flow in addition the snyder method provided the largest estimates of t l and t c table ts2 among those methods the catchment storage coefficients or lag factors c t derived in a temperate region for snyder s method ranged from 1 35 to 1 65 application of these coefficients in our tropical watersheds led to the above overestimates of t l and t c underpredictions of peak flow snyder scs velocity bransby williams and simas hawkins methods can also have adverse impacts due to construction of inadequate hydraulic infrastructure such as overtopping or fracturing of hydraulic structures surface erosion and seepage these can also have socioeconomic consequences to evaluate the sensitivities of the equations representing the 10 methods for each of the six watersheds we plotted seven of the input variables drainage area mean watershed slope drainage density weighted curve number circularity ratio main channel length and mean channel slope table ts1 against the corresponding median t l values three of the seven variables mean watershed slope drainage density and weighted curve number of the watersheds showed positive correlations with t l r 2 0 88 0 71 and 0 40 respectively fig 8 on the basis of these correlations we consider that the roles of these three variables are dominant in the equations which in turn suggests that mixed channel and overland flow is the dominant flow regime in the watersheds we studied and that these flows are controlled mainly by soil moisture swc practices and land cover on hillslopes it is often difficult to select an appropriate method for estimation of t l and t c from the many presented in the scientific literature sharifi and hosseini 2011 such analyses can provide design engineers with a measure of confidence when applying estimated t l and t c to design problems such as flood risk analyses urban planning and stream restoration our study has also shown the need to develop general lag time t l and t c equations for particular types of watersheds on the basis of intensive local hydrological monitoring our work suggests that it is necessary to either replace existing methods with new ones or to improve existing methods by calibrating the coefficients based on observed data 5 conclusions most of the published methods for empirical measurement of t l and t c are based on data gathered from a particular geographic region with specific physical attributes and rainfall patterns we compared the performance of 10 of these methods in six small agricultural watersheds in tropical ethiopia majority of methods were developed from watersheds of temperate climate of the united states where rainfall runoff mechanisms differ considerably than tropical regions our study was based on high frequency hydrometric observations in the six watersheds for five consecutive rainy seasons 2014 2019 our results show that values of t l and t c determined for a particular watershed by the various methods varied considerably up to 2 65 h and 4 45 h for t l and t c respectively and without systematic differences according to the method used our statistical analysis of the performance of the 10 methods showed most of them to have positive or negative statistical biases of at least 25 however t l and t c estimated by the simas hawkins and scs velocity methods were closest to the measured values likely because both methods take into consideration the mixed overland and channel flow that is characteristic of tropical regions six of the selected methods greatly underestimated t l and t c and if they were applied in tropical regions could lead to overestimations of peak flow construction of unnecessarily large hydraulic infrastructure and excessively conservative estimations of flood height thus incurring unnecessary material and construction costs for swc projects the comparison of empirical methods we have presented here for estimation of river flow parameters is important information for the design of hydraulic structures in the tropical watersheds of ethiopia the local characteristics of the watersheds soil type topography conservation practices land cover soil moisture and climate affected the estimates of t l and t c which demonstrates the need for caution in the selection of empirical methods for application outside the region in which they were developed the results of our study indicate the need to develop a new methodology for estimation of t l and t c in the tropical watersheds of ethiopia based on intensive local hydrological monitoring funding this research was supported by the science and technology research partnership for sustainable development

8033,study region a channel fen in the athabasca oil sands area alberta canada study focus we assessed the hydrological changes to the hydrology of a moderate rich fen after the construction of a road perpendicular to flow in 2003 and a pipeline obliquely to flow in 2011 new hydrological insights for the region flow obstruction was most prominent where the fen intersected the road changes to hydrophysical properties from pipeline construction were most pronounced in the top 10 cm of peat which demonstrated significantly higher bulk density by 170 and 112 and lower hydraulic conductivity by 94 and 91 above the buried pipeline and in adjacent cleared locations respectively relative to areas not cleared or directly disturbed during pipeline development changes to water table levels from the pipeline were more pronounced farther down gradient as the pipeline cut through the fen obliquely to direction of flow and water tables became more variable on the side where the flow face had decreased in length if built through peatlands pipelines should be oriented parallel to flow direction and located along the central axis of the fen additional culverts should be considered in the

water to streams and rivers during periods of high water availability peatlands in the aosa are a dominant land cover type 50 of the landscape vitt et al 1996 and represent key drainage routes within the athabasca river watershed hwang et al 2018 contributing up to 81 of annual streamflow to its tributaries gibson et al 2016 in peatland dominated boreal regions including the wbp peatland processes

sat bishop 1991 price 2003 mccarter and price 2017 elmes and price 2019 in contrast flow is enhanced during wet periods when shallow water tables intersect near surface peat comprising living or

sink efficiency water use efficiency petrone et al 2014 however peatlands and the autogenic processes described above are quite sensitive to ground disturbance for example from linear disturbances which can impact the hydrophysical properties of the peat and the overall hydrologic regime of the peatland volik et al 2020 elmes et al 2021a linear disturbances including roads and pipelines for oil

al 2021a pipeline installation in the aosa uses heavy machinery that typically removes at least 40 cm of the upper peat layer this disturbed peat is then replaced over the excavated area after

described above effects of linear disturbances on aosa peatlands has gained increasing attention over the past decade with most hydrological studies focusing on seismic lines petrone et al 2008 davidson et al 2020 and roads bocking et al 2017 strack et al 2018 saraswati et al 2020 elmes et al 2021a with little or no information on pipelines furthermore no studies have addressed the influence of multiple disturbance types and the potential for cumulative effects in this study we explore the hydrophysical impacts of a road and pipeline on a channel fen watershed poplar fen in the aosa using a combination of hydrological and dendrochronological analyses specific objectives are to 1 evaluate differences in hydrophysical properties total porosity bulk density drainable porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of peat replaced above the pipeline adjacent to the pipeline in cleared areas and in uncleared areas adjacent to cleared areas and 2 use contemporary hydrological as well as dendrochronological analyses to evaluate water table and subsurface flow regimes of the peatland area around the pipeline and road and determine whether it differs from less disturbed areas of the fen 2 methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted within the wbp where the climate is defined as sub humid bothe and abraham 1993 devito et al 2012 where the annual potential evapotranspiration typically exceeds precipitation and dry conditions are interrupted by infrequent wet periods occurring over a roughly 10 year cycle marshall et al 1999 analyses were conducted at a sub watershed 2 5 km2 of the poplar creek watershed hereafter referred to as poplar fen 56 56 n 111 32 w fig 1b located 25 km north of fort mcmurray refer to fig 1a the watershed is located within a meltwater channel belt characterized by treed moderate rich channel fen chee and vitt 1989 at the center 1 5 1 7 m deep which transitions to peat margin swamp towards the gentle sloping uplands slope 0 4 1 8 elmes et al 2021b for more detail on the hydrogeologic setting and hydrological regime of the watershed refer to elmes and price 2019 and elmes et al 2021b anthropogenic disturbances had started in the area in the late 1960 s when industrial oil sands development began however human impact was low at that time and the main disturbances included 3 seismic lines and a winter road in the northern and central parts of poplar fen by the 1980 s the current grid of cutlines outlined in fig s1 2012 was established within this time the upland area on the east side of the watershed had a permanent gravel road aostra road constructed through it along a local drainage divide an additional road was constructed in 2003 on the west side of poplar fen extending north to south to provide access to gravel mining operations and a work camp both located on the west side of the watershed in fig s1 establishing the final watershed boundary depicted in fig s1 culverts were installed at two different locations where peatland systems met the road to reduce potential flow restriction refer to fig 1c in the spring of 2011 a below ground pipeline was constructed along the northwest section of the site extending southeast through a peatland system and then east toward aostra road refer to fig 1b and c although details on the construction of the pipeline are unavailable standard practices in the region involve the initial removal of a minimum of 40 cm of peat during installation which is then replaced over the excavated area after installation enbridge pipelines inc 2012 a 40 m wide corridor was also disturbed alongside the pipeline which included the removal of trees by heavy machinery in the summer of 2011 a 0 3 0 5 m protuberance in topography over the pipeline was present due to the exposed overburden however in some areas specifically near t3 this protuberance was not visible 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 hydrological monitoring hydrological instrumentation of poplar fen began in 2011 comprising three north south transects extending through peatland and upland areas t1 t3 fig 1c to observe and monitor general sub surface flow patterns however cleared areas near the pipeline were not monitored until 2012 t2 and 2014 t1 and t3 the final network comprised 13 wells in uncleared peatland areas 4 in cleared areas near the pipeline three of which were installed in the spring of 2014 10 in upland areas and one in a disturbed peatland area east of the road near the culvert fig 1c in 2014 and 2015 additional wells were installed at a reference location 300 m up gradient from the pipeline fig 1b a total of 8 peatland and 4 upland wells were installed in this reference location across all field seasons and for all wells at poplar fen absolute top of pipe elevations meters above sea level masl were measured using a dgps leica geosystems viva gs14 gnss rtk gps system the wells were constructed of perforated screened 1 5 inch inner diameter pvc piping driven 0 8 1 5 m into the ground water table measurements were made weekly throughout the 2012 2015 monitoring period may aug in addition a continuous measurement of fen water table level was recorded at t1 using a capacitance water level recorder odyssey dataflow systems ltd set to collect depth to water table at 30 minute intervals throughout 2012 2015 water levels on the east side of poplar road adjacent to the culvert were also recorded half hourly in 2014 using the same capacitance water level recorder 2 2 2 soil sampling and analysis to examine potential changes to peat hydrophysical properties due to pipeline development 0 5 1 1 m long peat cores were obtained in the summer of 2019 from pipeline n 5 cleared n 8 and uncleared n 6 locations refer to fig 1c using a 10 cm diameter pvc tube fitted with a hacksaw blade on the bottom once retrieved samples were then sectioned into 10 cm stratigraphic intervals frozen and shipped to the wetlands hydrology research laboratory at the university of waterloo once ready for analysis peat samples were thawed laid horizontally and trimmed to fit into a 7 cm diameter stainless steel core and saturated with water for several days saturated samples were weighed for future analyses and were then analyzed for horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity k h using a ksat device meter group inc usa a subset of samples was also measured for k h manually using a constant head method freeze and cherry 1979 to validate the accuracy of the ksat device some samples from undisturbed sites typically the near surface samples were only measured manually because they were too permeable 10 3 m s 1 for the ksat device to measure accurately following k h tests saturated samples were immediately measured for total volume using the area of the stainless steel core and a sample height averaged from 10 measurements along random locations samples were then left to drain and covered to prevent evaporation for 24 h and were then dried in an oven at 80 c to remove all moisture o kelly and sivakumar 2014 saturated weight and volume along with drained and dried mass were used to calculate drainable porosity n d total porosity ϕ and dry bulk density ρb using standard methods klute 1986 2 2 3 dendrochronological analysis to explore historical changes to the peatland due to road and pipeline construction black spruce picea mariana tree stem discs were obtained from three separate peatland locations comprising a reference undisturbed location n 16 a road and pipeline disturbed location n 20 near within t1 and t2 as well as a road only location n 13 adjacent to a different culvert farther south and away from the pipeline refer to fig 1b in this study we were unable to sample a pipeline only location as no such peatland locations existed at a far enough distance from the road as poplar fen was impacted by the horse river wildfire in 2016 elmes et al 2018 some trees were burned with the last ring corresponding to 2015 only trees with slightest burning to the trunk were chosen to ensure that the tree and ring record had endured minimal damage tree stem discs were sanded using incremental grit sizes with 600 grit being the finest and rings were counted using a velmex sliding stage micrometre precision 0 001 mm duplicate measurements were made for each core taken at a roughly 45 angle from the first measurement chronologies for the three tree sampling locations were established using the r dplr package bunn 2008 first to detect user error all individual series were correlated against their master chronology using a negative exponential regression series with low r2 0 35 and or high p values 0 05 were reanalyzed until these conditions were satisfied cores that could not provide satisfactory correlations after several reanalyses were discarded from the final chronologies the index series within each location reference road only and road pipeline were then combined using a negative exponential model yielding three separate standardized ring width index rwi chronologies each dating from 1970 to 2015 whereby an rwi 1 denotes above average growth for a given year and an rwi 1 denotes below average growth 2 2 4 geospatial analyses to analyze ground surface changes from road and pipeline development elevation cross sections were created in qgis using an airborne lidar light detection and ranging digital elevation model dem with 2 m grid resolution airborne imaging inc licensed to the government of alberta due to the hummock hollow topography characteristic of peatlands multiple parallel cross sections 20 per transect were made and averaged to smooth the surface to detect changes from disturbance dem elevations were ground truthed using ground elevations obtained during dgps pipe top surveys 2 2 5 statistical analysis since water table depth and peat hydrophysical property data were characterized by non normal distributions assessed by kurtosis and skewness coefficients and the shapiro wilk test the kruskal wallis test α 0 05 was used to identify 1 differences in hydrophysical properties among peat samples and 2 differences in water table levels among all well locations across t1 and t2 dunn s post hoc tests were conducted with a bonferroni correction following the kruskal wallis tests to reveal differences in hydrophysical peat properties between sampling locations and between well locations all statistical analyses were conducted using the performance analytics package peterson et al 2020 in r r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 surface elevation for averaged cross sections a a and b b refer to fig 1c for locations elevation changes from upland to fen were not smooth fig 2 as is common in peatland and riparian systems with hummock hollow microform topography at cross section a a the pipeline oblique to the flow direction of the channel fen was positioned at the peat margin swamp north of the channel fen refer to fig 1c on the south side of the cleared area near the vicinity of the pipeline is a sharp increase in surface elevation and a slope of 1 relative to the average slope of the remaining cross section 0 25 no such change in slope was observed on the north side of the pipeline fig 2 for cross section b b the pipeline was positioned in a local topographic low near the center of the fen the slope along the disturbed area at cross section b b averaged 0 07 this was similarly low relative to the slope in the low lying peatland area to the southwest which averaged 0 02 mounding from the replaced overburden over the pipeline could not be discerned visually in the b b cross section fig 2 nor could it be by field observations in 2019 3 2 peat hydrophysical properties peat cores obtained from the top 0 10 cm below ground surface b g s from cleared areas north and south of the pipeline demonstrated significantly higher ρb 112 and lower n d 59 ϕ 10 and lower k h 91 relative to cores from uncleared areas fig 3 refer to table s 1 for standard deviations below 0 10 cm b g s no significant differences were detected between disturbed and uncleared areas in any of the hydrophysical parameters fig 3 for the replaced overburden directly over the pipeline samples exhibited the highest ρb and lowest ϕ at all depths with significant differences detected for most depths when compared with cores from both cleared and uncleared locations at 0 10 cm b g s replaced overburden directly over the pipeline demonstrated significantly higher ρb 170 and lower n d 65 ϕ 17 and lower k h 94 relative to cores from uncleared areas higher ρb and lower ϕ is consistent with mineral fragments sand and gravel that were found in the replaced overburden during core retrieval compared to uncleared locations that did not comprise these fragments for the remaining hydrophysical properties significant differences were detected between pipeline and uncleared samples for k h at 0 10 cm b g s n d at 0 10 and 10 20 cm b g s and between pipeline and cleared for n d at 30 40 cm b g s fig 3 3 3 water table fig 4 illustrates spatial water table kriged patterns for above june 2014 and below august 2015 average water levels in road pipeline and reference conditions throughout the measurement period the general flow regime from t3 to the culvert south of the pipeline interpreted as being orthogonal to the isopotential lines representing water table was directed northwest down the peatland roughly parallel to the direction of the pipeline however during the characteristically wet period fig 4a flow north of the pipeline was in a southwestern direction toward the pipeline similar down fen flow patterns were observed fig 4c in the reference location refer to fig 1c however during extended dry conditions the water table was directed west into the upland fig 4d hydraulic gradients down the fen from t1 to t2 to t3 in 2015 mean 0 0025 were similar to those measured in the reference location 0 0021 over the same period the complete table of p values between water table levels of wells at t1 and t2 is reported in table s 2 water table levels and variability were similar between cleared and uncleared peatland areas at t2 fig 5 here no significant differences were detected between peat margin swamp locations north and south of the pipeline and between fen locations north and south of the pipeline including in the cleared area table s 2 despite this peat margin swamp and fen wells on the north side of the pipeline exhibited less variability margin sd 0 13 m fen sd 0 12 m relative to those measured south of the pipeline margin sd 0 19 m fen sd 0 15 m cleared fen sd 0 14 m fig 5 further both cleared and uncleared fen locations at t2 illustrated shallower water tables relative to peat margin swamp and upland locations fig 5 at t1 there was no fen water table level north of the pipeline due to its placement on the north peat margin swamp area of the channel fen refer to fig 1c peat margin swamp water tables north of the pipeline mean 0 46 0 27 m b g s where denotes the standard deviation were shallower on average yet more variable relative to peat margin swamp water tables south of the pipeline

table levels relative to t2 sd 0 13 m fig 5 to investigate whether the road and pipeline were restricting flow out of the watershed manually measured water table levels from 2012 to 2015 were plotted against one another for select well locations fig 6 as was the case between all uncleared fen locations south of the pipeline including reference fen water tables refer to fig 1b water table levels generally followed a strong linear relationship as is illustrated in fig 6a comparisons of uncleared fen water tables south of the pipeline at t1 180 m up gradient from the road and water tables adjacent to the culvert displayed a non linear relationship fig 6b a similar curve is observed when comparing two uncleared peat margin swamp wells at t1 one located north and one located south of the pipeline fig 6c this non linear relationship was not evident between fen water tables north and south of the pipeline at t3 and instead was linear fig 6d 3 4 dendrochronology interseries correlations of ring width negative exponential regression for road pipeline road only and reference locations were 0 66 0 63 and 0 54 respectively rwi followed a similar pattern from 1970 to 2015 in pipeline road road only and reference locations fig 7 in general chronologies included a period of above average growth in the late 1980 s followed by a period of below average growth in the early 1990 s and another period of above average growth in the mid 2000 s the trends in the late 1980 s to mid 1990 s however were not as apparent in the road only location in the second half of the chronology 1995 2015 all three locations showed strong agreement and similar trends following road construction in 2003 and pipeline construction in 2011 the only detectable deviations between disturbed and reference chronologies in the second half of the record were in 2009 and 2010 pre pipeline where pipeline road and road only locations both demonstrated above average growth relative to the reference location which was close to average rwi 1 fig 7 rwi at all three locations displayed weak and mostly statistically insignificant relationships with monthly air temperature and precipitation table s3 4 discussion 4 1 changes to peat hydrophysical properties from pipeline construction the peat sampling campaign above the pipeline and around its perimeter highlighted significant changes to peat hydrophysical properties at poplar fen 8 years after construction differences were most pronounced directly over the pipeline which exhibited a general absence of trends in properties with depth relative to other sampled areas of poplar fen such differences can be explained by ground disturbance during the installation of the pipeline for example excavation from heavy machinery would lead to compression of the peat column gauthier et al 2018 and excavation and replacement of the peat would have altered the natural layering of peat and its various stages of decomposition and associated hydrophysical properties furthermore the presence of mineral soil grains within the replaced peat matrix observed during laboratory analysis which typically have a lower porosity and higher bulk density relative to peat suggests that the pipeline was constructed into the mineral layer 1 7 m depth thus influencing the properties of the entire peat layer reductions in k h and increases in bulk density especially at the shallow and normally most permeable peat layers are synonymous with a reduction in flow elmes et al 2021a between cleared and uncleared fen locations the greatest differences in peat hydrophysical properties were observed in the top 10 cm fig 3 the heavy machinery used over the cleared area appeared to have significantly reduced the hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity of the upper peat layer which can even occur during winter when the ground is frozen c f gauthier 2019 such changes can influence water table dynamics and associated autogenic processes unique to peatlands waddington et al 2014 which may result in a reduction in subsurface flow and thus runoff generation to downstream water bodies due to a reduction in peat transmissivity such changes could further influence soil moisture dynamics chow et al 1992 silins and rothwell 1998 price and schlotzhauer 1999 moss productivity and water use efficiency kettridge et al 2016 thus altering the peatland water balance while some compression caused by ground disturbance is reversible loads associated with heavy machinery well exceed preconsolidation pressures associated with natural processes gauthier et al 2018 steps should also be taken to minimize disturbance around the pipeline including minimizing the area cleared and constructing during winter months when the peat substrate is frozen and more stable gauthier et al 2018 as peat sampling was conducted 8 years after pipeline construction any potential rebound should be complete as a wide range of hydrometeorological conditions have occurred over this time fig 8 it is worth noting that over the 8 years since construction of the pipeline the peat substrate may have experienced additional damage for example linear disturbances are often key travel routes for wildlife james and stuart smith 2000 and heavy all terrain vehicles atvs both of which were observed in cleared areas south of the pipeline these activities specifically atv use in the summer when the peat substrate is thawed can significantly compress and damage the natural peat structure ahlstrand and racine 1993 this may also explain why changes in surface elevation were more prominent on the south side of the pipeline near t1 fig 2 as this wider and therefore more accessible side may have been more vulnerable to further degradation from recreational use 4 2 changes to the hydrology of poplar fen from pipeline and road construction despite changes to peat hydrophysical properties in disturbed areas fig 2 no significant differences in water table levels were observed between uncleared and adjacent cleared locations south of the pipeline fig 5 although the pipeline was oriented obliquely to the flow direction it was oriented toward the north side of the channel fen and therefore did not obstruct flow down the fen on the south side of the pipeline furthermore peat compression and associated changes to surface elevation and peat hydrophysical properties can lead to surface ponding during wet periods and enhanced water table decline via reductions to peat drainable porosity during drier periods whittington and price 2006 which were not detected between 2012 and 2015 however groundwater movement at poplar fen is influenced primarily by a local flow system generated in the adjacent uplands elmes and price 2019 it is likely that disturbed and uncleared locations are both influenced by vertical recharge discharge patterns generated by this local groundwater flow system such hydrogeological controls seem to strongly moderate the water table in cleared and uncleared areas to minimize any changes that may result from the pipeline the influence of disturbance was more apparent north of the pipeline at t1 higher water table variability fig 5 and a faster water table rise and recession fig 6c at t1 peat margin swamp north of the pipeline can be explained by the orientation of the pipeline as it cut into the peat margin swamp in this area of the channel fen fig 1c we argue that this caused flow obstruction fig 4 and greater water table variability that was otherwise not witnessed at t2 fig 5 where the pipeline was positioned closer to the center of the fen fig 1c as discharge zones in local flow systems typically develop at local elevational lows winter 1999 winter et al 2003 the pipeline and denser replaced material likely acted as a barrier establishing uncharacteristic discharge conditions in the peat margin swamp area north of the pipeline elmes et al 2021b this was not witnessed at the peat margin swamp area south of the pipeline at t1 where there was a wider flow face and no evidence of flow impediment towards the fen center fig 4 furthermore the changes in water table levels north of the pipeline at t1 were likely exacerbated by being in close proximity to the road 180 m as an additional road culvert was not installed on the north side of the pipeline following construction the results presented in this study suggest that in the event of building a pipeline along a peatland ideally it should be built parallel rather than obliquely to the direction of flow and at the fen center local topographic low to minimize obstruction to local recharge discharge patterns this is not to suggest that pipelines cannot be built perpendicular to flow just that this orientation may have a greater impact on the hydrology of the peatland where the ideal orientation is impractical pipelines would require permeable drains e g french drains across the obstruction to facilitate flow down gradient where pipelines and roads intersect in a peatland additional culverts under the road should be considered to minimize flow obstruction the relationship between water levels adjacent to the road and 180 m up gradient of the road south of the pipeline fig 6b highlights the influence of flow obstruction more severe than that which was observed north of the pipeline fig 6c this specific culvert was found to stop conveying water out of the watershed when the water table level fell below 320 58 masl it is close to this elevation 320 65 masl where water around the culvert recedes at a slower rate than up gradient fig 6c over the 5 year monitoring period water levels fell below this minimum 35 of the time however during this time additional autogenic water table feedbacks would be restricting flow down the fen elmes and price 2019 corresponding to periods of typically low runoff generation devito et al 2005 here we suggest that during these periods when the water table falls below the culvert the athabasca river and tributaries are receiving limited runoff from peatlands regardless of whether or not they are disturbed in contrast the non linear rise and recession in water table level near the road fig 6b relative to up gradient fen locations during wetter periods water level near road 320 58 m fig 6a illustrates how the culvert cannot convey water out of the watershed sufficiently once water table elevations rise beyond this threshold we argue that the relationship observed in fig 6b is explained by flow obstruction as standing water near the culvert with a drainable porosity of 1 should rise due to precipitation at a slower pace relative to up gradient locations where the water table is typically below ground surface and drainable porosity is significantly lower fig 2 in spite of the hydrological changes described above similar flow patterns were illustrated in the disturbed and reference locations during characteristically wet conditions fig 4 in both cases water table levels in the fen were lower relative to adjacent upland suggesting that the fen transmits sub surface water more efficiently out of the system relative to the upland thus the primary hydrologic function of poplar fen appears to remain intact in spite of these disturbances although the culvert was found to impede flow it is assumed that ponded water will leave the watershed during wet periods albeit at a slower pace relative to natural conditions road development will therefore cause a lagged stream response and lower peak flow standing water conditions can however lead to increased evaporation which may reduce discharge from the system wells et al 2017 flow obstruction could be reduced at the poplar fen watershed by using larger diameter culverts that can handle higher discharge volumes during wet periods or multiple culverts positioned at different elevations which could continue to convey water out of the watershed during the dry periods in addition geosynthetics including fabrics and underdrains can aid in maintaining natural flow volumes under the road and reinforcing road stream crossings keller 2016 given the age of the road in this study est 2003 it is unlikely that such technologies were used 4 3 the use of dendrochronology to infer changes in hydrology from disturbance we detected no large deviations with the exception of 2009 in radial growth of black spruce between the three locations post 2003 year of road construction results presented here suggest that black spruce are not particularly sensitive to any of the hydrological changes that may have occurred over this time our results contrast with those reported by bocking et al 2017 who detected tree die off in a poor fen in the aosa 10 years after the development of a permanent gravel road built perpendicular to flow the lagged die off that was observed by bocking et al 2017 was attributed to damming of the culvert from beavers suggesting that the culvert was working sufficiently prior to damming in contrast the general agreement of our disturbed and reference rwi plots suggest that the culverts at poplar fen have either not been clogged or have undergone regular maintenance and upkeep it is important to note that no trees could be sampled north of the pipeline as the 2016 horse river wildfire was more destructive to this particular area we suggest that flow obstruction north of the pipeline at the peat margin swamp area of t1 fig 6c may have been sufficient to influence black spruce growth in this area however this can only be speculated 5 conclusions this research provides insight into the impacts of road and below ground pipeline development on peat hydrophysical properties and fen hydrology directly above the pipeline and in adjacent cleared areas disturbance sufficiently altered the top 10 cm of peat a highly transmissive layer that is important for conveying water down gradient during wet periods given that the cores were obtained eight years after pipeline construction any peat rebound would have already occurred however despite these changes water table levels were roughly similar in disturbed and uncleared locations and flow patterns were as expected along the peatland south of the pipeline the largest impacts were observed north of the pipeline as it was not built in the center of the fen but rather closer to the north end of the fen and not entirely parallel to the flow direction as a result water table levels on the north side showed evidence of flow obstruction such changes were exacerbated by the road which obstructed flow out of the watershed during wet periods despite construction of the pipeline and road hydraulic gradients were approximately similar between areas near the disturbances and a reference location 300 m and 1 km up gradient of the pipeline and road respectively the above hydrological findings combined with the inability to detect changes in radial growth of black spruce during the period of disturbance 2003 2015 suggests that these disturbances did not notably influence the hydrologic function of the majority of the watershed however precautionary steps should be taken during design and construction to minimize these impacts for example when building linear infrastructure within channel fens e g roads pipelines they should be constructed exactly parallel to the dominant flow direction and in the center of the fen to minimize flow obstruction on either side when constructing linear disturbances through fens perpendicular to the dominant flow direction e g roads efficient cross drainage networks should be implemented furthermore in the event of multiple disturbances e g parallel following perpendicular culverts should be located at the disturbance perpendicular to flow on each side of the parallel disturbance minimizing the impact of a fen to these developments will depend on an efficient culvert network that is capable of conveying water over a wide range of hydrological conditions reflective of the athabasca oil sands area as well as any geosynthetic

8033,study region a channel fen in the athabasca oil sands area alberta canada study focus we assessed the hydrological changes to the hydrology of a moderate rich fen after the construction of a road perpendicular to flow in 2003 and a pipeline obliquely to flow in 2011 new hydrological insights for the region flow obstruction was most prominent where the fen intersected the road changes to hydrophysical properties from pipeline construction were most pronounced in the top 10 cm of peat which demonstrated significantly higher bulk density by 170 and 112 and lower hydraulic conductivity by 94 and 91 above the buried pipeline and in adjacent cleared locations respectively relative to areas not cleared or directly disturbed during pipeline development changes to water table levels from the pipeline were more pronounced farther down gradient as the pipeline cut through the fen obliquely to direction of flow and water tables became more variable on the side where the flow face had decreased in length if built through peatlands pipelines should be oriented parallel to flow direction and located along the central axis of the fen additional culverts should be considered in the

water to streams and rivers during periods of high water availability peatlands in the aosa are a dominant land cover type 50 of the landscape vitt et al 1996 and represent key drainage routes within the athabasca river watershed hwang et al 2018 contributing up to 81 of annual streamflow to its tributaries gibson et al 2016 in peatland dominated boreal regions including the wbp peatland processes

of multiple disturbance types and the potential for cumulative effects in this study we explore the hydrophysical impacts of a road and pipeline on a channel fen watershed poplar fen in the aosa using a combination of hydrological and dendrochronological analyses specific objectives are to 1 evaluate differences in hydrophysical properties total porosity bulk density drainable porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of peat replaced above the pipeline adjacent to the pipeline in cleared areas and in uncleared areas adjacent to cleared areas and 2 use contemporary hydrological as well as dendrochronological analyses to evaluate water table and subsurface flow regimes of the peatland area around the pipeline and road and determine whether it differs from less disturbed areas of the fen 2 methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted within the wbp where the climate is defined as sub humid bothe and abraham 1993 devito et al 2012 where the annual potential evapotranspiration typically exceeds precipitation and dry conditions are interrupted by infrequent wet periods occurring over a roughly 10 year cycle marshall et al 1999 analyses were conducted at a sub watershed 2 5 km2 of the poplar creek watershed hereafter referred to as poplar fen 56 56 n 111 32 w fig 1b located 25 km north of fort mcmurray refer to fig 1a the watershed is located within a meltwater channel belt characterized by treed moderate rich channel fen chee and vitt 1989 at the center 1 5 1 7 m deep which transitions to peat margin swamp towards the gentle sloping uplands slope 0 4 1 8 elmes et al 2021b for more detail on the hydrogeologic setting and hydrological regime of the watershed refer to elmes and price 2019 and elmes et al 2021b anthropogenic disturbances had started in the area in the late 1960 s when industrial oil sands development began however human impact was low at that time and the main disturbances included 3 seismic lines and a winter road in the northern and central parts of poplar fen by the 1980 s the current grid of cutlines outlined in fig s1 2012 was established within this time the upland area on the east side of the watershed had a permanent gravel road aostra road constructed through it along a local drainage divide an additional road was constructed in 2003 on the west side of poplar fen extending north to south to provide access to gravel mining operations and a work camp both located on the west side of the watershed in fig s1 establishing the final watershed boundary depicted in fig s1 culverts were installed at two different locations where peatland systems met the road to reduce potential flow restriction refer to fig 1c in the spring of 2011 a below ground pipeline was constructed along the northwest section of the site extending southeast through a peatland system and then east toward aostra road refer to fig 1b and c although details on the construction of the pipeline are unavailable standard practices in the region involve the initial removal of a minimum of 40 cm of peat during installation which is then replaced over the excavated area after installation enbridge pipelines inc 2012 a 40 m wide corridor was also disturbed alongside the pipeline which included the removal of trees by heavy machinery in the summer of 2011 a 0 3 0 5 m protuberance in topography over the pipeline was present due to the exposed overburden however in some areas specifically near t3 this protuberance was not visible 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 hydrological monitoring hydrological instrumentation of poplar fen began in 2011 comprising three north south transects extending through peatland and upland areas t1 t3 fig 1c to observe and monitor general sub surface flow patterns however cleared areas near the pipeline were not monitored until 2012 t2 and 2014 t1 and t3 the final network comprised 13 wells in uncleared peatland areas 4 in cleared areas near the pipeline three of which were installed in the spring of 2014 10 in upland areas and one in a disturbed peatland area east of the road near the culvert fig 1c in 2014 and 2015 additional wells were installed at a reference location 300 m up gradient from the pipeline fig 1b a total of 8 peatland and 4 upland wells were installed in this reference location across all field seasons and for all wells at poplar fen absolute top of pipe elevations meters above sea level masl were measured using a dgps leica geosystems viva gs14 gnss rtk gps system the wells were constructed of perforated screened 1 5 inch inner diameter pvc piping driven 0 8 1 5 m into the ground water table measurements were made weekly throughout the 2012 2015 monitoring period may aug in addition a continuous measurement of fen water table level was recorded at t1 using a capacitance water level recorder odyssey dataflow systems ltd set to collect depth to water table at 30 minute intervals throughout 2012 2015 water levels on the east side of poplar road adjacent to the culvert were also recorded half hourly in 2014 using the same capacitance water level recorder 2 2 2 soil sampling and analysis to examine potential changes to peat hydrophysical properties due to pipeline development 0 5 1 1 m long peat cores were obtained in the summer of 2019 from pipeline n 5 cleared n 8 and uncleared n 6 locations refer to fig 1c using a 10 cm diameter pvc tube fitted with a hacksaw blade on the bottom once retrieved samples were then sectioned into 10 cm stratigraphic intervals frozen and shipped to the wetlands hydrology research laboratory at the university of waterloo once ready for analysis peat samples were thawed laid horizontally and trimmed to fit into a 7 cm diameter stainless steel core and saturated with water for several days saturated samples were weighed for future analyses and were then analyzed for horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity k h using a ksat device meter group inc usa a subset of samples was also measured for k h manually using a constant head method freeze and cherry 1979 to validate the accuracy of the ksat device some samples from undisturbed sites typically the near surface samples were only measured manually because they were too permeable 10 3 m s 1 for the ksat device to measure accurately following k h tests saturated samples were immediately measured for total volume using the area of the stainless steel core and a sample height averaged from 10 measurements along random locations samples were then left to drain and covered to prevent evaporation for 24 h and were then dried in an oven at 80 c to remove all moisture o kelly and sivakumar 2014 saturated weight and volume along with drained and dried mass were used to calculate drainable porosity n d total porosity ϕ and dry bulk density ρb using standard methods klute 1986 2 2 3 dendrochronological analysis to explore historical changes to the peatland due to road and pipeline construction black spruce picea mariana tree stem discs were obtained from three separate peatland locations comprising a reference undisturbed location n 16 a road and pipeline disturbed location n 20 near within t1 and t2 as well as a road only location n 13 adjacent to a different culvert farther south and away from the pipeline refer to fig 1b in this study we were unable to sample a pipeline only location as no such peatland locations existed at a far enough distance from the road as poplar fen was impacted by the horse river wildfire in 2016 elmes et al 2018 some trees were burned with the last ring corresponding to 2015 only trees with slightest burning to the trunk were chosen to ensure that the tree and ring record had endured minimal damage tree stem discs were sanded using incremental grit sizes with 600 grit being the finest and rings were counted using a velmex sliding stage micrometre precision 0 001 mm duplicate measurements were made for each core taken at a roughly 45 angle from the first measurement chronologies for the three tree sampling locations were established using the r dplr package bunn 2008 first to detect user error all individual series were correlated against their master chronology using a negative exponential regression series with low r2 0 35 and or high p values 0 05 were reanalyzed until these conditions were satisfied cores that could not provide satisfactory correlations after several reanalyses were discarded from the final chronologies the index series within each location reference road only and road pipeline were then combined using a negative exponential model yielding three separate standardized ring width index rwi chronologies each dating from 1970 to 2015 whereby an rwi 1 denotes above average growth for a given year and an rwi 1 denotes below average growth 2 2 4 geospatial analyses to analyze ground surface changes from road and pipeline development elevation cross sections were created in qgis using an airborne lidar light detection and ranging digital elevation model dem with 2 m grid resolution airborne imaging inc licensed to the government of alberta due to the hummock hollow topography characteristic of peatlands multiple parallel cross sections 20 per transect were made and averaged to smooth the surface to detect changes from disturbance dem elevations were ground truthed using ground elevations obtained during dgps pipe top surveys 2 2 5 statistical analysis since water table depth and peat hydrophysical property data were characterized by non normal distributions assessed by kurtosis and skewness coefficients and the shapiro wilk test the kruskal wallis test α 0 05 was used to identify 1 differences in hydrophysical properties among peat samples and 2 differences in water table levels among all well locations across t1 and t2 dunn s post hoc tests were conducted with a bonferroni correction following the kruskal wallis tests to reveal differences in hydrophysical peat properties between sampling locations and between well locations all statistical analyses were conducted using the performance analytics package peterson et al 2020 in r r core team 2017 3 results 3 1 surface elevation for averaged cross sections a a and b b refer to fig 1c for locations elevation changes from upland to fen were not smooth fig 2 as is common in peatland and riparian systems with hummock hollow microform topography at cross section a a the pipeline oblique to the flow direction of the channel fen was positioned at the peat margin swamp north of the channel fen refer to fig 1c on the south side of the cleared area near the vicinity of the pipeline is a sharp increase in surface elevation and a slope of 1 relative to the average slope of the remaining cross section 0 25 no such change in slope was observed on the north side of the pipeline fig 2 for cross section b b the pipeline was positioned in a local topographic low near the center of the fen the slope along the disturbed area at cross section b b averaged 0 07 this was similarly low relative to the slope in the low lying peatland area to the southwest which averaged 0 02 mounding from the replaced overburden over the pipeline could not be discerned visually in the b b cross section fig 2 nor could it be by field observations in 2019 3 2 peat hydrophysical properties peat cores obtained from the top 0 10 cm below ground surface b g s from cleared areas north and south of the pipeline demonstrated significantly higher ρb 112 and lower n d 59 ϕ 10 and lower k h 91 relative to cores from uncleared areas fig 3 refer to table s 1 for standard deviations below 0 10 cm b g s no significant differences were detected between disturbed and uncleared areas in any of the hydrophysical parameters fig 3 for the replaced overburden directly over the pipeline samples exhibited the highest ρb and lowest ϕ at all depths with significant differences detected for most depths when compared with cores from both cleared and uncleared locations at 0 10 cm b g s replaced overburden directly over the pipeline demonstrated significantly higher ρb 170 and lower n d 65 ϕ 17 and lower k h 94 relative to cores from uncleared areas higher ρb and lower ϕ is consistent with mineral fragments sand and gravel that were found in the replaced overburden during core retrieval compared to uncleared locations that did not comprise these fragments for the remaining hydrophysical properties significant differences were detected between pipeline and uncleared samples for k h at 0 10 cm b g s n d at 0 10 and 10 20 cm b g s and between pipeline and cleared for n d at 30 40 cm b g s fig 3 3 3 water table fig 4 illustrates spatial water table kriged patterns for above june 2014 and below august 2015 average water levels in road pipeline and reference conditions throughout the measurement period the general flow regime from t3 to the culvert south of the pipeline interpreted as being orthogonal to the isopotential lines representing water table was directed northwest down the peatland roughly parallel to the direction of the pipeline however during the characteristically wet period fig 4a flow north of the pipeline was in a southwestern direction toward the pipeline similar down fen flow patterns were observed fig 4c in the reference location refer to fig 1c however during extended dry conditions the water table was directed west into the upland fig 4d hydraulic gradients down the fen from t1 to t2 to t3 in 2015 mean 0 0025 were similar to those measured in the reference location 0 0021 over the same period the complete table of p values between water table levels of wells at t1 and t2 is reported in table s 2 water table levels and variability were similar between cleared and uncleared peatland areas at t2 fig 5 here no significant differences were detected between peat margin swamp locations north and south of the pipeline and between fen locations north and south of the pipeline including in the cleared area table s 2 despite this peat margin swamp and fen wells on the north side of the pipeline exhibited less variability margin sd 0 13 m fen sd 0 12 m relative to those measured south of the pipeline margin sd 0 19 m fen sd 0 15 m cleared fen sd 0 14 m fig 5 further both cleared and uncleared fen locations at t2 illustrated shallower water tables relative to peat margin swamp and upland locations fig 5 at t1 there was no fen water table level north of the pipeline due to its placement on the north peat margin swamp area of the channel fen refer to fig 1c peat margin swamp water

table levels relative to t2 sd 0 13 m fig 5 to investigate whether the road and pipeline were restricting flow out of the watershed manually measured water table levels from 2012 to 2015 were plotted against one another for select well locations fig 6 as was the case between all uncleared fen locations south of the pipeline including reference fen water tables refer to fig 1b water table levels generally followed a strong linear relationship as is illustrated in fig 6a comparisons of uncleared fen water tables south of the pipeline at t1 180 m up gradient from the road and water tables adjacent to the culvert displayed a non linear relationship fig 6b a similar curve is observed when comparing two uncleared peat margin swamp wells at t1 one located north and one located south of the pipeline fig 6c this non linear relationship was not evident between fen water tables north and south of the pipeline at t3 and instead was linear fig 6d 3 4 dendrochronology interseries correlations

road only and reference locations fig 7 in general chronologies included a period of above average growth in the late 1980 s followed by a period of below average growth in the early 1990 s and another period of above average growth in the mid 2000 s the trends in the late 1980 s to mid 1990 s however were not as apparent in the road only location in the second half of the chronology 1995 2015 all three locations showed strong agreement and similar trends following road construction in 2003 and pipeline construction in 2011 the only detectable deviations between disturbed and reference chronologies in the second half of the record were in 2009 and 2010 pre pipeline where pipeline road and road only locations both demonstrated above average growth relative to the reference location which was close to average rwi 1 fig 7 rwi at all three locations displayed weak and mostly statistically insignificant relationships with monthly air temperature and precipitation table s3 4 discussion 4 1 changes to peat hydrophysical properties from pipeline construction the peat sampling campaign above the pipeline and around its perimeter highlighted significant changes to peat hydrophysical properties at poplar fen 8 years after construction differences were most pronounced directly over the pipeline which exhibited a general absence of trends in properties with depth relative to other sampled areas of poplar fen such differences can be explained by ground disturbance during the installation of the pipeline for example excavation from heavy machinery would lead to compression of the peat column gauthier et al 2018 and excavation and replacement of the peat would have altered the natural layering of peat and its various stages of decomposition and associated hydrophysical properties furthermore the presence of mineral soil grains within the replaced peat matrix observed during laboratory analysis which typically have a lower porosity and higher bulk density relative to peat suggests that the pipeline was constructed into the mineral layer 1 7 m depth thus influencing the properties of the entire peat layer reductions in k h and increases in bulk density especially at the shallow and normally most permeable peat layers are synonymous with a reduction in flow elmes et al 2021a between cleared and uncleared fen locations the greatest differences in peat hydrophysical properties were observed in the top 10 cm fig 3 the heavy machinery used over the cleared area appeared to have significantly reduced the hydraulic conductivity and drainable porosity of the upper peat layer which can even occur during winter when the ground is frozen c f gauthier 2019 such changes can influence water table dynamics and associated autogenic processes unique to peatlands waddington et al 2014 which may result in a reduction in subsurface flow and thus runoff generation to downstream water bodies due to a reduction in peat transmissivity such changes could further influence soil moisture dynamics chow et al 1992 silins and rothwell 1998 price and schlotzhauer 1999 moss productivity and water use efficiency kettridge et al 2016 thus altering the peatland water balance while some compression caused by ground disturbance is reversible loads associated with heavy machinery well exceed preconsolidation pressures associated with natural processes gauthier et al 2018 steps should also be taken to minimize disturbance around the pipeline including minimizing the area cleared and constructing during winter months when the peat substrate is frozen and more stable gauthier et al 2018 as peat sampling was conducted 8 years after pipeline construction any potential rebound should be complete as a wide range of hydrometeorological conditions have occurred over this time fig 8 it is worth noting that over the 8 years since construction of the pipeline the peat substrate may have experienced additional damage for example linear disturbances are often key travel routes for wildlife james and stuart smith 2000 and heavy all terrain vehicles atvs both of which were observed in cleared areas south of the pipeline these activities specifically atv use in the summer when the peat substrate is thawed can significantly compress and damage the natural peat structure ahlstrand and racine 1993 this may also explain why changes in surface elevation were more prominent on the south side of the pipeline near t1 fig 2 as this wider and therefore more accessible side may have been more vulnerable to further degradation from recreational use 4 2 changes to the hydrology of poplar fen from pipeline and road construction despite changes to peat hydrophysical properties in disturbed areas fig 2 no significant differences in water table levels were observed between uncleared and adjacent cleared locations south of the pipeline fig 5 although the pipeline was oriented obliquely to the flow direction it was oriented toward the north side of the channel fen and therefore did not obstruct flow down the fen on the south side of the pipeline furthermore peat compression and associated changes to surface elevation and peat hydrophysical properties can lead to surface ponding during wet periods and enhanced water table decline via reductions to peat drainable porosity during drier periods whittington and price 2006 which were not detected between 2012 and 2015 however groundwater movement at poplar fen is influenced primarily by a local flow system generated in the adjacent uplands elmes and price 2019 it is likely that disturbed and uncleared locations are both influenced by vertical recharge discharge patterns generated by this local groundwater flow system such hydrogeological controls seem to strongly moderate the water table in cleared and uncleared areas to minimize any changes that may result from the pipeline the influence of disturbance was more apparent north of the pipeline at t1 higher water table variability fig 5 and a faster water table rise and recession fig 6c at t1 peat margin swamp north of the pipeline can be explained by the orientation of the pipeline as it cut into the peat margin swamp in this area of the channel fen fig 1c we argue that this caused flow obstruction fig 4 and greater water table variability that was otherwise not witnessed at t2 fig 5 where the pipeline was positioned closer to the center of the fen fig 1c as discharge zones in local flow systems typically develop at local elevational lows winter 1999 winter et al 2003 the pipeline and denser replaced material likely acted as a barrier establishing uncharacteristic discharge conditions in the peat margin swamp area north of the pipeline elmes et al 2021b this was not witnessed at the peat margin swamp area south of the pipeline at t1 where there was a wider flow face and no evidence of flow impediment towards the fen center fig 4 furthermore the changes in water table levels north of the pipeline at t1 were likely exacerbated by being in close proximity to the road 180 m as an additional road culvert was not installed on the north side of the pipeline following construction the results presented in this study suggest that in the event of building a pipeline along a peatland ideally it should be built parallel rather than obliquely to the direction of flow and at the fen center local topographic low to minimize obstruction to local recharge discharge patterns this is not to suggest that pipelines cannot be built perpendicular to flow just that this orientation may have a greater impact on the hydrology of the peatland where the ideal orientation is impractical pipelines would require permeable drains e g french drains across the obstruction to facilitate flow down gradient where pipelines and roads intersect in a peatland additional culverts under the road should be considered to minimize flow obstruction the relationship between water levels adjacent to the road and 180 m up gradient of the road south of the pipeline fig 6b highlights the influence of flow obstruction more severe than that which was observed north of the pipeline fig 6c this specific culvert was found to stop conveying water out of the watershed when the water table level fell below 320 58 masl it is close to this elevation 320 65 masl where water around the culvert recedes at a slower rate than up gradient fig 6c over the 5 year monitoring period water levels fell below this minimum 35 of the time however during this time additional autogenic water table feedbacks would be restricting flow down the fen elmes and price 2019 corresponding to periods of typically low runoff generation devito et al 2005 here we suggest that during these periods when the water table falls below the culvert the athabasca river and tributaries are receiving limited runoff from peatlands regardless of whether or not they are disturbed in contrast the non linear rise and recession in water table level near the road fig 6b relative to up gradient fen locations during wetter periods water level near road 320 58 m fig 6a illustrates how the culvert cannot convey water out of the watershed sufficiently once water table elevations rise beyond this threshold we argue that the relationship observed in fig 6b is explained by flow obstruction as standing water near the culvert with a drainable porosity of 1 should rise due to precipitation at a slower pace relative to up gradient locations where the water table is typically below ground surface and drainable porosity is significantly lower fig 2 in spite of the hydrological changes described above similar flow patterns were illustrated in the disturbed and reference locations during characteristically wet conditions fig 4 in both cases water table levels in the fen were lower relative to adjacent upland suggesting that the fen transmits sub surface water more efficiently out of the system relative to the upland thus the primary hydrologic function of poplar fen appears to remain intact in spite of these disturbances although the culvert was found to impede flow it is assumed that ponded water will leave the watershed during wet periods albeit at a slower pace relative to natural conditions road development will therefore cause a lagged stream response and lower peak flow standing water conditions can however lead to increased evaporation which may reduce discharge from the system wells et al 2017 flow obstruction could be reduced at the poplar fen watershed by using larger diameter culverts that can handle higher discharge volumes during wet periods or multiple culverts positioned at different elevations which could continue to convey water out of the watershed during the dry periods in addition geosynthetics including fabrics and underdrains can aid in maintaining natural flow volumes under the road and reinforcing road stream crossings keller 2016 given the age of the road in this study est 2003 it is unlikely that such technologies were used 4 3 the use of dendrochronology to infer changes in hydrology from disturbance we detected no large deviations with the exception of 2009 in radial growth of black spruce between the three locations post 2003 year of road construction results presented here suggest that black spruce are not particularly sensitive to any of the hydrological changes that may have occurred over this time our results contrast with those reported by bocking et al 2017 who detected tree die off in a poor fen in the aosa 10 years after the development of a permanent gravel road built perpendicular to flow the lagged die off that was observed by bocking et al 2017 was attributed to damming of the culvert from beavers suggesting that the culvert was working sufficiently prior to damming in contrast the general agreement of our disturbed and reference rwi plots suggest that the culverts at poplar fen have either not been clogged or have undergone regular maintenance and upkeep it is important to note that no trees could be sampled north of the pipeline as the 2016 horse river wildfire was more destructive to this particular area we suggest that flow obstruction north of the pipeline at the peat margin swamp area of t1 fig 6c may have been sufficient to influence black spruce growth in this area however this can only be speculated 5 conclusions this research provides insight into the impacts of road and below ground pipeline development on peat hydrophysical properties and fen hydrology directly above the pipeline and in adjacent cleared areas disturbance sufficiently altered the top 10 cm of peat a highly transmissive layer that is important for conveying water down gradient during wet periods given that the cores were obtained eight years after pipeline construction any peat rebound would have already occurred however despite these changes water table levels were roughly similar in disturbed and uncleared locations and flow patterns were as expected along the peatland south of the pipeline the largest impacts were observed north of the pipeline as it was not built in the center of the fen but rather closer to the north end of the fen and not entirely parallel to the flow direction as a result water table levels on the north side showed evidence of flow obstruction such changes were exacerbated by the road which obstructed flow out of the watershed during wet periods despite construction of the pipeline and road hydraulic gradients were approximately similar between areas near the disturbances and a reference location 300 m and 1 km up gradient of the pipeline and road respectively the above hydrological findings combined with the inability to detect changes in radial growth of black spruce during the period of disturbance 2003 2015 suggests that these disturbances did not notably influence the hydrologic function of the majority of the watershed however precautionary steps should be taken during design and construction to minimize these impacts for example when building linear infrastructure within channel fens e g roads pipelines they should be constructed exactly parallel to the dominant flow direction and in the center of the fen to minimize flow obstruction on either side when constructing linear disturbances through fens perpendicular to the dominant flow direction e g roads efficient cross drainage networks should be implemented furthermore in the event of multiple disturbances e g parallel following perpendicular culverts should be located at the disturbance perpendicular to flow on each side of the parallel disturbance minimizing the impact of a fen to these developments will depend on an efficient culvert network that is capable of conveying water over a wide range of hydrological conditions reflective of the athabasca oil sands area as well as any geosynthetic underdrains beneath the road that can help in maintaining flow at greater depths credit authorship contribution statement matthew c elmes conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft

8034,study region mekong river basin study focus the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 recently announced an updated version of general circulation models gcms this study investigated the performance of improved cmip6 over those of cmip5 with respect to precipitation and flood representations in the mekong river basin mrb the correlation and error comparison from the referenced precipitation exhibited a significant improvement in the peak value representation hence the impacts of climate change on future floods in the mrb were simulated and assessed using a distributed rainfall runoff inundation model new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that precipitation from cmip6 had a higher correlation and a lower error coefficient than cmip5 similarly the simulation of gcm ensembles of monthly discharge from cmip6 exhibited a comparable average value to the observations whereas cmip5 underestimated the discharge simulations the performance of the mean annual peak discharge improved from 37 220 m3 s cmip5 to 45 423 m3 s cmip6 compared to 43 521 m3 s observation the projections of future floods in the mrb from cmip6 exhibited an increase of annual peak discharge at chiang saen vientiane pakse and kratie stations by 10 15 20 22 and 24 29 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 10 18 24 29 and 41 54 for the ssp5 8 5 scenario in the near future 2026 2050 mid future 2051 2075 and far future 2076 2100 respectively the statistical k s test showed significant changes in all stations and projected periods with a p value 0 01 keywords cmip5 cmip6 gcm flooding mekong river basin 1 introduction with a drainage area of 795 000 km2 the mekong river basin mrb is one of the largest transboundary rivers shared by china myanmar thailand lao people s democratic republic lao pdr cambodia and vietnam the floodplain and delta areas located in the lower mekong basin lmb are annually affected by flooding as a natural phenomenon leading to the deposition of sediment as a natural fertilizer resulting in high agricultural productivity and biodiversity however the frequency and severity of extreme flood events over the last few decades and future projections would be significantly increased hoang et al 2016 oddo et al 2018 perera et al 2017 try et al 2020a västilä et al 2010 flood related economic damage has also risen try et al 2018a primarily because of the significant increase in population and settlement close to the river network and floodplain of the lmb try et al 2018a the cost of the average historical annual flood damage is approximately us 60 70 million and these figures continue to rise mrc 2011 climate change and human activity are projected to affect the hydrological and ecological systems of the lmb particularly in tonle sap lake chadwick and juntopas 2008 hoang et al 2016 johnstone et al 2013 keskinen et al 2013 try et al 2020a 2020b uk et al 2018 the tonle sap lake and its floodplain play a significant role in the hydrology of the lmb the tonle sap river the connection between the mekong river and tonle sap lake has a bi directional flow between the rainy and dry seasons this area is home to more than 370 plant species 197 phytoplankton species and more than 225 bird species mrc 2010 constant assessment of the projected impacts of future climate on regional infrastructure and the environment is essential to be able to develop and implement appropriate adaptation measures flood simulations in the mekong region have been studied extensively for instance try et al 2018b simulated a large scale flood inundation in the entire mrb during the large flood event in 2000 wang et al 2021b simulated daily floods in the mrb from 1967 to 2015 pokhrel et al 2018 studied flood dynamics in the lmb focusing on the variations in upstream flow regulation siev et al 2019 and tanaka et al 2018 modeled the inundation pattern in tonle sap lake a major sub basin in the lmb future planning preparation mitigation and adaptation measures in river basins are essential in the current reality of climate change thus information on climate change effects on a river basin is vital to policymakers and the population in general general circulation model gcm uncertainties have been identified from different sources such as the assumption of greenhouse gas emission scenarios model configuration climate downscaling and the unforced variability of the climate system giorgi 2010 yet they still provide a valuable source of stochastic system performance the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 results have reduced the uncertainty of hydrological extremes under climate change in the mrb compared to cmip3 hoang et al 2016 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recently released new outputs from cmip6 the cmip5 projected the future climate based on greenhouse gas emissions represented by four representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 ipcc 2014 the cmip6 has designed five scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathways ssp namely ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 and ssp5 8 5 to include socioeconomic factors such as the growth of population economics urbanization and other factors eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 the improvement of cmip6 scenarios includes wider equilibrium climate sensitivity ecs with an increasing temperature range of 1 5 4 5 c the models in cmip6 were expected to improve their capability and reduce uncertainty over the previous cmip5 and cmip3 chen et al 2020 the new protocol of cmip6 provided also the high resolution gcm simulations namely highresmip experiments together with their coarse resolution gcm haarsma et al 2016 the highresmip experiments would solve the issue of coarse resolution of climate models with their resolutions being comparable to regional climate models rcms e g cordex and high resolution agcm mizuta et al 2012 2014 in cmip5 ruan et al 2018 evaluated the ranking scores of precipitation from cmip5 over the lmb chhin and yoden 2018 proposed a framework for model ensemble selection based on historical simulations of cmip5 in the indochina region and chhin et al 2020 used their optimal ensemble subset for future drought projections several studies on flood inundation simulation used a two dimensional distributed model in the lmb during historical flood events dutta et al 2007 perera et al 2017 try et al 2018b try et al 2020b assessed future climate change impacts on flood inundation in the lmb through a high resolution atmospheric general circulation model from the meteorological research institute mri agcm in which sea surface temperatures ssts from 28 cmip5 were used as boundary condition try et al 2020a projected the extreme flood inundation in the mrb from a large ensemble database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf using mri agcm with sst boundary conditions for six cmip5 models ccsm4 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 miroc5 mpi esm mr and cgcm3 overall previous studies of future flooding projections in the mrb were based on previous cmip3 and cmip5 only a comparison of cmip5 and cmip6 could provide guidance for further exploration of the newly released cmip6 datasets cmip6 are found to have an improved performance in capturing climate changes in various regions kamruzzaman et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zamani et al 2020 there is still a lack of information for the comparison of cmip5 and cmip6 on precipitation and flood projections in the mekong region considering the significant improvement in the climate variables of the cmip6 over cmip5 it is necessary to conduct a comparative study that will provide a valuable resource of information for policy decision makers in this area iqbal et al 2021 evaluated cmip6 precipitation over mainland southeast asia and results indicated that most cmip6 models were able to capture rainfall climatological in this region gusain et al 2020 found the improvements of precipitation in agreement with the observation from cmip6 over cmip5 in simulating the indian summer monsoon moreover kim et al 2020 analyzed extreme climate indices from cmip6 models and showed their improved ability to capture the global and regional climate patterns demory et al 2020 showed that rcm euro cordex and highresmip outperform cmip5 particularly in summer and autumn in most of the european regions dong and dong 2021 found an improvement in bias reduction of extreme precipitation in asia from cmip6 coarse resolution and highresmip experiments over cmip5 xin et al 2021 revealed better performance of model ensemble from cmip6 highresmip in simulation of precipitation distribution in china the high resolution highresmip was found suitable for projecting of monsoon precipitation and hydrological extreme in case studies in peninsular malaysia liang et al 2021 tan et al 2021 this study aims to investigate the performance of cmip6 compared to cmip5 on precipitation estimates applied to flood simulation within the mrb it also assesses the potential impacts of climate change on flood inundation in the mrb under the new projected scenarios for the near future 2026 2050 mid future 2050 2075 and far future 2075 until the end of the 21st century 2 methodology 2 1 rainfall runoff inundation modeling this study used an integrated rainfall runoff and flood inundation rri model sayama et al 2012 2015a 2015b the rri model is a two dimensional distributed model that separately considers hill slopes and river channels the rri model calculates flow on slopes and rivers based on 2d and 1d diffusive wave equations which can consider reversed flow the rri model simulates the lateral subsurface flow vertical infiltration and surface flow to represent the rainfall runoff inundation processes the river geometry is assumed to be rectangular with width w m and depth d m as indicated in eqs 1 and 2 as a function of upstream drainage area a km2 try et al 2018b calculated the geometry coefficients c w s w c d and s d with values of 0 0015 0 7491 0 0520 and 0 7596 respectively for the mrb 1 w c w a s w 2 d c d a s d this study employed the precipitation dataset from gpcc with daily scale and 1 resolution ziese et al 2018 the gpcc precipitation data provide a reasonable rainfall distribution over the entire mrb in the rainfall runoff inundation modeling by exhibiting a better correlation with the observed discharge than other available open datasets try et al 2020c try et al 2020a 2020b validated the gpcc data for long term flood inundation modeling in the mrb for 1983 2010 and 1982 2007 respectively the evapotranspiration dataset was taken from the japanese 55 year reanalysis dataset jra 55 with 3 hourly and 0 5625 resolution kobayashi et al 2015 the topography datasets including digital elevation model dem flow direction dir and flow accumulation acc derived from multi error removed improved terrain merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 and land use from modis product mcd12q1 for 2000 friedl et al 2010 were used as input to the rri model in this study more detailed description of model structure and input parameters of the rri model could be found in the supplementary file the rri model has been applied to hydrological simulations in southeast asia to simulate flood inundation and confirm its good performance for example the rri model was used to reproduce a historical large scale flood event in 2000 try et al 2018b and to evaluate the performance of satellite based precipitation products for flood inundation simulation try et al 2020c perera et al 2017 and try et al 2020b used the rri model to evaluate the effects of climate change in the lmb by considering various rcp and sst scenarios moreover try et al 2020a validated the rri model for long term simulation 1983 2010 before using it to project extreme flood inundation events in the mrb 2 2 climate datasets precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets were obtained from cmip6 and cmip5 at a daily time step eight gcms were used for the comparative analysis each gcm was selected from the same institution in cmip5 and cmip6 table 1 shows the institution model name and spatial resolution of each model six gcms no 1 to no 6 in table 1 had the same spatial resolution in cmip5 and cmip6 two gcms nos 7 and 8 had a higher gridded resolution in cmip6 than in cmip5 to consider the effect of simulation of high resolution this study compared two cmip6 cnrm cm6 1 and mri esm2 0 with two gcms from highresmip cnrm cm6 1 hr and mri agcm3 2s and two rcms from cordex east asia cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 and mpi m mpi esm lr the gpcc rainfall dataset was used to evaluate the performance of gcms from cmip5 and cmip6 2 3 performance assessment this study used multiple statistical indicators to verify the performance of rri model simulation including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 peak discharge ratio pdr and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta

the number of datasets that are both temporal and spatial patterns in this study the taylor diagram provides a concise statistical summary of how well the pattern distribution of the two variables matches the diagram visualizes their correlation root mean square difference and variances of data i e standard deviation in this study the taylor diagram was used to visualize and evaluate the precipitation performance of cmip5 and cmip6 over the mrb geographical conditions and uneven precipitation distribution were estimated by dividing the mrb into three zones namely the upper mekong basin in china the middle mrb in thailand and lao pdr and the lmb in cambodia and vietnam fig 1 the simulated discharge from the rri model from cmip5 and cmip6 in monthly and annual peak discharge values was compared with gauged observations finally the best gcms were selected for future projections to identify changes in flood characteristics in the mrb in the near mid and far future the gcms were bias corrected for future flood projections this study applied a bias correction method using linear scaling approach 12 p day bc p mon obs p mon gcm p day gcm where p mon obs average monthly gpcc precipitation p mon gcm average monthly gcm precipitation p day agcm daily gcm precipitation and p day bc daily bias corrected gcm precipitation the correction factor calculated from the present climate was applied to future climate projections this study used the kolmogorov smirnov k s test to evaluate the changes in flooding between present and future projection climates the statistical k s test is a non parametric test of two samples and is used to evaluate statistical variation the maximum difference in the cumulative distribution function cdf of the two samples can be defined as follows 13 d n m sup x f n x f m x where f n and f m are the empirical distribution functions of the two samples and sup is the supremum function the null hypothesis h 0 assumes that the two samples have no significant difference in the cdf when the likelihood of the different distributions of the two samples exceeds the significance level the null hypothesis is rejected the null hypothesis is rejected if the following condition is satisfied 14 d n m c α n m nm where n and m are the sample sizes at a significance level of 1 c α was equal to 1 628 3 results and discussion 3 1 rri model performance fig 2 compares the simulated discharge from the rri model and the observed discharge at the four hydrological stations from upstream to downstream of the mekong river at chiang saen vientiane pakse and kratie the rri model performance at the upstream station in chiang saen was kge 0 57 nse 0 49 r 0 82 and pdr 0 65 0 15 the performance at the two middle stations of vientiane and pakse were kge 0 79 and 0 91 nse 0 74 and 0 85 r 0 88 and 0 93 and pdr 0 80 0 14 and 0 95 0 17 respectively the rri model simulated discharge was more accurate at the downstream station kratie with kge 0 93 nse 0 88 r 0 94 and pdr 0 95 0 15 overall the rri model performance in the mrb hydrological simulation was acceptable and particularly accurate in the downstream area which is the area most affected by floods 3 2 evaluation of precipitation the historical gcm experiments used were from 1950 to 2005 for cmip5 and from 1950 to 2014 for cmip6 the monthly precipitation results based on the grid by grid distribution and basin average for each gcm from cmip5 and cmip6 are shown in the taylor diagrams in figs 3 and 4 respectively the basin average precipitation had higher accuracy than the grid by grid precipitation in the correlation coefficient r root mean square difference rmsd and standard deviation σ for the grid by grid precipitation the improvement of gcms was r 0 48 and rmsd 79 11 mm in cmip5 to r 0 58 and rmsd 72 82 mm in cmip6 table 2 the standard deviation values were similarly improved from σ 61 81 mm in cmip5 to σ 67 10 mm in cmip6 σ of gpcc 87 89 mm table 2 for the basin average precipitation the performance improvement from cmip5 to cmip6 was 0 97 0 99 for the correlation coefficient and 27 20 24 67 mm for the bias however the standard deviation seemed larger in cmip6 being 110 46 mm compared to 102 mm in cmip5 σ of gpcc 101 18 mm this means that cmip6 have improved their agreement with reference precipitation and have shown smaller error values in both analyses of the basin average and the grid by grid precipitation in addition to the evaluation based on the grid by grid and the basin average the precipitation results were also compared for the three zones upstream high elevation midstream and downstream in the mrb both cmip5 and cmip6 generally exhibited good performance in zone iii the lmb floodplain and delta followed by zone ii central mrb and zone i the upper mekong basin ranked by the best performance the tendency of each model distribution in the taylor plot in fig 5 can be distinguished by an increase in the correlation coefficient and a reduction in the bias index rmsd from cmip5 to cmip6 particularly noticeable in zones i and ii however cmip6 also had larger standard deviation values compared to cmip5 table 3 provides a summary of the information on all model performances for zone iii the average performance indices among eight gcms were r 0 97 rmsd 31 46 mm and σ 88 77 mm reference to gpcc σ 63 97 mm for cmip5 and r 0 98 rmsd 30 42 mm and σ 89 97 mm for cmip6 similarly the advancement from cmip5 to cmip6 in zone ii was indicated by the following results r 0 96 0 98 rmsd 36 41 30 74 mm and σ 104 49 114 31 mm σ of gpcc 118 55 mm among the three zones zone i had poor accuracy with r 0 95 and 0 97 rmsd 38 42 mm and 41 69 mm and σ 115 82 mm and 131 29 mm σ of gpcc 109 90 mm for cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in summary there was an improvement in the performance of the new cmip6 over the previous cmip5 for precipitation simulations over the mrb cmip6 thus better represented precipitation in the middle and downstream areas compared to cmip5 3 3 performance of discharge simulation daily precipitation from all gcms was used as input to the calibrated and validated rri model to assess river flow and annual peak flood discharge fig 6 shows a comparison of the gauged observation and simulated discharge at kratie on monthly basis during the flood season the cmip5 underestimated the river discharge by means and even error bars i e mean standard deviation in july and august with values outside the range compared to the observation discharge however the mean values are overestimated in september but within the error bar but closer to observations in the late flood period in october the overall performance of cmip6 improved during the flood season compared to that of cmip5 all values within the error bar notably during the peak flood period in september the mean of cmip6 was close to the observation whereas the mean of cmip5 was underestimated similar to precipitation and monthly discharge the annual peak discharge fig 7 showed a similar performance improvement in cmip6 compared to cmip5 at hydrological stations in kratie and chiang saen the simulated annual peak discharge from cmip5 and cmip6 overestimated the annual peak discharge at chiang saen the mean values slightly improved from cmip5 14 398 m3 s to cmip6 13 890 m3 s compared to observation 10 483 m3 s at kratie the cmip5 outputs underestimated the annual peak discharge and the means from cmip6 were in good agreement with the observations the means from cmip5 and cmip6 were 37 220 m3 s and 43 016 m3 s compared to the observation of 43 521 m3 s however the standard deviation values ranging from lower to upper error bars of the cmip6 outputs at kratie were larger than those of cmip5 and of the observed peak discharges overall even though there was an improvement in cmip6 over cmip5 cmip6 still had an extensive bias compared to the observation therefore the following sections consider the bias correction to further improve cmip6 for the evaluation of future flooding projections in the mrb 3 4 performance of bias correction the bias correction of the precipitation of cmip6 was conducted using the linear scaling method to improve the performance of the precipitation and discharge projections this method previously exhibited good performance in the bias correction of high resolution climate outputs in the mrb try et al 2020b fig 8 shows the performance of simulated discharge from the non bias corrected and bias corrected cmip6 the non bias corrected gcms generally had more variation between each gcm in discharge simulation for both cmip5 and cmip6 in contrast the bias corrected gcms had smaller variations and were close to the ones generated from the gpcc dataset 3 5 projection of future precipitation to better represent the precipitation effect on flooding this study evaluated the changes in precipitation based on annual maximum 90 day rainfall which provided the highest correlation with annual peak discharge and inundation compared with the periods from 1 to 6 months try et al 2020c fig 9 shows the annual maximum 90 day precipitation from the baseline period 1980 2014 to the projected periods in the near future 2026 2050 mid future 2051 2075 and far future 2076 2100 derived from cmip6 overall the results indicated that precipitation would increase for all future projected periods in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios according to eight simulations from cmip6 the effective precipitation would increase by 5 8 and 9 for ssp2 4 5 and 6 9 and 15 for ssp5 8 5 in near mid and far future respectively the results of the k s test of annual maximum 90 day precipitation from the present to each future climate showed that the null hypothesis was rejected at a significance level of 1 for all cases of ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 during the near mid and far future p value 0 001 in table 4 3 6 projection of future floods the peak discharge for future flood projections was evaluated and compared with the baseline period four main hydrological stations along the mainstream of the mekong river were investigated the annual peak discharge at chiang saen showed an increase in discharge by 10 20 and 27 for ssp2 4 5 and 10 27 and 47 for ssp5 8 5 at the projected periods in the near mid and far future respectively fig 10 these increases were notable with the k s test at a significance level of 1 with p values 0 01 table 4 moreover the peak discharge indicated a crucial increase in future projections with a similar rising rate of 11 29 for ssp2 4 5 and 14 54 for ssp5 8 5 in vientiane fig 11 p value 0 01 15 26 for ssp2 4 5 and 20 46 for ssp5 8 5 in pakse fig 12 p value 0 001 in table 4 the peak discharge increased for all assessed periods at all stations figs 10 13 in fig 13 the annual peak discharge in the downstream station kratie is used as a representative point of flooding in the lmb for the ssp2 4 5 scenario the peak discharge increased by 14 21 and 24 in the near mid and far future respectively p value 0 001 additionally the peak discharge for ssp5 8 5 sharply increased by 18 24 and 41 for the three future projection periods p value 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 implementation of climate change impacts on future flood projections the most recent cmip6 have improved the characteristics and performance of climate simulations over the previous cmip5 this study compared precipitation and flood characteristics from eight cmip6 with the same models from cmip5 in the mrb according to the precipitation analysis based on the grid by grid basin average and three mrb zones the cmip6 results clearly show significant improvement in correlation and bias values moreover the monthly and annual peak discharges from historical experiments have also improved this was primarily observed in the model ensemble means from cmip5 which underestimated peak flows compared to cmip6 the climate outputs of cmip6 have significantly improved results compared to those of cmip5 as confirmed by other research studies chen et al 2021 showed similar improvements in extreme seasonal precipitation in cmip6 over cmip5 based on case studies in the western north pacific and east asia xin et al 2020 evaluated and found higher skill scores in the simulation of summer precipitation from cmip6 in china and east asia zamani et al 2020 determined the outperformance of cmip5 by cmip6 for precipitation projections in northeastern iran ayugi et al 2021 showed an improved performance using cmip6 in simulating mean and extreme precipitation in east africa with less bias than cmip5 future climate projections in the mrb using the cmip6 indicate an increase in both effective precipitation and annual peak discharge in the near 2026 2050 mid 2051 2075 and far 2076 2100 future compared to the baseline period 1980 2014 the increases in peak discharge at kratie range between 14 and 24 and 18 41 during the three projected periods for ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively these results agree with those of previous studies on the impacts and severity of future climate change in the mrb for instance try et al 2020b found an increase in high flow exceeding 5 of times q5 by 13 30 in the future climate projection for 2075 2099 compared to 1979 2003 similarly perera et al 2017 found an increase in future inundation extent in the lmb between 24 and 35 by using a single mri agcm3 2s with ranging of different sea surface temperature patterns with for rcp8 5 which is comparable to ssp5 8 5 in cmip6 västilä et al 2010 projected annual maximum floods in the lmb from 2010 to 2049 with exceedance between 3 and 14 for the a2 scenario in cmip3 comparable to rcp8 5 in cmip5 and ssp5 8 5 in cmip6 khoi et al 2020 found an increase of annual river discharge of the mrb from 3 35 to 9 13 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using cordex datasets 4 2 performance of cmip6 gcms and high resolution gcms and rcms this study evaluated the effect of spatial resolution on flood simulation by comparing two high resolution version highresmip from cmip6 cnrm cm6 1 hr and mri agcm3 2s hereafter noted as highresmip1 and highresmip2 and two rcms from cordex east asia cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 and mpi m mpi esm lr hereafter noted as cordex1 and cordex2 with the coarse resolution cmip6 cnrm cm6 1 and mri esm2 0 hereafter noted as gcm1 and gcm2 this analysis applied the same linear scaling bias correction method for the cmip6 highresmip and cordex by comparing with gpcc precipitation the highresmip and cordex datasets with high resolution of up to 0 1875 0 5 could overcome the smoothing distribution of annual precipitation compared to the coarse resolution versions of cmip6 1 40625 and 1 125 during the baseline period fig 14 however the difference in resolution was not sensitive to the basin average monthly precipitation even though the spatial resolution is different the gcms from the same model agency i e gcm1 vs highresmip1 and gcm2 vs highresmip2 generally showed a similar precipitation distribution no significant difference could be seen in the violin and box plots in fig 15 the mean monthly precipitation was 122 and 123 mm month for highresmip1 and highresmip2 122 and 123 mm month for gcm1 and gcm2 and 126 and 119 mm month for cordex1 and cordex2 respectively compared to 126 mm month from gpcc precipitation fig 15 in addition the discharge simulation performances from gcm highresmip and cordex showed a similar pattern of distribution as shown in the violin plot of daily discharge in fig 16 comparing with mean daily discharge from gpcc of 11 512 m3 s the simulated discharge was 11 773 and 11 487 m3 s for gcm1 and gcm2 and 11 327 and 10 918 m3 s for highresmip1 and highresmip2 and 13 509 and 10 577 m3 s for cordex1 and cordex2 respectively fig 16 in conclusion the effect of different resolutions from gcms and rcms may not be a significant factor affecting flood projection in the mrb particularly at kratie station located near the floodplain of the lmb 4 3 uncertainties and limitations this study primarily evaluated historical simulation from climate datasets and future projections of gcms under future climate change impacts only future climate change impact perspectives on flooding were considered while leaving important variables untouched the sources of uncertainties in flood projections under the impacts of climate change could be associated with emission scenarios gcms downscaling methods and hydrological models hoan et al 2020 this study evaluated only two future projection scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from cmip6 other future projection scenarios e g ssp1 2 6 and ssp3 7 0 could also possibly happen and they should be considered in further studies moreover different downscaling methods should be investigated to capture the topographic characteristics complexity particularly in the more regional scale studies only the rri model was used to project floods in this study while different hydrological models and their input parameters could associate with flood projection uncertainties in addition land use was assumed to be constant from baseline throughout the projected periods in the rri model simulation changes in topography due to soil erosion and deposition were not considered in the rri model as well moreover the influence of hydropower and irrigation reservoirs on the river basin s seasonal hydrology and flow has not yet been analyzed the future projections of flooding in this study focused only on annual peak discharge using cmip6 further studies are needed to assess the cumulative impacts of climate change associated with these land use changes and the impacts of water infrastructure development 5 conclusions this study focuses on assessing the performance of eight cmip6 compared with cmip5 in precipitation and discharge simulations in the mrb the results show a significant improvement in the non bias corrected cmip6 compared to the non bias corrected cmip5 the future projections of flooding in the mrb from eight cmip6 show a significant increase in effective precipitation and annual peak discharge in the near mid and far future in both the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios this study found that different resolutions of gcms and rcms performed similarly in predicting river discharge downstream of the mrb however our study focused on flood projection in the large basin mrb with a drainage area up to 795 000 km2 the benefits of using high resolution gcm and regional downscaled climate data would be able to capture the complexity of land surface and local topographic characteristics in the small river basin such as tributaries of the mrb studies on climate change impacts on hydrology changes such as floods and droughts using cmip6 could provide additional analysis to the previous cmip3 or cmip5 outputs moreover further studies should focus on downscaling gcm to catch up with regional climate change by obtaining a higher spatial resolution this might be more suitable for spatial distribution particularly for studies in small scale river basins to reduce the possibility of severe damage caused by extreme flooding adequate water resource management flood adaptation and mitigation strategies flood prevention infrastructure and efficient real time flood early warning and forecasting systems are required funding

8034,study region mekong river basin study focus the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 recently announced an updated version of general circulation models gcms this study investigated the performance of improved cmip6 over those of cmip5 with respect to precipitation and flood representations in the mekong river basin mrb the correlation and error comparison from the referenced precipitation exhibited a significant improvement in the peak value representation hence the impacts of climate change on future floods in the mrb were simulated and assessed using a distributed rainfall runoff inundation model new hydrological insights for the region the results indicated that precipitation from cmip6 had a higher correlation and a lower error coefficient than cmip5 similarly the simulation of gcm ensembles of monthly discharge from cmip6 exhibited a comparable average value to the observations whereas cmip5 underestimated the discharge simulations the performance of the mean annual peak discharge improved from 37 220 m3 s cmip5 to 45 423 m3 s cmip6 compared to 43 521 m3 s observation the projections of future floods in the mrb from cmip6 exhibited an increase of annual peak discharge at chiang saen vientiane pakse and kratie stations by 10 15 20 22 and 24 29 for the ssp2 4 5 scenario and 10 18 24 29 and 41 54 for the ssp5 8 5 scenario in the near future 2026 2050 mid future 2051 2075 and far future 2076 2100 respectively the statistical k s test showed significant changes in all stations and projected periods with a p value 0 01 keywords cmip5 cmip6 gcm flooding mekong river basin 1 introduction with a drainage area of 795 000 km2 the mekong river basin mrb is one of the largest transboundary rivers shared by china myanmar thailand lao people s democratic republic lao pdr cambodia and vietnam the floodplain and delta areas located in the lower mekong basin lmb are annually affected by flooding as a natural phenomenon leading to the deposition of sediment as a natural fertilizer resulting in high agricultural productivity and biodiversity however the frequency and severity of extreme flood events over the last few decades and future projections would be significantly increased hoang et al 2016 oddo et al 2018 perera et al 2017 try et al 2020a västilä et al 2010 flood related economic damage has also risen try et al 2018a primarily because of the significant increase in population and settlement close to the river network and floodplain of the lmb try et al 2018a the cost of the average historical annual flood damage is approximately us 60 70 million and these figures continue to rise mrc 2011 climate change and human activity are projected to affect the hydrological and ecological systems of the lmb particularly in tonle sap lake chadwick and juntopas 2008 hoang et al 2016 johnstone et al 2013 keskinen et al 2013 try et al 2020a 2020b uk et al 2018 the tonle sap lake and its floodplain play a significant role in the hydrology of the lmb the tonle sap river the connection between the mekong river and tonle sap lake has a bi directional flow between the rainy and dry seasons this area is home to more than 370 plant species 197 phytoplankton species and more than 225 bird species mrc 2010 constant assessment of the projected impacts of future climate on regional infrastructure and the environment is essential to be able to develop and implement appropriate adaptation measures flood simulations in the mekong region have been studied extensively for instance try et al 2018b simulated a large scale flood inundation in the entire mrb during the large flood event in 2000 wang et al 2021b simulated daily floods in the mrb from 1967 to 2015 pokhrel et al 2018 studied flood dynamics in the lmb focusing on the variations in upstream flow regulation siev et al 2019 and tanaka et al 2018 modeled the inundation pattern in tonle sap lake a major sub basin in the lmb future planning preparation mitigation and adaptation measures in river basins are essential in the current reality of climate change thus information on climate change effects on a river basin is vital to policymakers and the population in general general circulation model gcm uncertainties have been identified from different sources such as the assumption of greenhouse gas emission scenarios model configuration climate downscaling and the unforced variability of the climate system giorgi 2010 yet they still provide a valuable source of stochastic system performance the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 results have reduced the uncertainty of hydrological extremes under climate change in the mrb compared to cmip3 hoang et al 2016 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc recently released new outputs from cmip6 the cmip5 projected the future climate based on greenhouse gas emissions represented by four representative concentration pathways rcps namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 ipcc 2014 the cmip6 has designed five scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathways ssp namely ssp1 2 6 ssp2 4 5 ssp4 6 0 and ssp5 8 5 to include socioeconomic factors such as the growth of population economics urbanization and other factors eyring et al 2016 o neill et al 2016 the improvement of cmip6 scenarios includes wider equilibrium climate sensitivity ecs with an increasing temperature range of 1 5 4 5 c the models in cmip6 were expected to improve their capability and reduce uncertainty over the previous cmip5 and cmip3 chen et al 2020 the new protocol of cmip6 provided also the high resolution gcm simulations namely highresmip experiments together with their coarse resolution gcm haarsma et al 2016 the highresmip experiments would solve the issue of coarse resolution of climate models with their resolutions being comparable to regional climate models rcms e g cordex and high resolution agcm mizuta et al 2012 2014 in cmip5 ruan et al 2018 evaluated the ranking scores of precipitation from cmip5 over the lmb chhin and yoden 2018 proposed a framework for model ensemble selection based on historical simulations of cmip5 in the indochina region and chhin et al 2020 used their optimal ensemble subset for future drought projections several studies on flood inundation simulation used a two dimensional distributed model in the lmb during historical flood events dutta et al 2007 perera et al 2017 try et al 2018b try et al 2020b assessed future climate change impacts on flood inundation in the lmb through a high resolution atmospheric general circulation model from the meteorological research institute mri agcm in which sea surface temperatures ssts from 28 cmip5 were used as boundary condition try et al 2020a projected the extreme flood inundation in the mrb from a large ensemble database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf using mri agcm with sst boundary conditions for six cmip5 models ccsm4 gfdl cm3 hadgem2 miroc5 mpi esm mr and cgcm3 overall previous studies of future flooding projections in the mrb were based on previous cmip3 and cmip5 only a comparison of cmip5 and cmip6 could provide guidance for further exploration of the newly released cmip6 datasets cmip6 are found to have an improved performance in capturing climate changes in various regions kamruzzaman et al 2021 wang et al 2021a zamani et al 2020 there is still a lack of information for the comparison of cmip5 and cmip6 on precipitation and flood projections in the mekong region considering the significant improvement in the climate variables of the cmip6 over cmip5 it is necessary to conduct a comparative study that will provide a valuable resource of information for policy decision makers in this area iqbal et al 2021 evaluated cmip6 precipitation over mainland southeast asia and results indicated that most cmip6 models were able to capture rainfall climatological in this region gusain et al 2020 found the improvements of precipitation in agreement with the observation from cmip6 over cmip5 in simulating the indian summer monsoon moreover kim et al 2020 analyzed extreme climate indices from cmip6 models and showed their improved ability to capture the global and regional climate patterns demory et al 2020 showed that rcm euro cordex and highresmip outperform cmip5 particularly in summer and autumn in most of the european regions dong and dong 2021 found an improvement in bias reduction of extreme precipitation in asia from cmip6 coarse resolution and highresmip experiments over cmip5 xin et al 2021 revealed better performance of model ensemble from cmip6 highresmip in simulation of precipitation distribution in china the high resolution highresmip was found suitable for projecting of monsoon precipitation and hydrological extreme in case studies in peninsular malaysia liang et al 2021 tan et al 2021 this study aims to investigate the performance of cmip6 compared to cmip5 on precipitation estimates applied to flood simulation within the mrb it also assesses the potential impacts of climate change on flood inundation in the mrb under the new projected scenarios for the near future 2026 2050 mid future 2050 2075 and far future 2075 until the end of the 21st century 2 methodology 2 1 rainfall runoff inundation modeling this study used an integrated rainfall runoff and flood inundation rri model sayama et al 2012 2015a 2015b the rri model is a two dimensional distributed model that separately considers hill slopes and river channels the rri model calculates flow on slopes and rivers based on 2d and 1d diffusive wave equations which can consider reversed flow the rri model simulates the lateral subsurface flow vertical infiltration and surface flow to represent the rainfall runoff inundation processes the river geometry is assumed to be rectangular with width w m and depth d m as indicated in eqs 1 and 2 as a function of upstream drainage area a km2 try et al 2018b calculated the geometry coefficients c w s w c d and s d with values of 0 0015 0 7491 0 0520 and 0 7596 respectively for the mrb 1 w c w a s w 2 d c d a s d this study employed the precipitation dataset from gpcc with daily scale and 1 resolution ziese et al 2018 the gpcc precipitation data provide a reasonable rainfall distribution over the entire mrb in the rainfall runoff inundation modeling by exhibiting a better correlation with the observed discharge than other available open datasets try et al 2020c try et al 2020a 2020b validated the gpcc data for long term flood inundation modeling in the mrb for 1983 2010 and 1982 2007 respectively the evapotranspiration dataset was taken from the japanese 55 year reanalysis dataset jra 55 with 3 hourly and 0 5625 resolution kobayashi et al 2015 the topography datasets including digital elevation model dem flow direction dir and flow accumulation acc derived from multi error removed improved terrain merit dem yamazaki et al 2017 and land use from modis product mcd12q1 for 2000 friedl et al 2010 were used as input to the rri model in this study more detailed description of model structure and input parameters of the rri model could be found in the supplementary file the rri model has been applied to hydrological simulations in southeast asia to simulate flood inundation and confirm its good performance for example the rri model was used to reproduce a historical large scale flood event in 2000 try et al 2018b and to evaluate the performance of satellite based precipitation products for flood inundation simulation try et al 2020c perera et al 2017 and try et al 2020b used the rri model to evaluate the effects of climate change in the lmb by considering various rcp and sst scenarios moreover try et al 2020a validated the rri model for long term simulation 1983 2010 before using it to project extreme flood inundation events in the mrb 2 2 climate datasets precipitation and evapotranspiration datasets were obtained from cmip6 and cmip5 at a daily time step eight gcms were used for the comparative analysis each gcm was selected from the same institution in cmip5 and cmip6 table 1 shows the institution model name and spatial resolution of each model six gcms no 1 to no 6 in table 1 had the same spatial resolution in cmip5 and cmip6 two gcms nos 7 and 8 had a higher gridded resolution in cmip6 than in cmip5 to consider the effect of simulation of high resolution this study compared two cmip6 cnrm cm6 1 and mri esm2 0 with two gcms from highresmip cnrm cm6 1 hr and mri agcm3 2s and two rcms from cordex east asia cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 and mpi m mpi esm lr the gpcc rainfall dataset was used to evaluate the performance of gcms from cmip5 and cmip6 2 3 performance assessment this study used multiple statistical indicators to verify the performance of rri model simulation including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 peak discharge ratio pdr and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta

matches the diagram visualizes their correlation root mean square difference and variances of data i e standard deviation in this study the taylor diagram was used to visualize and evaluate the precipitation performance of cmip5 and cmip6 over the mrb geographical conditions and uneven precipitation distribution were estimated by dividing the mrb into three zones namely the upper mekong basin in china the middle mrb in thailand and lao pdr and the lmb in cambodia and vietnam fig 1 the simulated discharge from the rri model from cmip5 and cmip6 in monthly and annual peak discharge values was compared with gauged observations finally the best gcms were selected for future projections to identify changes in flood characteristics in the mrb in the near mid and far future the gcms were bias corrected for future flood projections this study applied a bias correction method using linear scaling approach 12 p day bc p mon obs p mon gcm p day gcm where p mon obs average monthly gpcc precipitation p mon gcm average monthly gcm precipitation p day agcm daily gcm precipitation and p day bc daily bias corrected gcm precipitation the correction factor calculated from the present climate was applied to future climate projections this study used the kolmogorov smirnov k s test to evaluate the changes in flooding between present and future projection climates the statistical k s test is a non parametric test of two samples and is used to evaluate statistical variation the maximum difference in the cumulative distribution function cdf of the two samples can be defined as follows 13 d n m sup x f n x f m x where f n and f m are the empirical distribution functions of the two samples and sup is the supremum function the null hypothesis h 0 assumes that the two samples have no significant difference in the cdf when the likelihood of the different distributions of the two samples exceeds the significance level the null hypothesis is rejected the null hypothesis is rejected if the following condition is satisfied 14 d n m c α n m nm where n and m are the sample sizes at a significance level of 1 c α was equal to 1 628 3 results and discussion 3 1 rri model performance fig 2 compares the simulated discharge from the rri model and the observed discharge at the four hydrological stations from upstream to downstream of the mekong river at chiang saen vientiane pakse and kratie the rri model performance at the upstream station in chiang saen was kge 0 57 nse 0 49 r 0 82 and pdr 0 65 0 15 the performance at the two middle stations of vientiane and pakse were kge 0 79 and 0 91 nse 0 74 and 0 85 r 0 88 and 0 93 and pdr 0 80 0 14 and 0 95 0 17 respectively the rri model simulated discharge was more accurate at the downstream station kratie with kge 0 93 nse 0 88 r 0 94 and pdr 0 95 0 15 overall the rri model performance in the mrb hydrological simulation was acceptable and particularly accurate in the downstream area which is the area most affected by floods 3 2 evaluation of precipitation the historical gcm experiments used were from 1950 to 2005 for cmip5 and from 1950 to 2014 for cmip6 the monthly precipitation results based on the grid by grid distribution and basin average for each gcm from cmip5 and cmip6 are shown in the taylor diagrams in figs 3 and 4 respectively the basin average precipitation had higher accuracy than the grid by grid precipitation in the correlation coefficient r root mean square difference rmsd and standard deviation σ for the grid by grid precipitation the improvement of gcms was r 0 48 and rmsd 79 11 mm in cmip5 to r 0 58 and rmsd 72 82 mm in cmip6 table 2 the standard deviation values were similarly improved from σ 61 81 mm in cmip5 to σ 67 10 mm in cmip6 σ of gpcc 87 89 mm table 2 for the basin average precipitation the performance improvement from cmip5 to cmip6 was 0 97 0 99 for the correlation coefficient and 27 20 24 67 mm for the bias however the standard deviation seemed larger in cmip6 being 110 46 mm compared to 102 mm in cmip5 σ of gpcc 101 18 mm this means that cmip6 have improved their agreement with reference precipitation and have shown smaller error values in both analyses of the basin average and the grid by grid precipitation in addition to the evaluation based on the grid by grid and the basin average the precipitation results were also compared for the three zones upstream high elevation midstream and downstream in the mrb both cmip5 and cmip6 generally exhibited good performance in zone iii the lmb floodplain and delta followed by zone ii central mrb and zone i the upper mekong basin ranked by the best performance the tendency of each model distribution in the taylor plot in fig 5 can be distinguished by an increase in the correlation coefficient and a reduction in the bias index rmsd from cmip5 to cmip6 particularly noticeable in zones i and ii however cmip6 also had larger standard deviation values compared to cmip5 table 3 provides a summary of the information on all model performances for zone iii the average performance indices among eight gcms were r 0 97 rmsd 31 46 mm and σ 88 77 mm reference to gpcc σ 63 97 mm for cmip5 and r 0 98 rmsd 30 42 mm and σ 89 97 mm for cmip6 similarly the advancement from cmip5 to cmip6 in zone ii was indicated by the following results r 0 96 0 98 rmsd 36 41 30 74 mm and σ 104 49 114 31 mm σ of gpcc 118 55 mm among the three zones zone i had poor accuracy with r 0 95 and 0 97 rmsd 38 42 mm and 41 69 mm and σ 115 82 mm and 131 29 mm σ of gpcc 109 90 mm for cmip5 and cmip6 respectively in summary there was an improvement in the performance of the new cmip6 over the previous cmip5 for precipitation simulations over the mrb cmip6 thus better represented precipitation in the middle and downstream areas compared to cmip5 3 3 performance of discharge simulation daily precipitation from all gcms was used as input to the calibrated and validated rri model to assess river flow and annual peak flood discharge fig 6 shows a comparison of the gauged observation and simulated discharge at kratie on monthly basis during the flood season the cmip5 underestimated the river discharge by means and even error bars i e mean standard deviation in july and august with values outside the range compared to the observation discharge however the mean values are overestimated in september but within the error bar but closer to observations in the late flood period in october the overall performance of cmip6 improved during the flood season compared to that of cmip5 all values within the error bar notably during the peak flood period in september the mean of cmip6 was close to the observation whereas the mean of cmip5 was underestimated similar to precipitation and monthly discharge the annual peak discharge fig 7 showed a similar performance improvement in cmip6 compared to cmip5 at hydrological stations in kratie and chiang saen the simulated annual peak discharge from cmip5 and cmip6 overestimated the annual peak discharge at chiang saen the mean values slightly improved from cmip5 14 398 m3 s to cmip6 13 890 m3 s compared to observation 10 483 m3 s at kratie the cmip5 outputs underestimated the annual peak discharge and the means from cmip6 were in good agreement with the observations the means from cmip5 and cmip6 were 37 220 m3 s and 43 016 m3 s compared to the observation of 43 521 m3 s however the standard deviation values ranging from lower to upper error bars of the cmip6 outputs at kratie were larger than those of cmip5 and of the observed peak discharges overall even though there was an improvement in cmip6 over cmip5 cmip6 still had an extensive bias compared to the observation therefore the following sections consider the bias correction to further improve cmip6 for the evaluation of future flooding projections in the mrb 3 4 performance of bias correction the bias correction of the precipitation of cmip6 was conducted using the linear scaling method to improve the performance of the precipitation and discharge projections this method previously exhibited good performance in the bias correction of high resolution climate outputs in the mrb try et al 2020b fig 8 shows the performance of simulated discharge from the non bias corrected and bias corrected cmip6 the non bias corrected gcms generally had more variation between each gcm in discharge simulation for both cmip5 and cmip6 in contrast the bias corrected gcms had smaller variations and were close to the ones generated from the gpcc dataset 3 5 projection of future precipitation to better represent the precipitation effect on flooding this study evaluated the changes in precipitation based on annual maximum 90 day rainfall which provided the highest correlation with annual peak discharge and inundation compared with the periods from 1 to 6 months try et al 2020c fig 9 shows the annual maximum 90 day precipitation from the baseline period 1980 2014 to the projected periods in the near future 2026 2050 mid future 2051 2075 and far future 2076 2100 derived from cmip6 overall the results indicated that precipitation would increase for all future projected periods in the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios according to eight simulations from cmip6 the effective precipitation would increase by 5 8 and 9 for ssp2 4 5 and 6 9 and 15 for ssp5 8 5 in near mid and far future respectively the results of the k s test of annual maximum 90 day precipitation from the present to each future climate showed that the null hypothesis was rejected at a significance level of 1 for all cases of ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 during the near mid and far future p value 0 001 in table 4 3 6 projection of future floods the peak discharge for future flood projections was evaluated and compared with the baseline period four main hydrological stations along the mainstream of the mekong river were investigated the annual peak discharge at chiang saen showed an increase in discharge by 10 20 and 27 for ssp2 4 5 and 10 27 and 47 for ssp5 8 5 at the projected periods in the near mid and far future respectively fig 10 these increases were notable with the k s test at a significance level of 1 with p values 0 01 table 4 moreover the peak discharge indicated a crucial increase in future projections with a similar rising rate of 11 29 for ssp2 4 5 and 14 54 for ssp5 8 5 in vientiane fig 11 p value 0 01 15 26 for ssp2 4 5 and 20 46 for ssp5 8 5 in pakse fig 12 p value 0 001 in table 4 the peak discharge increased for all assessed periods at all stations figs 10 13 in fig 13 the annual peak discharge in the downstream station kratie is used as a representative point of flooding in the lmb for the ssp2 4 5 scenario the peak discharge increased by 14 21 and 24 in the near mid and far future respectively p value 0 001 additionally the peak discharge for ssp5 8 5 sharply increased by 18 24 and 41 for the three future projection periods p value 0 001 4 discussion 4 1 implementation of climate change impacts on future flood projections the most recent cmip6 have improved the characteristics and performance of climate simulations over the previous cmip5 this study compared precipitation and flood characteristics from eight cmip6 with the same models from cmip5 in the mrb according to the precipitation analysis based on the grid by grid basin average and three mrb zones the cmip6 results clearly show significant improvement in correlation and bias values moreover the monthly and annual peak discharges from historical experiments have also improved this was primarily observed in the model ensemble means from cmip5 which underestimated peak flows compared to cmip6 the climate outputs of cmip6 have significantly improved results compared to those of cmip5 as confirmed by other research studies chen et al 2021 showed similar improvements in extreme seasonal precipitation in cmip6 over cmip5 based on case studies in the western north pacific and east asia xin et al 2020 evaluated and found higher skill scores in the simulation of summer precipitation from cmip6 in china and east asia zamani et al 2020 determined the outperformance of cmip5 by cmip6 for precipitation projections in northeastern iran ayugi et al 2021 showed an improved performance using cmip6 in simulating mean and extreme precipitation in east africa with less bias than cmip5 future climate projections in the mrb using the cmip6 indicate an increase in both effective precipitation and annual peak discharge in the near 2026 2050 mid 2051 2075 and far 2076 2100 future compared to the baseline period 1980 2014 the increases in peak discharge at kratie range between 14 and 24 and 18 41 during the three projected periods for ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively these results agree with those of previous studies on the impacts and severity of future climate change in the mrb for instance try et al 2020b found an increase in high flow exceeding 5 of times q5 by 13 30 in the future climate projection for 2075 2099 compared to 1979 2003 similarly perera et al 2017 found an increase in future inundation extent in the lmb between 24 and 35 by using a single mri agcm3 2s with ranging of different sea surface temperature patterns with for rcp8 5 which is comparable to ssp5 8 5 in cmip6 västilä et al 2010 projected annual maximum floods in the lmb from 2010 to 2049 with exceedance between 3 and 14 for the a2 scenario in cmip3 comparable to rcp8 5 in cmip5 and ssp5 8 5 in cmip6 khoi et al 2020 found an increase of annual river discharge of the mrb from 3 35 to 9 13 under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using cordex datasets 4 2 performance of cmip6 gcms and high resolution gcms and rcms this study evaluated the effect of spatial resolution on flood simulation by comparing two high resolution version highresmip from cmip6 cnrm cm6 1 hr and mri agcm3 2s hereafter noted as highresmip1 and highresmip2 and two rcms from cordex east asia cnrm cerfacs cnrm cm5 and mpi m mpi esm lr hereafter noted as cordex1 and cordex2 with the coarse resolution cmip6 cnrm cm6 1 and mri esm2 0 hereafter noted as gcm1 and gcm2 this analysis applied the same linear scaling bias correction method for the cmip6 highresmip and cordex by comparing with gpcc precipitation the highresmip and cordex datasets with high resolution of up to 0 1875 0 5 could overcome the smoothing distribution of annual precipitation compared to the coarse resolution versions of cmip6 1 40625 and 1 125 during the baseline period fig 14 however the difference in resolution was not sensitive to the basin average monthly precipitation even though the spatial resolution is different the gcms from the same model agency i e gcm1 vs highresmip1 and gcm2 vs highresmip2 generally showed a similar precipitation distribution no significant difference could be seen in the violin and box plots in fig 15 the mean monthly precipitation was 122 and 123 mm month for highresmip1 and highresmip2 122 and 123 mm month for gcm1 and gcm2 and 126 and 119 mm month for cordex1 and cordex2 respectively compared to 126 mm month from gpcc precipitation fig 15 in addition the discharge simulation performances from gcm highresmip and cordex showed a similar pattern of distribution as shown in the violin plot of daily discharge in fig 16 comparing with mean daily discharge from gpcc of 11 512 m3 s the simulated discharge was 11 773 and 11 487 m3 s for gcm1 and gcm2 and 11 327 and 10 918 m3 s for highresmip1 and highresmip2 and 13 509 and 10 577 m3 s for cordex1 and cordex2 respectively fig 16 in conclusion the effect of different resolutions from gcms and rcms may not be a significant factor affecting flood projection in the mrb particularly at kratie station located near the floodplain of the lmb 4 3 uncertainties and limitations this study primarily evaluated historical simulation from climate datasets and future projections of gcms under future climate change impacts only future climate change impact perspectives on flooding were considered while leaving important variables untouched the sources of uncertainties in flood projections under the impacts of climate change could be associated with emission scenarios gcms downscaling methods and hydrological models hoan et al 2020 this study evaluated only two future projection scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 from cmip6 other future projection scenarios e g ssp1 2 6 and ssp3 7 0 could also possibly happen and they should be considered in further studies moreover different downscaling methods should be investigated to capture the topographic characteristics complexity particularly in the more regional scale studies only the rri model was used to project floods in this study while different hydrological models and their input parameters could associate with flood projection uncertainties in addition land use was assumed to be constant from baseline throughout the projected periods in the rri model simulation changes in topography due to soil erosion and deposition were not considered in the rri model as well moreover the influence of hydropower and irrigation reservoirs on the river basin s seasonal hydrology and flow has not yet been analyzed the future projections of flooding in this study focused only on annual peak discharge using cmip6 further studies are needed to assess the cumulative impacts of climate change associated with these land use changes and the impacts of water infrastructure development 5 conclusions this study focuses on assessing the performance of eight cmip6 compared with cmip5 in precipitation and discharge simulations in the mrb the results show a significant improvement in the non bias corrected cmip6 compared to the non bias corrected cmip5 the future projections of flooding in the mrb from eight cmip6 show a significant increase in effective precipitation and annual peak discharge in the near mid and far future in both the ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios this study found that different resolutions of gcms and rcms performed similarly in predicting river discharge downstream of the mrb however our study focused on flood projection in the large basin mrb with a drainage area up to 795 000 km2 the benefits of using high resolution gcm and regional downscaled climate data would be able to capture the complexity of land surface and local topographic characteristics in the small river basin such as tributaries of the mrb studies on climate change impacts on hydrology changes such as floods and droughts using cmip6 could provide additional analysis to the previous cmip3 or cmip5 outputs moreover further studies should focus on downscaling gcm to catch up with regional climate change by obtaining a higher spatial resolution this might be more suitable for spatial distribution particularly for studies in small scale river basins to reduce the possibility of severe damage caused by extreme flooding adequate water resource management flood adaptation and mitigation strategies flood prevention infrastructure and efficient real time flood early warning and forecasting systems are required funding
