695,deposition of fine sediments on a marsh platform favors accretion that counteracts sea level rise however it is difficult to assess the sediment trapping capacity of a marsh given the heterogeneity of sediment sources and the geometric complexity of the system with a network of dendritic and meandering creeks dissecting the intertidal area here we use a numerical model to study the sediment trapping capacity of a marsh dominated estuary plum island sound usa and its variations across the landscape the results highlight the importance of the timing between sediment inputs and tidal phase and show that sediment discharged from tidal rivers deposit within the rivers themselves or in adjacent marshes most sediment is deposited in shallow tidal flats and channels and is unable to penetrate farther inside the marshes because of the limited water depths and velocities on the marsh platform trapping capacity of sediment in different intertidal subdomains decreases logarithmically with the ratio between advection length and the typical length of channels and tidal flats moreover sediment deposition on the marsh decreases exponentially with distance from the channels and marsh edge this decay rate is a function of settling velocity and the maximum value of water depth and velocity on the marsh platform keywords salt marshes numerical modelling sediment

violent storms in recent years salt marshes have experienced increasing pressure from sea level rise slr and human activities e g a decrease in riverine sediment supply due to dams syvitski et al 2005 2007 dai et al 2014 dai and liu 2013 craft et al 2009 marsh drowning due to slr and wave induced horizontal retreat has been well documented around the world fagherazzi et al 2013 kirwan and murray 2007 leonardi and fagherazzi 2014 leonardi et al 2017 fagherazzi et al 2013 and ganju et al 2017 highlight the critical role that sediment supply and sediment transport mechanisms play in the resilience of salt marshes against slr and human perturbations kirwan et al 2016 used process based models based on biophysical feedbacks to predict the threshold rate of slr for marsh survival their results indicate that marshes can survive under relatively high slr rates only if abundant sediment is available ganju et al 2015 found that a marsh can laterally erode despite having high ssc and accretion rates they suggested the flood ebb ssc ratio as a better vulnerability metric since it mimics the difference between the sediment entering and exiting the marsh complex another vulnerability metric is the ratio between unvegetated and vegetated areas which well predicts the sediment deficit of microtidal marsh systems ganju et al 2017 all these recent results indicate that sediment fluxes are critical in determining marsh vulnerability to slr the possible sources of sediments vary in different systems and most coastal bays may lack riverine sediment inputs in a recent work hopkinson et al 2018 evaluated the sediment budget of plum island sound by comparing lidar data taken in different years they found that marsh edge erosion provides more 30 of the sediment required to counteract slr whereas riverine sediments provide less than 10 this indicates that sediment fluxes from the ocean and from tidal flats should account for more than 50 of the budget it is thus critical to understand the fate of suspended sediments in a salt marsh complex and the trapping capacity of different marsh locations with respect to potential sources of sediments including rivers bays and the coastal ocean understanding the source and fate of sediments within marshes is of paramount importance in determining the future resilience of these ecosystems marshes are able to capture fine cohesive sediments because the thick vegetation reduces flow speed and turbulence allowing the deposition of small particles fagherazzi et al 2012 mehta 2014 however it is difficult to quantify sediment transport dynamics in an estuary due to the complex geometry of the intertidal landscape with dendritic channel networks dissecting salt marshes fagherazzi et al 1999 numerical simulations provide the opportunity to explore sediment trajectories in such a complex environment for example simulations can capture the residence time of sediment particles and tracers in intertidal areas defne et al 2016 mercier and delhez 2007 and tidal rivers ralston and geyer 2017 point field measurements have identified that increasing elevation distance to channels and marsh edges and flow friction due to vegetation canopy affect the spatial distribution of sediment deposition rates on marshes christiansen et al 2000 fagherazzi et al 2012 reed et al 1999 temmerman et al 2005a temmerman et al 2003 proposed an empirical model by relating sedimentation to platform surface elevation distance to nearest channel or marsh edge and distance to marsh edge measured along the nearest creek the model well captured spatial variations of sedimentation over the marsh platform in the scheldt estuary belgium sw netherlands a simplified advection dispersion equation of suspended sediment transport over marshes indicates that settling velocity inundation depth and flow velocity determine the decay rate of sediment concentration along a transect perpendicular to the creek bank or marsh edge fagherazzi et al 2012 but it is not clear whether this simplified model can be applied to a natural system with a complex channel network flow velocities over the marsh platform are relatively small compared to those in the channels and significantly vary in space and time during a tidal cycle for example the peak velocity is one order of magnitude larger than the velocity during high slack water leonard and luther 1995 as a result it is difficult to determine what hydrodynamic conditions are responsible for the advection of sediment in the marsh the role of vegetation in sediment transport dynamics is well captured in recent numerical models the effect of vegetation structures on momentum turbulence and water exchange dynamics nepf and vivoni 2000 is solved in the hydrodynamic models delft3d baptist 2005 temmerman et al 2005b and roms beudin et al 2017 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models have produced excellent results in a variety of vegetated coastal environments ranging from deltaic wetlands nardin and edmonds 2014 donatelli et al 2018 to mangrove forests horstman et al 2015 among these studies it was found that vegetation with intermediate height and density enhances sedimentation in river deltas such as the wax lake delta usa nardin and edmonds 2014 horstman et al 2015 highlighted the sensitivity of tropical shorelines to coupled sediment vegetation dynamics by showing a significant decrease in sediment trapping efficiency driven by loss of mangroves and a reduction in sediment inputs moreover by including vegetation growth and mortality oorschot et al 2016 showed that a dynamic vegetation provides more realistic results in the long term evolution of mangrove shorelines donatelli et al 2018 used the newly developed vegetation model in roms to investigate the impact of seagrass beds on sediment transport dynamics they found that the presence of seagrasses increases the total sediment budget of coastal embayment but reduces the amount of sediment in suspension and delivered to marsh platforms during high tide the vegetation module of the model delft3d was tested in temmerman et al 2005b in this model the momentum drag and turbulence structure induced by the vegetation are solved numerically using the k Îµ turbulence closure sensitive analyses show that a 2d vegetation model can also be used to reduce computational cost without a significant loss in accuracy despite the absence of three dimensional turbulence horstman et al 2013 in this manuscript we have applied the 2d delft3d flow mor model with the vegetation module to plum island sound massachusetts usa a mesotidal bay dominated by salt marshes fig 1 the bay hosts the plum island ecosystems of long term ecological research program pie lter the goal of this work is to determine the fate of cohesive sediments in the system specifically we will explore the sediment trapping capacity of different marsh subdomains by releasing sediments at different locations at different instants within the tidal cycle and with sediment grain sizes ranging from clay to silt furthermore characteristic scales of sediment deposition and factors controlling suspended sediment transport over the marsh platform are analyzed in order to clarify the mechanisms 2 methods 2 1 study area plum island sound fig 1 is a coastal plain bar built estuary with extensive areas of productive tidal marshes dominated by spartina alterniflora and spartina patens the estuary is located along the northeastern massachusetts shoreline and is fed by the ipswich rowley and parker rivers the tide is semi diurnal with a mean range of 2 6 m an inlet connects the sound to the atlantic ocean fagherazzi et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 because of the relatively high tidal energy the tide induced bed shear stresses are larger than the wind wave stresses except during extreme storms fagherazzi et al 2014 the bathymetry of the estuary is characterized by extensive tidal flats and a deep more than 5 m central channel fagherazzi et al 2014 we define marsh the area between 0 09 m mean sea level in navd88 and 1 453 m mhhw upland the area higher than 1 453 m wilson et al 2014 marshes account for 60 of the estuary surface fig 2 a in addition in order to determine the exchange of sediment across different parts of the estuary the system is divided in eight subdomains named upper estuary parker river rowley river ipswich river upper sound lower sound inlet and ocean fig 2b 2 2 numerical model setup we use the delft3d model coupled to the 2dh vegetation module to simulate tidal flow and the transport of cohesive sediments the domain consists of 703 410 cells with a resolution of 20 20 m fig 2 tidal harmonic constituents m2 s2 n2 k1 m4 o1 at the noaa station 8441241 see location 2 in fig 1 are prescribed at three ocean boundaries at the beginning of the simulations the phases of harmonic constituents are modified to match the water level data at the ipswich bay yacht club pier see location 1 in fig 1 the daily averaged flow discharge data of the parker 1 m3 s and ipswich rivers 5 m3 s are available at usgs gauges 01101000 01102000 while that of rowley river 0 2 m3 s is obtained by scaling the ipswich river discharge to the watershed area fagherazzi et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 although previous work highlights the contribution of saline water from plum island sound to the merrimack river the yearly daily averaged flow discharge recorded at the usgs gauge 424752070491701 tpk bridge see location 3 in fig 1 is 3 7 m3 s being ignorable compared to tidal prism 6 37 107 m3 of entire domain the water only outflows from plum island sound to the merrimack river during relatively low water levels for the bed roughness we set the following chezy coefficients 45 m1 2s 1 for the ocean rivers and main tidal channels 40 m1 2 s 1 for the tidal creeks and 35 m1 2 s 1 for the marsh platform the 2dh vegetation module uses the directed point model dpm and the vegetation drag effects on the momentum equations are solved based on baptist 2005 specifically a term 1 2 Î» u v 2 is included within the momentum equation to account for the flow resistance due to vegetation where

main fractions of cohesive sediments are tested based on field observations namely a coarse silt with grain size 32 64 Âµm and settling velocity of 3 6 mm s 1 and a clay fraction with grain size less than 32 Âµm with a settling velocity of 0 5 mm s 1 wiberg et al 2015 erosion e and deposition d of cohesive sediments in delft3d are calculated with the partheniades krone equations partheniades 1965

cohesive sediments we adopt the same parameters used in delft3d simulations for the virginia coast reserve a similar system of intertidal bays along the eastern shore of virginia wiberg et al 2015 Ï e is set to 0 05 n m 2 m to 1 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 and the dry bed density to 795 kg m 3 note that in this study we are not considering the possible coarser material sand present at the channel bottoms but only the fine material that is exchanged between channels and salt marsh platform from 1994 to 2015 water samples along the plum island estuary from the parker river dam to the mouth of the sound were collected within 2 h of either high tide or low tide in the spring and fall seasons the median value of 13 year suspended sediment concentration along the transect peaks approximately at 40 mg l at the mouth of the parker river decreases in the sound and reaches a lower value of 15 mg l at the inlet generally the concentration is higher in the spring when river discharge is high hopkinson et al 2018 an initial suspended sediment concentration of 30 mg l was released in different subdomains at different instants of the tidal cycle the bottom elevation was maintained fixed during the simulations to maintain model stability even with parallel computing we set the time step to be 0 3 min 2 3 numerical simulations we release a depth averaged suspended sediment concentration of 30 mg l in the water area of the subdomains 1 to 7 see fig 2 the suspended sediment was released at four different instants during a spring tidal cycle at high water level sh mean water level during ebb me low water level sl and mean water level during flood mf the physical parameters of the cohesive sediment were kept uniform with a settling velocity of 0 5 mm s 1 and a critical shear stress for erosion of 0 05 n m 2 since in all scenarios the suspended sediment mass in the water column after 1 month is negligible we only measured the sediment mass deposited at the bottom of the different subdomains to determine the role of different intertidal geometries on sediment transport dynamics we choose the rowley river as a representative marsh dominated area and the upper sound as an intertidal area with limited marsh we determine the distribution of deposited cohesive sediments after one month as a function of water depth in three landforms salt marshes elevation between 0 09 and 2 m tidal flats elevation between 0 09 and 2 m and deep channels elevation below 2 m for every marsh cell we calculate the minimum distance to the tidal flats channels as well as the averaged values of both maximum and mean flow velocity and inundation depth during marsh flooding 2 4 characteristic scales of sediment deposition the dynamics of sediment deposition is controlled by advection and setting of sediment advection depends on the average velocity of the tidal flow u while settling depends on water depth h and settling velocity Ï s we define a sediment transport length l0 as the distance a sediment particle travels before depositing 5 l 0 u h Ï s we define the non dimensional parameter r as the ratio between the sediment transport length l0 and the characteristic spatial dimension of a reference area l 6 r l 0 l if r 1 the sediment is likely to leave the reference area while if r 1 the sediment is trapped in it the values of the dimensional scales are reported in table 1 for all the subdomains of the estuary fig 2b following fagherazzi et al 2012 we examine the deposition rate on the marsh platform using the advection equation 7 c c 0 exp x l m where c is the suspended sediment concentration along a transect perpendicular to the marsh boundary kg m3 c0 is the concentration at the boundary between marsh and channel tidal flat lm umhm Ï s is the sediment transport length on the marsh um and hm are the average velocity m s and water depth m on the marsh platform during flooding x is distance from the marsh edge m the deposition rate is computed as the divergence of the sediment flux 8 d d c u m h m dx c Ï s exp x l m where d indicates deposition rate kg m2 s eqs 7 and 8 are evaluated for the entire marsh area computing the distance from the edge of each marsh point and utilizing the average value of velocity and water depth on the marsh platform computed with delft3d 3 results 3 1 sediment trapping capacity a dependency matrix shows the distribution of trapped sediment across the estuary fig 3 the diagonal elements indicate the fraction of sediment that deposits in the same subdomain where it was released the off diagonal elements record the sediment deposited in a subdomain different from the one of the initial release in the upper estuary parker river rowley river and ipswich river most sediments are deposited in the release area irrespectively of the timing of release in the lower sound and inlet domains the strong tidal currents resuspend and transport the cohesive sediments to low energy areas generally a large fraction of the sediments released in the rivers is kept in the estuary with an exception of the ipswich river because of its proximity to the inlet and the strong currents in the lower part of the sound the differences among the four matrixes reported in fig 3 highlight the role of the timing of release in the sediment trapping efficiency within the estuary the trapping efficiency is high in the mf case mean water level during flood since more sediment is transported landward during flood and then deposits in low energy areas on the contrary if released during ebb me more sediment is flushed out of the system as expected a large fraction of the sediment is exchanged between the upper and lower sound and more sediment deposits in the upper sound when released in the lower sound during flood the direct sediment exchange among the four marsh dominated subdomains the upper estuary parker river rowley river and ipswich river is very limited and only occurs through the sound no cohesive sediment released at the inlet remains there but it is either discharged to the ocean or trapped in the tidal reaches and marshes of the rowley and ipswich rivers hardly any sediment released at the inlet reaches the parker river and upper estuary even in the flood scenario 3 2 sediment exchange processes and mechanisms we then explore whether sediments are preferentially deposited in quiet areas experiencing low tidal velocities and low bottom shear stresses high tidal flow can in fact resuspend sediments and move them in areas where the velocity is lower for example in salt marshes and shallow tidal flats our results show that this is not always the case fig 4 a and the sediments are prevalently deposited in areas experiencing intermediate bottom shear stresses similarly sediments are mostly deposited at water depth between 0 and 2 m typical of tidal flats and tidal bars and not at water depths above mean sea level typical of salt marshes fig 4b the results of fig 4b are in agreements with the results of fig 4a since tidal bars and flats experience intermediate bottom shear stresses while marshes are characterized by very low shear stresses these results indicate that sediment availability and sediment pathways are also important and that only a small fraction of sediment is reaching the marsh platform this is partly due to the fact that at time zero the sediments are not released on the marsh platform but only in areas covered with water at mean sea level tidal channels and tidal flats the likely sources of sediment yet the fact that a small fraction of sediment reaches the marsh platform seems counterintuitive and it is an important result within the rowley river area clay Ï s 0 5 mm s is mostly deposited in the marshes and tidal flats deposition of coarse silt Ï s 3 6 mm s follows the same distribution with a slight shift toward lower areas in the upper sound a larger fraction of both mud and coarse silt is transferred into deep channels with less sediment deposited on the marshes fig 5 we also find that the distribution of deposited sediments is controlled more by the physical attributes of each area i e presence of salt marshes rather than by the grain size and settling velocity the distributions of deposited sediment as a function of water depth display peaks in the marsh area elevations around 1 3 m and in the tidal flats which correspond to the larger area fractions showed in fig 5b high values of bottom shear stress hinder the deposition of cohesive sediment in the rivers and large tidal channels as a result sediments that reach these channels are transported to either shallow areas or to the ocean sediment released in the rowley river is deposited mostly in tidal flats and salt marshes while a smaller fraction is deposited in the tidal channels or exported to the ocean fig 6 a in time the volume of sediments deposited on the marsh increases collecting sediments resuspended in tidal flats and channels note that the amount of sediments gained by marshes is higher than the sediment lost by tidal flats indicating that channels actively feed the marsh surface channels also contribute to the export of sediment to the ocean overall most sediments are deposited within hours after the release and moderate variations occur because of resuspension because tidal flats and deep channels have a similar area in the upper sound at the beginning of the simulation an equal amount of mud is deposited on these two landforms fig 6b similarly to the rowley river case the sediment deposited in the deep channels decreases while it increases on the marshes and tidal flats over time and some of these sediments are also exported to the ocean in the upper sound changes in the sediment reservoirs are larger in time with marshes increasing the trapped sediments twofold and the sediments stored in the channels decreasing of 40 we ascribe these larger variations to intense tidal flows that remobilize bottom sediments interestingly the total amount of sediments stored in tidal flats increases in time this is likely due to the larger extent of the flats area in the upper sound some of these tidal flats provide the quiet environment for permanent sediment settling on the contrary tidal flats are almost absent in the rowley river where tidal bars at the side and center of the river represent the most conspicuous landform between msl and 2 m of depth because of the proximity to the river the tidal flow on these bars is strong easily remobilizing the deposited sediment the rivers and deep channels are therefore dynamic transit areas that control sediment remobilization within the estuary feeding the marshes or exporting sediment to the ocean this is particularly true for estuaries and bays characterized by the presence of large tidal channels as in our study site 3 3 factors controlling deposition on marshes and location of ponds the mean values of velocity and water depth on the marsh surface computed with delft3d during marsh submergence are um 0 015 m s and hm 0 197 m the sediment transport length lm on the marsh surface eq 7 is 5 9 m while it becomes 43 5 m using the maximum values of velocity and water depth umax 0 05 m s hmax 0 44 m the maximum and mean flow velocity and inundation depth during marsh flooding are plotted as a function of distance to the marsh edge in fig 7 a and 7b both maximum and mean values decay with distance with flow velocities decreasing more significantly 4 times than inundation depths 2 times using the maximum flow velocity and inundation depth fig 7c well captures the logarithmical decay rate of deposition with distance from the marsh edge the sediment transport length on the marsh lm 43 5 m agrees with the field measurements of temmerman et al 2003 who reported a length of 41 7 m decay coefficient of 0 024 m 1 on average ponds pools accounts for 4 5 of marsh platform from virginia to maine usa correll et al 2018 and those present in the plum island marshes have expanded extensively in recent decades wilson et al 2014 using 3 m resolution map of tidal marsh cover classes by random forest classifier with 90 overall map accuracy correll et al 2018 we calculated the distance of all ponds to the bay or closest channel for the entire plum island sound fig 8 a histogram plot fig 8b of distances indicates that 40 of ponds area are located less than 50 m from channels and 78 within a distance of 100 m this is in agreement with the sediment transport length on the marsh lm 43 5 m and fig 7c showing that deposition is low farther than 100 m from channels 4 discussion salt marshes are fed by sediments coming from rivers sediments resuspended from tidal flats in the sound and sediments fluxes from the ocean a length ratio r smaller than 1 see table 1 indicates that most of the incoming cohesive sediment Ï s 0 5 mm s from the parker rowley and ipswich rivers can be hardly transported into the sound and is trapped in the rivers subdomains four marsh dominated subdomains the upper estuary parker river rowley river and ipswich river can also receive sediment from the sound and sediment coming from the ocean through the inlet can only feed the marshes bordering the rowley and ipswich rivers the upper estuary and parker river can hardly receive sediment from the ocean the timing between river floods wind waves and tidal stage affects sediment trapping if the peak river discharge occurs during the flood phase of the tide more riverine sediments will remain in the system on the contrary if the peak discharge occurs during ebb more sediment will be flushed to the ocean fig 3 similarly sediment resuspended during energetic wave events remain in the system during tidal food but leave the system if the storm occurs during ebb hydrodynamics determine the trapping capacity of each subdomain as showed in fig 9 the trapping capacity of sediment decreases exponentially with increasing non dimensional parameter r in the different subdomains therefore minor variations of r trigger large variations of sediment trapping capacity in the system in plum island sound the salt marshes are currently keeping pace with slr at the expense of total marsh area via edge erosion wilson et al 2014 hopkinson et al 2018 bay enlargement together with slr increase the tidal prism leading to higher water depths and higher tidal velocities within the channels and thus increasing r tidal flats and channels in the bay will therefore trap less sediment flushing more material to the ocean in the long term the flushing effect will result in a net sediment loss for the entire system on the other hand higher water levels and velocities on the marsh platform will also allow the sediment to be deposited further in the marsh kirwan and murray 2007 d alpaos et al al 2007 moreover less deposition in tidal flats and channels could be beneficial for the marshes since there will be more sediment in the water column to feed them the feedback between slr and sediment trapping has therefore a twofold effect an increase in salt marsh resilience in the short term but a net loss of sediment in the long term that might jeopardize the entire intertidal system if the marsh fails to keep up with slr large scale marsh die off might occur morris et al 2002 belliard et al 2016 marsh drowning reduces tidal flow velocity in the marsh channels and limits the amount of sediments transported into the marsh interior which in turn leads to more marsh die off temmerman et al 2012 in this case the trapping capacity of marsh channels will increase because of a smaller r further reducing the flux to the marshes in both marsh dominated and marsh limited subdomains only a small portion of sediments in the water column is transported into the marsh area one possible reason is that our model does not account for wind waves and storms mariotti et al 2010 showed that a 15 m s wind over the virginia coast produces bottom shear stresses comparable to tidal flow on tidal flats more resuspension and longer permanence in the water column result in more deposition further into the marsh interior higher suspended sediment concentration within channels and in the sound c0 in eq 7 supplies more sediments to the marsh platform during flooding lawson et al 2007 mariotti et al 2010 clearly further quantitative analyses are essential to determine the effect of waves on sediment dynamics although in our mesotidal study area the shear stress induced by wind waves is generally one order of magnitude smaller than the shear stress caused by tides fagherazzi et al 2014 temmerman et al 2003 empirically related sedimentation rates to time of tidal inundation and distance to the nearest creek or marsh edge however sediment transport over the marsh platform is physically controlled by sediment properties and hydrodynamics with the latter control less explored field measurements of flow within spartina alterniflora canopies in north carolina found a logarithmical decrease of mean velocity total kinetic energy tke and total suspended solid with distance with 50 reduction of mean velocity and tke within 5 m of the marsh edge leonard and croft 2006 our model shows a similar trend the velocity drops by approximately 50 within 300 m and decreases further with distance fig 7b leonard and croft 2006 also measured an abrupt increase of tke when the mean velocity decreases at the marsh edge in our model the sediment entering the marsh platform is perhaps underestimated because we do not account for the 3d turbulence structure of the flow neglecting the possible wakes forming when the flow initially interacts with the vegetation at the marsh edge in fact the data of leonard and croft 2006 show that horizontal tke dominates advection of sediment in the canopy while vertical turbulence is of secondary importance horstman et al 2013 leonard and croft 2006 the concentration of sediment at the marsh edge and the decay rate determine the spatial distribution of deposition over the marsh platform comparing the regression plot based on model results with the simplified eq 8 we see that the maximum values of water depth and velocity during flood well capture the sediment transport over the marshes fig 7c this is because the maximum velocity umax controls sediment dynamics rather than the mean velocity dyer 1995 in plum island sound wilson et al 2014 attributed the increase in pond occurrence in recent decades to poor drainage density sparse channels are unable to bring sediment to the interior of the marsh thus favoring pond formation and expansion lack of sediment inputs seem more important than waterlogging stress from slr for pond dynamics wilson et al 2014 an increase in organic matter production and deposition could mitigate the lack of sediment inputs to the marsh interior however organic matter accounts for only 30 of the marsh soil in plum island sound hopkinson et al 2018 thus it would be impossible to keep pace with slr without the inorganic fraction similarly mariotti 2016 indicate that inorganic sediment deposition alone controls pond recovery using a simple numerical model our results are in agreement with this hypothesis the low flow velocity on the marsh platform favors sediment deposition near the channels to a distance of 100 m fig 7c farther than that little deposition is present favoring the formation of ponds which indeed are on average 50 m away from channels fig 8 we also note that finer resolution numerical models 1 m would be needed to capture the dynamics of narrow creeks and ditches dissecting the marsh surface ignoring these small scale channels by using a mesh with a 20 m resolution could lead to an overestimation of the distance between marsh and channels 5 conclusions deposition of cohesive sediment within marshes not only provides nutrients for plant growth but also builds land to counteract slr strong friction in the vegetation canopy weakens the tidal flow thus facilitating sediment deposition cohesive sediments are typically transported in tidal channels and deposited on the marsh platform during high slack water the spatial pattern of sedimentation differs for different grain sizes and settling velocities of cohesive sediments as a function of topography and marsh geometry these patterns are very complex and can be hardly understood by field measurements in this manuscript we use a numerical model that solves the shallow water equations coupled to a vegetation module to study the fate of cohesive sediments within a marsh dominated estuary we test a series of scenarios with different instants of sediment release release in specific subdomains and the role of sediment grain size we determine how these scenarios affect the spatial distribution of sedimentation and sediment trapping capacity of the marshes our main results are 1 riverine sediments discharged in the bay during tidal flood will result in more sedimentation within the bay similarly sediments mobilized by storm waves will be trapped in the system if the storm occurs during tidal flood but partly exported to the ocean if the storm occurs during the ebb phase 2 most sediment arriving in marsh dominated areas is trapped there irrespectively of the tidal phase when the sediments was discharged by rivers or resuspended direct exchange of sediments between these areas is very limited sediment discharged from the tidal rivers deposit within the rivers themselves or in adjacent marshes 3 trapping capacity of sediment in different intertidal subdomains decreases exponentially with r the ratio between advection length and the typical spatial length of channels and tidal flats minor variations of r result in large variations in trapping capacity of sediment slr by increasing r could considerably reduce sediment deposition in the system 4 sediment deposition in the mash decreases exponentially with distance from the channels and marsh edge the decay rate is a function of settling velocity and the maximum value of water depth and velocity on the marsh platform 5 only a fraction of the sediments is deposited in the marshes most sediment is deposited in shallow tidal flats and channels areas characterized by low flow this is because sediments are unable to penetrate farther inside the marshes because of the limited water depths and velocities on the marsh platforms acknowledgments this research was funded by the usa national science foundation award 1832221 vcr

are critical in determining marsh vulnerability to slr the possible sources of sediments vary in different systems and most coastal bays may lack riverine sediment inputs in a recent work hopkinson et al 2018 evaluated the sediment budget of plum island sound by comparing lidar data taken in different years they found that marsh edge erosion provides more 30 of the sediment required to counteract slr whereas riverine sediments provide less than 10 this indicates that sediment fluxes from the ocean and from tidal flats should account for more than 50 of the budget it is thus critical to understand the fate of suspended sediments in a salt marsh complex and the trapping capacity of different marsh locations with respect to potential sources of sediments including rivers bays and the coastal ocean understanding the source and fate of sediments within marshes is of paramount importance in determining the future resilience of these ecosystems marshes are able to capture fine cohesive sediments because the thick vegetation reduces flow speed and turbulence allowing the deposition of small particles fagherazzi et al 2012 mehta 2014 however it is difficult to quantify sediment transport dynamics in an estuary due to the complex geometry of the intertidal landscape with dendritic channel networks dissecting salt marshes fagherazzi et al 1999 numerical simulations provide the opportunity to explore sediment trajectories in such a complex environment for example simulations can capture the residence time of sediment particles and tracers in intertidal areas defne et al 2016 mercier and delhez 2007 and tidal rivers ralston and geyer 2017 point field measurements have identified that increasing elevation distance to channels and marsh edges and flow friction due to vegetation canopy affect the spatial distribution of sediment deposition rates on marshes christiansen et al 2000 fagherazzi et al 2012 reed et al 1999 temmerman et al 2005a temmerman et al 2003 proposed an empirical model by relating sedimentation to platform surface elevation distance to nearest channel or marsh edge and distance to marsh edge measured along the nearest creek the model well captured spatial variations of sedimentation over the marsh platform in the scheldt estuary belgium sw netherlands a simplified advection dispersion equation of suspended sediment transport over marshes indicates that settling velocity inundation depth and flow velocity determine the decay rate of sediment concentration along a transect perpendicular to the creek bank or marsh edge fagherazzi et al 2012 but it is not clear whether this simplified model can be applied to a natural system with a complex channel network flow velocities over the marsh platform are relatively small compared to those in the channels and significantly vary in space and time during a tidal cycle for example the peak velocity is one order of magnitude larger than the velocity during high slack water leonard and luther 1995 as a result it is difficult to determine what hydrodynamic conditions are responsible for the advection of sediment in the marsh the role of vegetation in sediment transport dynamics is well captured in recent numerical models the effect of vegetation structures on momentum turbulence and water exchange dynamics nepf and vivoni 2000 is solved in the hydrodynamic models delft3d baptist 2005 temmerman et al 2005b and roms beudin et al 2017 2d and 3d hydrodynamic models have produced excellent results in a variety of vegetated coastal environments ranging from deltaic wetlands nardin and edmonds 2014 donatelli et al 2018 to mangrove forests horstman et al 2015 among these studies it was found that vegetation with intermediate height and density enhances sedimentation in river deltas such as the wax lake delta usa nardin and edmonds 2014 horstman et al 2015 highlighted the sensitivity of tropical shorelines to coupled sediment vegetation dynamics by showing a significant decrease in sediment trapping efficiency driven by loss of mangroves and a reduction in sediment inputs moreover by including vegetation growth and mortality oorschot et al 2016 showed that a dynamic vegetation provides more realistic results in the long term evolution of mangrove shorelines donatelli et al 2018 used the newly developed vegetation model in roms to investigate the impact of seagrass beds on sediment transport dynamics they found that the presence of seagrasses increases the total sediment budget of coastal embayment but reduces the amount of sediment in suspension and delivered to marsh platforms during high tide the vegetation module of the model delft3d was tested in temmerman et al 2005b in this model the momentum drag and turbulence structure induced by the vegetation are solved numerically using the k Îµ turbulence closure sensitive analyses show that a 2d vegetation model can also be used to reduce computational cost without a significant loss in accuracy despite the absence of three dimensional turbulence horstman et al 2013 in this manuscript we have applied the 2d delft3d flow mor model with the vegetation module to plum island sound massachusetts usa a mesotidal bay dominated by salt marshes fig 1 the bay hosts the plum island ecosystems of long term ecological research program pie lter the goal of this work is to determine the fate of cohesive sediments in the system specifically we will explore the sediment trapping capacity of different marsh subdomains by releasing sediments at different locations at different instants within the tidal cycle and with sediment grain sizes ranging from clay to silt furthermore characteristic scales of sediment deposition and factors controlling suspended sediment transport over the marsh platform are analyzed in order to clarify the mechanisms 2 methods 2 1 study area plum island sound fig 1 is a coastal plain bar built estuary with extensive areas of productive tidal marshes dominated by spartina alterniflora and spartina patens the estuary is located along the northeastern massachusetts shoreline and is fed by the ipswich rowley and parker rivers the tide is semi diurnal with a mean range of 2 6 m an inlet connects the sound to the atlantic ocean fagherazzi et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 because of the relatively high tidal energy the tide induced bed shear stresses are larger than the wind wave stresses except during extreme storms fagherazzi et al 2014 the bathymetry of the estuary is characterized by extensive tidal flats and a deep more than 5 m central channel fagherazzi et al 2014 we define marsh the area between 0 09 m mean sea level in navd88 and 1 453 m mhhw upland the area higher than 1 453 m wilson et al 2014 marshes account for 60 of the estuary surface fig 2 a in addition in order to determine the exchange of sediment across different parts of the estuary the system is divided in eight subdomains named upper estuary parker river rowley river ipswich river upper sound lower sound inlet and ocean fig 2b 2 2 numerical model setup we use the delft3d model coupled to the 2dh vegetation module to simulate tidal flow

see location 1 in fig 1 the daily averaged flow discharge data of the parker 1 m3 s and ipswich rivers 5 m3 s are available at usgs gauges 01101000 01102000 while that of rowley river 0 2 m3 s is obtained by scaling the ipswich river discharge to the watershed area fagherazzi et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 although previous work highlights the contribution of saline water from plum island sound to the merrimack river the yearly daily averaged flow discharge recorded at the usgs gauge 424752070491701 tpk bridge see location 3 in fig 1 is 3 7 m3 s being ignorable compared to tidal prism 6 37 107

for the ocean rivers and main tidal channels 40 m1 2 s 1 for the tidal creeks and 35 m1 2 s 1 for the marsh platform the 2dh vegetation module uses the directed point model dpm and the vegetation drag effects on the momentum equations are solved based on baptist 2005 specifically a term 1 2 Î» u v 2 is included within the momentum equation to account for the flow resistance due to vegetation where

main fractions of cohesive sediments are tested based on field observations namely a coarse silt with grain size 32 64 Âµm and settling velocity of 3 6 mm s 1 and a clay fraction with grain size less than 32 Âµm with a settling velocity of 0 5 mm s 1 wiberg et al 2015 erosion e and deposition d of cohesive sediments in delft3d are calculated with the partheniades krone equations partheniades 1965

cohesive sediments we adopt the same parameters used in delft3d simulations for the virginia coast reserve a similar system of intertidal bays along the eastern shore of virginia wiberg et al 2015 Ï e is set to 0 05 n m 2 m to 1 10 5 kg m 2 s 1 and the dry bed density to 795 kg m 3 note that in this study we are not considering the possible coarser material sand present at the channel bottoms but only the fine material that is exchanged between channels and salt marsh platform from 1994 to 2015 water samples along the plum island estuary from the parker river dam to the mouth of the sound were collected within 2 h of either high tide or low tide in the spring and fall seasons the median value of 13 year suspended sediment concentration along the transect peaks approximately at 40 mg l at the mouth of the parker river decreases in the sound and reaches a lower value of 15 mg l at the inlet generally the concentration is higher in the spring when river discharge is high hopkinson et al 2018 an initial suspended sediment concentration of 30 mg l was released in different subdomains at different instants of the tidal cycle the bottom elevation was maintained fixed during the simulations to maintain model stability even with parallel computing we set the time step to be 0 3 min 2 3 numerical simulations we release a depth averaged suspended sediment concentration of 30 mg l in the water area of the subdomains 1 to 7 see fig 2 the suspended sediment was released at four different instants during a spring tidal cycle at high water level sh mean water level during ebb me low water level sl and mean water level during flood mf the physical parameters of the cohesive sediment were kept uniform with a settling velocity of 0 5 mm s 1 and a critical shear stress for erosion of 0 05 n m 2 since in all scenarios the suspended sediment mass in the water column after 1 month is negligible we only measured the sediment mass deposited at the bottom of the different subdomains to determine the role of different intertidal geometries on sediment transport dynamics we choose the rowley river as a representative marsh dominated area and the upper sound as an intertidal area with limited marsh we determine the distribution of deposited cohesive sediments after one month as a function of water depth in three landforms salt marshes elevation between 0 09 and 2 m tidal flats elevation between 0 09 and 2 m and deep channels elevation below 2 m for every marsh cell we calculate the minimum distance to the tidal flats channels as well as the averaged values of both maximum and mean flow velocity and inundation depth during marsh flooding 2 4 characteristic scales of sediment deposition the dynamics of sediment deposition is controlled by advection and setting of sediment advection depends on the average velocity of the tidal flow u while settling depends on water depth h and settling velocity Ï s we define a sediment transport length l0 as the distance a sediment particle travels before depositing 5 l 0 u h Ï s we define the non dimensional parameter r as the ratio between the sediment transport length l0 and the characteristic spatial dimension of a reference area l 6 r l 0 l if r 1 the sediment is likely to leave the reference area while if r 1 the sediment is trapped in it the values of the dimensional scales are reported in table 1 for all the subdomains of the estuary fig 2b following fagherazzi et al 2012 we examine the deposition rate on the marsh platform using the advection equation 7 c c 0 exp x l m where c is the suspended sediment concentration along a transect perpendicular to the marsh boundary kg m3 c0 is the concentration at the boundary between marsh and channel tidal flat lm umhm Ï s is the sediment transport length on the marsh um and hm are the average velocity m s and water depth m on the marsh platform during flooding x is distance from the marsh edge m the deposition rate is computed as the divergence of the sediment flux 8 d d c u m h m dx c Ï s exp x l m where d indicates deposition rate kg m2 s eqs 7 and 8 are evaluated for the entire marsh area computing the distance from the edge of each marsh point and utilizing the average value of velocity and water depth on the marsh platform computed with delft3d 3 results 3 1 sediment trapping capacity a dependency matrix shows the distribution of trapped sediment across the estuary fig 3 the diagonal elements indicate the fraction of sediment that deposits in the same subdomain where it was released the off diagonal elements record the sediment deposited in a subdomain different from the one of the initial release in the upper estuary parker river rowley river and ipswich river most sediments are deposited in the release area irrespectively of the timing of release in the lower sound and inlet domains the strong tidal currents resuspend and transport the cohesive sediments to low energy areas generally a large fraction of the sediments released in the rivers is kept in the estuary with an exception of the ipswich river because of its proximity to the inlet and the strong currents in the lower part of the sound the differences among the four matrixes reported in fig 3 highlight the role of the timing of release in the sediment trapping efficiency within the estuary the trapping efficiency is high in the mf case mean water level during flood since more sediment is transported landward during flood and then deposits in low energy areas on the contrary if released during ebb me more sediment is flushed out of the system as expected a large fraction of the sediment is exchanged between the upper and lower sound and more sediment deposits in the upper sound when released in the lower sound during flood the direct sediment exchange among the four marsh dominated subdomains the upper estuary parker river rowley river and ipswich river is very limited and only occurs through the sound no cohesive sediment released at the inlet remains there but it is either discharged to the ocean or trapped in the tidal reaches and marshes of the rowley and ipswich rivers hardly any sediment released at the inlet reaches the parker river and upper estuary even in the flood scenario 3 2 sediment exchange processes and mechanisms we then explore whether sediments are preferentially deposited in quiet areas experiencing low tidal velocities and low bottom shear stresses high tidal flow can in fact resuspend sediments and move them in areas where the velocity is lower for example in salt marshes and shallow tidal flats our results show that this is not always the case fig 4 a and the sediments are prevalently deposited in areas experiencing intermediate bottom shear stresses similarly sediments are mostly deposited at water depth between 0 and 2 m typical of tidal flats and tidal bars and not at water depths above mean sea level typical of salt marshes fig 4b the results of fig 4b are in agreements with the results of fig 4a since tidal bars and flats experience intermediate bottom shear stresses while marshes are characterized by very low shear stresses these results indicate that sediment availability and sediment pathways are also important and that only a small fraction of sediment is reaching the marsh platform this is partly due to the fact that at time zero the sediments are not released on the marsh platform but only in areas covered with water at mean sea level tidal channels and tidal flats the likely sources of sediment yet the fact that a small fraction of sediment reaches the marsh platform seems counterintuitive and it is an important result within the rowley river area clay Ï s 0 5 mm s is mostly deposited in the marshes and tidal flats deposition of coarse silt Ï s 3 6 mm s follows the same distribution with a slight shift toward lower areas in the upper sound a larger fraction of both mud and coarse silt is transferred into deep channels with less sediment deposited on the marshes fig 5 we also find that the distribution of deposited sediments is controlled more by the physical attributes of each area i e presence of salt marshes rather than by the grain size and settling velocity the distributions of deposited sediment as a function of water depth display peaks in the marsh area elevations around 1 3 m and in the tidal flats which correspond to the larger area fractions showed in fig 5b high values of bottom shear stress hinder the deposition of cohesive sediment in the rivers and large tidal channels as a result sediments that reach these channels are transported to either shallow areas or to the ocean sediment released in the rowley river is deposited mostly in tidal flats and salt marshes while a smaller fraction is deposited in the tidal channels or exported to the ocean fig 6 a in time the volume of sediments deposited on the marsh increases collecting sediments resuspended in tidal flats and channels note that the amount of sediments gained by marshes is higher than the sediment lost by tidal flats indicating that channels actively feed the marsh surface channels also contribute to the export of sediment to the ocean overall most sediments are deposited within hours after the release and moderate variations occur because of resuspension because tidal flats and deep channels have a similar area in the upper sound at the beginning of the simulation an equal amount of mud is deposited on these two landforms fig 6b similarly to the rowley river case the sediment deposited in the deep channels decreases while it increases on the marshes and tidal flats over time and some of these sediments are also exported to the ocean in the upper sound changes in the sediment reservoirs are larger in time with marshes increasing the trapped sediments twofold and the sediments stored in the channels decreasing of 40 we ascribe these larger variations to intense tidal flows that remobilize bottom sediments interestingly the total amount of sediments stored in tidal flats increases in time this is likely due to the larger extent of the flats area in the upper sound some of these tidal flats provide the quiet environment for permanent sediment settling on the contrary tidal flats are almost absent in the rowley river where tidal bars at the side and center of the river represent the most conspicuous landform between msl and 2 m of depth because of the proximity to the river the tidal flow on these bars is strong easily remobilizing the deposited sediment the rivers and deep channels are therefore dynamic transit areas that control sediment remobilization within the estuary feeding the marshes or exporting sediment to the ocean this is particularly true for estuaries and bays characterized by the presence of large tidal channels as in our study site 3 3 factors controlling deposition on marshes and location of ponds the mean values of velocity and water depth on the marsh surface computed with delft3d during marsh submergence are um 0 015 m s and hm 0 197 m the sediment transport length lm on the marsh surface eq 7 is 5 9 m while it becomes 43 5 m using the maximum values of velocity and water depth umax 0 05 m s hmax 0 44 m the maximum and mean flow velocity and inundation depth during marsh flooding are plotted as a function of distance to the marsh edge in fig 7 a and 7b both maximum and mean values decay with distance with flow velocities decreasing more significantly 4 times than inundation depths 2 times using the maximum flow velocity and inundation depth fig 7c well captures the logarithmical decay rate of deposition with distance from the marsh edge the sediment transport length on the marsh lm 43 5 m agrees with the field measurements of temmerman et al 2003 who reported a length of 41 7 m decay coefficient of 0 024 m 1 on average ponds pools accounts for 4 5 of marsh platform from virginia to maine usa correll et al 2018 and those present in the plum island marshes have expanded extensively in recent decades wilson et al 2014 using 3 m resolution map of tidal marsh cover classes by random forest classifier with 90 overall map accuracy correll et al 2018 we calculated the distance of all ponds to the bay or closest channel for the entire plum island sound fig 8 a histogram plot fig 8b of distances indicates that 40 of ponds area are located less than 50 m from channels and 78 within a distance of 100 m this is in agreement with the sediment transport length on the marsh lm 43 5 m and fig 7c showing that deposition is low farther than 100 m from channels 4 discussion salt marshes are fed by sediments coming from rivers sediments resuspended from tidal flats in the sound and sediments fluxes from the ocean a length ratio r smaller than 1 see table 1 indicates that most of the incoming cohesive sediment Ï s 0 5 mm s from the parker rowley and ipswich rivers can be hardly transported into the sound and is trapped in the rivers subdomains four marsh dominated subdomains the upper estuary parker river rowley river and ipswich river can also receive sediment from the sound and sediment coming from the ocean through the inlet can only feed the marshes bordering the rowley and ipswich rivers the upper estuary and parker river can hardly receive sediment from the ocean the timing between river floods wind waves and tidal stage affects sediment trapping if the peak river discharge occurs during the flood phase of the tide more riverine sediments will remain in the system on the contrary if the peak discharge occurs during ebb more sediment will be flushed to the ocean fig 3 similarly sediment resuspended during energetic wave events remain in the system during tidal food but leave the system if the storm occurs during ebb hydrodynamics determine the trapping capacity of each subdomain as showed in fig 9 the trapping capacity of sediment decreases exponentially with increasing non dimensional parameter r in the different subdomains therefore minor variations of r trigger large variations of sediment trapping capacity in the system in plum island sound the salt marshes are currently keeping pace with slr at the expense of total marsh area via edge erosion wilson et al 2014 hopkinson et al 2018 bay enlargement together with slr increase the tidal prism leading to higher water depths and higher tidal velocities within the channels and thus increasing r tidal flats and channels in the bay will therefore trap less sediment flushing more material to the ocean in the long term the flushing effect will result in a net sediment loss for the entire system on the other hand higher water levels and velocities on the marsh platform will also allow the sediment to be deposited further in the marsh kirwan and murray 2007 d alpaos et al al 2007 moreover less deposition in tidal flats and channels could be beneficial for the marshes since there will be more sediment in the water column to feed them the feedback between slr and sediment trapping has therefore a twofold effect an increase in salt marsh resilience in the short term but a net loss of sediment in the long term that might jeopardize the entire intertidal system if the marsh fails to keep up with slr large scale marsh die off might occur morris et al 2002 belliard et al 2016 marsh drowning reduces tidal flow velocity in the marsh channels and limits the amount of sediments transported into the marsh interior which in turn leads to more marsh die off temmerman et al 2012 in this case the trapping capacity of marsh channels will increase because of a smaller r further reducing the flux to the marshes in both marsh dominated and marsh limited subdomains only a small portion of sediments in the water column is transported into the marsh area one possible reason is that our model does not account for wind waves and storms mariotti et al 2010 showed that a 15 m s wind over the virginia coast produces bottom shear stresses comparable to tidal flow on tidal flats more resuspension and longer permanence in the water column result in more deposition further into the marsh interior higher suspended sediment concentration within channels and in the sound c0 in eq 7 supplies more sediments to the marsh platform during flooding lawson et al 2007 mariotti et al 2010 clearly further quantitative analyses are essential to determine the effect of waves on sediment dynamics although in our mesotidal study area the shear stress induced by wind waves is generally one order of magnitude smaller than the shear stress caused by tides fagherazzi et al 2014 temmerman et al 2003 empirically related sedimentation rates to time of tidal inundation and distance to the nearest creek or marsh edge however sediment transport over the marsh platform is physically controlled by sediment properties and hydrodynamics with the latter control less explored field measurements of flow within spartina alterniflora canopies in north carolina found a logarithmical decrease of mean velocity total kinetic energy tke and total suspended solid with distance with 50 reduction of mean velocity and tke within 5 m of the marsh edge leonard and croft 2006 our model shows a similar trend the velocity drops by approximately 50 within 300 m and decreases further with distance fig 7b leonard and croft 2006 also measured an abrupt increase of tke when the mean velocity decreases at the marsh edge in our model the sediment entering the marsh platform is perhaps underestimated because we do not account for the 3d turbulence structure of the flow neglecting the possible wakes forming when the flow initially interacts with the vegetation at the marsh edge in fact the data of leonard and croft 2006 show that horizontal tke dominates advection of sediment in the canopy while vertical turbulence is of secondary importance horstman et al 2013 leonard and croft 2006 the concentration of sediment at the marsh edge and the decay rate determine the spatial distribution of deposition over the marsh platform comparing the regression plot based on model results with the simplified eq 8 we see that the maximum values of water depth and velocity during flood well capture the sediment transport over the marshes fig 7c this is because the maximum velocity umax controls sediment dynamics rather than the mean velocity dyer 1995 in plum island sound wilson et al 2014 attributed the increase in pond occurrence in recent decades to poor drainage density sparse channels are unable to bring sediment to the interior of the marsh thus favoring pond formation and expansion lack of sediment inputs seem more important than waterlogging stress from slr for pond dynamics wilson et al 2014 an increase in organic matter production and deposition could mitigate the lack of sediment inputs to the marsh interior however organic matter accounts for only 30 of the marsh soil in plum island sound hopkinson et al 2018 thus it would be impossible to keep pace with slr without the inorganic fraction similarly mariotti 2016 indicate that inorganic sediment deposition alone controls pond recovery using a simple numerical model our results are in agreement with this hypothesis the low flow velocity on the marsh platform favors sediment deposition near the channels to a distance of 100 m fig 7c farther than that little deposition is present favoring the formation of ponds which indeed are on average 50 m away from channels fig 8 we also note that finer resolution numerical models 1 m would be needed to capture the dynamics of narrow creeks and ditches dissecting the marsh surface ignoring these small scale channels by using a mesh with a 20 m resolution could lead to an overestimation of the distance between marsh and channels 5 conclusions deposition of cohesive sediment within marshes not only provides nutrients for plant growth but also builds land to counteract slr strong friction in the vegetation canopy weakens the tidal flow thus facilitating sediment deposition cohesive sediments are typically transported in tidal channels and deposited on the marsh platform during high slack water the spatial pattern of sedimentation differs for different grain sizes and settling velocities of cohesive sediments as a function of topography and marsh geometry these patterns are very complex and can be hardly understood by field measurements in this manuscript we use a numerical model that solves the shallow water equations coupled to a vegetation module to study the fate of cohesive sediments within a marsh dominated estuary we test a series of scenarios with different instants of sediment release release in specific subdomains and the role of sediment grain size we determine how these scenarios affect the spatial distribution of sedimentation and sediment trapping capacity of the marshes our main results are 1 riverine sediments discharged in the bay during tidal flood will result in more sedimentation within the bay similarly sediments mobilized by storm waves will be trapped in the system if the storm occurs during tidal flood but partly exported to the ocean if the storm occurs during the ebb phase 2 most sediment arriving in marsh dominated areas is trapped there irrespectively of the tidal phase when the sediments was discharged by rivers or resuspended direct exchange of sediments between these areas is very limited sediment discharged from the tidal rivers deposit within the rivers themselves or in adjacent marshes 3 trapping capacity of sediment in different intertidal subdomains decreases exponentially with r the ratio between advection length and the typical spatial length of channels and tidal flats minor variations of r result in large variations in trapping capacity of sediment slr by increasing r could considerably reduce sediment deposition in the system 4 sediment deposition in the mash decreases exponentially with distance from the channels and marsh edge the decay rate is a function of settling velocity and the maximum value of water depth and velocity on the marsh platform 5 only a fraction of the sediments is deposited in the marshes most sediment is deposited in shallow tidal flats and channels areas characterized by low flow this is because sediments are unable to penetrate farther inside the marshes because of the limited water depths and velocities on the marsh platforms acknowledgments this research was funded by the usa national science foundation award 1832221 vcr

696,groundwater resource management often requires detailed numerical models that make calibration and predictive uncertainty analysis computationally challenging reduced order models roms alleviate the computational burden but can potentially lead to predictive bias and underestimation of uncertainty a paired model approach has previously been proposed to estimate the predictive uncertainty of models compared to highly complex synthetic realities this approach is modified to analyze and compare the simplification error for groundwater predictions of a real world numerical modflow model of the wairau plains aquifer in the marlborough region of new zealand two different rom types were applied in this study to predict groundwater heads spring discharge and river groundwater exchange fluxes 1 a drastically simplified modflow model and 2 artificial neural networks anns the different roms exhibit very different patterns of bias and magnitude of model simplification error the method accurately captures the simplification error for most predictions by the modflow model but underestimates the error for predictions highly dependent on the variability of the complex model the simplified modflow model shows significant parameter surrogacy and non optimality of simplification thus questioning the adherence to expert knowledge based parameter limits for predictions where historic data sets are available anns provide superior predictive power however they cannot be applied to predictions of data types and locations not contained in the calibration data set for those predictions simplified numerical models can be applied with varying degree of accuracy keywords model reduction paired model analysis predictive simplification error regional groundwater modeling 1 introduction modern groundwater management is often supported by the application of groundwater models these models integrate available system knowledge e g measurements of system states and expert information and are used to predict system states under different future settings differences in modeling approaches are accompanied by a large diversity in model complexity input data size and model run time among other factors typically complex physically based models are required to represent the spatial variability of coupled groundwater flow processes and to incorporate existing knowledge unfortunately with increasing complexity these models become arduous to handle due to large run times and problems of numerical stability this vastly restricts the model s applicability for model calibration and uncertainty analysis a common solution to this problem is model simplification different approaches to generate reduced order models roms have been developed and applied in the past decades three categories of model reduction are most common in groundwater modeling data driven methods projection based methods and upscaling methods data driven methods such as bayesian networks fienen et al 2013 artificial neural networks taormina et al 2012 or some types of polynomial chaos expansion oladyshkin and nowak 2012 result in very fast simple models that reproduce data time series relying only on few input data sources due to their black box character they are limited in their applicability to data types and locations contained in the training data set and do not incorporate any system knowledge or underlying physical principles projection based methods such as proper orthogonal decomposition pod e g boyce et al 2015 siade et al 2012 ushijima and yeh 2015 retain the physical properties of the full model while speeding up run times by solving the model equations in a subspace computed off line from full model simulations recent studies tried to tackle the method s limitations regarding model non linearity stanko et al 2016 and boundary representation gosses et al 2018 but applications of pod are still hampered by its complexity in setup which usually necessitates altering source code of the applied modeling tools to access the model equation systems lastly upscaling methods e g dagan et al 2013 von gunten et al 2014 wood 2009 employ grid coarsening and or homogenized parameterization to reduce computational times but are limited by a lack of system detail in conclusion model simplification tackles the issues of long run times and numerical instability with a variety of different methods which all come at some costs a possible solution to the complementary problems of simple and complex models is a paired model approach where the rom is calibrated against outputs of the complex model lÃ¸dÃ¸en and tjelmeland 2010 and scheidt et al 2011 applied such methods in the field of reservoir modeling for petroleum in groundwater doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 developed a paired model approach to reduce predictive bias and for uncertainty analysis they analyzed performance and shortcomings of synthetic groundwater models in comparison to virtual realities they successfully computed predictive bias and uncertainty and gained insights into causes of uncertainty and the shortcomings of model parameterizations however they applied their paired model analysis only to synthetic models as a proof of concept furthermore the simplified models used in their studies are mainly simplifications of the complex model in the computational grid and the model parameters thus considering only a small portion of possible roms in their analysis in this study we apply the methodology developed by doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 to an existing complex model of a real world aquifer instead of a virtual reality this distinction allows us to assess the predictive simplification error of the simple model and test it against a the simulation results of the calibrated complex model and b real world data pertaining to some of the model predictions furthermore we use two distinctly different roms in the study a simplified physically based modflow model and a collection of anns as application of very fast data driven black box models this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we summarize the underlying subspace theory of the paired model approach here we also describe the extension of the methodology to test the roms against the calibrated complex model and real world data section 3 outlines the case study of the wairau plain aquifer the complex model and both rom types as well as the predictions used in the paired model analysis section 4 presents the results of the study the findings are discussed and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 concepts and theory this study utilizes a paired simple complex model approach first presented by doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 to study the simplification error associated with using roms for predictions in real world groundwater system since we use this method in a slightly different context and extend it to real world data we will first outline the differences to the original method here the main assumptions and differences between the original approach and our methodology is summarized in fig 1 doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 postulate that their complex models are equal to reality outputs of these complex models are deemed to be free of bias and or error this allows them to analyze the total predictive uncertainty of their simple model predictions with the paired model approach furthermore they can treat actual field data sets as another potential complex model output and use it for bias correction in contrast the complex model presented in this paper is considered to be an imperfect representation of reality as all models are by definition while it is built to accommodate all available system knowledge and calibrated thoroughly its outputs are subject to mostly unknown bias and or error the paired model approach presented here can only analyze bias and error between the complex and simple models this is therefore not the total predictive uncertainty but will be called simplification error instead due to this definition the bias correction has to be undertaken on basis of the calibrated complex model output instead of actual measurements differing conceptually from the original approach real world observations can be used here to estimate the prediction specific error between complex model and reality the underlying concepts of the paired model analysis are based on the assumptions of model linearization the non linearity present in most complex groundwater models effects the results of the analysis but poses no restriction to the applicability of the method presented in the following 2 1 linear models solution space and null space let the following equation denote a linear model 1 h zk É where the vector h represents the calibration data set k is a vector of model parameters the matrix z denotes the action of the model under calibration condition and the vector Îµ describes random measurement noise we define the vector k as the set of model parameters that produce a sufficiently calibrated model in linear algebra a matrix z has a null space if the following equation is true for a non zero vector k n 2 0 z k n this is usually true for every linearized form of a complex spatially explicit groundwater model combining eqs 1 and 2 and introducing a calibrated parameter set k gives 3 h z k k n É since there are typically multiple non zero vectors k n eq 3 illustrates the problem of non uniqueness in solving the inverse model problem that is well known to groundwater modelers for the concepts described in the following it is important to note that the solution space component of the parameter vector k can be inferred from the calibration data set h through the model while the null space component k n can not 2 2 model simplification concept and calibration in this section model simplification is described by an omission of model parameters from the complex model note that in this definition parameter omission can also represent omission of processes in the simple model this leads to the definition of 4 k k s k o where k s describe the simple model parameters and k o are the omitted parameters combining eq 4 with eq 1 gives 5 h zk É z s z o k s k o É z s k s z o k o É where z s and z o denote portions of the system matrix z pertaining to k s and k o respectively we now assume that eq 2 also holds for z s i e that the parameter solution of the simple model is also non unique for the methodology presented here it is assumed that the parameter estimation for k s is performed using principal component regression pcr mandel 1982 often referred to simply as singular value decomposition svd in groundwater literature this does not necessarily have to be the chosen method for solving the inverse problem and was not used for the model presented here but is useful here to understand the concepts described below singular value decomposition of z s is written as 6 z s us v t where s holds the singular values of z s and u and v the left and right singular vectors which are orthonormal eigenvectors of z s z s t or z s t z s respectively v s and u are partitioned into their solution space v 1 s 1 and u 1 and null space v 2 s 2 and u 2 counterparts c f aster et al 2011 for details thus the calibrated simple model parameter set k s is given as 7 k s v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t h v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É from eq 7 the calibrated complex model parameter set is written as 8 k k s k o v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 h v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 É note that the 0 s on the right hand side do not imply that k o 0 but only that calibration of the simple model can not be used to infer the omitted parameters k o combining eq 8 with eq 5 leads to 9 k k s k o v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 z s z o k s k o v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 É eq 9 eq 11 in doherty and christensen 2011 shows the definition of the calibrated complex model parameter set k in regard to the complex model solution space v 1 s 1 and u 1 and the partitioned system matrix z s z o it is used as a basis for the analysis between simple and complex model parameters in the following section 2 3 2 3 the relationship between simple and complex model parameters it is desirable that much of the parameter detail of the complex model that can be explained by the data is retained in the parameter set of the simple model as it is typically not the case that the parameters themselves are kept in the simple model because often model simplification means parameter number reduction we need to analyze how much of the parameter detail is retained in the simple model to analyze the relationship between simple and complex model parameters we disregard measurement noise note that this is done only for ease of understanding and that the presence of measurement noise does not invalidate the following analysis eq 9 is rewritten to solve for the calibrated simple model parameter set k s as 10 k s v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z s k s z o k o combining eq 10 with eq 6 results in 11 k s v 1 v 1 t k s v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o from eq 11 it becomes obvious that a calibrated simple parameter is usually composed of two parts the first term on the right hand side of eq 11 is the projection of the simple model parameter set k s onto its solution space while the second term is dependent on the omitted complex parameter set k o the second term is called parameter surrogacy where the simple model parameter is not only made up by a physical property a hydraulic conductivity zone value for example represented by the first term but also can represent certain aspects of omitted complex parameters hydraulic conductivity from another area or storage values for example to analyze this further we adapt eq 22 from watson et al 2013 to our definition of an imperfect complex model let us start with the following equation that denotes the fitting of the simple model parameters k s against the output of the complex model o by linear regression equivalent to the first term of the right hand side of eq 22 in watson et al 2013 12 k s z s t z s 1 z s t o we can substitute the complex model by adapting eq 1 substituting h by o and ignoring measurement noise into eq 12 to get the second term of the right hand side of eq 22 in watson et al 2013 13 k s z s t z s 1 z s t zk by defining k s lk eq 20 in watson et al 2013 and eq 13 we arrive at 14 l z s t z s 1 z s t z this l matrix relates the simple model parameter space k s to the complex model parameter space k it allows the investigation of the influence of different complex model parameters onto simple model parameters and is thus a way to reveal the influence of parameter surrogacy contained in the simple model parameters 2 4 components of simplification error for rom predictions making predictions of future and or unknown system states is a crucial part in environmental modeling and concomitant with this is the analysis of uncertainty associated to predictions a prediction is denoted in the linear model approach as 15 s y t k where s is a scalar describing the prediction and the vector y defines the sensitivities of the prediction to the model parameters k separating this equation into simple and omitted parameter components we get 16 s y s t k s y o t k o if we now postulate that a prediction made by the calibrated simple model s is written as 17 s y s t k s then the error of the simple model prediction in comparison to the complex model prediction is defined as 18 s s y s t k s y s t k s y o t k o combining eq 18 with eq 7 while again ignoring measurement noise Îµ for clarity we get 19 s s y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t h y s t k s y o t k o we can now substitute eq 5 into eq 19 and simplify utilizing to the orthonormality of v to get to 20 s s y s t i v 1 v 1 t k s y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É y o t k o finally we can rearrange eq 20 and utilize the relationship v 1 v 1 t v 2 v 2 t i aster et al 2011 to describe the simplification error of the model prediction see doherty and christensen 2011 for more details 21 s s y s t v 2 v 2 t k s y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o y o t k o term 0 term 1 term 2 term 3 term 4 in other words eq 21 eq 36 in doherty and christensen 2011 defines the complex model prediction by the composition of the prediction of the calibrated simple model term 0 and four terms terms 1 4 describing the difference between the two predictions the different contributions to the simplification error of the prediction and their implications are best evaluated by analyzing a s versus s scatter plot again summarizing doherty and christensen 2011 assume that a number of complex model realizations i 1 n were randomly generated each resulting in a set of complex model parameters k i the complex model is run not calibrated one time with each of these parameter sets to generate a corresponding complex model output vector o i to this output o i random measurement error Îµ i is added to incorporate the influence of term 2 of eq 21 now the simple model is calibrated against each of the n complex model outputs o i É i to derive a simple model parameter set k s i associated with each complex model parameter set k i for each of these n parameter pairs we compute the prediction of interest thus obtaining the complex model prediction si and the simple model prediction s i as this was done for n model pairs we then compose a scatter plot of s versus s as schematically depicted in fig 2 a this is the basis for the paired model analysis described in section 2 5 1 to better associate the different features of these scatter plots with the different terms of eq 21 their influence on the shape of the scatter plot is analyzed individually again a detailed description can be found in doherty and christensen 2011 and is only partially repeated here to provide the context necessary for the evaluation of the study s results if the simple model is a perfect representation of the complex model eq 21 would simplify to s s thus yielding a scatter plot of points perfectly forming a line of slope 1 with intercept 0 therefore the different contributions of model simplification error result in a deviation of points from this line term 1 of eq 21 y s t v 2 v 2 t k s denotes the influence of the null space onto the simplification error the null space of the simple model does not affect the simple model prediction s by definition thus causing the vertical scatter in the plot due to its influence on the complex model prediction s term 2 of eq 21 y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É constitutes the influence of the measurement error Îµ as the measurement error only pertains to the simple model calibrated against complex model outputs with the addition of random but predefined measurement error this leads to horizontal scatter affecting s and not s term 3 of eq 21 y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o is the representation of parameter surrogacy see eq 11 and its explanation this contribution of parameters and processes that are not represented in the simple model parameters only affects the simple model prediction s as the complex model prediction s depends on the full parameter set therefore causing horizontal scatter finally term 4 of eq 21 y o t k o is the influence of the omitted complex model parameter detail on the predictive error thus it only acts upon s and not s which results in vertical scatter in summary a perfect simple model would result in si s i points perfectly sitting on a line with slope 1 and intercept 0 measurement error in calibration of the simple model and the effects of parameter surrogacy lead to horizontal scatter around this line furthermore vertical scatter can originate from null space contribution and the influence of the omitted parameters and processes note that the extent of vertical scatter denotes the simplification error of the model prediction here while in doherty and christensen 2011 it signifies the total postcalibration uncertainty of the simple model prediction because they assume that the complex model is reality further discussion of the pattern of the scatter plots can be found in section 2 5 2 as well as in sections 4 and 5 2 5 paired simple complex model analysis 2 5 1 methodology in this section we briefly summarize the methodology for the paired model analysis that applies the theoretical concepts detailed in section 2 4 in this study the methodology was first presented in doherty and christensen 2011 and is extended here to accommodate the changes in methodology presented at the beginning of section 2 the individual steps of the methodology are as follows 1 create a complex model z with the parameter set k of the system of interest incorporating all available system knowledge in process representation and parameterization 2 construct n different model parameter sets k i for i 1 n and run the model for each of these parameter realizations these complex model parameter realizations k i should represent the unknown variability of the different parameters and thus be random in nature but the statistics such as type of distribution mean and standard deviation etc should be informed by the data or expert knowledge about the system for each of these n random model runs the output o i is recorded 3 build a simple model z s that represents a simplified version of the system under study and runs fast enough to allow stochastic simulation 4 calibrate the simple model z s against each of the outputs of the complex model z corrupted with appropriate measurement errors o i É i thus a calibrated simple model realization is obtained for each random complex model realization 5 calculate the individual model predictions s i j and s i j for both the complex and the simple model realizations and all j 1 m different predictions 6 create a scatter plot of simple model predictions s i j versus complex model predictions s i j for each prediction j a linear regression line s a s b is fitted to the si s i pairs for each jth prediction and added to the plot obviously any other function could be used instead of a linear regression without loss of generality furthermore standard deviations Ï of the regression are calculated and the corresponding 95 confidence intervals 2Ï assuming normal distribution are added to the scatter plot the confidence intervals are used to discern the contributions to predictive uncertainty by the four terms of eq 21 this is shown in fig 2 a and is discussed in detail in section 2 5 2 7 calibrate the simple model z s using the real world measurement data set h and compute the corresponding model predictions s h 8 use the line of best fit from step 6 to project the real world simple model predictions s h into real world complex model predictions s h thus correcting for potential bias doherty and christensen 2011 end their analysis here as they assume a complex model so big that it can not feasibly be calibrated against the real world data set furthermore their correction of the real world simple model prediction s h via the regression line from step 6 equates the complex model to the synthetic real world this means that they treat the scatter discerned in step 6 as the total predictive uncertainty and the real world measurement data set h is used in steps 7 and 8 as a basis for bias correction in our application while the complex model is deemed to be a reasonable representation of the real world it is imperfect and thus prone to bias and or error then again it is still feasible to calibrate the model furthermore we undertake the scatter plot analysis for some model outputs for which actual real world measurements of the predicted model output are available this real world data corresponding to a prediction h can be used to estimate Îµ cm the prediction specific error between cm and reality therefore we altered and extended the above methodology to incorporate this new definition of the complex model as an error prone simplification of reality diverting after step 6 of the original method by doherty and christensen 2011 note that a thorough analysis of these changes follows in section 2 5 2 7 new calibrate the complex model z against the real world measurement data set h this creates a complex model output o h and calibrated complex model predictions s h 8 new calibrate the simple model z s against the calibrated complex model output o h and compute the corresponding model predictions s o h these predictions are the basis for the simplification error analysis tested via the s o h s h pairs and bias correction which will be explained in detail in section 2 5 2 9 new the line of best fit from step 6 is used to project the predictions s o h of the simple model calibrated against the output o h of the real world calibrated complex model into corresponding simple model predictions s o h corrected for bias by model simplification this is shown in fig 2 b again we differ from the original steps 7 and 8 by correcting s o h and not s h 10 new originally step 7 calibrate the simple model z s against the real world measurement data set h and compute the corresponding model predictions s h 11 new for the j predictions where real world data corresponding to predictions h is available the data pairs of s h j h j are added to the corresponding plots s h j h j gives the discrepancy between the corresponding jth complex model prediction and reality Îµ cm this is shown schematically in fig 2 c table 1 summarizes the notation used for the different predictions made by the complex cm and simple rom model 2 5 2 analysis of the s versus s scatter plot section 2 4 described the theoretical basis for the scatter plots of paired simple complex models while section 2 5 1 outlined the application of this theory as the resulting scatter plots are a major part of the analysis presented in this paper we provide a detailed explanation of the different features and the information contained in such scatter plots in this section the first part is based on doherty and christensen 2011 and is therefore only summarized here the second part explains the changes and extensions of our approach that are listed in section 2 5 1 in more detail fig 2 a shows a schematic scatter plot of simple model predictions s versus complex model predictions s obtained by calibration of the simple model against n randomly parameterized complex model outputs that were corrupted by white noise to represent measurement error labeled exemplarily for realization i in addition it depicts the regression line of the scatter it is 95 uncertainty bands and the reduction based predictive error contributions steps 1 6 in section 2 5 1 in general the form and range of scatter points within the uncertainty bands and the slope and intercept of the regression line are very informative the relationship between simple and complex model predictions is fitted by linear regression from which we calculate the slope a and intercept b of the regression line the intercept b denotes the bias of the rom prediction in comparison to the complex model prediction that needs to be added or subtracted for correction of the prediction the slope a can deviate from an ideal slope of 1 in two directions if a 1 the total horizontal extent of the scatter points is larger than the vertical scatter which means that rom predictions are more variable than random complex model predictions this indicates that the propensity of predictive error was actually increased through calibration of the simple model compared to the random uncalibrated complex model doherty and christensen 2011 if instead a 1 the total horizontal scatter is smaller than the total vertical scatter and thus the random complex model predictions are more variable than the rom predictions this would mean that the rom can not reproduce all possible predictive outcomes of the complex model which might be an indication of over fitting to the calibration data set or of missing process detail in the rom as outlined in section 2 4 the horizontal scatter around the line of regression is composed of the contributions of terms 2 and 3 of eq 21 to the simplification error of a simple model prediction s the influence of measurement noise labeled Îµ noise in fig 2 a which is equal to term 2 and the effect of parameter surrogacy Îµ surr term 3 the vertical scatter around the line of regression consists of terms 1 and 4 of eq 21 the null space contribution to the predictive error caused by the model reduction Îµ null term 1 and the influence of structural simplification on the rom prediction Îµredu term 4 all the above is explained in more detail in doherty and christensen 2011 now we analyze the changes made to the original methodology and their impact on the analysis using scatter plots originally doherty and christensen 2011 use s h for bias correction the simple model prediction calibrated against the real world data set h as they state that the complex model is reality they treat h as a complex model output and the regression line as a representation of the relationship between real world represented by the complex model and the simple model therefore the regression line can be used to correct s h old step 7 we do not treat the complex model as reality thus o h h the regression line depicts the bias between complex and simple model since it was developed from calibrating the simple model against complex model outputs consequently we use the regression line to correct s o h the prediction of the simple model calibrated against o h instead of s h the prediction of the real world calibrated simple model o h is the output of the complex model calibrated against h which contains any error and or bias of the complex model therefore s o h relates the simple and complex model and can thus be used for correction of bias between simple and complex model new steps 7 to 9 when using the simple model as a surrogate for the complex model fig 2 b shows the graphical analysis corresponding to the new steps 7 9 in the methodology in section 2 5 1 the prediction s o h of the simple model calibrated against the real world calibrated complex model output o h is added to the x axis of the graph from this prediction two relationships can be drawn as shown in fig 2 b and explained above first the regression line is used to correct the prediction bias denoted by the intercept b which results in the corrected simple model prediction s o h as shown in the y axis in doherty and christensen 2011 the vertical scatter around the intersection with the regression line which is equal to É redu É null c f fig 2 b is equivalent to the postcalibration uncertainty of the corrected rom prediction in our case the vertical scatter denotes the simplification error of the corrected rom prediction s o h second we calibrated the complex model step 7 new in section 2 4 against the real world data set h we add the corresponding calibrated complex model prediction s h to the y axis of the graph the s o h s h pairs are now used to test the simplification error estimation for the corrected simple model prediction s o h as we assume that the uncertainty bands depicted in the graph capture 95 of the simplification error of the rom prediction s o h the intercept between rom prediction s o h and complex model prediction s h i e the corresponding s o h s h pair should ideally lie within these uncertainty bands if the intersection lies far outside these uncertainty bands that suggests the method of correcting the rom prediction and assessing its error failed for the particular prediction while non uniqueness of calibrated cm parameters could influence s o h s h pairs tests have shown only minimal effect for our chosen models results not shown it is further possible to define predictions of data type and location for which one has actual measurements available this could be the case for predictions of groundwater head during a validation phase for example if this is the case these real world measurements hj taken at the same time and location as the corresponding model prediction sj can be used to examine the performance of the complex model for this prediction this is shown in fig 2 c and corresponds to steps 10 and 11 new in the methodology in section 2 4 while we did not use the prediction of the simple model calibrated against the real world measurement set s h for the bias correction as described above it is now plotted on the x axis of the graph against the real world measurement h on the y axis to create a new intersection the s h h pair if the complex model would perfectly represent reality h s h therefore the difference on the y axis labeled Îµ cm in fig 2 c is an estimate of the prediction specific error of the calibrated complex model against reality note that considering an unknown measurement error in h is generally possible and could potentially increase the error estimate between calibrated complex model and reality nonetheless Îµ cm can be considered here as a qualitative estimate of the predictive quality of the complex model to summarize the above the graphical analysis of the paired simple complex models allows several insights the slope a of the regression line is used to detect an increase of propensity of predictive error through calibration a 1 or potential over fitting a 1 the intercept b of the regression line allows for bias correction of the simple model prediction s o h to s o h the uncertainty bands of the regression line are used to discern the influence of measurement noise and parameter surrogacy horizontal scatter terms 2 and 3 of eq 21 as well as null space contribution and structural simplification vertical scatter i e simplification error terms 1 and 4 of eq 21 the calibrated complex model prediction s h allows the validation of the bias correction via the s o h s h pairs and evaluation of predictive coverage with the uncertainty bands for the simple model prediction s o h and potential real world measurements h are used to discern the prediction specific error Îµ cm of the complex model prediction s h s h h pairs 2 5 3 comparison of full model and rom parameters the relationship between complex and simple model parameters was derived mathematically in section 2 3 here we summarize the implications of these equations for the analysis of our results as previously discussed by watson et al 2013 eq 14 can be used to calculate the composition of simple model parameters in regard to the complex model parameters the main purpose of this analysis here as was stated in section 2 3 is the identification of parameter surrogacy meaning that simple model parameters can take on the role of very different complex model parameters or processes this is important given the fact that often simple model parameters are thought to represent measurable real world characteristics e g hydraulic conductivity or processes which are incorporated into the model as initial values and parameter limits for example thus simple model parameters found to represent widely different complex model parameters should be treated as effective parameters in model calibration and uncertainty analysis 3 case study the wairau aquifer model 3 1 the wairau aquifer in contrast to previous studies we applied the paired model analysis to a complex non linear coupled surface water groundwater interaction model the study is conducted for the wairau plain aquifer which is a shallow aquifer of regional importance on the wairau plain in the northern part of the south island of new zealand its main source of recharge is the wairau river and its groundwater is used intensively for irrigation mainly vineyards and municipal uses drinking water for the city of blenheim and surrounding villages the fluvial highly conductive aquifer has formed under the approximately 27 km long floodplain of the wairau river a braided gravel bed river that discharges into the pacific ocean the aquifer is shallow has a thickness of 20 35 m and is horizontally stratified by three main hydrogeological units that comprise a lower and upper highly permeable gravel aquifer intermitted by a lower permeable clay rich gravel layer in the east toward the sea a fourth confining geological formation dillon s point lies like a wedge on top of the first unit forcing the groundwater upwards into several low land springs and into the downstream part of the wairau river several groundwater observation wells to measure groundwater head are installed on the wairau plain and a flow recorder monitors the discharge of the major low land spring spring creek furthermore four river gauging stations are located in the wairau river meteorological data precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were taken from niwa s virtual climate station network tait et al 2006 estimates of irrigation water abstraction and groundwater recharge were calculated by a soil water balance model wÃ¶hling et al 2018 a detailed numerical model was developed for the coupled surface water groundwater system which was recently presented in wÃ¶hling et al 2018 this model is used as the complex benchmark model in our paired model analysis and briefly summarized in the next section 3 2 complex modflow cm model the transient numerical coupled surface water groundwater model was presented in detail by wÃ¶hling et al 2018 and is therefore only summarized here it was implemented in modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 using a horizontal 200 200 m grid approx 85 km2 and 6360 active model cells and three vertical layers analogous to the geological units fig 3 a the model was calibrated on about three years of data 1225 daily time steps the northern model boundary follows the course of the wairau river while the southern model boundary was aligned orthogonal to the groundwater flow field and thus assigned a no flow boundary in the east a constant groundwater flux boundary was implemented the wairau river is simulated using modflow s stream flow routing package niswonger and prudic 2005 allowing river and groundwater to interact in both directions over a head gradient flow that is constrained by the river bed conductivity kr the low land springs fig 3 a are implemented as drains allowing groundwater to leave the model along a conductivity kd and gradient controlled one way interaction at the land surface the model area is subject to groundwater recharge estimated by a soil water balance model wÃ¶hling et al 2018 the model has a total of 207 parameters the majority of parameters 180 is used for interpolating hydraulic conductivity kh and specific yield sy of the three geological layers via pilot points the specific storage ss and anisotropy ratio fa are defined by a single parameter per geological unit as are all four geological properties of the eastern dillon s point formation other parameters include river bed conductivities kr as well as bed conductivities for the different low land springs kd a list of all cm model parameters and their respective ranges for calibration is given in table 2 spatially variable kh and sy parameter fields were implemented using regularization techniques and an exponential variogram the parameters were calibrated using groundwater heads labeled 1 5 discharge at the spring creek sc spring differential wairau river flow gaugings and soft calibration targets for other springs that were implemented as expert knowledge state of the art parameter estimation was performed using pest see doherty 2016 in pareto mode calibrating the model parameters and assessing the trade off between data and regularization objective functions the model is used to predict groundwater heads at locations not contained in the calibration data set labeled 6 10 river groundwater exchange fluxes and flows of other low land springs an in depth discussion of the calibration process and uncertainty analysis for this model can be found in wÃ¶hling et al 2018 and is therefore not repeated here the run time of the complex modflow cm wairau model is between 75 and 150 s on an average desktop computer i5 processor with 2 6 ghz 16 gb ram and a 64 bit operating system this seems low but considering the high amount of runs necessary for calibration 208 for each computation of the jacobian matrix the computational burden for stochastic simulation is rather high it also allows for the calibration of the complex model which is a key feature of the extended paired model analysis presented here we like to note that model complexity is not necessarily directly synonymous with the number of model cells or parameters cf hÃ¶ge et al 2018 schÃ¶niger et al 2014 it has been shown that linear models with 104 model cells can efficiently be replaced by rom s e g siade et al 2012 non linear models such as the surface water groundwater model presented here and state depending boundaries are much more challenging to reproduce for roms for our analysis a total of 1000 random parameter sets were generated and model simulation conducted of which 976 terminated successfully and were used for the paired model analysis for all non pilot point parameters the values were drawn from a uniform distribution of their respective parameter ranges table 2 for the pilot point parameters of the three aquifer layers kh and sy fields we developed a method to semi randomly generate parameter fields which adhere to both their respective parameter ranges and the spatial correlation of the parameters a detailed description of this method can be found in appendix a 3 3 simplified modflow sm model the first rom used in this study is a strongly simplified modflow model that is subsequently referred to as the sm model it is based on the cm model described in section 3 2 and uses identical boundary conditions the horizontal grid size was changed from 200 200 m to 600 600 m thus reducing the number of active cells from 6360 to 756 furthermore the kh and sy fields of the cm model were assumed to be uniform in each hydrogeological unit and thus replaced by a single parameter each in addition the number of river bed sections was reduced from 12 to 3 as a consequence the total number of sm model parameters is 24 compared to the 207 parameters of the cm model fig 3 b depicts the differences of the computational grid and table 2 lists how the cm and sm model parameters are related the calibration process for the sm model along with the utilized calibration data and weighting strategy were kept consistent with the strategy used for the cm model see wÃ¶hling et al 2018 for details the model simplification resulted in a reduction of run time for a single sm model run by a factor of 5 10 approx 15 s for a single sm model run in addition the drastic parameter reduction makes calibration or stochastic simulation with the sm model much less computational demanding than with the cm model 25 instead of 208 model runs for computing the jacobian matrix 3 4 artificial neural network ann the second type of rom used in this study are artificial neural networks anns we created separate anns for each of the data time series described in section 3 5 with exception of the total river groundwater exchange flux qex instead of a single ann model simulating all the different data series as the cm and sm models do thus we used 17 anns one for each data time series corresponding to a prediction used in the scatter plot analysis their basic configuration is a nonlinear regressive neural network that was built using the neural network toolbox of matlab version r2015a we used the river flow time series estimated for the rock ferry gauging station as well as the groundwater abstraction and recharge time series integrated over the entire model area as input to all anns furthermore we implemented a closed feedback loop where the simulated outputs from previous time steps are used as input the time steps used for the anns are the same as for the cm and sm models each individual ann was trained on the continuous time series over the calibration time days 124 1047 of its corresponding data type and location the three main structural components of the anns used in this study are the number of nodes in the hidden layer the amount of input delay and the amount of feedback delay all of which were chosen for each net individually based on a preliminary data specific performance test with different ann setups results not shown the feedback delay denotes the number of time steps of previous simulated outputs that are used in the closed feedback loop while the input delay describes the time lag used for the input series note that the setup of separate anns for each of the data time series is possible in this paired model analysis as full time series are available for each data point since they are simulations of the cm model while there are no corresponding real world time series for a lot of these data points see section 3 5 for details table 3 summarizes the ann structures that were used for each data set a single ann model run takes about 0 1 s on the desktop pc 3 5 predictions the paired model analysis presented in section 2 5 is applied to several model predictions which are subsequently described the first group of predictions is a hindcast of groundwater heads at ten observation wells fig 3 for each groundwater well the smallest daily value in the whole simulation period was chosen as the prediction labeled h min available measurements of the first five groundwater wells 1 5 conders recharge conders no 2 wratts rd selmes rd and murphys rd were used in the calibration data set therefore these are not model predictions in the true sense the other groundwater wells 6 10 pauls rd old mcb mcb catchment shallow and p neal are model predictions of groundwater heads for which no data was used in the calibration process the second group of predictions are the river groundwater exchange fluxes between two consecutive gauging stations q ex1 rock ferry sh6 q ex2 sh6 wratts rd and q ex3 wratts rd sh1 a specific low flow period was chosen in which the average exchange flux between river and groundwater in the respective river sections was measured furthermore the overall mean exchange flux qex rock ferry sh1 in the model area consisting of the sum of all three individual fluxes during this time period was also used as a prediction for the sm model the third prediction group are the mean flows of the low land springs flow data are available for a portion of spring creek which was used in the calibration data set of the model labeled sc in fig 3 with predicted mean flow q sp1 the fluxes in the remaining tributaries of spring creek were summarized and used as a prediction under the name spring creek jr sc jr q sp2 in this study furthermore the various small southern streams ss q sp3 were summed up and were used as another flow prediction finally the model predicts the total flow in a smaller spring that flows back into the river in the north east of the model domain named northern drain nd q sp4 4 results 4 1 paired model analysis predictions in this chapter we present the results of predictive performance and simplification error analysis for the two rom types section 3 5 as analyzed using the paired model analysis section 2 5 2 we will compare the predictive quality of the two different rom types for different predictions to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses the 976 total data points paired complex simple model runs were divided into two subgroups the first 500 named estimation realizations were used to fit a regression line with 95 confidence intervals while the remaining 476 named test realizations were used to test the integrity of these confidence intervals this allows to assess the quality of the regression as well as the structure of the residuals 4 1 1 groundwater head predictions fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the sm model for the minimum groundwater head predictions h min of the ten wells in our analysis intercept slope and basic statistics of the regression lines are listed in table 4 first of all the h min used in the calibration 1 5 exhibit narrower bands of scatter than those solely used for prediction 6 10 which is confirmed by on average higher r 2 and lower Ï values table 4 this seems plausible as predictions of data contained in the calibration data set should have smaller errors associated with them as is predicated by the narrower scatter bands the slope of the regression line is close to 1 for all h min predictions even where the intercept is far from 0 this means that while the sm model might be strongly biased as indicated by the intercepts one could assume that the correction of the prediction via the regression line is trustworthy this is evaluated utilizing the s o h s h pairs which should lie within or close to the uncertainty bands fig 4 shows that this is not always the case for example the wratts rd and murphys rd h min predictions fig 4 3 and 5 the s o h s h pairs lie far below the uncertainty bands indicating that the error of the model reduction is underestimated by the method this discrepancy can be explained by the following the murphys rd well is influenced by the no flow boundary because it is located on the southern boundary of the model area well 5 in fig 3 boundary effects are probably intensified by the grid coarsening affecting a larger area in the sm model compared to the cm model this is confirmed by the s h h pair which shows an even smaller real world measurement h for the murphys rd h min than the cm model prediction s h indicating that a the cm model also shows an influence of the no flow boundary on this prediction and b the amplification of this effect through the simplification the wratts rd well lies at the outcropping of the dillon s point aquitard in the eastern part of the model where most of the low land springs originate this is a model area that has shown to be sensitive to changes in the model geometry relying on a relatively detailed resolution of geology this detail has probably been lost in the sm model the s h h pair suggests that the cm model itself is erroneous for the wratts rd h min prediction which might exaggerate the amount of simplification error underestimation compared to the s o h s h pair in contrast to the wratts rd and murphys rd predictions the s o h s h pair for the old mcb well lies both above the uncertainty bounds and at a very high value of the random realizations fig 4 7 most of the test realizations are also found in this area with a bias toward cm model values significantly higher than their corresponding sm model values for these high old mcb h min prediction values this indicates that for these values a linear regression line might not be a good estimator for model reduction error and an upward curving non linear fit might be more suitable to capture the simplification error for high predictive values this is also the case at the pauls rd and mcb wells fig 4 6 and 8 fig 5 shows the h min prediction scatter plots for the anns and the statistics of the linear regressions are given in table 4 generally the slope of the best fit line is very close to 1 for all predictions and the uncertainty bounds are quite narrow the s o h s h pairs are within the uncertainty bands for almost all head predictions and reasonably close for the remaining ones as each individual ann is calibrated against the corresponding head time series of the complex model see section 3 4 s h h pairs could only be computed for the wells where a real world data set was available wells 1 5 for these cases the s h h pairs show little influence of the prediction specific error between cm model and real world on the ann model predictions for the old mcb and mcb wells fig 5 7 and 8 the clustering of test realization scatter below the uncertainty band for low prediction values suggests that a linear relationship might not be suited to transfer the ann prediction to the cm predictions as such low h min predictions are rare cases at these wells and the real world calibrated cm and ann prediction pairs s o h s are at higher values this seems of not much significance for the presented application in comparison to the sm model predictions of h min the ann model predictions are less biased and show far less simplification error this is mainly due to the different setup though as explained in sections 3 3 3 5 the sm model is calibrated against a complex data set comprising several groundwater head time series 1 5 as well as spring flows and river exchange fluxes and is used to predict simultaneous system states contained and not contained in the calibration data set in contrast the anns are specific to their respective system state and solely calibrated to the single time series of the specific predictions due to this specialization the anns are better equipped to predict h min than the sm model but they can only be applied where real world data sets are available 4 1 2 river groundwater exchange flux predictions the scatter plots for the prediction of river groundwater exchange fluxes for the sm model are presented in fig 6 while the statistics of the linear regressions are listed in table 5 again the most apparent feature is the difference between the two predictions pertaining to the calibration data set q ex3 and qex and the other two predictions q ex1 and q ex2 as seen in fig 6 3 and 4 the scatter for the predictions q ex3 and qex is minorly spread the slopes of the regression lines are close to 1 and the s o h s h pairs are inside the uncertainty bounds the two available s h h pairs show that there is little error between cm model and reality for those two specific predictions for qex the scatter points outside the uncertainty bands are almost exclusively situated above the uncertainty band fig 6 4 meaning there is a bias of the sm model underestimating these fluxes compared to the cm model the scatter plots of q ex1 and q ex2 look very different fig 6 1 and 2 with wide spread scatter and slopes below 0 5 as was explained in section 2 5 2 this indicates an inability of the calibrated sm model to reduce the simplification predictive error in comparison to the precalibration uncertainty of the cm model the large horizontal scatter implies that this is influenced by parameter surrogacy in the sm model the river flow gauging stations corresponding to the calculations of q ex1 and q ex2 are situated in the north western and northern area of the model fig 3 where the river is in contact with the main aquifer the hydrogeological aquifer properties are parameterized via interpolation between pilot points in the cm model which is reduced to a single parameter in the sm model this reinforces the necessity of representing hydrogeological detail which is only in part compensated by other parameters in the sm model this is examined in more detail in section 4 2 the s o h s h pairs in fig 6 1 and 2 suggest a strong underestimation of the simplification error for these two predictions which further illustrates the poor ability to transfer the rom predictions to the cm predictions only three anns were built to predict the consecutive partial exchange fluxes between the gauging stations and the results are shown in fig 7 for these three slopes of the regression line are very close to 1 and uncertainty bounds are small while also incorporating s o h s h pairs furthermore intercepts are close to 0 for all three predictions meaning the anns can reproduce the cm model predictions without any notable bias table 5 as noted above this is again due to the prediction specific setup of the anns as roms 4 1 3 low land spring predictions fig 8 shows the scatter plots for the sm model predictions of mean low land spring fluxes and the statistics for the corresponding regression lines are given in table 6 observation of spring flow is only available for spring creek the sm model shows almost zero bias for the prediction of q sp1 fig 8 1 and the regression line with slope about 1 and small corresponding uncertainty bands suggest only a small model simplification error for this prediction for both q sp2 and q sp3 the regression lines have a slope of about 0 7 and wider uncertainty bands fig 8 2 and 3 nonetheless the s o h s h pairs are captured by the simplification error bounds for both predictions the s h h pair is far outside the uncertainty bands for q sp3 fig 8 3 showing a huge discrepancy between the observation and the calibrated cm model prediction this suggests that while the regression fit seems reasonable the calibrated cm model prediction seems to be a special case that might restrict the model pairing for this particular prediction on the other hand the observation os for q sp3 itself is known to be a very uncertain estimate so it might not be the best indicator for predictive quality the sm model prediction of q sp4 shows a scatter plot distinctly different to all others fig 8 4 a multitude of realizations predict a q sp4 of zero some in agreement between cm and sm model predictions but many only in the sm model many model realizations seem to predict groundwater levels below the threshold necessary to supply the spring with flow i e below the spring s channel elevation these realizations predict flows of q s p 4 0 m3 s which results in this particular scatter plot that allows no meaningful analysis of the results this is demonstrated by the s h h pair which is one of the few points where the sm model predicts q sp4 0 m3 s while the accompanying cm model predicts q s p 4 0 m3 s fig 8 4 the accumulation of sm model realizations of q s p 4 0 m3 s compared to the few cm model realizations suggests a significant error in model simplification the inability of the sm model to reproduce small scale interactions between groundwater and surface features in this model area results in either a too low groundwater levels in the sm model or b overestimation of spring bed elevation through spatial aggregation similar to the results presented for h min and qex in the previous section the results for spring predictions with anns are different from those of the sm model the scatter and uncertainty bounds for the ann models around the regression lines shown in fig 9 can barely be distinguished with slopes close to 1 and intercepts around zero table 6 the s o h s h pairs lie within the uncertainty bands for all four predictions note again that a direct comparison to the sm model results is not informative as the ann models were each calibrated against it is individual specific data set nonetheless the ann models seem to be able to predict mean spring fluxes for all four springs with small error and without any need for correction through a complex model 4 2 composition of sm model parameters the equations presented in section 2 3 allow an analysis of the effects of parameter reduction on the sm model parameters regarding their composition of cm model parameters note that the parameters of the anns are not associated to any real world features or characteristics of the aquifer in contrast to the sm model parameters and we therefore only carried out the analysis for the sm model even though it would be possible for the anns as well as can be seen in table 2 some of the 24 sm model parameters are combinations of the 207 cm model parameters the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of layer 1 to 3 as well as the river bed conductivities while others are the same the remaining ones all of the cm model parameters stand for certain processes of the real world geology and were thus informed by expert knowledge to derive starting values and parameter bounds for the calibration fig 10 shows the contribution of the cm model parameters to each of the grouped sm model parameters preferably a sm model parameter should be mainly influenced by the corresponding cm model parameters k h 1 s m by k h c m layer 1 pilot points for example it is generally notable that many different cm model parameters contribute to each sm model parameter only in some cases are the cm model parameters corresponding to the same process a major influence on the accompanying sm model parameter as for k d 2 s m and to some extent s s 2 s m or k h 1 s m from the discussion in section 4 1 2 we assume a high level of parameter surrogacy for k d 1 2 s m with major influences of k h c m which can clearly be seen in the graph furthermore k r 1 s m between gauging stations rock ferry and sh6 does not have any real contributions from its cm model counterparts k r 1 4 c m this is a crucial demonstration of the concept of parameter surrogacy that was mentioned in several sections of this study fig 10 demonstrates clearly that parameters in the physically based distributed sm model are not only or in many cases even barely representing the function of the real world process associated with them instead they are made up of various mixtures of complex cm model parameters this does illustrate that the information of starting values and parameter bounds via expert knowledge is dubious at best for this rom indeed the limiting of parameter values to geology informed delimitation might severely inhibit the rom performance in a case where parameters are not representing the process that one would associate with them therefore rom parameters should best be treated as effective parameters and only be loosely constrained in application 5 discussion and conclusions in this study the theoretical work of doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 of a paired model analysis of simplification error for roms was extended and applied to the real world physically based groundwater model of the wairau plains aquifer two roms differing widely in type and complexity were created for the paired model analysis the first a simplification of the complex modflow model the second a collection of anns the trustworthiness of the predictive bias correction and simplification error assessment that is the focal point of the scatter plots was tested by actual calibration of the complex model in addition the application to two types of roms demonstrated potencies and shortcomings of these roms for different application fields the first rom labeled sm is a spatially and parametrically simplified version of the basic complex model cm the proposed method of bias correction and error analysis seems to work fine for most of the predictions tested with this rom with low errors associated with predictions pertaining to the calibration data set medium errors for predictions of similar type and high errors for the remaining predictions nonetheless the testing of the analysis via the real world calibrated complex cm model prediction showed that the error estimates for some predictions disregarding of type are too low these problems seem to have several reasons a major one seems to be the location of the prediction several problematic predictions lie within the area of transition between the highly conductive aquifer and the dillon s point aquitard in the east of the model this area requires relatively high spatial and parametric detail to be adequately represented which seems to be missing in the sm model another source of simplification error underestimation seems to be coming from parameter surrogacy which could be the main contributor for the two highly uncertain river groundwater flux predictions as demonstrated by our analysis parameters in the sm model compensate for an assortment of cm model parameters due to absent variability and process representation in the simple model this questions the constraining of simple model parameter boundaries to realistic values during calibration as was undertaken for the sm model therefore they should probably be treated as effective parameters in the calibration process finally underestimation of simplification error could also stem from interaction with boundary conditions the second type of rom that was used in the study were anns as a most fundamental difference a single ann model was created and calibrated for each single location in the data set it was demonstrated that most predictions by ann roms are generally free of bias and have small simplification errors associated to them as all anns are calibrated against the respective time series from which those predictions come this mainly proves that the chosen type of ann is capable of reproducing such timelines adequately from this we conclude that where data is available such anns can be used for short term prediction and management purposes the paired model analysis can aid this by providing bias correction where necessary a direct comparison of the results for the two different roms is not expedient due to the different setup prediction space and usage of calibration data sets we conclude that the anns are formidable tools where they are applicable predictions for available data time series can be made with low simplification error and almost in real time for predictions not associated directly with measurements a simple physically distributed model like sm is the only choice but the performance depends on how similar the prediction type is to the calibration data set some predictions of very different type or predictions dependent on parameter detail not represented in the simple model might be better assessed only relying on the complex model here error can actually increase through the calibration of the simple model in comparison to complex model precalibration uncertainty estimates overall the presented methodology allows the evaluation of different types of roms in conjunction with the complex model and their classification into different areas of operation the analysis of the strength and shortcomings of the simple models in regard to different predictions is adamant for their further potential use in management be it scenario calculations or data worth analysis acknowledgments this work was funded by the german research foundation grant wo

696,groundwater resource management often requires detailed numerical models that make calibration and predictive uncertainty analysis computationally challenging reduced order models roms alleviate the computational burden but can potentially lead to predictive bias and underestimation of uncertainty a paired model approach has previously been proposed to estimate the predictive uncertainty of models compared to highly complex synthetic realities this approach is modified to analyze and compare the simplification error for groundwater predictions of a real world numerical modflow model of the wairau plains aquifer in the marlborough region of new zealand two different rom types were applied in this study to predict groundwater heads spring discharge and river groundwater exchange fluxes 1 a drastically simplified modflow model and 2 artificial neural networks anns the different roms exhibit very different patterns of bias and magnitude of model simplification error the method accurately captures the simplification error for most predictions by the modflow model but underestimates the error for predictions highly dependent on the variability of the complex model the simplified modflow model shows significant parameter surrogacy and non optimality of simplification thus questioning the adherence to expert knowledge based parameter limits for predictions where historic data sets are available anns provide superior predictive power however they cannot be applied to predictions of data types and locations not contained in the calibration data set for those predictions simplified numerical models can be applied with varying degree of accuracy keywords model reduction paired model analysis predictive simplification error regional groundwater modeling 1 introduction modern groundwater management is often supported by the application of groundwater models these models integrate available system knowledge e g measurements of system states and expert information and are used to predict system states under different future settings differences in modeling approaches are accompanied by a large diversity in model complexity input data size and model run time among other factors typically complex physically based models are required to represent the spatial variability of coupled groundwater flow processes and to incorporate existing knowledge unfortunately with increasing complexity these models become arduous to handle due to large run times and problems of numerical stability this vastly restricts the model s applicability for model calibration and uncertainty analysis a common solution to this problem is model simplification different approaches to generate reduced order models roms have been developed and applied in the past decades three categories of model reduction are most common in groundwater modeling data driven methods projection based methods and upscaling methods data driven methods such as bayesian networks fienen et al 2013 artificial neural networks taormina et al 2012 or some types of polynomial chaos expansion oladyshkin and nowak 2012 result in very fast simple models that reproduce data time series relying only on few input data sources due to their black box character they are limited in their applicability to data types and locations contained in the training data set and do not incorporate any system knowledge or underlying physical principles projection based methods such as proper orthogonal decomposition pod e g boyce et al 2015 siade et al 2012 ushijima and yeh 2015 retain the physical properties of the full model while speeding up run times by solving the model equations in a subspace computed off line from full model simulations recent studies tried to tackle the method s limitations regarding model non linearity stanko et al 2016 and boundary representation gosses et al 2018 but applications of pod are still hampered by its complexity in setup which usually necessitates altering source code of the applied modeling tools to access the model equation systems lastly upscaling methods e g dagan et al 2013 von gunten et al 2014 wood 2009 employ grid coarsening and or homogenized parameterization to reduce computational times but are limited by a lack of system detail in conclusion model simplification tackles the issues of long run times and numerical instability with a variety of different methods which all come at some costs a possible solution to the complementary problems of simple and complex models is a paired model approach where the rom is calibrated against outputs of the complex model lÃ¸dÃ¸en and tjelmeland 2010 and scheidt et al 2011 applied such methods in the field of reservoir modeling for petroleum in groundwater doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 developed a paired model approach to reduce predictive bias and for uncertainty analysis they analyzed performance and shortcomings of synthetic groundwater models in comparison to virtual realities they successfully computed predictive bias and uncertainty and gained insights into causes of uncertainty and the shortcomings of model parameterizations however they applied their paired model analysis only to synthetic models as a proof of concept furthermore the simplified models used in their studies are mainly simplifications of the complex model in the computational grid and the model parameters thus considering only a small portion of possible roms in their analysis in this study we apply the methodology developed by doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 to an existing complex model of a real world aquifer instead of a virtual reality this distinction allows us to assess the predictive simplification error of the simple model and test it against a the simulation results of the calibrated complex model and b real world data pertaining to some of the model predictions furthermore we use two distinctly different roms in the study a simplified physically based modflow model and a collection of anns as application of very fast data driven black box models this paper is structured as follows in section 2 we summarize the underlying subspace theory of the paired model approach here we also describe the extension of the methodology to test the roms against the calibrated complex model and real world data section 3 outlines the case study of the wairau plain aquifer the complex model and both rom types as well as the predictions used in the paired model analysis section 4 presents the results of the study the findings are discussed and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 concepts and theory this study utilizes a paired simple complex model approach first presented by doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 to study the simplification error associated with using roms for predictions in real world groundwater system since we use this method in a slightly different context and extend it to real world data we will first outline the differences to the original method here the main assumptions and differences between the original approach and our methodology is summarized in fig 1 doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 postulate that their complex models are equal to reality outputs of these complex models are deemed to be free of bias and or error this allows them to analyze the total predictive uncertainty of their simple model predictions with the paired model approach furthermore they can treat actual field data sets as another potential complex model output and use it for bias correction in contrast the complex model presented in this paper is considered to be an imperfect representation of reality as all models are by definition while it is built to accommodate all available system knowledge and calibrated thoroughly its outputs are subject to mostly unknown bias and or error the paired model approach presented here can only analyze bias and error between the complex and simple models this is therefore not the total predictive uncertainty but will be called simplification error instead due to this definition the bias correction has to be undertaken on basis of the calibrated complex model output instead of actual measurements differing conceptually from the original approach real world observations can be used here to estimate the prediction specific error between complex model and reality the underlying concepts of the paired model analysis are based on the assumptions of model linearization the non linearity present in most complex groundwater models effects the results of the analysis but poses no restriction to the applicability of the method presented in the following 2 1 linear models solution space and null space let the following equation denote a linear model 1 h zk É where the vector h represents the calibration data set k is a vector of model parameters the matrix z denotes the action of the model under calibration condition and the vector Îµ describes random measurement noise we define the vector k as the set of model parameters that produce a sufficiently calibrated model in linear algebra a matrix z has a null space if the following equation is true for a non zero vector k n 2 0 z k n this is usually true for every linearized form of a complex spatially explicit groundwater model combining eqs 1 and 2 and introducing a calibrated parameter set k gives 3 h z k k n É since there are typically multiple non zero vectors k n eq 3 illustrates the problem of non uniqueness in solving the inverse model problem that is well known to groundwater modelers for the concepts described in the following it is important to note that the solution space component of the parameter vector k can be inferred from the calibration data set h through the model while the null space component k n can not 2 2 model simplification concept and calibration in this section model simplification is described by an omission of model parameters from the complex model note that in this definition parameter omission can also represent omission of processes in the simple model this leads to the definition of 4 k k s k o where k s describe the simple model parameters and k o are the omitted parameters combining eq 4 with eq 1 gives 5 h zk É z s z o k s k o É z s k s z o k o É where z s and z o denote portions of the system matrix z pertaining to k s and k o respectively we now assume that eq 2 also holds for z s i e that the parameter solution of the simple model is also non unique for the methodology presented here it is assumed that the parameter estimation for k s is performed using principal component regression pcr mandel 1982 often referred to simply as singular value decomposition svd in groundwater literature this does not necessarily have to be the chosen method for solving the inverse problem and was not used for the model presented here but is useful here to understand the concepts described below singular value decomposition of z s is written as 6 z s us v t where s holds the singular values of z s and u and v the left and right singular vectors which are orthonormal eigenvectors of z s z s t or z s t z s respectively v s and u are partitioned into their solution space v 1 s 1 and u 1 and null space v 2 s 2 and u 2 counterparts c f aster et al 2011 for details thus the calibrated simple model parameter set k s is given as 7 k s v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t h v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É from eq 7 the calibrated complex model parameter set is written as 8 k k s k o v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 h v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 É note that the 0 s on the right hand side do not imply that k o 0 but only that calibration of the simple model can not be used to infer the omitted parameters k o combining eq 8 with eq 5 leads to 9 k k s k o v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 z s z o k s k o v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t 0 É eq 9 eq 11 in doherty and christensen 2011 shows the definition of the calibrated complex model parameter set k in regard to the complex model solution space v 1 s 1 and u 1 and the partitioned system matrix z s z o it is used as a basis for the analysis between simple and complex model parameters in the following section 2 3 2 3 the relationship between simple and complex model parameters it is desirable that much of the parameter detail of the complex model that can be explained by the data is retained in the parameter set of the simple model as it is typically not the case that the parameters themselves are kept in the simple model because often model simplification means parameter number reduction we need to analyze how much of the parameter detail is retained in the simple model to analyze the relationship between simple and complex model parameters we disregard measurement noise note that this is done only for ease of understanding and that the presence of measurement noise does not invalidate the following analysis eq 9 is rewritten to solve for the calibrated simple model parameter set k s as 10 k s v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z s k s z o k o combining eq 10 with eq 6 results in 11 k s v 1 v 1 t k s v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o from eq 11 it becomes obvious that a calibrated simple parameter is usually composed of two parts the first term on the right hand side of eq 11 is the projection of the simple model parameter set k s onto its solution space while the second term is dependent on the omitted complex parameter set k o the second term is called parameter surrogacy where the simple model parameter is not only made up by a physical property a hydraulic conductivity zone value for example represented by the first term but also can represent certain aspects of omitted complex parameters hydraulic conductivity from another area or storage values for example to analyze this further we adapt eq 22 from watson et al 2013 to our definition of an imperfect complex model let us start with the following equation that denotes the fitting of the simple model parameters k s against the output of the complex model o by linear regression equivalent to the first term of the right hand side of eq 22 in watson et al 2013 12 k s z s t z s 1 z s t o we can substitute the complex model by adapting eq 1 substituting h by o and ignoring measurement noise into eq 12 to get the second term of the right hand side of eq 22 in watson et al 2013 13 k s z s t z s 1 z s t zk by defining k s lk eq 20 in watson et al 2013 and eq 13 we arrive at 14 l z s t z s 1 z s t z this l matrix relates the simple model parameter space k s to the complex model parameter space k it allows the investigation of the influence of different complex model parameters onto simple model parameters and is thus a way to reveal the influence of parameter surrogacy contained in the simple model parameters 2 4 components of simplification error for rom predictions making predictions of future and or unknown system states is a crucial part in environmental modeling and concomitant with this is the analysis of uncertainty associated to predictions a prediction is denoted in the linear model approach as 15 s y t k where s is a scalar describing the prediction and the vector y defines the sensitivities of the prediction to the model parameters k separating this equation into simple and omitted parameter components we get 16 s y s t k s y o t k o if we now postulate that a prediction made by the calibrated simple model s is written as 17 s y s t k s then the error of the simple model prediction in comparison to the complex model prediction is defined as 18 s s y s t k s y s t k s y o t k o combining eq 18 with eq 7 while again ignoring measurement noise Îµ for clarity we get 19 s s y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t h y s t k s y o t k o we can now substitute eq 5 into eq 19 and simplify utilizing to the orthonormality of v to get to 20 s s y s t i v 1 v 1 t k s y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É y o t k o finally we can rearrange eq 20 and utilize the relationship v 1 v 1 t v 2 v 2 t i aster et al 2011 to describe the simplification error of the model prediction see doherty and christensen 2011 for more details 21 s s y s t v 2 v 2 t k s y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o y o t k o term 0 term 1 term 2 term 3 term 4 in other words eq 21 eq 36 in doherty and christensen 2011 defines the complex model prediction by the composition of the prediction of the calibrated simple model term 0 and four terms terms 1 4 describing the difference between the two predictions the different contributions to the simplification error of the prediction and their implications are best evaluated by analyzing a s versus s scatter plot again summarizing doherty and christensen 2011 assume that a number of complex model realizations i 1 n were randomly generated each resulting in a set of complex model parameters k i the complex model is run not calibrated one time with each of these parameter sets to generate a corresponding complex model output vector o i to this output o i random measurement error Îµ i is added to incorporate the influence of term 2 of eq 21 now the simple model is calibrated against each of the n complex model outputs o i É i to derive a simple model parameter set k s i associated with each complex model parameter set k i for each of these n parameter pairs we compute the prediction of interest thus obtaining the complex model prediction si and the simple model prediction s i as this was done for n model pairs we then compose a scatter plot of s versus s as schematically depicted in fig 2 a this is the basis for the paired model analysis described in section 2 5 1 to better associate the different features of these scatter plots with the different terms of eq 21 their influence on the shape of the scatter plot is analyzed individually again a detailed description can be found in doherty and christensen 2011 and is only partially repeated here to provide the context necessary for the evaluation of the study s results if the simple model is a perfect representation of the complex model eq 21 would simplify to s s thus yielding a scatter plot of points perfectly forming a line of slope 1 with intercept 0 therefore the different contributions of model simplification error result in a deviation of points from this line term 1 of eq 21 y s t v 2 v 2 t k s denotes the influence of the null space onto the simplification error the null space of the simple model does not affect the simple model prediction s by definition thus causing the vertical scatter in the plot due to its influence on the complex model prediction s term 2 of eq 21 y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t É constitutes the influence of the measurement error Îµ as the measurement error only pertains to the simple model calibrated against complex model outputs with the addition of random but predefined measurement error this leads to horizontal scatter affecting s and not s term 3 of eq 21 y s t v 1 s 1 1 u 1 t z o k o is the representation of parameter surrogacy see eq 11 and its explanation this contribution of parameters and processes that are not represented in the simple model parameters only affects the simple model prediction s as the complex model prediction s depends on the full parameter set therefore causing horizontal scatter finally term 4 of eq 21 y o t k o is the influence of the omitted complex model parameter detail on the predictive error thus it only acts upon s and not s which results in vertical scatter in summary a perfect simple model would result in si s i points perfectly sitting on a line with slope 1 and intercept 0 measurement error in calibration of the simple model and the effects of parameter surrogacy lead to horizontal scatter around this line furthermore vertical scatter can originate from null space contribution and the influence of the omitted parameters and processes note that the extent of vertical scatter denotes the simplification error of the model prediction here while in doherty and christensen 2011 it signifies the total postcalibration uncertainty of the simple model prediction because they assume that the complex model is reality further discussion of the pattern of the scatter plots can be found in section 2 5 2 as well as in sections 4 and 5 2 5 paired simple complex model analysis 2 5 1 methodology in this section we briefly summarize the methodology for the paired model analysis that applies the theoretical concepts detailed in section 2 4 in this study the methodology was first presented in doherty and christensen 2011 and is extended here to accommodate the changes in methodology presented at the beginning of section 2 the individual steps of the methodology are as follows 1 create a complex model z with the parameter set k of the system of interest incorporating all available system knowledge in process representation and parameterization 2 construct n different model parameter sets k i for i 1 n and run the model for each of these parameter realizations these complex model parameter realizations k i should represent the unknown variability of the different parameters and thus be random in nature but the statistics such as type of distribution mean and standard deviation etc should be informed by the data or expert knowledge about the system for each of these n random model runs the output o i is recorded 3 build a simple model z s that represents a simplified version of the system under study and runs fast enough to allow stochastic simulation 4 calibrate the simple model z s against each of the outputs of the complex model z corrupted with appropriate measurement errors o i É i thus a calibrated simple model realization is obtained for each random complex model realization 5 calculate the individual model predictions s i j and s i j for both the complex and the simple model realizations and all j 1 m different predictions 6 create a scatter plot of simple model predictions s i j versus complex model predictions s i j for each prediction j a linear regression line s a s b is fitted to the si s i pairs for each jth prediction and added to the plot obviously any other function could be used instead of a linear regression without loss of generality furthermore standard deviations Ï of the regression are calculated and the corresponding 95 confidence intervals 2Ï assuming normal distribution are added to the scatter plot the confidence intervals are used to discern the contributions to predictive uncertainty by the four terms of eq 21 this is shown in fig 2 a and is discussed in detail in section 2 5 2 7 calibrate the simple model z s using the real world measurement data set h and compute the corresponding model predictions s h 8 use the line of best fit from step 6 to project the real world simple model predictions s h into real world complex model predictions s h thus correcting for potential bias doherty and christensen 2011 end their analysis here as they assume a complex model so big that it can not feasibly be calibrated against the real world data set furthermore their correction of the real world simple model prediction s h via the regression line from step 6 equates the complex model to the synthetic real world this means that they treat the scatter discerned in step 6 as the total predictive uncertainty and the real world measurement data set h is used in steps 7 and 8 as a basis for bias correction in our application while the complex model is deemed to be a reasonable representation of the real world it is imperfect and thus prone to bias and or error then again it is still feasible to calibrate the model furthermore we undertake the scatter plot analysis for some model outputs for which actual real world measurements of the predicted model output are available this real world data corresponding to a prediction h can be used to estimate Îµ cm the prediction specific error between cm and reality therefore we altered and extended the above methodology to incorporate this new definition of the complex model as an error prone simplification of reality diverting after step 6 of the original method by doherty and christensen 2011 note that a thorough analysis of these changes follows in section 2 5 2 7 new calibrate the complex model z against the real world measurement data set h this creates a complex model output o h and calibrated complex model predictions s h 8 new calibrate the simple model z s against the calibrated complex model output o h and compute the corresponding model predictions s o h these predictions are the basis for the simplification error analysis tested via the s o h s h pairs and bias correction which will be explained in detail in section 2 5 2 9 new the line of best fit from step 6 is used to project the predictions s o h of the simple model calibrated against the output o h of the real world calibrated complex model into corresponding simple model predictions s o h corrected for bias by model simplification this is shown in fig 2 b again we differ from the original steps 7 and 8 by correcting s o h and not s h 10 new originally step 7 calibrate the simple model z s against the real world measurement data set h and compute the corresponding model predictions s h 11 new for the j predictions where real world data corresponding to predictions h is available the data pairs of s h j h j are added to the corresponding plots s h j h j gives the discrepancy between the corresponding jth complex model prediction and reality Îµ cm this is shown schematically in fig 2 c table 1 summarizes the notation used for the different predictions made by the complex cm and simple rom model 2 5 2 analysis of the s versus s scatter plot section 2 4 described the theoretical basis for the scatter plots of paired simple complex models while section 2 5 1 outlined the application of this theory as the resulting scatter plots are a major part of the analysis presented in this paper we provide a detailed explanation of the different features and the information contained in such scatter plots in this section the first part is based on doherty and christensen 2011 and is therefore only summarized here the second part explains the changes and extensions of our approach that are listed in section 2 5 1 in more detail fig 2 a shows a schematic scatter plot of simple model predictions s versus complex model predictions s obtained by calibration of the simple model against n randomly parameterized complex model outputs that were corrupted by white noise to represent measurement error labeled exemplarily for realization i in addition it depicts the regression line of the scatter it is 95 uncertainty bands and the reduction based predictive error contributions steps 1 6 in section 2 5 1 in general the form and range of scatter points within the uncertainty bands and the slope and intercept of the regression line are very informative the relationship between simple and complex model predictions is fitted by linear regression from which we calculate the slope a and intercept b of the regression line the intercept b denotes the bias of the rom prediction in comparison to the complex model prediction that needs to be added or subtracted for correction of the prediction the slope a can deviate from an ideal slope of 1 in two directions if a 1 the total horizontal extent of the scatter points is larger than the vertical scatter which means that rom predictions are more variable than random complex model predictions this indicates that the propensity of predictive error was actually increased through calibration of the simple model compared to the random uncalibrated complex model doherty and christensen 2011 if instead a 1 the total horizontal scatter is smaller than the total vertical scatter and thus the random complex model predictions are more variable than the rom predictions this would mean that the rom can not reproduce all possible predictive outcomes of the complex model which might be an indication of over fitting to the calibration data set or of missing process detail in the rom as outlined in section 2 4 the horizontal scatter around the line of regression is composed of the contributions of terms 2 and 3 of eq 21 to the simplification error of a simple model prediction s the influence of measurement noise labeled Îµ noise in fig 2 a which is equal to term 2 and the effect of parameter surrogacy Îµ surr term 3 the vertical scatter around the line of regression consists of terms 1 and 4 of eq 21 the null space contribution to the predictive error caused by the model reduction Îµ null term 1 and the influence of structural simplification on the rom prediction Îµredu term 4 all the above is explained in more detail in doherty and christensen 2011 now we analyze the changes made to the original methodology and their impact on the analysis using scatter plots originally doherty and christensen 2011 use s h for bias correction the simple model prediction calibrated against the real world data set h as they state that the complex model is reality they treat h as a complex model output and the regression line as a representation of the relationship between real world represented by the complex model and the simple model therefore the regression line can be used to correct s h old step 7 we do not treat the complex model as reality thus o h h the regression line depicts the bias between complex and simple model since it was developed from calibrating the simple model against complex model outputs consequently we use the regression line to correct s o h the prediction of the simple model calibrated against o h instead of s h the prediction of the real world calibrated simple model o h is the output of the complex model calibrated against h which contains any error and or bias of the complex model therefore s o h relates the simple and complex model and can thus be used for correction of bias between simple and complex model new steps 7 to 9 when using the simple model as a surrogate for the complex model fig 2 b shows the graphical analysis corresponding to the new steps 7 9 in the methodology in section 2 5 1 the prediction s o h of the simple model calibrated against the real world calibrated complex model output o h is added to the x axis of the graph from this prediction two relationships can be drawn as shown in fig 2 b and explained above first the regression line is used to correct the prediction bias denoted by the intercept b which results in the corrected simple model prediction s o h as shown in the y axis in doherty and christensen 2011 the vertical scatter around the intersection with the regression line which is equal to É redu É null c f fig 2 b is equivalent to the postcalibration uncertainty of the corrected rom prediction in our case the vertical scatter denotes the simplification error of the corrected rom prediction s o h second we calibrated the complex model step 7 new in section 2 4 against the real world data set h we add the corresponding calibrated complex model prediction s h to the y axis of the graph the s o h s h pairs are now used to test the simplification error estimation for the corrected simple model prediction s o h as we assume that the uncertainty bands depicted in the graph capture 95 of the simplification error of the rom prediction s o h the intercept between rom prediction s o h and complex model prediction s h i e the corresponding s o h s h pair should ideally lie within these uncertainty bands if the intersection lies far outside these uncertainty bands that suggests the method of correcting the rom prediction and assessing its error failed for the particular prediction while non uniqueness of calibrated cm parameters could influence s o h s h pairs tests have shown only minimal effect for our chosen models results not shown it is further possible to define predictions of data type and location for which one has actual measurements available this could be the case for predictions of groundwater head during a validation phase for example if this is the case these real world measurements hj taken at the same time and location as the corresponding model prediction sj can be used to examine the performance of the complex model for this prediction this is shown in fig 2 c and corresponds to steps 10 and 11 new in the methodology in section 2 4 while we did not use the prediction of the simple model calibrated against the real world measurement set s h for the bias correction as described above it is now plotted on the x axis of the graph against the real world measurement h on the y axis to create a new intersection the s h h pair if the complex model would perfectly represent reality h s h therefore the difference on the y axis labeled Îµ cm in fig 2 c is an estimate of the prediction specific error of the calibrated complex model against reality note that considering an unknown measurement error in h is generally possible and could potentially increase the error estimate between calibrated complex model and reality nonetheless Îµ cm can be considered here as a qualitative estimate of the predictive quality of the complex model to summarize the above the graphical analysis of the paired simple complex models allows several insights the slope a of the regression line is used to detect an increase of propensity of predictive error through calibration a 1 or potential over fitting a 1 the intercept b of the regression line allows for bias correction of the simple model prediction s o h to s o h the uncertainty bands of the regression line are used to discern the influence of measurement noise and parameter surrogacy horizontal scatter terms 2 and 3 of eq 21 as well as null space contribution and structural simplification vertical scatter i e simplification error terms 1 and 4 of eq 21 the calibrated complex model prediction s h allows the validation of the bias correction via the s o h s h pairs and evaluation of predictive coverage with the uncertainty bands for the simple model prediction s o h and potential real world measurements h are used to discern the prediction specific error Îµ cm of the complex model prediction s h s h h pairs 2 5 3 comparison of full model and rom parameters the relationship between complex and simple model parameters was derived mathematically in section 2 3 here we summarize the implications of these equations for the analysis of our results as previously discussed by watson et al 2013 eq 14 can be used to calculate the composition of simple model parameters in regard to the complex model parameters the main purpose of this analysis here as was stated in section 2 3 is the identification of parameter surrogacy meaning that simple model parameters can take on the role of very different complex model parameters or processes this is important given the fact that often simple model parameters are thought to represent measurable real world characteristics e g hydraulic conductivity or processes which are incorporated into the model as initial values and parameter limits for example thus simple model parameters found to represent widely different complex model parameters should be treated as effective parameters in model calibration and uncertainty analysis 3 case study the wairau aquifer model 3 1 the wairau aquifer in contrast to previous studies we applied the paired model analysis to a complex non linear coupled surface water groundwater interaction model the study is conducted for the wairau plain aquifer which is a shallow aquifer of regional importance on the wairau plain in the northern part of the south island of new zealand its main source of recharge is the wairau river and its groundwater is used intensively for irrigation mainly vineyards and municipal uses drinking water for the city of blenheim and surrounding villages the fluvial highly conductive aquifer has formed under the approximately 27 km long floodplain of the wairau river a braided gravel bed river that discharges into the pacific ocean the aquifer is shallow has a thickness of 20 35 m and is horizontally stratified by three main hydrogeological units that comprise a lower and upper highly permeable gravel aquifer intermitted by a lower permeable clay rich gravel layer in the east toward the sea a fourth confining geological formation dillon s point lies like a wedge on top of the first unit forcing the groundwater upwards into several low land springs and into the downstream part of the wairau river several groundwater observation wells to measure groundwater head are installed on the wairau plain and a flow recorder monitors the discharge of the major low land spring spring creek furthermore four river gauging stations are located in the wairau river meteorological data precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were taken from niwa s virtual climate station network tait et al 2006 estimates of irrigation water abstraction and groundwater recharge were calculated by a soil water balance model wÃ¶hling et al 2018 a detailed numerical model was developed for the coupled surface water groundwater system which was recently presented in wÃ¶hling et al 2018 this model is used as the complex benchmark model in our paired model analysis and briefly summarized in the next section 3 2 complex modflow cm model the transient numerical coupled surface water groundwater model was presented in detail by wÃ¶hling et al 2018 and is therefore only summarized here it was implemented in modflow nwt niswonger et al 2011 using a horizontal 200 200 m grid approx 85 km2 and 6360 active model cells and three vertical layers analogous to the geological units fig 3 a the model was calibrated on about three years of data 1225 daily time steps the northern model boundary follows the course of the wairau river while the southern model boundary was aligned orthogonal to the groundwater flow field and thus assigned a no flow boundary in the east a constant groundwater flux boundary was implemented the wairau river is simulated using modflow s stream flow routing package niswonger and prudic 2005 allowing river and groundwater to interact in both directions over a head gradient flow that is constrained by the river bed conductivity kr the low land springs fig 3 a are implemented as drains allowing groundwater to leave the model along a conductivity kd and gradient controlled one way interaction at the land surface the model area is subject to groundwater recharge estimated by a soil water balance model wÃ¶hling et al 2018 the model has a total of 207 parameters the majority of parameters 180 is used for interpolating hydraulic conductivity kh and specific yield sy of the three geological layers via pilot points the specific storage ss and anisotropy ratio fa are defined by a single parameter per geological unit as are all four geological properties of the eastern dillon s point formation other parameters include river bed conductivities kr as well as bed conductivities for the different low land springs kd a list of all cm model parameters and their respective ranges for calibration is given in table 2 spatially variable kh and sy parameter fields were implemented using regularization techniques and an exponential variogram the parameters were calibrated using groundwater heads labeled 1 5 discharge at the spring creek sc spring differential wairau river flow gaugings and soft calibration targets for other springs that were implemented as expert knowledge state of the art parameter estimation was performed using pest see doherty 2016 in pareto mode calibrating the model parameters and assessing the trade off between data and regularization objective functions the model is used to predict groundwater heads at locations not contained in the calibration data set labeled 6 10 river groundwater exchange fluxes and flows of other low land springs an in depth discussion of the calibration process and uncertainty analysis for this model can be found in wÃ¶hling et al 2018 and is therefore not repeated here the run time of the complex modflow cm wairau model is between 75 and 150 s on an average desktop computer i5 processor with 2 6 ghz 16 gb ram and a 64 bit operating system this seems low but considering the high amount of runs necessary for calibration 208 for each computation of the jacobian matrix the computational burden for stochastic simulation is rather high it also allows for the calibration of the complex model which is a key feature of the extended paired model analysis presented here we like to note that model complexity is not necessarily directly synonymous with the number of model cells or parameters cf hÃ¶ge et al 2018 schÃ¶niger et al 2014 it has been shown that linear models with 104 model cells can efficiently be replaced by rom s e g siade et al 2012 non linear models such as the surface water groundwater model presented here and state depending boundaries are much more challenging to reproduce for roms for our analysis a total of 1000 random parameter sets were generated and model simulation conducted of which 976 terminated successfully and were used for the paired model analysis for all non pilot point parameters the values were drawn from a uniform distribution of their respective parameter ranges table 2 for the pilot point parameters of the three aquifer layers kh and sy fields we developed a method to semi randomly generate parameter fields which adhere to both their respective parameter ranges and the spatial correlation of the parameters a detailed description of this method can be found in appendix a 3 3 simplified modflow sm model the first rom used in this study is a strongly simplified modflow model that is subsequently referred to as the sm model it is based on the cm model described in section 3 2 and uses identical boundary conditions the horizontal grid size was changed from 200 200 m to 600 600 m thus reducing the number of active cells from 6360 to 756 furthermore the kh and sy fields of the cm model were assumed to be uniform in each hydrogeological unit and thus replaced by a single parameter each in addition the number of river bed sections was reduced from 12 to 3 as a consequence the total number of sm model parameters is 24 compared to the 207 parameters of the cm model fig 3 b depicts the differences of the computational grid and table 2 lists how the cm and sm model parameters are related the calibration process for the sm model along with the utilized calibration data and weighting strategy were kept consistent with the strategy used for the cm model see wÃ¶hling et al 2018 for details the model simplification resulted in a reduction of run time for a single sm model run by a factor of 5 10 approx 15 s for a single sm model run in addition the drastic parameter reduction makes calibration or stochastic simulation with the sm model much less computational demanding than with the cm model 25 instead of 208 model runs for computing the jacobian matrix 3 4 artificial neural network ann the second type of rom used in this study are artificial neural networks anns we created separate anns for each of the data time series described in section 3 5 with exception of the total river groundwater exchange flux qex instead of a single ann model simulating all the different data series as the cm and sm models do thus we used 17 anns one for each data time series corresponding to a prediction used in the scatter plot analysis their basic configuration is a nonlinear regressive neural network that was built using the neural network toolbox of matlab version r2015a we used the river flow time series estimated for the rock ferry gauging station as well as the groundwater abstraction and recharge time series integrated over the entire model area as input to all anns furthermore we implemented a closed feedback loop where the simulated outputs from previous time steps are used as input the time steps used for the anns are the same as for the cm and sm models each individual ann was trained on the continuous time series over the calibration time days 124 1047 of its corresponding data type and location the three main structural components of the anns used in this study are the number of nodes in the hidden layer the amount of input delay and the amount of feedback delay all of which were chosen for each net individually based on a preliminary data specific performance test with different ann setups results not shown the feedback delay denotes the number of time steps of previous simulated outputs that are used in the closed feedback loop while the input delay describes the time lag used for the input series note that the setup of separate anns for each of the data time series is possible in this paired model analysis as full time series are available for each data point since they are simulations of the cm model while there are no corresponding real world time series for a lot of these data points see section 3 5 for details table 3 summarizes the ann structures that were used for each data set a single ann model run takes about 0 1 s on the desktop pc 3 5 predictions the paired model analysis presented in section 2 5 is applied to several model predictions which are subsequently described the first group of predictions is a hindcast of groundwater heads at ten observation wells fig 3 for each groundwater well the smallest daily value in the whole simulation period was chosen as the prediction labeled h min available measurements of the first five groundwater wells 1 5 conders recharge conders no 2 wratts rd selmes rd and murphys rd were used in the calibration data set therefore these are not model predictions in the true sense the other groundwater wells 6 10 pauls rd old mcb mcb catchment shallow and p neal are model predictions of groundwater heads for which no data was used in the calibration process the second group of predictions are the river groundwater exchange fluxes between two consecutive gauging stations q ex1 rock ferry sh6 q ex2 sh6 wratts rd and q ex3 wratts rd sh1 a specific low flow period was chosen in which the average exchange flux between river and groundwater in the respective river sections was measured furthermore the overall mean exchange flux qex rock ferry sh1 in the model area consisting of the sum of all three individual fluxes during this time period was also used as a prediction for the sm model the third prediction group are the mean flows of the low land springs flow data are available for a portion of spring creek which was used in the calibration data set of the model labeled sc in fig 3 with predicted mean flow q sp1 the fluxes in the remaining tributaries of spring creek were summarized and used as a prediction under the name spring creek jr sc jr q sp2 in this study furthermore the various small southern streams ss q sp3 were summed up and were used as another flow prediction finally the model predicts the total flow in a smaller spring that flows back into the river in the north east of the model domain named northern drain nd q sp4 4 results 4 1 paired model analysis predictions in this chapter we present the results of predictive performance and simplification error analysis for the two rom types section 3 5 as analyzed using the paired model analysis section 2 5 2 we will compare the predictive quality of the two different rom types for different predictions to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses the 976 total data points paired complex simple model runs were divided into two subgroups the first 500 named estimation realizations were used to fit a regression line with 95 confidence intervals while the remaining 476 named test realizations were used to test the integrity of these confidence intervals this allows to assess the quality of the regression as well as the structure of the residuals 4 1 1 groundwater head predictions fig 4 shows the scatter plots of the sm model for the minimum groundwater head predictions h min of the ten wells in our analysis intercept slope and basic statistics of the regression lines are listed in table 4 first of all the h min used in the calibration 1 5 exhibit narrower bands of scatter than those solely used for prediction 6 10 which is confirmed by on average higher r 2 and lower Ï values table 4 this seems plausible as predictions of data contained in the calibration data set should have smaller errors associated with them as is predicated by the narrower scatter bands the slope of the regression line is close to 1 for all h min predictions even where the intercept is far from 0 this means that while the sm model might be strongly biased as indicated by the intercepts one could assume that the correction of the prediction via the regression line is trustworthy this is evaluated utilizing the s o h s h pairs which should lie within or close to the uncertainty bands fig 4 shows that this is not always the case for example the wratts rd and murphys rd h min predictions fig 4 3 and 5 the s o h s h pairs lie far below the uncertainty bands indicating that the error of the model reduction is underestimated by the method this discrepancy can be explained by the following the murphys rd well is influenced by the no flow boundary because it is located on the southern boundary of the model area well 5 in fig 3 boundary effects are probably intensified by the grid coarsening affecting a larger area in the sm model compared to the cm model this is confirmed by the s h h pair which shows an even smaller real world measurement h for the murphys rd h min than the cm model prediction s h indicating that a the cm model also shows an influence of the no flow boundary on this prediction and b the amplification of this effect through the simplification the wratts rd well lies at the outcropping of the dillon s point aquitard in the eastern part of the model where most of the low land springs originate this is a model area that has shown to be sensitive to changes in the model geometry relying on a relatively detailed resolution of geology this detail has probably been lost in the sm model the s h h pair suggests that the cm model itself is erroneous for the wratts rd h min prediction which might exaggerate the amount of simplification error underestimation compared to the s o h s h pair in contrast to the wratts rd and murphys rd predictions the s o h s h pair for the old mcb well lies both above the uncertainty bounds and at a very high value of the random realizations fig 4 7 most of the test realizations are also found in this area with a bias toward cm model values significantly higher than their corresponding sm model values for these high old mcb h min prediction values this indicates that for these values a linear regression line might not be a good estimator for model reduction error and an upward curving non linear fit might be more suitable to capture the simplification error for high predictive values this is also the case at the pauls rd and mcb wells fig 4 6 and 8 fig 5 shows the h min prediction scatter plots for the anns and the statistics of the linear regressions are given in table 4 generally the slope of the best fit line is very close to 1 for all predictions and the uncertainty bounds are quite narrow the s o h s h pairs are within the uncertainty bands for almost all head predictions and reasonably close for the remaining ones as each individual ann is calibrated against the corresponding head time series of the complex model see section 3 4 s h h pairs could only be computed for the wells where a real world data set was available wells 1 5 for these cases the s h h pairs show little influence of the prediction specific error between cm model and real world on the ann model predictions for the old mcb and mcb wells fig 5 7 and 8 the clustering of test realization scatter below the uncertainty band for low prediction values suggests that a linear relationship might not be suited to transfer the ann prediction to the cm predictions as such low h min predictions are rare cases at these wells and the real world calibrated cm and ann prediction pairs s o h s are at higher values this seems of not much significance for the presented application in comparison to the sm model predictions of h min the ann model predictions are less biased and show far less simplification error this is mainly due to the different setup though as explained in sections 3 3 3 5 the sm model is calibrated against a complex data set comprising several groundwater head time series 1 5 as well as spring flows and river exchange fluxes and is used to predict simultaneous system states contained and not contained in the calibration data set in contrast the anns are specific to their respective system state and solely calibrated to the single time series of the specific predictions due to this specialization the anns are better equipped to predict h min than the sm model but they can only be applied where real world data sets are available 4 1 2 river groundwater exchange flux predictions the scatter plots for the prediction of river groundwater exchange fluxes for the sm model are presented in fig 6 while the statistics of the linear regressions are listed in table 5 again the most apparent feature is the difference between the two predictions pertaining to the calibration data set q ex3 and qex and the other two predictions q ex1 and q ex2 as seen in fig 6 3 and 4 the scatter for the predictions q ex3 and qex is minorly spread the slopes of the regression lines are close to 1 and the s o h s h pairs are inside the uncertainty bounds the two available s h h pairs show that there is little error between cm model and reality for those two specific predictions for qex the scatter points outside the uncertainty bands are almost exclusively situated above the uncertainty band fig 6 4 meaning there is a bias of the sm model underestimating these fluxes compared to the cm model the scatter plots of q ex1 and q ex2 look very different fig 6 1 and 2 with wide spread scatter and slopes below 0 5 as was explained in section 2 5 2 this indicates an inability of the calibrated sm model to reduce the simplification predictive error in comparison to the precalibration uncertainty of the cm model the large horizontal scatter implies that this is influenced by parameter surrogacy in the sm model the river flow gauging stations corresponding to the calculations of q ex1 and q ex2 are situated in the north western and northern area of the model fig 3 where the river is in contact with the main aquifer the hydrogeological aquifer properties are parameterized via interpolation between pilot points in the cm model which is reduced to a single parameter in the sm model this reinforces the necessity of representing hydrogeological detail which is only in part compensated by other parameters in the sm model this is examined in more detail in section 4 2 the s o h s h pairs in fig 6 1 and 2 suggest a strong underestimation of the simplification error for these two predictions which further illustrates the poor ability to transfer the rom predictions to the cm predictions only three anns were built to predict the consecutive partial exchange fluxes between the gauging stations and the results are shown in fig 7 for these three slopes of the regression line are very close to 1 and uncertainty bounds are small while also incorporating s o h s h pairs furthermore intercepts are close to 0 for all three predictions meaning the anns can reproduce the cm model predictions without any notable bias table 5 as noted above this is again due to the prediction specific setup of the anns as roms 4 1 3 low land spring predictions fig 8 shows the scatter plots for the sm model predictions of mean low land spring fluxes and the statistics for the corresponding regression lines are given in table 6 observation of spring flow is only available for spring creek the sm model shows almost zero bias for the prediction of q sp1 fig 8 1 and the regression line with slope about 1 and small corresponding uncertainty bands suggest only a small model simplification error for this prediction for both q sp2 and q sp3 the regression lines have a slope of about 0 7 and wider uncertainty bands fig 8 2 and 3 nonetheless the s o h s h pairs are captured by the simplification error bounds for both predictions the s h h pair is far outside the uncertainty bands for q sp3 fig 8 3 showing a huge discrepancy between the observation and the calibrated cm model prediction this suggests that while the regression fit seems reasonable the calibrated cm model prediction seems to be a special case that might restrict the model pairing for this particular prediction on the other hand the observation os for q sp3 itself is known to be a very uncertain estimate so it might not be the best indicator for predictive quality the sm model prediction of q sp4 shows a scatter plot distinctly different to all others fig 8 4 a multitude of realizations predict a q sp4 of zero some in agreement between cm and sm model predictions but many only in the sm model many model realizations seem to predict groundwater levels below the threshold necessary to supply the spring with flow i e below the spring s channel elevation these realizations predict flows of q s p 4 0 m3 s which results in this particular scatter plot that allows no meaningful analysis of the results this is demonstrated by the s h h pair which is one of the few points where the sm model predicts q sp4 0 m3 s while the accompanying cm model predicts q s p 4 0 m3 s fig 8 4 the accumulation of sm model realizations of q s p 4 0 m3 s compared to the few cm model realizations suggests a significant error in model simplification the inability of the sm model to reproduce small scale interactions between groundwater and surface features in this model area results in either a too low groundwater levels in the sm model or b overestimation of spring bed elevation through spatial aggregation similar to the results presented for h min and qex in the previous section the results for spring predictions with anns are different from those of the sm model the scatter and uncertainty bounds for the ann models around the regression lines shown in fig 9 can barely be distinguished with slopes close to 1 and intercepts around zero table 6 the s o h s h pairs lie within the uncertainty bands for all four predictions note again that a direct comparison to the sm model results is not informative as the ann models were each calibrated against it is individual specific data set nonetheless the ann models seem to be able to predict mean spring fluxes for all four springs with small error and without any need for correction through a complex model 4 2 composition of sm model parameters the equations presented in section 2 3 allow an analysis of the effects of parameter reduction on the sm model parameters regarding their composition of cm model parameters note that the parameters of the anns are not associated to any real world features or characteristics of the aquifer in contrast to the sm model parameters and we therefore only carried out the analysis for the sm model even though it would be possible for the anns as well as can be seen in table 2 some of the 24 sm model parameters are combinations of the 207 cm model parameters the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of layer 1 to 3 as well as the river bed conductivities while others are the same the remaining ones all of the cm model parameters stand for certain processes of the real world geology and were thus informed by expert knowledge to derive starting values and parameter bounds for the calibration fig 10 shows the contribution of the cm model parameters to each of the grouped sm model parameters preferably a sm model parameter should be mainly influenced by the corresponding cm model parameters k h 1 s m by k h c m layer 1 pilot points for example it is generally notable that many different cm model parameters contribute to each sm model parameter only in some cases are the cm model parameters corresponding to the same process a major influence on the accompanying sm model parameter as for k d 2 s m and to some extent s s 2 s m or k h 1 s m from the discussion in section 4 1 2 we assume a high level of parameter surrogacy for k d 1 2 s m with major influences of k h c m which can clearly be seen in the graph furthermore k r 1 s m between gauging stations rock ferry and sh6 does not have any real contributions from its cm model counterparts k r 1 4 c m this is a crucial demonstration of the concept of parameter surrogacy that was mentioned in several sections of this study fig 10 demonstrates clearly that parameters in the physically based distributed sm model are not only or in many cases even barely representing the function of the real world process associated with them instead they are made up of various mixtures of complex cm model parameters this does illustrate that the information of starting values and parameter bounds via expert knowledge is dubious at best for this rom indeed the limiting of parameter values to geology informed delimitation might severely inhibit the rom performance in a case where parameters are not representing the process that one would associate with them therefore rom parameters should best be treated as effective parameters and only be loosely constrained in application 5 discussion and conclusions in this study the theoretical work of doherty and christensen 2011 and watson et al 2013 of a paired model analysis of simplification error for roms was extended and applied to the real world physically based groundwater model of the wairau plains aquifer two roms differing widely in type and complexity were created for the paired model analysis the first a simplification of the complex modflow model the second a collection of anns the trustworthiness of the predictive bias correction and simplification error assessment that is the focal point of the scatter plots was tested by actual calibration of the complex model in addition the application to two types of roms demonstrated potencies and shortcomings of these roms for different application fields the first rom labeled sm is a spatially and parametrically simplified version of the basic complex model cm the proposed method of bias correction and error analysis seems to work fine for most of the predictions tested with this rom with low errors associated with predictions pertaining to the calibration data set medium errors for predictions of similar type and high errors for the remaining predictions nonetheless the testing of the analysis via the real world calibrated complex cm model prediction showed that the error estimates for some predictions disregarding of type are too low these problems seem to have several reasons a major one seems to be the location of the prediction several problematic predictions lie within the area of transition between the highly conductive aquifer and the dillon s point aquitard in the east of the model this area requires relatively high spatial and parametric detail to be adequately represented which seems to be missing in the sm model another source of simplification error underestimation seems to be coming from parameter surrogacy which could be the main contributor for the two highly uncertain river groundwater flux predictions as demonstrated by our analysis parameters in the sm model compensate for an assortment of cm model parameters due to absent variability and process representation in the simple model this questions the constraining of simple model parameter boundaries to realistic values during calibration as was undertaken for the sm model therefore they should probably be treated as effective parameters in the calibration process finally underestimation of simplification error could also stem from interaction with boundary conditions the second type of rom that was used in the study were anns as a most fundamental difference a single ann model was created and calibrated for each single location in the data set it was demonstrated that most predictions by ann roms are generally free of bias and have small simplification errors associated to them as all anns are calibrated against the respective time series from which those predictions come this mainly proves that the chosen type of ann is capable of reproducing such timelines adequately from this we conclude that where data is available such anns can be used for short term prediction and management purposes the paired model analysis can aid this by providing bias correction where necessary a direct comparison of the results for the two different roms is not expedient due to the different setup prediction space and usage of calibration data sets we conclude that the anns are formidable tools where they are applicable predictions for available data time series can be made with low simplification error and almost in real time for predictions not associated directly with measurements a simple physically distributed model like sm is the only choice but the performance depends on how similar the prediction type is to the calibration data set some predictions of very different type or predictions dependent on parameter detail not represented in the simple model might be better assessed only relying on the complex model here error can actually increase through the calibration of the simple model in comparison to complex model precalibration uncertainty estimates overall the presented methodology allows the evaluation of different types of roms in conjunction with the complex model and their classification into different areas of operation the analysis of the strength and shortcomings of the simple models in regard to different predictions is adamant for their further potential use in management be it scenario calculations or data worth analysis acknowledgments this work was funded by the german research foundation grant wo

697,the exchange of surface and subsurface waters plays an important role in understanding and predicting large scale transport processes in streams and rivers accurately capturing the influence of small scale features associated with turbulent dispersion on exchange in an upscaled framework is necessary for developing reliable predictive models at the reach scale in this work we use high fidelity direct numerical simulations dns to fully resolve turbulent flow and hyporheic exchange in an open channel we parameterize a 2d particle tracking model with the average dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles breakthrough curves and rate of surface mass loss to the subsurface in both models agree after a sufficient distance downstream from particle injection finally we find that the travel time distance joint pdf contains enough information to parameterize a 1d dual domain coupled continuous time random walk ddc ctrw model that successfully reproduces the behavior of both the dns and the 2d particle tracking model allowing accurate prediction of breakthrough curves predicting breakthrough curves with a fully parameterized ddc ctrw reduces cpu time by orders of magnitude when compared with dns keywords hyporheic exchange transport ctrw direct numerical simulation 1 introduction streams and rivers play a fundamental role in transporting minerals nutrients and other solutes across local to continental scales thereby integrating the biological chemical and geologic processes of watersheds battin et al 2009 boano et al 2014 gooseff 2010 modeling transport of these materials in river systems is especially challenging because the physical processes controlling macro scale transport range from the sediment to the stream reach scale and resolving all of these scales is far too costly of particular significance is the interaction of fast moving surface waters with underlying slow hyporheic flow which delays downstream transport and enhances biological processing of nutrients boano et al 2014 wÃ¶rman et al 2002 this exchange of water across the sediment water interface swi into and out of the hyporheic zone the subsurface region penetrated by surface waters must be captured in upscaled modeling frameworks if we hope to advance predictive transport models at the stream reach scale and above classical open channel flow theory assumes an impermeable boundary at the swi allowing one to treat transport in rivers as a fickian process described with an advection dispersion equation ade as first derived by g i taylor in taylor 1954 however decades of experimental observations in rivers and streams show that this assumption is consistently violated aubeneau et al 2014 gonzÃ¡lez pinzÃ³n et al 2013 haggerty et al 2000 harvey et al 1996 in reality solutes in the water column and hyporehic zone are mixed by molecular diffusion and mechanical turbulent dispersion voermans et al 2018 due to such exchange solute is retained in the slower moving pore waters for long time scales leading to large scale anomalous transport which is transport that cannot be described with a traditional one dimensional fickian ade model aubeneau et al 2014 benson et al 2001 haggerty et al 2001 in field scale conservative tracer experiments observed breakthrough curves btcs which measure the temporal evolution of in stream solute concentration display anomalous transport as persistent power law tailing behavior resulting in an elevated concentration at late times relative to an ade prediction haggerty et al 2002 additionally measured btcs can exhibit an apparent mass loss to the subsurface wlostowski et al 2016 suggesting solute remains in the sediment bed for timescales that far exceed those in the surface channel among other state of the art modeling approaches continuous time random walks ctrw have been shown to sufficiently describe anomalous transport in a broad range of hydrologic systems berkowitz et al 2006 berkowitz and scher 2009 cortis and birkholzer 2008 in a ctrw framework a solute plume is conceptualized as an infinite number of particles that jump through time and space with spatial and temporal increments l and Ï respectively sampled from a distribution Ï l Ï particle travel times and distances are often assumed to be decoupled and successive jumps uncorrelated berkowitz et al 2006 in systems that demonstrate strong velocity correlations the uncorrelated assumption can be relaxed and an additional correlation parameter can be included to capture persistent behavior bolster et al 2014 borgne et al 2008 kang et al 2014 sherman et al 2017 the ctrw framework was first applied to river systems in boano et al 2007 where they investigated the effects of residence time distribution in the hyporheic zone on btcs as applied in their framework particle travel times and distances are assumed independent i e uncoupled Ï l t Î» l Ï t where Î» l is a jump length distribution and Ï t is a wait time distribution particles only move when in the water column meaning subsurface longitudinal travel distances are assumed to be insignificant relative to travel distances in the stream the model has been used to successfully describe both solute and fine particle transport in streams drummond et al 2014 stonedahl et al 2012 however the uncoupled assumption may not reflect universal behaviors as high streamwise velocities in highly permeable beds can allow particles to travel significant distances in the subsurface roche et al 2018 to overcome this possible limitation we propose a dual domain coupled ctrw ddc ctrw model that generalizes previously applied ctrw models by relaxing the independence requirement in this framework solute is conceptualized as a large number of particles but now particle trajectories consist of alternating jumps between the surface and subsurface domains and are sampled from different joint probability density functions for each domain two major benefits of such an approach are i all particles travel at a realistic velocity because time and distance are coupled and ii accounting for streamwise particle fluxes in the hyporehic zone allows a particle s first passage across a plane to occur while in the subsurface this causes an apparent surface mass loss that is observed in breakthrough curve measurements and cannot occur if the subsurface is considered as entirely immobile we compare btc predictions from our ddc ctrw upscaled model with results obtained from a high fidelity turbulence resolving direct numerical simulation dns gonzÃ¡lez et al 2017 park et al 2018 we also parameterize a two dimensional lagrangian particle tracking open channel flow model aquino et al 2015 aubeneau et al 2014 li et al 2017 from the spatio temporally averaged dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles and track particle travel times and distances to create joint probabilty density distributions for the surface and subsurface domains these pdfs act as inputs for our 1d ddc ctrw framework which allows us to make predictions of dns measurements at significantly reduced computational cost with this work we aim to answer the following questions does an idealized 2d particle tracking model faithfully portray transport in a fully turbulent system and what statistics from the 2d model are required to accurately estimate dns measurements with a 1d upscaled framework 2 model frameworks we model solute transport in an idealized stream with a 3d dns a 2d particle tracking simulation henceforth referred to as the 2d model and the new 1d ddc ctrw computational cost decreases from 3d to 1d and so we investigate the statistics needed to properly reduce the full 3d flow simulation to a 1d downstream transport model the stream reach is idealized as a straight open channel with an underlying sediment bed exerting a uniform drag on the flow the sediment bed has infinite depth and subsurface flow approaches a darcy velocity with increasing streambed depth i e the average velocity when an applied pressure gradient balances sediment resistance solute is conceptualized as an ensemble of infinitesimal massless particles that are simultaneously released from a point at the swi 2 1 3d direct numerical simulation to numerically model turbulent exchange between the surface and subsurface we utilize dns coupled with lagrangian tracers in a system designed to mimic free stream wall bounded turbulence above a porous substrate the dns solves the navier stokes equations for fluid mass and momentum conservation and in the free stream resolves all scales of motion on the computational grid the governing mass and momentum equations are given by 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 Ï p Î½ 2 u f sed where fsed is a resistance force applied below z 0 to mimic sediment 3 f sed 0 z 0 c d h f s u u z 0 hence the subsurface is considered as a continuum similar to a darcy model but with the drag coefficient representing flow resistance rather than directly resolving flow on the scale of individual sediment grains i e between spaces in the porous media we treat the subsurface as a continuous source of resistance for the flow similarly to how vegetation canopies are represented in atmospheric boundary layer models finnigan et al 2009 in this way coupling between the turbulent surface flow and the subsurface is done continuously the incompressible flow solver uses a pseudospectral discretization in the horizontal directions x and y and second order finite differencing in the vertical the code is well established routinely used for studying turbulent flow and has been validated and tested for grid convergence gonzÃ¡lez et al 2017 richter and sullivan 2013 sweet et al 2018 in the vertical direction grid stretching is used near z 0 to resolve motions in the open channel near the swi i e the wall normal grid spacing Î´z is smaller near the swi than in the upper free stream since vertical gradients are larger there a computational mesh of size 128 128 128 is applied over domain lengths of 2Ï Ï 1 6 hfs where hfs is the height of the free stream portion of the domain the computational domain over which the flow is being solved via dns includes a free stream of height hfs and a portion of the subsurface of depth hsub fig 1 the depth of the subsurface h s u b h f s 0 6 is sufficient to reach steady darcy flow beneath the turbulent free stream in the flow calculation therefore z h s u b is merely a computational boundary for the flow solver and the flow is assumed to be steady and uniform beneath this depth at the top boundary z h f s a free slip boundary condition is applied and a fixed pressure gradient is used to drive flow in the x direction the lateral boundaries are assumed periodic at the bottom boundary of the flow computational domain a free slip boundary condition is imposed with steady darcy flow assumed beneath the computational domain time integration is performed using a third order runge kutta rk3 scheme what results is a three dimensional time dependent turbulent velocity field that is fully resolved in the free stream and gradually transitions to steady darcy flow deep in the subsurface see fig 1 in the following analysis velocities are nondimensionalized by the friction velocity u Ï w Ï where Ïw is the total surface stress felt by the free stream lengths are nondimensionalized by hfs and time is nondimensionalized by t h f s u note that free stream refers to flow above the swi this eulerian velocity field is used to transport random walk particles which

nondimensional uniform dispersion coefficient note that dm is not meant to represent turbulent dispersion turbulence is resolved explicitly in the 3d model in the surface flow particle transport is dominated by turbulent motion and the influence of dm is negligible and thus our use of a uniform dm is effectively only active in the subsurface turbulence strength decreases in the sediment bed and dm plays an important role in transporting particles vertically through the subsurface eq 4 is solved at the end of each full rk3 step of the dns at the top boundary the lagrangian particles are reflected to impose a no flux condition at the bottom of the computational domain z h s u b the particles are free to leave the domain i e they experience an infinitely deep bed and an advection velocity of u u s u b 0 0 is imposed reflecting the steady darcy flow deep in the subsurface here usub is the steady velocity found at the bottom of the eulerian computational domain which reflects the balance between the imposed resistance and the pressure gradient found by solving eqs 1 and 2 the underlying bed is considered infinitely deep with a uniform darcy velocity for the purpose of advecting lagrangian particles beneath the eulerian domain as noted above the dispersion dm is meant to reflect a constant background dispersion either molecular or mechanical since turbulent transport is explicitly resolved as unsteady advection of the particles additional details on the combined eulerian lagrangian computational model can be found elsewhere richter and sullivan 2013 sweet et al 2018 as detailed below two primary cases are considered with varying sediment permeability 1 c d 10 which corresponds to a free stream reynolds number of 2500 based on the maximum free stream velocity the stream height hfs and the fluid viscosity Î½ and 2 c d 100 which corresponds to a free stream reynolds number of 3500 similarly we find the permeability reynolds number based on

that exchange at the swi is dominated by turbulent motions as opposed to mechanical dispersion voermans et al 2017 in each case a total particle number of n p 10 5 is used and the simulations are

that is fully resolved we obtain a statistically steady velocity field from which a mean velocity profile u z and a scalar diffusivity profile k z can be obtained the scalar diffusivity is calculated directly from the scalar flux and mean scalar gradient in the dns k z w c z c where c and c are the fluctuating and average scalar concentrations and w is the fluctuation of the z velocity component in the dns here overbars refer to averaging in both the horizontal directions x and y and in time and fluctuations from this average are denoted with primes these spatio temporally averaged profiles

done to be consistent with how btcs are calcualted in the dns 2 3 1d ddc ctrw in a ctrw framework particle trajectories are sampled from a travel time distance pdf Ï l Ï typically the ctrw is simplified by decoupling time and distance berkowitz et al 2006 the ctrw framework has been particularly successful for predicting transport through geologic formations and other porous media however such an approach may be limited for the open channel and hyporheic exchange systems under consideration here because treating the entire surface subsurface continuum with a single distribution makes it impossible to distinguish whether particles cross a control plane in the surface or subsurface as no information related to a particle s transverse position is predicted to overcome these challenges we introduce a ddc ctrw in the ddc ctrw we conceptualize a particle s trajectory as a series of jumps alternating between the subsurface and surface i e after each jump the particle exchanges between the surface and subsurface compartments with probability 1 this reflects the fact that a jump encompasses a particle s entire trajectory between successive exchange events in each jump particles traverse a distance l in time Ï which are coupled and probabilistically sampled from a joint pdf let Ïw l Ï and Ïs l Ï be the surface and subsurface time distance joint pdfs respectively then Ïd l Ï is the set including the joint pdfs for both the surface and subsurface Ï d l Ï Ï w l Ï Ï s l Ï Ïd is the only input parameter required to run the ddc ctrw in this study we construct Ïd by tracking the traverse time and distance of each particle between exchange events in the particle tracking simulations an exchange event occurs when a particle crosses the swi we refer to a particle s entire trajectory between exchange events as an excursion the 2d and dns particle tracking simulations described in the previous section allow for separate estimations of Ïd which enables us to observe the influence of short time scale coherent turbulence structures on the joint pdfs finding the joint pdfs using the 2d model offers a significant computational advantage when compared with the dns again we discretize a solute plume into a large number of particles n p 10 5 the trajectory of particle i on the n 1 model step follows a langevin equation 6 x i n 1 x i n l

randomly sampled from a corresponding joint pdf the distribution that is sampled alternates between Ïw and Ïs to represent hyporheic exchange e g the n 1 model step must sample from Ïw if model step n sampled from Ïs and vice versa consistent with the dns particles at t 0 are released at the swi x 0 for simplicity we assume that diffusion and dispersion transport an equal number of particles to the surface and subsurface during the first model step i e there is a 50 50 split of particles in each surface subsurface compartment however the ddc ctrw first step assumption can easily be relaxed to fit any initial condition dns simulations show that the 50 50 assumption is not correct because the resistance of the subsurface bed preferentially directs particles to the surface at the first step 60 of particles enter the surface for both drag coefficients because z k z i is positive at the swi however we also tested an initial condition that matches the dns surface subsurface mass distribution at the first model step and found that this initial condition only affected the surface subsurface mass distribution at early times and not downstream transport i e btcs at each model step we store a particle s position total travel time and the traverse time and distance of its previous excursion this framework enables prediction of btcs at downstream position Ï let f be

coefficients are considered in the dns framework c d 10 and c d 100 resulting in the ratio of mean channel to mean subsurface velocity being approximately 20 and 90 respectively these ratios are consistent with btcs measured from pulse experiments in streams with cobble and pea gravel substrates aubeneau et al 2016 where the surface to subsurface velocity ratio approximately equal to the ratio of latest arrival time to arrival of peak concentration ranged from o 10 o 100 the effective permeability of the subsurface in the low drag case is 3 2 times greater than the high drag case the lower permeability bed of the c d 100 case more rapidly removes turbulent momentum from the flow thereby causing a more rapid decay of mean streamwise velocity and scalar diffusivity with increasing depth in the streambed fig 2 the non darcy velocity portion of the bed experiences increased turbulence in the c d 10 case demonstrated by a permeability reynolds number r e k 300 vs r e k 165 for the high drag case note that bed turbulence is significantly weaker than in the free stream where the reynolds numbers are approximately an order of magnitude larger the dns snapshot fig 1 illustrates the presence of coherent structures near the bed as given by local rotation of the fluid motion these structures enable rapid transport across the swi and in the mean sense are responsible for the turbulent flux of scalar w c naturally the structures are only temporary as the turbulent flow is constantly evolving such coherent 3d motions are inherently absent in the 2d model as the scalar diffusivity parameter represents the time average of turbulent fluctuations in scalar concentration as such the 2d and therefore 1d model is unable to accurately represent scalar transport at timescales shorter than the characteristic lifetime of these structures the timescale in which coherent turbulent structures dictate particle motions is estimated by calculating the autocorrelation of velocity fluctuations at the swi fig 3 velocity fluctuations become uncorrelated at roughly 0 7 and 0 35 nondimensional times for the c d 10 100 cases hence for a stream with a depth of o 10 cm and u of o 1 cm s as observed in packman and mackay 2003 the lifetime of a turbulent structure is only of order 1 10s structures in the c d 10 case have longer lifetimes near the swi due to the smaller bed resistance the 2d model is only valid when averaged over many coherent motions at which time the motion becomes decorrelated 3 2 dns vs 2d particle tracking model 3 2 1 joint pdfs particle trajectory comparison we observe the influence of coherent turbulent structures on particle excursions by comparing the travel time distance joint pdfs from the dns and 2d model these are computed in both models by calculating the time and streamwise distance traveled by each particle during each surface or subsurface excursion the general shape of both the surface and subsurface 2d joint pdfs match well with the dns pdfs for each drag case fig 4 differences between models are most pronounced for particle excursions less than the time scale of velocity decorrelation seen as a widening of the distribution in distance for a corresponding travel time in the dns as excursion travel time increases trajectories asymptotically approach a corresponding distance governed by an effective velocity this is clearly evident in all subsurface pdfs where particles can remain in the turbulence free portion of the subsurface for long times and motion is dominated by the mean darcy velocity in the surface flow the range of travel distances at large times t 1 is greater than in the subsurface because both channel turbulence and the average velocity is substantially stronger in the surface e g at t 1 in the c d 10 case travel distances range from 1 4 to 7 7 in the surface while subsurface distances range from only 0 08 to 1 coherent turbulent dispersive effects begin to average to a mean dispersion as distance from the particle source increases and so particle transport begins to resemble transport governed by the mean velocity field and mean turbulent dispersion profile in both domains of the dns and 2d model turbulent coherent structures have a greater relative impact on particle excursions at early times because particles do not have ample time to sample the flow field these coherent structures present in the dns but not in the 2d model due to averaging cause a wider distribution in travel distance for all timescales in the dns this is especially noticeable in the surface where turbulence is stronger despite neglecting these structures the 2d model and dns excursion distributions share a similar shape meaning the ddc ctrw can be accurately parameterized with the 2d model 3 2 2 hyporheic exchange comparison we observe hyporheic exchange by measuring the percent of particles in both the surface and subsurface domain over time for the dns and 2d model fig 5 the 2d model does not agree with the dns at short times t 1 because short time transport is controlled by turbulent coherent structures in the dns particles carried by these structures are correlated until approximately one non dimensional time scale t t and these correlations violate the underlying description of particle motion in the 2d model eq 5 the decreased increased percent subsurface mass at early times is attributed to local turbulent coherent structures sweeping particles out of into the subsurface for the c d 10 c d 100 case the location and timing of specific sweeping events varies by dns realization so early behavior in percent surface mass fig 5 is highly dependent on the time and location of initial particle release note that due to computational constraints we only conduct one dns realization as time increases in both models the total mass in the surface decreases because the infinite bed allows particles to reside in the subsurface for long durations the taylor dispersion timescale the characteristic time for a solute to fully sample the velocity field is defined as Ï t a 2 d t where a is a characteristic length scale and dt is the dispersion coefficient we calculate dt as the vertically averaged surface dispersion from the 2d model and a as the channel depth hfs Ï t 11 1 24 9 in the surface for the c d 10 100 cases respectively at times greater than Ït the mass transfer rates across the swi in the two models are consistent demonstrated by the nearly identical slopes of percent mass over time fig 5 thus after a sufficient time approximately equal to a taylor timescale the hyporheic exchange rate in the dns can be accurately estimated with mean scalar diffusivity and velocity profiles 3 3 ddc ctrw breakthrough curve predictions for both the dns and 2d pdf inputs the predicted btcs from the ddc ctrw closely match the dns btcs fig 6 especially as distance from the particle source increases this convergence is expected because as downstream distance increases particles have more time to sample the velocity field resulting in motion that closely resembles one governed by mean velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles as distance from the source increases single coherent turbulent structures have a reduced impact on macro scale transport because their effects are averaged out we compare btc agreement by calculating the first second and third centered temporal moments representing the mean arrival the variance and skewness respectively fig 7 the first temporal moment is calculated as m 1 t c t d t and the ith centered moment is defined as m i t m 1 i c t d t for i 1 there is excellent agreement of moments at far downstream locations and greater deviation near the location of initial particle release note that btcs from the ddc ctrw and the 2d model are nearly identical results not shown this suggests that at a sufficiently large distance from the solute source the 2d model and ddc ctrw both accurately represent the distribution of arrival times calculated in the dns a normalized mean squared error mse is calculated between ddc ctrw btc predictions and dns simulations at control plane j as m s e 1 a b t c j n i 1 n c t i d n s c t i d d c c t r w 2 where a b t c j is the area under the btc at control plane j n is the number of dns time steps and c ti is the particle concentration at time step i calculated from simulated btcs the greatest mse occurs at the first two control plane locations x 12 6 and x 23 1 fig 8 predicted peak concentration also shows the most significant deviation from the dns at these control planes we find a characteristic length scale lt where sufficient statistical sampling will have occurred for an ensemble representation to hold by multiplying the taylor timescale by a mean velocity we define l w u w h f s 2 k w as the distance at which particles have fully sampled the surface velocity distribution where u w is the vertically averaged mean surface velocity and k w is the vertically averaged mean surface scalar diffusivity in our simulations l w 61 128 for the c d 10 100 cases respectively corresponding to where the rate of decrease in mse with distance begins to temper in both drag cases particle concentration near the btc peak is approximately equal between the ddc ctrw and dns models at distances exceeding x 78 similar to what is expected from the characteristic length lw fig 6 the shape of btcs near peak concentration is dominated by surface flow where as btc power law tailing is dominated by particles being retained in the slower moving subsurface we find an additional taylor like length scale over the entire water column and the portion of the bed penetrated by turbulence h f s h s u b as l s h 147 307 for the c d 10 100 cases respectively the model agreement for tailing of the ddc ctrw with the dns occurs at close proximity to these estimated length scales at distances less than these lengths the ddc ctrw model overpredicts concentrations in power law tails because the particle excursion distributions have not yet converged to the input pdf parameters 3 3 1 ddc ctrw sensitivity to subsurface travel distances to test the sensitivity of model outputs to subsurface travel distances we rerun the ddc ctrw with a mean subsurface velocity that is we again parameterize the ddc ctrw with the surface travel time distance pdf but now only sample a subsurface travel time with a corresponding distance calculated as the selected time multiplied by the mean subsurface velocity usub in this parameterization scheme there is virtually no difference in predicted btcs from the mean subsurface ddc ctrw with the ddc ctrw parameterized with the 2d model pdfs fig 9 in our systems this agreement is expected because travel distances are negligible at small subsurface residence times and particle travel velocity asymptotically approaches the mean subsurface velocity with increasing excursion time fig 4 the increased range in surface travel distances at large times makes the analogous argument invalid for the surface case as the finite depth of the channel makes it nearly impossible for particles to remain in the surface long enough to all approach the same mean velocity furthermore we test a ctrw framework where particles sample the same surface and subsurface travel times as the ddc ctrw but now particles all travel according to a mean surface and mean subsurface velocity for the respective domains the mean surface velocity is the vertically averaged channel velocity u 1 h f s 0 h f s u z d z and the subsurface velocity is again the darcy velocity the dashed lines in fig 9 show btc predictions with this framework the btc peak is the area most affected by the surface flow neglecting surface velocity variations reduces the range of possible particle trajectories which manifests as a narrowing of btc peak widths enforcing a mean velocity also prevents particles from persisting in the fastest velocities of the flow and so the earliest arrival times are delayed the turbulent nature of the surface flow suggests transverse velocity variations should be considered in a 1d framework for accurate representation of btc peak concentration at the scales of interest considered in this study we also predict btcs with a mobile immobile ctrw that neglects travel distances in the subsurface fig 6 bottom row an assumption consistent with the framework most typically applied to date boano et al 2007 in this model surface trajectories and subsurface travel times are identical to those used in the ddc ctrw model based on the dns simulation but subsurface particle travel distances are set to zero so that particles in the subsurface do not advect downstream this model also effectively captures breakthrough of peak concentrations as particle trajectories with these arrival times are dominated by the surface flow field in contrast late time tailing is drastically overestimated because mass cannot cross btc control planes while in the subsurface manifesting as late time breakthrough which otherwise would have occurred in the subsurface roche et al 2017 in the dns breakthrough curves truncate at approximately Ï usub where Ï is the downstream position and usub is the darcy velocity this truncation is captured when subsurface velocity is incorporated into the ctrw framework as done in the ddc ctrw these results demonstrate that when the ratio of surface to subsurface velocity is low i e o 10 or less subsurface velocities may significantly impact late time arrival as both the distance from the source and the surface to subsurface velocity ratio increase treating the subsurface as an immobile zone becomes more reasonable in the c d 100 case when the surface to subsurface velocity ratio is o 100 this mobile immobile ctrw accurately predicts btcs at the farthest distances considered in our simulations hence subsurface advection should be accounted for at the lengths scales considered in this study when the surface to subsurface velocity ratio is less than o 100 additionally as the distance from the particle source increases the surface btc truncation time also increases and therefore considering the subsurface as entirely immobile becomes a more reasonable assumption subsurface travel distances may be neglected as the ratio of surface to subsurface velocity increases because surface flow plays an increasing role in streamwise transport we apply our ddc ctrw to investigate the effect of subsurface velocity on apparent surface btc mass loss by measuring the percent of injected particles that crosses in the surface at each btc plane for different ratios of mean surface to subsurface velocities fig 10 in this analysis the ddc ctrw inputs are the c d 10 surface joint pdf and the c d 10 travel time pdf with distances found using the mean velocity method described previously when the surface to subsurface mean velocity ratio exceeds 500 less than 2 of mass propagates past btc control planes in the subsurface at downstream distances surpassing 1000 non dimensional lengths however at a ratio of 20 7 5 times as many particles 15 cross the btc control plane while in the subsurface at the same distance incorporating subsurface trajectories into a modeling framework becomes increasingly important as subsurface velocities increase which increases with bed permeability and the hydraulic gradient a benefit of this proposed ddc ctrw is that it generalizes previous frameworks and can easily reduce to a mobile immobile model 3 4 computational benefits and limitations upscaled modeling frameworks provide an obvious computational advantage over dns because they do not resolve all scales of turbulent motion we compare computational cost by cpu hours the total time to complete a simulation multiplied by the number of cores in this study the dns run time using 105 particles was o 10 000 cpu hours which took weeks to complete using a 64 core intel ivy bridge computational cluster the corresponding 2d simulation run time was o 10 cpu hours and the corresponding ddc ctrw run time was o 0 01 cpu hours however both the 2d model and ddc ctrw require model input parameters which are directly or indirectly calculated from the dns therefore the full reduction in computational cost offered by the ddc ctrw is only truly achieved if input parameters are known a priori to dns note that the mean dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles converge after o 1 000 cpu hours this drastic reduction in run time demonstrates the potential benefits of the ddc ctrw framework but estimating input parameters without relying on higher dimensional particle tracking simulations remains an open question one possible method for parameterizing the subsurface joint pdf is to estimate subsurface residence time with a truncated power law distribution boano et al 2007 and then advect particles with a darcy velocity a paramterization scheme such as a noise driven mass balance model aquino et al 2017 may be better suited to estimate the surface joint pdf because it captures surface velocity fluctuations which are important for capturing peak btc concentration paramterizing the ddc ctrw with these methods remain untested and warrants further investigation even without a priori knowledge of model input parameters the ddc ctrw still offers a significant computational advantage over dns because the input travel time distance joint pdfs can be calculated prior to completion of a full dns run since the mean dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles converge after o 1 000 cpu hours only a portion of the dns needs to be completed to parametrize the 2d model given the 2d model is initialized with a large number of particles we only need to calculate travel time and distance of the first surface and subsurface excursion for each particle to estimate the ddc ctrw input joint pdfs meaning that again the 2d model does not need to be run until completion thus with this methodology we can still parameterize the ddc ctrw and accurately predict dns btcs at a significantly reduced computational cost as with any successful modeling effort the system under consideration must satisfy the assumptions embedded into the model framework the ddc ctrw assumes that joint pdf input parameters do not change in time and space i e stationary homogeneous turbulence with a constant channel geometry and permeability our idealized river system satisfies these assumptions and therefore produces excellent agreement between ddc ctrw predictions with dns btcs given the highly dynamic nature of real streams and rivers coupled with a changing bed geometry the length and time scales that meet these assumptions must be considered however parameterizing such dynamical behavior is a limitation that all current state of the art effective models suffer from despite the ddc ctrw s limitations it carries obvious computational advantages over turbulence resolving dns experiments and can help advance the understanding of underlying physical processes controlling transport as they are inferred from btcs specifically a ddc ctrw framework helps quantify the length scales at which subsurface advection must be accounted for and the evolution of solute in the subsurface through space and time 4 conclusions in this study we find that the surface and subsurface joint travel time distance pdfs provide enough information to accurately portray hyporheic exchange and transport in an idealized open channel system we leverage such data in a ddc ctrw framework and accurately predict btcs of the high fidelity turbulence resolving dns after a sufficient distance which is defined as a taylor like length scale the ddc ctrw allows mass to advect downstream while in the subsurface which has been neglected in most models to date we find that when the ratio of surface to subsurface velocity is of o 10 subsurface advection must be considered in an upscaled framework to accurately predict btc tailing behavior the ddc ctrw framework is especially advantageous because it reduces to a mobile immobile ctrw when streamwise subsurface advection is ignored but by incorporating both subsurface and surface advection it can characterize quantities such as the percent of initial mass in the subsurface at a given location such characterization can be important in interpretation and design of experiments where subsurface mass is undetectable in conventional in stream btc measurements furthermore the computational cost of the ddc ctrw is orders of magnitude less than that of a dns and therefore the ddc ctrw is a computationally efficient model which can aid in the understanding of hyporheic exchange and transport in river systems acknowledgments the authors

697,the exchange of surface and subsurface waters plays an important role in understanding and predicting large scale transport processes in streams and rivers accurately capturing the influence of small scale features associated with turbulent dispersion on exchange in an upscaled framework is necessary for developing reliable predictive models at the reach scale in this work we use high fidelity direct numerical simulations dns to fully resolve turbulent flow and hyporheic exchange in an open channel we parameterize a 2d particle tracking model with the average dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles breakthrough curves and rate of surface mass loss to the subsurface in both models agree after a sufficient distance downstream from particle injection finally we find that the travel time distance joint pdf contains enough information to parameterize a 1d dual domain coupled continuous time random walk ddc ctrw model that successfully reproduces the behavior of both the dns and the 2d particle tracking model allowing accurate prediction of breakthrough curves predicting breakthrough curves with a fully parameterized ddc ctrw reduces cpu time by orders of magnitude when compared with dns keywords hyporheic exchange transport ctrw direct numerical simulation 1 introduction streams and rivers play a fundamental role in transporting minerals nutrients and other solutes across local to continental scales thereby integrating the biological chemical and geologic processes of watersheds battin et al 2009 boano et al 2014 gooseff 2010 modeling transport of these materials in river systems is especially challenging because the physical processes controlling macro scale transport range from the sediment to the stream reach scale and resolving all of these scales is far too costly of particular significance is the interaction of fast moving surface waters with underlying slow hyporheic flow which delays downstream transport and enhances biological processing of nutrients boano et al 2014 wÃ¶rman et al 2002 this exchange of water across the sediment water interface swi into and out of the hyporheic zone the subsurface region penetrated by surface waters must be captured in upscaled modeling frameworks if we hope to advance predictive transport models at the stream reach scale and above classical open channel flow theory assumes an impermeable boundary at the swi allowing one to treat transport in rivers as a fickian process described with an advection dispersion equation ade as first derived by g i taylor in taylor 1954 however decades of experimental observations in rivers and streams show that this assumption is consistently violated aubeneau et al 2014 gonzÃ¡lez pinzÃ³n et al 2013 haggerty et al 2000 harvey et al 1996 in reality solutes in the water column and hyporehic zone are mixed by molecular diffusion and mechanical turbulent dispersion voermans et al 2018 due to such exchange solute is retained in the slower moving pore waters for long time scales leading to large scale anomalous transport which is transport that cannot be described with a traditional one dimensional fickian ade model aubeneau et al 2014 benson et al 2001 haggerty et al 2001 in field scale conservative tracer experiments observed breakthrough curves btcs which measure the temporal evolution of in stream solute concentration display anomalous transport as persistent power law tailing behavior resulting in an elevated concentration at late times relative to an ade prediction haggerty et al 2002 additionally measured btcs can exhibit an apparent mass loss to the subsurface wlostowski et al 2016 suggesting solute remains in the sediment bed for timescales that far exceed those in the surface channel among other state of the art modeling approaches continuous time random walks ctrw have been shown to sufficiently describe anomalous transport in a broad range of hydrologic systems berkowitz et al 2006 berkowitz and scher 2009 cortis and birkholzer 2008 in a ctrw framework a solute plume is conceptualized as an infinite number of particles that jump through time and space with spatial and temporal increments l and Ï respectively sampled from a distribution Ï l Ï particle travel times and distances are often assumed to be decoupled and successive jumps uncorrelated berkowitz et al 2006 in systems that demonstrate strong velocity correlations the uncorrelated assumption can be relaxed and an additional correlation parameter can be included to capture persistent behavior bolster et al 2014 borgne et al 2008 kang et al 2014 sherman et al 2017 the ctrw framework was first applied to river systems in boano et al 2007 where they investigated the effects of residence time distribution in the hyporheic zone on btcs as applied in their framework particle travel times and distances are assumed independent i e uncoupled Ï l t Î» l Ï t where Î» l is a jump length distribution and Ï t is a wait time distribution particles only move when in the water column meaning subsurface longitudinal travel distances are assumed to be insignificant relative to travel distances in the stream the model has been used to successfully describe both solute and fine particle transport in streams drummond et al 2014 stonedahl et al 2012 however the uncoupled assumption may not reflect universal behaviors as high streamwise velocities in highly permeable beds can allow particles to travel significant distances in the subsurface roche et al 2018 to overcome this possible limitation we propose a dual domain coupled ctrw ddc ctrw model that generalizes previously applied ctrw models by relaxing the independence requirement in this framework solute is conceptualized as a large number of particles but now particle trajectories consist of alternating jumps between the surface and subsurface domains and are sampled from different joint probability density functions for each domain two major benefits of such an approach are i all particles travel at a realistic velocity because time and distance are coupled and ii accounting for streamwise particle fluxes in the hyporehic zone allows a particle s first passage across a plane to occur while in the subsurface this causes an apparent surface mass loss that is observed in breakthrough curve measurements and cannot occur if the subsurface is considered as entirely immobile we compare btc predictions from our ddc ctrw upscaled model with results obtained from a high fidelity turbulence resolving direct numerical simulation dns gonzÃ¡lez et al 2017 park et al 2018 we also parameterize a two dimensional lagrangian particle tracking open channel flow model aquino et al 2015 aubeneau et al 2014 li et al 2017 from the spatio temporally averaged dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles and track particle travel times and distances to create joint probabilty density distributions for the surface and subsurface domains these pdfs act as inputs for our 1d ddc ctrw framework which allows us to make predictions of dns measurements at significantly reduced computational cost with this work we aim to answer the following questions does an idealized 2d particle tracking model faithfully portray transport in a fully turbulent system and what statistics from the 2d model are required to accurately estimate dns measurements with a 1d upscaled framework 2 model frameworks we model solute transport in an idealized stream with a 3d dns a 2d particle tracking simulation henceforth referred to as the 2d model and the new 1d ddc ctrw computational cost decreases from 3d to 1d and so we investigate the statistics needed to properly reduce the full 3d flow simulation to a 1d downstream transport model the stream reach is idealized as a straight open channel with an underlying sediment bed exerting a uniform drag on the flow the sediment bed has infinite depth and subsurface flow approaches a darcy velocity with increasing streambed depth i e the average velocity when an applied pressure gradient balances sediment resistance solute is conceptualized as an ensemble of infinitesimal massless particles that are simultaneously released from a point at the swi 2 1 3d direct numerical simulation to numerically model turbulent exchange between the surface and subsurface we utilize dns coupled with lagrangian tracers in a system designed to mimic free stream wall bounded turbulence above a porous substrate the dns solves the navier stokes equations for fluid mass and momentum conservation and in the free stream resolves all scales of motion on the computational grid the governing mass and momentum equations are given by 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 Ï p Î½ 2 u f sed where fsed is a resistance force applied below z 0 to mimic sediment 3 f sed 0 z 0 c d h f s u u z 0 hence the subsurface is considered as a continuum similar to a darcy model but with the drag coefficient representing flow resistance rather than directly resolving flow on the scale of individual sediment grains i e between spaces in the porous media we treat the subsurface as a continuous source of resistance for the flow similarly to how vegetation canopies are represented in atmospheric boundary layer models finnigan et al 2009 in this way coupling between the turbulent surface flow and the subsurface is done continuously the incompressible flow solver uses a pseudospectral discretization in the horizontal directions x and y and second order finite differencing in the vertical the code is well established routinely used for studying turbulent flow and has been validated and tested for grid convergence gonzÃ¡lez et al 2017 richter and sullivan 2013 sweet et al 2018 in the vertical direction grid stretching is used near z 0 to resolve motions in the open channel near the swi i e the wall normal grid spacing Î´z is smaller near the swi than in the upper free stream since vertical gradients are larger there a computational mesh of size 128 128 128 is applied over domain lengths of 2Ï Ï 1 6 hfs where hfs is the height of the free stream portion of the domain the computational domain over which the flow is being solved via dns includes a free stream of height hfs and a portion of the subsurface of depth hsub fig 1 the depth of the subsurface h s u b h f s 0 6 is sufficient to reach steady darcy flow beneath the turbulent free stream in the flow calculation therefore z h s u b is merely a computational boundary for the flow solver and the flow is assumed to be steady and uniform beneath this depth at the top boundary z h f s a free slip boundary condition is applied and a fixed pressure gradient is used to drive flow in the x direction the lateral boundaries are assumed periodic at the bottom boundary of the flow computational domain a free slip boundary condition is imposed with steady darcy flow assumed beneath the computational domain time integration is performed using a third order runge kutta rk3 scheme what results is a three dimensional time dependent turbulent velocity field that is fully resolved in the free stream and gradually transitions to steady darcy flow deep in the subsurface see fig 1 in the following analysis velocities are nondimensionalized by the friction velocity u Ï w Ï where Ïw is the total surface stress felt by the free stream lengths are nondimensionalized by hfs and time is nondimensionalized by t h f s u note that free stream refers to flow above the swi this eulerian velocity field is used to transport random walk particles which

nondimensional uniform dispersion coefficient note that dm is not meant to represent turbulent dispersion turbulence is resolved explicitly in the 3d model in the surface flow particle transport is dominated by turbulent motion and the influence of dm is negligible and thus our use of a uniform dm is effectively only active in the subsurface turbulence strength decreases in the sediment bed and dm plays an important role in transporting particles vertically through the subsurface eq 4 is solved at the end of each full rk3 step of the dns at the top boundary the lagrangian particles are reflected to impose a no flux condition at the bottom of the computational domain z h s u b the particles are free to leave the domain i e they experience an infinitely deep bed and an advection velocity of u u s u b 0 0 is imposed reflecting the steady darcy flow deep in the subsurface here usub is the steady velocity found at the bottom of the eulerian computational domain which reflects the balance between the imposed resistance and the pressure gradient found by solving eqs 1 and 2 the underlying bed is considered infinitely deep with a uniform darcy velocity for the purpose of advecting lagrangian particles beneath the eulerian domain as noted above the dispersion dm is meant to reflect a constant background dispersion either molecular or mechanical since turbulent transport is explicitly resolved as unsteady advection of the particles additional details on the combined eulerian lagrangian computational model can be found elsewhere richter and sullivan 2013 sweet et al 2018 as detailed below two primary cases are considered with varying sediment permeability 1 c d 10 which corresponds to a free stream reynolds number of 2500 based on the maximum free stream velocity the stream height hfs and the fluid viscosity Î½ and 2 c d 100 which corresponds to a free stream reynolds number of 3500 similarly we find the permeability reynolds number based on the effective permeability of the bed k calculated assuming darcy flow deep in the bed i e u s u b k d p d x and the friction velocity u to be r e k k u Î½ 300 165 for c d 10 100 cases this ensures that exchange at the swi is dominated by turbulent motions as opposed to mechanical dispersion voermans et al 2017 in each case a total particle number of n p 10 5 is used and the simulations are advanced for 3 106 time steps statistics are taken only after a stationary turbulent flow field is developed and all particles are initialized at the same time and same location x p t 0 0 Î³ 0 where

that is fully resolved we obtain a statistically steady velocity field from which a mean velocity profile u z and a scalar diffusivity profile k z can be obtained the scalar diffusivity is calculated directly from the scalar flux and mean scalar gradient in the dns k z w c z c where c and c are the fluctuating and average scalar concentrations and w is the fluctuation of the z velocity component in the dns here overbars refer to averaging in both the horizontal directions x and y and in time and fluctuations from this average are denoted with primes these spatio temporally averaged profiles are used to parameterize a 2d particle tracking model as with the dns solute is conceptualized as a collection of point particles particle i at time t follows a trajectory given by the following

done to be consistent with how btcs are calcualted in the dns 2 3 1d ddc ctrw in a ctrw framework particle trajectories are sampled from a travel time distance pdf Ï l Ï typically the ctrw is simplified by decoupling time and distance berkowitz et al 2006 the ctrw framework has been particularly successful for predicting transport through geologic formations and other porous media however such an approach may be limited for the open channel and hyporheic exchange systems under consideration here because treating the entire surface subsurface continuum with a single distribution makes it impossible to distinguish whether particles cross a control plane in the surface or subsurface as no information related to a particle s transverse position is predicted to overcome these challenges we introduce a ddc ctrw in the ddc ctrw we conceptualize a particle s trajectory as a series of jumps alternating between the subsurface and surface i e after each jump the particle exchanges between the surface and subsurface compartments with probability 1 this reflects the fact that a jump encompasses a particle s entire trajectory between successive exchange events in each jump particles traverse a distance l in time Ï which are coupled and probabilistically sampled from a joint pdf let Ïw l Ï and Ïs l Ï be the surface and subsurface time distance joint pdfs respectively then Ïd l Ï is the set including the joint pdfs for both the surface and subsurface Ï d l Ï Ï w l Ï Ï s l Ï Ïd is the only input parameter required to run the ddc ctrw in this study we construct Ïd by tracking the traverse time and distance of each particle between exchange events in the particle tracking simulations an exchange event occurs when a particle crosses the swi we refer to a particle s entire trajectory between exchange events as an excursion the 2d and dns particle tracking simulations described in the previous section allow for separate estimations of Ïd which enables us to observe the influence of short time scale coherent turbulence structures on the joint pdfs finding the joint pdfs using the 2d model offers a significant computational advantage when compared with the dns again we discretize a solute plume into a large number of particles n p 10 5 the trajectory of particle i on the n 1 model step follows a langevin equation 6 x i n 1 x i n l

step n sampled from Ïs and vice versa consistent with the dns particles at t 0 are released at the swi x 0 for simplicity we assume that diffusion and dispersion transport an equal number of particles to the surface and subsurface during the first model step i e there is a 50 50 split of particles in each surface subsurface compartment however the ddc ctrw first step assumption can easily be relaxed to fit any initial condition dns simulations show that the 50 50 assumption is not correct because the resistance of the subsurface bed preferentially directs particles to the surface at the first step 60 of particles enter the surface for both drag coefficients because z k z i is positive at the swi however we also tested an initial condition that matches the dns surface subsurface mass distribution at the first model step and found that this initial condition only affected the surface subsurface mass distribution at early times and not downstream transport i e btcs at each

coefficients are considered in the dns framework c d 10 and c d 100 resulting in the ratio of mean channel to mean subsurface velocity being approximately 20 and 90 respectively these ratios are consistent with btcs measured from pulse experiments in streams with cobble and pea gravel substrates aubeneau et al 2016 where the surface to subsurface velocity ratio approximately equal to the ratio of latest arrival time to arrival of peak concentration ranged from o 10 o 100 the effective permeability of the subsurface in the low drag case is 3 2 times greater than the high drag case the lower permeability bed of the c d 100 case more rapidly removes turbulent momentum from the flow thereby causing a more rapid decay of mean streamwise velocity and scalar diffusivity with increasing depth in the streambed fig 2 the non darcy velocity portion of the bed experiences increased turbulence in the c d 10 case demonstrated by a permeability reynolds number r e k 300 vs r e k 165 for the high drag case note that bed turbulence is significantly weaker than in the free stream where the reynolds numbers are approximately an order of magnitude larger the dns snapshot fig 1 illustrates the presence of coherent structures near the bed as given by local rotation of the fluid motion these structures enable rapid transport across the swi and in the mean sense are responsible for the turbulent flux of scalar w c naturally the structures are only temporary as the turbulent flow is constantly evolving such coherent 3d motions are inherently absent in the 2d model as the scalar diffusivity parameter represents the time average of turbulent fluctuations in scalar concentration as such the 2d and therefore 1d model is unable to accurately represent scalar transport at timescales shorter than the characteristic lifetime of these structures the timescale in which coherent turbulent structures dictate particle motions is estimated by calculating the autocorrelation of velocity fluctuations at the swi fig 3 velocity fluctuations become uncorrelated at roughly 0 7 and 0 35 nondimensional times for the c d 10 100 cases hence for a stream with a depth of o 10 cm and u of o 1 cm s as observed in packman and mackay 2003 the lifetime of a turbulent structure is only of order 1 10s structures in the c d 10 case have longer lifetimes near the swi due to the smaller bed resistance the 2d model is only valid when averaged over many coherent motions at which time the motion becomes decorrelated 3 2 dns vs 2d particle tracking model 3 2 1 joint pdfs particle trajectory comparison we observe the influence of coherent turbulent structures on particle excursions by comparing the travel time distance joint pdfs from the dns and 2d model these are computed in both models by calculating the time and streamwise distance traveled by each particle during each surface or subsurface excursion the general shape of both the surface and subsurface 2d joint pdfs match well with the dns pdfs for each drag case fig 4 differences between models are most pronounced for particle excursions less than the time scale of velocity decorrelation seen as a widening of the distribution in distance for a corresponding travel time in the dns as excursion travel time increases trajectories asymptotically approach a corresponding distance governed by an effective velocity this is clearly evident in all subsurface pdfs where particles can remain in the turbulence free portion of the subsurface for long times and motion is dominated by the mean darcy velocity in the surface flow the range of travel distances at large times t 1 is greater than in the subsurface because both channel turbulence and the average velocity is substantially stronger in the surface e g at t 1 in the c d 10 case travel distances range from 1 4 to 7 7 in the surface while subsurface distances range from only 0 08 to 1 coherent turbulent dispersive effects begin to average to a mean dispersion as distance from the particle source increases and so particle transport begins to resemble transport governed by the mean velocity field and mean turbulent dispersion profile in both domains of the dns and 2d model turbulent coherent structures have a greater relative impact on particle excursions at early times because particles do not have ample time to sample the flow field these coherent structures present in the dns but not in the 2d model due to averaging cause a wider distribution in travel distance for all timescales in the dns this is especially noticeable in the surface where turbulence is stronger despite neglecting these structures the 2d model and dns excursion distributions share a similar shape meaning the ddc ctrw can be accurately parameterized with the 2d model 3 2 2 hyporheic exchange comparison we observe hyporheic exchange by measuring the percent of particles in both the surface and subsurface domain over time for the dns and 2d model fig 5 the 2d model does not agree with the dns at short times t 1 because short time transport is controlled by turbulent coherent structures in the dns particles carried by these structures are correlated until approximately one non dimensional time scale t t and these correlations violate the underlying description of particle motion in the 2d model eq 5 the decreased increased percent subsurface mass at early times is attributed to local turbulent coherent structures sweeping particles out of into the subsurface for the c d 10 c d 100 case the location and timing of specific sweeping events varies by dns realization so early behavior in percent surface mass fig 5 is highly dependent on the time and location of initial particle release note that due to computational constraints we only conduct one dns realization as time increases in both models the total mass in the surface decreases because the infinite bed allows particles to reside in the subsurface for long durations the taylor dispersion timescale the characteristic time for a solute to fully sample the velocity field is defined as Ï t a 2 d t where a is a characteristic length scale and dt is the dispersion coefficient we calculate dt as the vertically averaged surface dispersion from the 2d model and a as the channel depth hfs Ï t 11 1 24 9 in the surface for the c d 10 100 cases respectively at times greater than Ït the mass transfer rates across the swi in the two models are consistent demonstrated by the nearly identical slopes of percent mass over time fig 5 thus after a sufficient time approximately equal to a taylor timescale the hyporheic exchange rate in the dns can be accurately estimated with mean scalar diffusivity and velocity profiles 3 3 ddc ctrw breakthrough curve predictions for both the dns and 2d pdf inputs the predicted btcs from the ddc ctrw closely match the dns btcs fig 6 especially as distance from the particle source increases this convergence is expected because as downstream distance increases particles have more time to sample the velocity field resulting in motion that closely resembles one governed by mean velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles as distance from the source increases single coherent turbulent structures have a reduced impact on macro scale transport because their effects are averaged out we compare btc agreement by calculating the first second and third centered temporal moments representing the mean arrival the variance and skewness respectively fig 7 the first temporal moment is calculated as m 1 t c t d t and the ith centered moment is defined as m i t m 1 i c t d t for i 1 there is excellent agreement of moments at far downstream locations and greater deviation near the location of initial particle release note that btcs from the ddc ctrw and the 2d model are nearly identical results not shown this suggests that at a sufficiently large distance from the solute source the 2d model and ddc ctrw both accurately represent the distribution of arrival times calculated in the dns a normalized mean squared error mse is calculated between ddc ctrw btc predictions and dns simulations at control plane j as m s e 1 a b t c j n i 1 n c t i d n s c t i d d c c t r w 2 where a b t c j is the area under the btc at control plane j n is the number of dns time steps and c ti is the particle concentration at time step i calculated from simulated btcs the greatest mse occurs at the first two control plane locations x 12 6 and x 23 1 fig 8 predicted peak concentration also shows the most significant deviation from the dns at these control planes we find a characteristic length scale lt where sufficient statistical sampling will have occurred for an ensemble representation to hold by multiplying the taylor timescale by a mean velocity we define l w u w h f s 2 k w as the distance at which particles have fully sampled the surface velocity distribution where u w is the vertically averaged mean surface velocity and k w is the vertically averaged mean surface scalar diffusivity in our simulations l w 61 128 for the c d 10 100 cases respectively corresponding to where the rate of decrease in mse with distance begins to temper in both drag cases particle concentration near the btc peak is approximately equal between the ddc ctrw and dns models at distances exceeding x 78 similar to what is expected from the characteristic length lw fig 6 the shape of btcs near peak concentration is dominated by surface flow where as btc power law tailing is dominated by particles being retained in the slower moving subsurface we find an additional taylor like length scale over the entire water column and the portion of the bed penetrated by turbulence h f s h s u b as l s h 147 307 for the c d 10 100 cases respectively the model agreement for tailing of the ddc ctrw with the dns occurs at close proximity to these estimated length scales at distances less than these lengths the ddc ctrw model overpredicts concentrations in power law tails because the particle excursion distributions have not yet converged to the input pdf parameters 3 3 1 ddc ctrw sensitivity to subsurface travel distances to test the sensitivity of model outputs to subsurface travel distances we rerun the ddc ctrw with a mean subsurface velocity that is we again parameterize the ddc ctrw with the surface travel time distance pdf but now only sample a subsurface travel time with a corresponding distance calculated as the selected time multiplied by the mean subsurface velocity usub in this parameterization scheme there is virtually no difference in predicted btcs from the mean subsurface ddc ctrw with the ddc ctrw parameterized with the 2d model pdfs fig 9 in our systems this agreement is expected because travel distances are negligible at small subsurface residence times and particle travel velocity asymptotically approaches the mean subsurface velocity with increasing excursion time fig 4 the increased range in surface travel distances at large times makes the analogous argument invalid for the surface case as the finite depth of the channel makes it nearly impossible for particles to remain in the surface long enough to all approach the same mean velocity furthermore we test a ctrw framework where particles sample the same surface and subsurface travel times as the ddc ctrw but now particles all travel according to a mean surface and mean subsurface velocity for the respective domains the mean surface velocity is the vertically averaged channel velocity u 1 h f s 0 h f s u z d z and the subsurface velocity is again the darcy velocity the dashed lines in fig 9 show btc predictions with this framework the btc peak is the area most affected by the surface flow neglecting surface velocity variations reduces the range of possible particle trajectories which manifests as a narrowing of btc peak widths enforcing a mean velocity also prevents particles from persisting in the fastest velocities of the flow and so the earliest arrival times are delayed the turbulent nature of the surface flow suggests transverse velocity variations should be considered in a 1d framework for accurate representation of btc peak concentration at the scales of interest considered in this study we also predict btcs with a mobile immobile ctrw that neglects travel distances in the subsurface fig 6 bottom row an assumption consistent with the framework most typically applied to date boano et al 2007 in this model surface trajectories and subsurface travel times are identical to those used in the ddc ctrw model based on the dns simulation but subsurface particle travel distances are set to zero so that particles in the subsurface do not advect downstream this model also effectively captures breakthrough of peak concentrations as particle trajectories with these arrival times are dominated by the surface flow field in contrast late time tailing is drastically overestimated because mass cannot cross btc control planes while in the subsurface manifesting as late time breakthrough which otherwise would have occurred in the subsurface roche et al 2017 in the dns breakthrough curves truncate at approximately Ï usub where Ï is the downstream position and usub is the darcy velocity this truncation is captured when subsurface velocity is incorporated into the ctrw framework as done in the ddc ctrw these results demonstrate that when the ratio of surface to subsurface velocity is low i e o 10 or less subsurface velocities may significantly impact late time arrival as both the distance from the source and the surface to subsurface velocity ratio increase treating the subsurface as an immobile zone becomes more reasonable in the c d 100 case when the surface to subsurface velocity ratio is o 100 this mobile immobile ctrw accurately predicts btcs at the farthest distances considered in our simulations hence subsurface advection should be accounted for at the lengths scales considered in this study when the surface to subsurface velocity ratio is less than o 100 additionally as the distance from the particle source increases the surface btc truncation time also increases and therefore considering the subsurface as entirely immobile becomes a more reasonable assumption subsurface travel distances may be neglected as the ratio of surface to subsurface velocity increases because surface flow plays an increasing role in streamwise transport we apply our ddc ctrw to investigate the effect of subsurface velocity on apparent surface btc mass loss by measuring the percent of injected particles that crosses in the surface at each btc plane for different ratios of mean surface to subsurface velocities fig 10 in this analysis the ddc ctrw inputs are the c d 10 surface joint pdf and the c d 10 travel time pdf with distances found using the mean velocity method described previously when the surface to subsurface mean velocity ratio exceeds 500 less than 2 of mass propagates past btc control planes in the subsurface at downstream distances surpassing 1000 non dimensional lengths however at a ratio of 20 7 5 times as many particles 15 cross the btc control plane while in the subsurface at the same distance incorporating subsurface trajectories into a modeling framework becomes increasingly important as subsurface velocities increase which increases with bed permeability and the hydraulic gradient a benefit of this proposed ddc ctrw is that it generalizes previous frameworks and can easily reduce to a mobile immobile model 3 4 computational benefits and limitations upscaled modeling frameworks provide an obvious computational advantage over dns because they do not resolve all scales of turbulent motion we compare computational cost by cpu hours the total time to complete a simulation multiplied by the number of cores in this study the dns run time using 105 particles was o 10 000 cpu hours which took weeks to complete using a 64 core intel ivy bridge computational cluster the corresponding 2d simulation run time was o 10 cpu hours and the corresponding ddc ctrw run time was o 0 01 cpu hours however both the 2d model and ddc ctrw require model input parameters which are directly or indirectly calculated from the dns therefore the full reduction in computational cost offered by the ddc ctrw is only truly achieved if input parameters are known a priori to dns note that the mean dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles converge after o 1 000 cpu hours this drastic reduction in run time demonstrates the potential benefits of the ddc ctrw framework but estimating input parameters without relying on higher dimensional particle tracking simulations remains an open question one possible method for parameterizing the subsurface joint pdf is to estimate subsurface residence time with a truncated power law distribution boano et al 2007 and then advect particles with a darcy velocity a paramterization scheme such as a noise driven mass balance model aquino et al 2017 may be better suited to estimate the surface joint pdf because it captures surface velocity fluctuations which are important for capturing peak btc concentration paramterizing the ddc ctrw with these methods remain untested and warrants further investigation even without a priori knowledge of model input parameters the ddc ctrw still offers a significant computational advantage over dns because the input travel time distance joint pdfs can be calculated prior to completion of a full dns run since the mean dns velocity and scalar diffusivity profiles converge after o 1 000 cpu hours only a portion of the dns needs to be completed to parametrize the 2d model given the 2d model is initialized with a large number of particles we only need to calculate travel time and distance of the first surface and subsurface excursion for each particle to estimate the ddc ctrw input joint pdfs meaning that again the 2d model does not need to be run until completion thus with this methodology we can still parameterize the ddc ctrw and accurately predict dns btcs at a significantly reduced computational cost as with any successful modeling effort the system under consideration must satisfy the assumptions embedded into the model framework the ddc ctrw assumes that joint pdf input parameters do not change in time and space i e stationary homogeneous turbulence with a constant channel geometry and permeability our idealized river system satisfies these assumptions and therefore produces excellent agreement between ddc ctrw predictions with dns btcs given the highly dynamic nature of real streams and rivers coupled with a changing bed geometry the length and time scales that meet these assumptions must be considered however parameterizing such dynamical behavior is a limitation that all current state of the art effective models suffer from despite the ddc ctrw s limitations it carries obvious computational advantages over turbulence resolving dns experiments and can help advance the understanding of underlying physical processes controlling transport as they are inferred from btcs specifically a ddc ctrw framework helps quantify the length scales at which subsurface advection must be accounted for and the evolution of solute in the subsurface through space and time 4 conclusions in this study we find that the surface and subsurface joint travel time distance pdfs provide enough information to accurately portray hyporheic exchange and transport in an idealized open channel system we leverage such data in a ddc ctrw framework and accurately predict btcs of the high fidelity turbulence resolving dns after a sufficient distance which is defined as a taylor like length scale the ddc ctrw allows mass to advect downstream while in the subsurface which has been neglected in most models to date we find that when the ratio of surface to subsurface velocity is of o 10 subsurface advection must be considered in an upscaled framework to accurately predict btc tailing behavior the ddc ctrw framework is especially advantageous because it reduces to a mobile immobile ctrw when streamwise subsurface advection is ignored but by incorporating both subsurface and surface advection it can characterize quantities such as the percent of initial mass in the subsurface at a given location such characterization can be important in interpretation and design of experiments where subsurface mass is undetectable in conventional in stream btc measurements furthermore the computational cost of the ddc ctrw is orders of magnitude less than that of a dns and therefore the ddc ctrw is a computationally efficient model which can aid in the understanding of hyporheic exchange and transport in river systems acknowledgments the authors

698,recent studies have shown that in beach aquifers tide induced upper saline plume usp may become unstable in the form of moving salt fingers under certain hydrogeological conditions however to what extent solute transport in beach aquifers is affected by the unstable flow associated with such salt fingers has not been quantitatively examined despite the implications inferred by these studies this study numerically investigated this problem by considering a land sourced conservative solute plume in a conceptual 2 d beach aquifer the results demonstrate that unstable flow leads to salt fingers that periodically develop from the usp and then move seaward across the intertidal zone compared to the quasi steady usp case unstable flow considerably modifies the migration path of land sourced solute plume towards the sea moving it deeper into the aquifer until reaching the base also unstable flow increases the residence time of the land sourced solute plume in the beach aquifer and causes the solute discharge zone to vary over time and shift from the mean shoreline in the quasi steady usp case to the low tide mark the temporal variations of total solute efflux pattern are also altered by unstable flow changing from a unimodal to a bimodal pattern sensitivity analysis based on dispersivity hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux reveals that the transport path of solute plume is more sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude while the residence time and plume spreading are more sensitive to inland freshwater flux keywords solute transport unstable flow upper saline plume beach aquifers tidal oscillations 1 introduction groundwater flow and salt transport processes in beach aquifers significantly determine the fate of solutes discharging into the sea boufadel et al 2006 li et al 2008 robinson et al 2007a 2007b taniguchi 2002 and so have been studied intensively over the past few decades with a focus on their response to the individual or combined influences of tidal fluctuations boufadel et al 2006 li et al 2008 robinson et al 2007a robinson et al 2007b taniguchi 2002 waves boufadel et al 2007 geng et al 2014

precipitation chaillou et al 2018 geng and boufadel 2017 yu et al 2017 readers may refer to a recent review by robinson et al 2018 for more details tidal forcing is a critical factor for the flow and mixing processes in beach aquifers it can greatly modify the groundwater flow and salt distribution regimes ataie ashtiani et al 1999 boufadel 2000 guo et al 2010 kuan et al 2012 mao et al 2006a mao et al 2006b werner and lockington 2006 tidal oscillations induce hydraulic gradients that drive seawater circulation through the sediment in the intertidal zone forming an upper saline plume usp which is separated from the saltwater wedge sw by a freshwater discharge zone fdz salt distributions across the usp fdz and sw have been measured in the field heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2006 and replicated in numerical simulations evans and wilson 2016 heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 and laboratory experiments e g kuan et al 2012 as a result of higher flow velocities transit time of circulating seawater through the usp is much shorter by two orders of magnitude than that in the sw robinson et al 2007a consequently seawater in the usp is more oxic due to less time available for the microbially mediated consumption of dissolved oxygen in the recirculated seawater slomp and van cappellen 2004 therefore seawater recirculating through the usp modifies the redox potential and overall geochemical conditions of beach aquifers robinson et al 2007a development of the usp depends on tidal forcing aquifer properties hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity beach slope and inland freshwater flux robinson et al 2007a the usp may not form if the beach is absent or in a tidally influenced beach aquifer where the hydraulic conductivity is low the fresh groundwater flux is high or the beach slope is very small e g 0 01 evans and wilson 2016 many studies have explored how tide induced circulation affects the transport of land sourced solutes in beach aquifers laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have shown that the shape and spreading of a land sourced solute plume are significantly affected by tides before discharging to the sea boufadel et al 2006 zhang et al 2001 2002 robinson et al 2007a further demonstrated that tidal seawater circulation within the usp greatly alters the transport pathway of terrestrial derived solutes in the beach aquifer reduces the transfer rate of solutes from the aquifer to coastal water and lowers the discharging solute concentrations the tide induced circulation was also found to enhance greatly the attenuation aerobic biodegradation of btex compounds due to tide driven oxygenation in the usp robinson et al 2009 tide induced circulation also controls land sourced nutrient transport and transformation in beach aquifers and fluxes across the beach face anwar et al 2014 numerically showed that when dissolved organic matter dom is considered tides enhance the mixing between saltwater and freshwater thereby increasing no 3 attenuation by contrast without considering dom tidal oscillations increase the no 3 flux because the newly formed no 3 from increased mixing of o2 and nh 4 in the usp cannot be reduced more recently heiss et al 2017 revealed that the tide driven mixing between saltwater and freshwater facilitates denitrification in the mixing zone around the boundary of the tidal circulation cell usp with the denitrification rates decreasing monotonically from the landward side to the seaward side of the circulation cell kim et al 2017 analyzed pore water samples collected at the beach near cape henlopen delaware their results confirmed the chemical reactivity within the intertidal circulation cell and revealed that the landward saltwater freshwater mixing zone is where the respiration rates are the highest due to the high dissolved inorganic carbon concentration besides these studies researchers further explored how the tide induced circulation cell influences solute transport in combination with other factors e g waves bakhtyar et al 2013 soil heterogeneity jang et al 2017 inland water level oscillations liu et al 2016 and hydraulic conductivity and beach slope heiss et al 2017 studies mentioned above have highlighted the importance of tides and associated intertidal circulation within the usp in affecting solute transport in beach aquifers most of these studies considered the usp in a quasi steady state with the size shape and salt distribution of the usp remaining almost unchanged over consecutive tidal cycles indeed the usp formed above the fdz is subjected to the influence of upward density gradients saltwater of higher density overlying less dense fresher groundwater and hence prone to flow instability a few studies e g greskowiak 2014 rÃ¶per et al 2015 zhang 2015 have demonstrated the formation of salt fingers in beach aquifers caused by unstable circulating flow greskowiak 2014 was the first to show numerically that the above mentioned upward density gradients may lead to an unstable usp which continues to generate salt fingers that penetrate deeply in the beach aquifer although the stable and unstable flow conditions could not be distinctly distinguished greskowiak 2014 still revealed some realistic hydrological and hydrogeological conditions favouring the occurrence of unstable flow e g low beach slope large tidal amplitude small inland freshwater flux and high hydraulic conductivity for example in one simulation with unstable flow the beach slope tidal amplitude inland freshwater flux and hydraulic conductivity were 0 02 1 5 m 1 0 m3 d 1 m 1 and 10 m d 1 respectively and these parameter values are not uncommon in real beach aquifers therefore the study of greskowiak 2014 provides useful information about where unstable usp might be detected in practical settings rÃ¶per et al 2015 later confirmed the likely occurrence of unstable flow in beach aquifers using laboratory experiments meanwhile they also discovered the spatiotemporally varying groundwater discharge zones that are not limited to the low tide mark in examining the effects of beach morphology on groundwater flow zhang 2015 also noticed the flow instability phenomenon she reported that the phase averaged over one tidal cycle flow under the unstable conditions fluctuates over a period much longer than the tidal period which was also reported by greskowiak 2014 and rÃ¶per et al 2015 all the above studies showed that the unstable usp creates non stationary and chaotic unstable flow in the form of local circulation associated with each salt finger with the circulation cell and salt finger moving seaward across the intertidal zone and inducing further mixing between circulating seawater and discharging fresh groundwater the flow instability not only leads to considerable variation in the amount of fresh groundwater discharge to coastal water but also dramatically alters the flow field and mixing process in the beach aquifer particularly the fdz more importantly as stated by greskowiak 2014 the mixing processes discharge patterns and rates altered by unstable flow have important implications for solute transport in beach aquifers for example the aerobic seawater might penetrate deeply in the aquifer and thus reduce solutes via oxidization while the unstable flow could modify the transport pathway of solutes however despite these implications the effects of unstable flow on solute either reactive or non reactive transport in beach aquifers have not yet been quantitatively investigated the extent to which solute transport in beach aquifers is affected by unstable flow still remains unknown for example what will the solute migration pathway be like how is the residence time in the unstable usp case compared to that in a quasi steady usp case will there be any significant changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of solute discharge moreover the migration characteristics of solute depend on factors that control the intensity of unstable flow e g hydraulic conductivity dispersivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux and may differ greatly under different unstable flow conditions therefore a study is needed to address these questions to determine quantitively the effects of unstable flow on solute transport in beach aquifers indeed unstable flow has been found to remarkably affect solute transport in other hydrological systems e g salt marshes shen et al 2016 and hyporheic zones of rivers jin et al 2015 similar instability effects on the transport behaviour of land sourced solutes in beach aquifers are expected but have not been examined so far based on the above review this study aimed to numerically investigate how unstable flow and salt fingers affect the transport of land sourced solutes with a focus on the transport paths mixing with seawater and spatiotemporal variations of solute efflux to coastal water for comparison two base cases were first simulated with a quasi steady and an unstable usp respectively subsequently a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the roles of dispersivity hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux the results of all these simulations will add to existing literature and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex solute transport behaviour in beach aquifers 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations we used sutra ms a variable saturation variable density groundwater flow and multiple species solute transport model hughes and sanford 2004 to

perpendicular transect of a beach aquifer fig 1 with the assumption of bedrock underlying the aquifer the aquifer base af was taken to be impermeable and thus assigned a no flow boundary the landward boundary ab was assumed a constant flux boundary note that the constant head condition was also applied at the landward boundary in previous studies werner and simmons 2009 found that compared to the case with a constant flux boundary seawater intrudes further landward under the constant head condition at the landward boundary similarly the use of a constant head landward boundary may lead to results different from those presented in this study for altered flow patterns with no precipitation or evapotranspiration considered the permanently exposed surface bc was set to be no flow the seaward boundary ef represents the flow divide at the seawater extent of the domain and was assigned a no flow boundary the section of surface boundary cde was assigned a specified pressure boundary based on a semi diurnal solar tidal level 5 h t h m s l a s i n Ï t where h t is the tidal level l varying with time t t hmsl is the mean sea level msl l set as 29 5 m a is the tidal amplitude l and Ï is the angular frequency t 1 and Ï 2Ï t with t being the tidal period t and set as 12 h during falling tide a seepage face was allowed to develop above the tidal level according to the method proposed by wilson and gardner 2006 and xin et al 2010 1 if the exposed boundary nodes were saturated in the last time step they were treated as seepage face nodes and assigned the atmospheric pressure and 2 if the boundary nodes above the tidal level were unsaturated in the previous time step they were set as no flow correspondingly for salt transport the seawater concentration 35 ppt was assigned to nodes with inflow to the beach aquifer while a zero concentration gradient was applied to nodes with outflow from the beach aquifer 2 3 model parameters and simulations we assumed a homogeneous and isotropic beach aquifer with ks 1 447 10 4 m s 1 Ï 0 45 longitudinal dispersivity Î±l 0 4 m and transverse dispersivity Î±t 0 04 m the ks value has been used in many numerical studies based on measured field conditions such as the beach near de panne belgium vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 swres was set as 0 1 and the van genuchten 1980 constants a and n are set as 2 68 and 14 5 m 1 respectively the values of swres a and n are typical for soil water retention parameters of sand carsel and parrish 1988 and have been used in several previous studies of groundwater flow and salt transport in beach aquifers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 xin et al 2015 a small beach slope sb is crucial to generating unstable flow in beach aquifers greskowiak 2014 in this study we set sb to 0 02 much smaller than those 0 1 used in previous numerical studies robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 despite the contrast it is not uncommon for natural beaches to have a slope of 0 02 or even lower for example butt et al 2001 reported a slope of 0 0143 for their perranporth beach site at uk mclachlan and dorvlo 2005 quantitatively surveyed 161 beaches in 10 countries and found a minimum sb of 0 0125 more recently walther et al 2017 used a quite small value 0 01 to explore the effect of sb on seawater intrusion inland fresh groundwater flux qf and tidal amplitude are two dominant factors affecting the flow and transport processes in beach aquifers in this study we set qf as 1 4 m3 d 1 m 1 for the semi diurnal solar tides we considered two amplitudes a 0 5 m and a 1 m these values of qf and a are within the ranges used in previous studies ataie ashtiani et al 1999 robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 as will be shown in the section below these two amplitudes created the quasi steady and unstable usp respectively all the parameters values used in this study are listed in table 1 we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of Î± ks a and qf on solute transport associated with the unstable flow with parameter values listed in table 2 overall the model setup in this study was based on greskowiak 2014 which provided guidance for determining the conditions under which unstable flow may occur in beach aquifers initially we ran numerical models to steady state with no tidal oscillations and then continued to run them to quasi steady state conditions after turning on tidal oscillations with two different tidal amplitudes generating quasi steady and unstable usp respectively after the simulations had reached the quasi steady state in terms of both flow and salt concentrations a land sourced conservative solute plume was introduced to the simulations by setting an initial tracer concentration c0 of 100 g l 1 within the lower semicircle of a 6 m radius centred at x 30 m and z 25 m below the water table fig 1 after the simulations started there were no prescribed concentrations for the solute such setup allowed the solute mass released in the model to be unaffected by the inland or seaward boundary conditions note that c 0 was set to be the same as that used by robinson et al 2007a since the solute is passive with no density effect involved a different c 0 will not change the migration characteristics e g centroid trajectory residence time and spreading area of solute plume also to avoid confusion solute plume mentioned hereinafter specially refers to the land sourced solute plume for all the simulations the model was run with a time step of 60 s the same mesh discretization with 41 261 nodes and 40 800 elements was used in all cases such discretization was determined based on the stability criterion of grid pÃ©clet number pe Î´l Î±l 4 for avoiding numerical oscillations hughes and sanford 2004 where Î´l is the transport distance l between two sides of an element along the groundwater flow direction and Î±l is the longitudinal dispersivity l under the mesh discretization the maximum grid pÃ©clet number was 2 5 meeting the stability criterion the grid resolution was tested for the grid independence of simulation results for both the quasi steady and unstable usp cases we compared the hydraulic head and salt distributions in the beach aquifer and the boundary fluxes for four grid resolutions 20 566 nodes 27 371 nodes 41 261 nodes and 54 511 nodes the results under the two highest resolutions were found to be virtually identical so the grid of 41 261 nodes was used for all the simulations the tests ensured that results presented in this paper are converged numerical solutions of sufficient accuracy 2 4 measurable diagnostics to quantify the effect of unstable usp on the characteristics of land derived conservative solute transport in the beach aquifer we calculated the spatial moments following the approach of freyberg 1986 the zeroth order first order and second order spatial moments of solute concentration provide information about the mass location centroid and variance of the solute plume respectively corresponding to the 2 d model domain used in present study the total solute mass can be determined based on the zeroth order spatial moment 6 m 00 Ï c x z t d x d z the first order spatial moments are calculated as 7a m 10 Ï c x z t x d x d z 7b m 01 Ï c x z t z d x d z the centroid of the solute plume xc zc is derived by dividing the first order spatial moments with the zeroth order spatial moment 8 x c m 10 m 00 z c m 01 m 00 the second order spatial moments in relation to the centre of the solute mass are given by 9a m 20 Ï c x z t x x c 2 d x d z 9b m 02 Ï c x z t z z c 2 d x d z dividing the second order spatial moments by the zeroth order spatial moment gives the horizontal Ï x x 2 and vertical Ï z z 2 variance of the solute plume 10 Ï x x 2 m 20 m 00 Ï z z 2 m 02 m 00 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of usp and solute plume before comparing the solute plume movement under quasi steady and unstable usp conditions we first examined the characteristics of salt distributions in both cases unlike the quasi steady usp case salt patterns in the upper intertidal zone for the unstable usp case exhibit great spatiotemporal variations fig 2 which are characterized by three stages of periodic changes a salt finger forms and develops from a persistent usp stage 1 then it is separated from the usp and moves downward and offshore stage 2 and finally merges with the sw stage 3 these three stages of changes repeat over a period of 240 tidal cycles as the salt finger penetrates downward and reaches the aquifer base some freshwater squeezes out of the bottom beneath the salt finger prior to being trapped meanwhile the trapped freshwater mixes with saltwater generating brackish water that moves upward fig 2 these results are consistent with the findings of greskowiak 2014 and zhang 2015 which also reported that freshwater would mix with seawater and be pushed upward as the seawater plumes sink down freshwater discharges at varying locations across the beach surface depend on the movement of salt fingers the spatial and temporal changes in the flow salinity distribution and freshwater discharge location are expected to affect the transport path of land sourced solute its mixing with ambient water and discharge to coastal water note that although the results presented in this study are specific to the simulated hydrogeological setting the revealed characteristics of flow and solute transport would be much alike if there is unstable flow happening in natural beach aquifers especially those with relatively flat beach surfaces fig 3 compares the migration path and shape of the solute plume between the quasi steady and unstable usp cases at different elapsed times within the first 600 days the transport and spreading of solute plume in both cases are similar over this period the solute plume mainly moves horizontally towards the seaward boundary affected little by the nearshore groundwater flow however as the solute plume approaches to the usp the patterns become different in the quasi steady usp case upon reaching the usp the solute plume moves downward around the lower part of the usp and discharges through the fdz until completely exiting the aquifer a4 a7 in fig 3 such a transport pattern is consistent with the findings of robinson et al 2007a in contrast the transport trajectory and spreading of solute plume are rather different in the unstable usp case b4 b7 in fig 3 affected by unstable flow the solute plume travels downward to a much greater depth than that in the quasi steady usp case reaching the aquifer base as the plume moves towards the shoreline it is intruded by the downward penetrating salt finger and split into two parts day 1250 the seaward part is pushed downward and seaward by the salt finger and so trapped in the sw day 1350 the discharge of this trapped plume together with trapped freshwater to the ocean occurs offshore of the low tide mark and appears to be a long process driven by density gradient day 1450 the landward part of the split plume continues to travel upward with freshwater to discharge near the low tide mark however a portion of it is further affected by salt fingers and subdivided into two parts day 1350 as a result the discharge of solute near the low tide mark also sustains for a long time 3 2 spatial moments and solute spreading fig 4 a compares the time dependent zeroth order spatial moments of solute concentration normalized by the initial total solute mass i e solute mass fraction m f m m0 between the quasi steady and unstable usp cases in general variation in the mf exhibits a decreasing trend as the plume gradually exits the aquifer in both cases at the early stage before day 800 mf remains at one as the solute plume mainly travels horizontally towards the seaward boundary and has not reached the usp to exit the aquifer when reaching and passing through the usp the solute starts to discharge into the ocean and mf experiences a relatively rapid decrease followed by a slower declining trend until entirely leaving the system despite similar variation patterns the fractions of remained mass in the aquifer differ between the two cases as the solute starts to discharge the decreasing rate of m f in the unstable usp case is slightly faster than that in the quasi steady usp case for a short period from 800th to 1000th day after this period m f in the quasi steady usp case falls much faster than in the unstable usp case leading to a shorter residence time of solute plume in the aquifer by day 1450 the solute plume has completely exited the aquifer in the quasi steady usp case while approximately 18 of the solute mass still remains in the aquifer for being trapped between salt fingers in the unstable usp case and it takes about another 500 days for the trapped solute plume to exit the aquifer the residence time of solute in the beach aquifer counted from the start of the discharge to the ocean i e day 915 for the quasi steady usp case and day 799 for the unstable usp case increases by 119 under the influence of unstable flow 1168 days for the unstable usp case compared with 533 days for the quasi steady usp case the two inflection points on the m f curve for the unstable usp case define three different solute discharge regimes that correspond with different parts of the solute plume separated by the salt fingers these results are consistent with the solute plume behaviours shown in fig 3 the movement of plume centroid fig 4b also reflects the effects of unstable flow on solute transport the plume centroid in the quasi steady usp case displays no downward movement at the early stage and travels upward upon arriving at the usp where tide induced circulation occurs in contrast the centroid in the unstable usp case moves to a greater depth forced by downward penetrating salt fingers after reaching the lowest point the centroid starts to migrate upward towards the sediment water interface note that the upward movement of centroid in the unstable usp case is driven by the salt finger induced vertical flow of ambient groundwater rather than the tidally induced circulation the winding path of the centroid in the unstable usp case reflects a longer residence time indicated by the color bar of solute in the beach aquifer and the exit position is near the low tide mark blue node rather than the mean shoreline as in the quasi steady usp case we also compared the migration paths of the toe of the plume determined based on the concentration of 0 005c 0 between the two cases fig 4b the spreading of the plume leads to downward movement of toe in both cases however the toe in the unstable usp case reaches the aquifer base and remains in the vicinity for almost 300 days due to weak local flow the extents of solute spreading in the x and z directions are indicated by the second order moments fig 4c the change of plume spreading in both cases shows similarly a rising phase followed by a declining phase however as solute plume enters the intertidal zone noticeable differences occur with the variance increased greatly in the unstable usp case unstable flow leads to further spreading of the plume in the horizontal direction compared with the quasi steady usp case fig 4c meanwhile in the vertical direction the plume gets stretched downward resulting in a maximum vertical variance around 82 m2 fig 4c being nine times that of the quasi steady usp case 9 m2 a notable difference is the twin peak feature of the horizontal variance in the unstable usp case in contrast with the single peak in the quasi steady usp case fig 4c this feature reflects the dynamic effect of moving salt fingers on the plume as manifested in the division of the plume into two parts such dynamic effect also occurs in the vertical direction indicated by the oscillations of vertical variance the comparison of spreading area the cross sectional area in which c c0 0 005 shows that plume affected by unstable flow spreads much wider than that influenced by the quasi steady usp with the peak value being 620 m2 and 370 m2 respectively fig 4d meanwhile during the declining stage plume area in the unstable usp case remains much larger than that in the quasi steady usp case consistent with the results in fig 4a the spreading area in both cases drops to zero as the plume exits the aquifer completely 3 3 temporal and spatial variations of solute discharge rate unstable flow also remarkably modifies the temporal variation of total solute efflux integrated across the sediment water interface cde in fig 1 and the spatial distribution of net solute efflux integrated over time fig 5 for the quasi steady usp case the temporal efflux variation exhibits a monotonically increasing trend initially followed by a decreasing trend i e one peak occurs as solute discharges into the ocean in contrast in the unstable usp case the total solute efflux demonstrates a bimodal trend there are two discharge episodes each with a relatively narrow discharge period around the peak compared with the extended discharge pattern in the quasi steady usp case this bimodal mass discharge pattern is due to the split of plume into two parts caused by salt fingers interestingly the second discharge episode associated with the part of plume that is pushed downward by salt finger occurs later than the peak efflux in the quasi steady usp case but with a higher peak value overall the discharge period of the second episode is similar to that of the quasi steady usp case but the occurrence time is delayed fig 5a the spatial distribution of net efflux also differs greatly between the two cases fig 5b in the quasi steady usp case the solute discharge zone is centered on the mean shoreline and relatively confined within a narrow concentrated area in comparison solute discharge in the unstable usp case spreads over a much wider area extending from the mid to lower intertidal zone in a more diffuse fashion these solute discharge results are consistent with and reflect modifications of solute transport paths and mixing made by unstable flow as shown in figs 3 and 4 we further examined the spatial distribution of solute efflux and variation of solute discharge zone at different times fig 6 while the spatial solute efflux distribution remains almost the same in the quasi steady usp case solute discharge pattern in the unstable usp case changes over time as evident in large variations of concentrated discharge areas i e peak discharge occurs in different areas and of different rates these variations are linked to the dynamic nature of unstable flow with salt fingers periodically formed and moved across the intertidal zone 3 4 sensitivity analysis greskowiak 2014 revealed that unstable flow in beach aquifers is affected by various hydrogeological parameters in the following we used the above mentioned unstable usp case as the base case and examined the effects of dispersivity hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux on solute transport associated with unstable flow indicators chosen for the sensitivity analysis include zeroth order and first order spatial moments and spreading area of solute plume note that all the simulations were run for the same 2000 day period as the quasi steady and unstable usp cases discussed above therefore as shown below in some cases the solute plume did not completely exit the beach aquifer by the end of the simulation 3 4 1 sensitivity to Î± two additional cases were simulated with lower Î± Î±l 0 2 m Î±t 0 02 m and higher Î± Î±l 0 8 m Î±t 0 08 m respectively as expected lower dispersivity leads to more intensive flow instability with reduced finger size while higher dispersivity weakens the unstable flow resulting in larger salt fingers the comparison in fig 7 a1 b7 shows a similar effect of unstable flow on solute transport as reflected in the vertical stretch of the solute plume and corresponding downward penetration to the aquifer base and its further movement offshore despite the above mentioned similarity the results in fig 8 a1 a3 highlight certain differences change of dispersivity leads to different rates of solute discharge generally at the late stage indicated by the black vertical dashed line solute discharge rates are slower in the lower dispersivity aquifer i e a slower decline of residual solute mass fig 8 a1 overall the plume spreading area increases under the condition of lower dispersivity as a result of intensified unstable flow fig 8 a2 the solute transport paths as indicated by the trajectory of the plume centroid remain similar among the three cases all experiencing the initial stage of lateral movement followed by a meander and with the exit point around the low tide mark in all cases fig 8 a3 3 4 2 sensitivity to ks two additional simulations were conducted with a lower ks 7 234 10 5 m s 1 and a higher ks 2 894 10 4 m s 1 hydraulic conductivity respectively fig 7 c1 c7 show that reduction of hydraulic conductivity weakens the downward penetration of salt fingers preventing them from reaching the aquifer base consequently solute plume in the low ks case spreads to a less extent than that in the high ks case fig 7 d1 d7 solute plume in the low ks case merely reaches the middle part e g around z 16 m of the beach aquifer whereas that in the high ks case moves down to and remains near the aquifer base for a rather long period moreover the residence time of plume is extended due to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity part of the solute plume still remains in the aquifer by the 2000th day in the low ks case but has already completely exited the aquifer in the high ks case the variation trends of remaining solute mass inside the beach aquifer do not differ greatly among the three cases fig 8 b1 particularly between the base case and low ks case the increase of hydraulic conductivity slightly accelerates the solute discharge process throughout the simulation period concerning plume spreading fig 8 b2 shows shrunk and enlarged solute plumes under the conditions of lower and higher ks respectively being consistent with the results in fig 7 c1 d7 the maximum plume spreading area falls to approximately 380 m2 in the low ks case but rises to roughly 760 m2 in the high ks case these changes represent a reduction of 38 7 and an increase of 22 6 respectively compared with the maximum spreading area of 620 m2 in the base case plume centroid in the low ks case does not move down to a considerable depth as in the other two cases fig 8 b3 because the downward finger penetration is weakened by reduced hydraulic conductivity plume centroid in the high ks case travels to a depth greater than that in the base case by day 2000 plume centroid in the low ks case is still in the beach aquifer red line in fig 8 b3 and this is consistent with the result in fig 7 c7 for base case and high ks case regardless of the different paths the centroid exits the aquifer near the low tide mark 3 4 3 sensitivity to a tidal amplitude affects the amount of seawater infiltrating into the beach aquifer and thus the intensity of unstable flow greskowiak 2014 the sensitivity of solute transport to tidal amplitude was examined with two additional simulations conducted using a smaller 0 75 m low a case and a larger value 1 25 m high a case respectively similar to the effects of hydraulic conductivity the reduced tidal amplitude leads to less penetrative salt fingers that only travel down to the lower part of the beach aquifer not reaching the aquifer base as in the case of a larger tidal amplitude fig 7 e1 e7 accordingly solute plume in the low a case is less diffuse compared to that in the high a case fig 7 f1 f7 fig 8 c1 shows that the temporal variation of remaining solute mass in the aquifer is affected little by tidal amplitude the reduction of mf in the low a case is slightly faster than that in the other two cases probably because the reduced tidal amplitude shortens the migration distance of solute plume the spatial range of solute plume spreading was also narrowed down greatly fig 8 c2 with the maximum area reduced from 620 m2 in the base case to 430 m2 a reduction of 30 6 in contrast the larger tidal amplitude results in more dispersed solute plume raising the peak value of spreading area to 740 m2 an increase of 19 35 the comparison in fig 8 c3 highlights the shortened and extended trajectory of centroid movement in the low a and high a case respectively consistent with the results in fig 7 e1 f7 moreover fig 8 c3 shows that regardless of the tidal range variation the exit point of plume centroid is around the low tide mark under unstable flow conditions 3 4 4 sensitivity to qf another two simulations were conducted with varied inland freshwater fluxes low qf 0 8 m3 d 1 m 1 and high qf 2 0 m3 d 1 m 1 to examine how sensitive solute transport is to this factor it is clear from fig 7 g1 h7 that smaller and larger qf promotes and impedes unstable flow respectively solute plume in the high qf case travels much faster than that in the low qf case a large proportion of solute plume still remains in the aquifer by day 2000 under the influence of reduced qf whereas that affected by increased qf has already been removed by the 1500th day the quantitative analysis in fig 8 d1 d3 further highlights notable differences compared with the base case the decline of mf slows down in the low qf case but speeds up in the high qf case indicating that mf is more sensitive to qf than other parameters e g dispersivity hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude as shown in fig 8 d1 mf has fallen to zero around day 1350 in the high qf case taking 600 days less than in the base case 1950 days in comparison after a 2000 days elapsed time almost 78 of the solute mass still remains in the beach aquifer for the low qf case as a result of the shortened residence time solute plume in the high qf case does not spread as extensively as that in the base case fig 8 d2 having a smaller maximum spreading area 420 m2 versus 620 m2 however the spreading area of solute plume in the low qf case continues to rise throughout the whole simulated period increasing to 710 m2 by the 2000th day with regard to the centroid position fig 8 d3 clearly shows a relatively low level sensitivity to qf 4 discussions most previous studies that investigated the transport of land sourced conservative solutes in beach aquifers considered a quasi steady usp and revealed that the solute would discharge into the coastal waters through the fdz in between the usp and sw bakhtyar et al 2013 robinson et al 2007a as shown in the quasi steady usp case of present study e g fig 3a however there has been little research considering the effects of an unstable usp as evident from the unstable usp cases simulated here e g fig 3b the more complex behaviour of solute transport in beach aquifers can result from an unstable usp the findings from this study have important ecological and environmental implications firstly driven by salt fingers solute plume moves further downward and impacts on the deeper area with the overall effect likely to be long lasting pore water flow is weak near the aquifer base and the seawater circulation rate within the sw is smaller than that near the usp by two orders of magnitude robinson et al 2007a therefore solutes reaching the aquifer base and entering the sw may reside for a long time as shown by the results in figs 3 b6 and 4b this would extend the duration of biogeochemical reactions involving these solutes if they are reactive e g nutrients meanwhile the high salinity in the sw as a potentially important factor might greatly alter the biogeochemical reactions and hence the fate of reactive solutes prior to their discharge into the ocean the solute residence time in the aquifer is extended considerably by unstable flow fig 4a meanwhile solute plume spreads over a much larger area compared with the quasi steady usp case these results suggest that reactions of chemicals and nutrients in the beach aquifer may occur over wider ranges of spatiotemporal scales in the presence of unstable flow in addition the more widespread solute plume covers areas with different geochemical conditions for example due to the vertical stretching figs 3b5 b6 4c the upper and lower part of the plume may encounter more oxic recirculating seawater and anoxic pore water respectively the sensitivity analysis revealed how sensitive solute transport is to various parameters under the premise of unstable flow in the aquifer the results show that the migration pathway of solute plume is more sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude whereas the residence time and plume spreading is more sensitive to inland freshwater flux the inland freshwater flux is assumed to be constant in this study but likely to vary seasonally in reality such seasonality has been shown to affect the flow and solute transport in beach aquifers liu et al 2016 michael et al 2005 the sensitivity results suggest that a more complex solute transport pattern would be expected under the combined influence of unstable flow and seasonally varied inland freshwater flux also the sensitivity analysis shows that despite changes of the hydraulic parameters the exit point of the plume centroid remains around the low tide mark under unstable flow conditions this finding is important and allows a distinction to be made between the unstable and quasi steady usp cases since the exit point appears to be fixed around the mean shoreline unaffected by even the tidal range however it is noteworthy that such a finding is conditional and only valid for the solute released below the water table when the solute is released at a greater depth e g close to the aquifer base the plume will be unaffected by the usp and exit the aquifer after moving along the edge of the sw under such a condition the exit point in the quasi steady usp case remains at the low tide mark for brevity the results are not shown apart from the above implications the findings may also provide guidance for the design of monitoring programs and instrument deployment in field investigations on nearshore groundwater flow and solute transport processes unstable flow leads to multiple fdzs that vary with time and shift from the upper to the lower part of the beach surface fig 3b majority of previous field studies had the instruments e g piezometers multilevel water samplers installed with sparse port spacing heiss and michael 2014 martin et al 2007 robinson et al 2006 taniguchi 2002 where the unstable flow occurs the port spacing should be dense enough not only along the cross shore transect most field studies were based on such a transect only but also in the horizontal plane due to unstable flow naturally occurring in 3 d also considering the long repetition period of salt patterns affected by unstable flow the salinity at all these positions should be measured hourly daily for a duration of several months otherwise the installations and measurement would be insufficient to monitor the salinity and solute distributions in the beach aquifer and solute fluxes to the sea affected by unstable flow 5 concluding remarks this study numerically examined how unstable flow and usp under certain hydrogeological conditions affect the transport of land sourced conservative solutes in a beach aquifer the key findings include 1 compared with the quasi steady usp case unstable flow in a beach aquifer can greatly delay the residence time of solute plume and enlarge the plume spreading area particularly in the vertical direction 2 unstable flow alters the exit location of the solute plume shifting it from the mean shoreline to the low tide mark also salt fingers drive the plume to the aquifer base and prolong its exit from the aquifer 3 instead of a unimodal solute discharge event the unstable flow may result in a more complicated discharge pattern e g bimodal with multiple episodes and peaks the peak values are comparable or even higher than the maximum solute efflux in the quasi steady usp case 4 sensitivity analysis reveals that in the presence of unstable flow the exit point of plume centroid is always around the low tide mark regardless of the tidal amplitude the migration path of plume centroid is more sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude whereas mf and the spreading area is more sensitive to inland freshwater flux these findings contribute to better understanding of solute transport in beach aquifers when evaluating the transport and fate of chemicals including nutrients in a beach aquifer the possibility of unstable usp formation and associated influences should be considered with the presence of an unstable usp the time for geochemical reactions of reactive solutes would become much longer and with a wider spreading area the solute plume may affect greatly the overall water quality of the beach aquifer this study considered a simple semidiurnal tidal signal and overlooked multiple tidal constituents e g spring neap tide other variations and factors such as seasonal change of inland freshwater flux heterogeneity and stratigraphy of aquifer soil and 3 d topography were all neglected all these factors would affect the formation and intensity of the unstable flow and thus the migration of solutes in unconfined beach aquifers for example taking the third spatial dimension into consideration unstable flow may develop more easily because the pushing up effect of freshwater is weaker but in the same time the large temporal variations in the discharge of both water and solute as seen in the 2 d simulation results presented in this study may alleviate moreover present study did not examine the effects of aquifer depth which is particularly important for the unstable usp case since the land derived solute plume reaches the aquifer bottom prior to discharging into the ocean aquifer depth will affect the migration characteristics of solute plume e g residence time spreading area and discharge rate for example a greater depth may lengthen the residence time and enlarge the spreading area in addition in this study we considered conservative passive solutes only no reactions and no changes in fluid density due to solute concentrations further investigations should be carried out to explore these factors to advance our understanding of flow and solute transport in beach aquifers beyond the findings presented here acknowledgments this research has been

698,recent studies have shown that in beach aquifers tide induced upper saline plume usp may become unstable in the form of moving salt fingers under certain hydrogeological conditions however to what extent solute transport in beach aquifers is affected by the unstable flow associated with such salt fingers has not been quantitatively examined despite the implications inferred by these studies this study numerically investigated this problem by considering a land sourced conservative solute plume in a conceptual 2 d beach aquifer the results demonstrate that unstable flow leads to salt fingers that periodically develop from the usp and then move seaward across the intertidal zone compared to the quasi steady usp case unstable flow considerably modifies the migration path of land sourced solute plume towards the sea moving it deeper into the aquifer until reaching the base also unstable flow increases the residence time of the land sourced solute plume in the beach aquifer and causes the solute discharge zone to vary over time and shift from the mean shoreline in the quasi steady usp case to the low tide mark the temporal variations of total solute efflux pattern are also altered by unstable flow changing from a unimodal to a bimodal pattern sensitivity analysis based on dispersivity hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux reveals that the transport path of solute plume is more sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude while the residence time and plume spreading are more sensitive to inland freshwater flux keywords solute

mixing processes in beach aquifers it can greatly modify the groundwater flow and salt distribution regimes ataie ashtiani et al 1999 boufadel 2000 guo et al 2010 kuan et al 2012 mao et al 2006a mao et al 2006b werner and lockington 2006 tidal oscillations induce hydraulic gradients that drive seawater circulation through the sediment in the intertidal zone forming an upper saline plume usp which is separated from the saltwater wedge sw by a freshwater discharge zone fdz salt distributions across the usp fdz and sw have been measured in the field heiss and michael 2014 michael et al 2005 robinson et al 2006 and replicated in numerical simulations evans and wilson 2016 heiss et al 2017 robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 and laboratory experiments e g kuan et al 2012 as a result of higher flow velocities transit time of circulating seawater through the usp is much shorter by two orders of magnitude than that in the sw robinson et al 2007a consequently seawater in the usp is more oxic due to less time available for the microbially mediated consumption of dissolved oxygen in the recirculated seawater slomp and van cappellen 2004 therefore seawater recirculating through the usp modifies the redox potential and overall geochemical conditions of beach aquifers robinson et al 2007a development of the usp depends on tidal forcing aquifer properties hydraulic conductivity and dispersivity beach slope and inland freshwater flux robinson et al 2007a the usp may not form if the beach is absent or in a tidally influenced beach aquifer where the hydraulic conductivity is low the fresh groundwater flux is high or the beach slope is very small e g 0 01 evans and wilson 2016 many studies have explored how tide induced circulation affects the transport of land sourced solutes in beach aquifers laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have shown that the shape and spreading of a land sourced solute plume are significantly affected by tides before discharging to the sea boufadel et al 2006 zhang et al 2001 2002 robinson et al 2007a further demonstrated that tidal seawater circulation within the usp greatly alters the transport pathway of terrestrial derived solutes in the beach aquifer reduces the transfer rate of solutes from the aquifer to coastal water and lowers the discharging solute concentrations the tide induced circulation was also found to enhance greatly the attenuation aerobic biodegradation of btex compounds due to tide driven oxygenation in the usp robinson et al 2009 tide induced circulation also controls land sourced nutrient transport and transformation in beach aquifers and fluxes across the beach face anwar et al 2014 numerically showed that when dissolved organic matter dom is considered tides enhance the mixing between saltwater and freshwater thereby increasing no 3 attenuation by contrast without considering dom tidal oscillations increase the no 3 flux because the newly formed no 3 from increased mixing of o2 and nh 4 in the usp cannot be reduced more recently heiss et al 2017 revealed that the tide driven mixing between saltwater and freshwater facilitates denitrification in the mixing zone around the boundary of the tidal circulation cell usp with the denitrification rates decreasing monotonically from the landward side to the seaward side of the circulation cell kim et al 2017 analyzed pore water samples collected at the beach near cape henlopen delaware their results confirmed the chemical reactivity within the intertidal circulation cell and revealed that the landward saltwater freshwater mixing zone is where the respiration rates are the highest due to the high dissolved inorganic carbon concentration besides these studies researchers further explored how the tide induced circulation cell influences solute transport in combination with other factors e g waves bakhtyar et al 2013 soil heterogeneity jang et al 2017 inland water level oscillations liu et al 2016 and hydraulic conductivity and beach slope heiss et al 2017 studies mentioned above have highlighted the importance of tides and associated intertidal circulation within the usp in affecting solute transport in beach aquifers most of these studies considered the usp in a quasi steady state with the size shape and salt distribution of the usp remaining almost unchanged over consecutive tidal cycles indeed the usp formed above the fdz is subjected to the influence of upward density gradients saltwater of higher density overlying less dense fresher groundwater and hence prone to flow instability a few studies e g greskowiak 2014 rÃ¶per et al 2015 zhang 2015 have demonstrated the formation of salt fingers in beach aquifers caused by unstable circulating flow greskowiak 2014 was the first to show numerically that the above mentioned upward density gradients may lead to an unstable usp which continues to generate salt fingers that penetrate deeply in the beach aquifer although the stable and unstable flow conditions could not be distinctly distinguished greskowiak 2014 still revealed some realistic hydrological and hydrogeological conditions favouring the occurrence of unstable flow e g low beach slope large tidal amplitude small inland freshwater flux and high hydraulic conductivity for example in one simulation with unstable flow the beach slope tidal amplitude inland freshwater flux and hydraulic conductivity were 0 02 1 5 m 1 0 m3 d 1 m 1 and 10 m d 1 respectively and these parameter values are not uncommon in real beach aquifers therefore the study of greskowiak 2014 provides useful information about where unstable usp might be detected in practical settings rÃ¶per et al 2015 later confirmed the likely occurrence of unstable flow in beach aquifers using laboratory experiments meanwhile they also discovered the spatiotemporally varying groundwater discharge zones that are not limited to the low tide mark in examining the effects of beach morphology on groundwater flow zhang 2015 also noticed the flow instability phenomenon she reported that the phase averaged over one tidal cycle flow under the unstable conditions fluctuates over a period much longer than the tidal period which was also reported by greskowiak 2014 and rÃ¶per et al 2015 all the above studies showed that the unstable usp creates non stationary and chaotic unstable flow in the form of local circulation associated with each salt finger with the circulation cell and salt finger moving seaward across the intertidal zone and inducing further mixing between circulating seawater and discharging fresh groundwater the flow instability not only leads to considerable variation in the amount of fresh groundwater discharge to coastal water but also dramatically alters the flow field and mixing process in the beach aquifer particularly the fdz more importantly as stated by greskowiak 2014 the mixing processes discharge patterns and rates altered by unstable flow have important implications for solute transport in beach aquifers for example the aerobic seawater might penetrate deeply in the aquifer and thus reduce solutes via oxidization while the unstable flow could modify the transport pathway of solutes however despite these implications the effects of unstable flow on solute either reactive or non reactive transport in beach aquifers have not yet been quantitatively investigated the extent to which solute transport in beach aquifers is affected by unstable flow still remains unknown for example what will the solute migration pathway be like how is the residence time in the unstable usp case compared to that in a quasi steady usp case will there be any significant changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of solute discharge moreover the migration characteristics of solute depend on factors that control the intensity of unstable flow e g hydraulic conductivity dispersivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux and may differ greatly under different unstable flow conditions therefore a study is needed to address these questions to determine quantitively the effects of unstable flow on solute transport in beach aquifers indeed unstable flow has been found to remarkably affect solute transport in other hydrological systems e g salt marshes shen et al 2016 and hyporheic zones of rivers jin et al 2015 similar instability effects on the transport behaviour of land sourced solutes in beach aquifers are expected but have not been examined so far based on the above review this study aimed to numerically investigate how unstable flow and salt fingers affect the transport of land sourced solutes with a focus on the transport paths mixing with seawater and spatiotemporal variations of solute efflux to coastal water for comparison two base cases were first simulated with a quasi steady and an unstable usp respectively subsequently a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the roles of dispersivity hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux the results of all these simulations will add to existing literature and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex solute transport behaviour in beach aquifers 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations we used sutra ms a variable saturation variable density groundwater flow and multiple species solute transport model hughes and sanford 2004 to

perpendicular transect of a beach aquifer fig 1 with the assumption of bedrock underlying the aquifer the aquifer base af was taken to be impermeable and thus assigned a no flow boundary the landward boundary ab was assumed a constant flux boundary note that the constant head condition was also applied at the landward boundary in previous studies werner and simmons 2009 found that compared to the case with a constant flux boundary seawater intrudes further landward under the constant head condition at the landward boundary similarly the use of a constant head landward boundary may lead to results different from those presented in this study for altered flow patterns with no precipitation or evapotranspiration considered the permanently exposed surface bc was set to be no flow the seaward boundary ef represents the flow divide at the seawater extent of the domain and was assigned a no flow boundary the section of surface boundary cde was assigned a specified pressure boundary

proposed by wilson and gardner 2006 and xin et al 2010 1 if the exposed boundary nodes were saturated in the last time step they were treated as seepage face nodes and assigned the atmospheric pressure and 2 if the boundary nodes above the tidal level were unsaturated in the previous time step they were set as no flow correspondingly for salt transport the seawater concentration 35 ppt was assigned to nodes with inflow to the beach aquifer while a zero concentration gradient was applied to nodes with outflow from the beach aquifer 2 3 model parameters and simulations we assumed a homogeneous and isotropic beach aquifer with ks 1 447 10 4 m s 1 Ï 0 45 longitudinal dispersivity Î±l 0 4 m and transverse dispersivity Î±t 0 04 m the ks value has been used in many numerical studies based on measured field conditions such as the beach near de panne belgium vandenbohede and lebbe 2006 swres was set as 0 1 and the van genuchten 1980 constants a and n are set as 2 68 and 14 5 m 1 respectively the values of swres a and n are typical for soil water retention parameters of sand carsel and parrish 1988 and have been used in several previous studies of groundwater flow and salt transport in beach aquifers robinson et al 2014 xin et al 2010 xin et al 2015 a small beach slope sb is crucial to generating unstable flow in beach aquifers greskowiak 2014 in this study we set sb to 0 02 much smaller than those 0 1 used in previous numerical studies robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 despite the contrast it is not uncommon for natural beaches to have a slope of 0 02 or even lower for example butt et al 2001 reported a slope of 0 0143 for their perranporth beach site at uk mclachlan and dorvlo 2005 quantitatively surveyed 161 beaches in 10 countries and found a minimum sb of 0 0125 more recently walther et al 2017 used a quite small value 0 01 to explore the effect of sb on seawater intrusion inland fresh groundwater flux qf and tidal amplitude are two dominant factors affecting the flow and transport processes in beach aquifers in this study we set qf as 1 4 m3 d 1 m 1 for the semi diurnal solar tides we considered two amplitudes a 0 5 m and a 1 m these values of qf and a are within the ranges used in previous studies ataie ashtiani et al 1999 robinson et al 2007a xin et al 2010 as will be shown in the section below these two amplitudes created the quasi steady and unstable usp respectively all the parameters values used in this study are listed in table 1 we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of Î± ks a and qf on solute transport associated with the unstable flow with parameter values listed in table 2 overall the model setup in this study was based on greskowiak 2014 which provided guidance for determining the conditions under which unstable flow may occur in beach aquifers initially we ran numerical models to steady state with no tidal oscillations and then continued to run them to quasi steady state conditions after turning on tidal oscillations with two different tidal amplitudes generating quasi steady and unstable usp respectively after the simulations had reached the quasi steady state in terms of both flow and salt concentrations a land sourced conservative solute plume was introduced to the simulations by setting an initial tracer concentration c0 of 100 g l 1 within the lower semicircle of a 6 m radius centred at x 30 m and z 25 m below the water table fig 1 after the simulations started there were no prescribed concentrations for the solute such setup allowed the solute mass released in the model to be unaffected by the inland or seaward boundary conditions note that c 0 was set to be the same as that used by robinson et al 2007a since the solute is passive with no density effect involved a different c 0 will not change the migration characteristics e g centroid trajectory residence time and spreading area of solute plume also to avoid confusion solute plume mentioned hereinafter specially refers to the land sourced solute plume for all the simulations the model was run with a time step of 60 s the same mesh discretization with 41 261 nodes and 40 800 elements was used in all cases such discretization was determined based on the stability criterion of grid pÃ©clet number pe Î´l Î±l 4 for avoiding numerical oscillations hughes and sanford 2004 where Î´l is the transport distance l between two sides of an element along the groundwater flow direction and Î±l is the longitudinal dispersivity l under the mesh discretization the maximum grid pÃ©clet number was 2 5 meeting the stability criterion the grid resolution was tested for the grid independence of simulation results for both the quasi steady and unstable usp cases we compared the hydraulic head and salt distributions in the beach aquifer and the boundary fluxes for four grid resolutions 20 566 nodes 27 371 nodes 41 261 nodes and 54 511 nodes the results under the two highest resolutions were found to be virtually identical so the grid of 41 261 nodes was used for all the simulations the tests ensured that results presented in this paper are converged numerical solutions of sufficient accuracy 2 4 measurable diagnostics to quantify the effect of unstable usp on the characteristics of land derived conservative solute transport in the beach aquifer we calculated the spatial moments following the approach of freyberg 1986 the zeroth order first order and second order spatial moments of solute concentration provide information about the mass location centroid and variance of the solute plume respectively corresponding to the 2 d model domain used in present study the total solute mass can be determined based on the zeroth order spatial moment 6 m 00 Ï c x z t d x d z the first order spatial moments are calculated as 7a m 10 Ï c x z t x d x d z 7b m 01 Ï c x z t z d x d z the centroid of the solute plume xc zc is derived by dividing the first order spatial moments with the zeroth order spatial moment 8 x c m 10 m 00 z c m 01 m 00 the second order spatial moments in relation to the centre of the solute mass are given by 9a m 20 Ï c x z t x x c 2 d x d z 9b m 02 Ï c x z t z z c 2 d x d z dividing the second order spatial moments by the zeroth order spatial moment gives the horizontal Ï x x 2 and vertical Ï z z 2 variance of the solute plume 10 Ï x x 2 m 20 m 00 Ï z z 2 m 02 m 00 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variations of usp and solute plume before comparing the solute plume movement under quasi steady and unstable usp conditions we first examined the characteristics of salt distributions in both cases unlike the quasi steady usp case salt patterns in the upper intertidal zone for the unstable usp case exhibit great spatiotemporal variations fig 2 which are characterized by three stages of periodic changes a salt finger forms and develops from a persistent usp stage 1 then it is separated from the usp and moves downward and offshore stage 2 and finally merges with the sw stage 3 these three stages of changes repeat over a period of 240 tidal cycles as the salt finger penetrates downward and reaches the aquifer base some freshwater squeezes out of the bottom beneath the salt finger prior to being trapped meanwhile the trapped freshwater mixes with saltwater generating brackish water that moves upward fig 2 these results are consistent with the findings of greskowiak 2014 and zhang 2015 which also reported that freshwater would mix with seawater and be pushed upward as the seawater plumes sink down freshwater discharges at varying locations across the beach surface depend on the movement of salt fingers the spatial and temporal changes in the flow salinity distribution and freshwater discharge location are expected to affect the transport path of land sourced solute its mixing with ambient water and discharge to coastal water note that although the results presented in this study are specific to the simulated hydrogeological setting the revealed characteristics of flow and solute transport would be much alike if there is unstable flow happening in natural beach aquifers especially those with relatively flat beach surfaces fig 3 compares the migration path and shape of the solute plume between the quasi steady and unstable usp cases at different elapsed times within the first 600 days the transport and spreading of solute plume in both cases are similar over this period the solute plume mainly moves horizontally towards the seaward boundary affected little by the nearshore groundwater flow however as the solute plume approaches to the usp the patterns become different in the quasi steady usp case upon reaching the usp the solute plume moves downward around the lower part of the usp and discharges through the fdz until completely exiting the aquifer a4 a7 in fig 3 such a transport pattern is consistent with the findings of robinson et al 2007a in contrast the transport trajectory and spreading of solute plume are rather different in the unstable usp case b4 b7 in fig 3 affected by unstable flow the solute plume travels downward to a much greater depth than that in the quasi steady usp case reaching the aquifer base as the plume moves towards the shoreline it is intruded by the downward penetrating salt finger and split into two parts day 1250 the seaward part is pushed downward and seaward by the salt finger and so trapped in the sw day 1350 the discharge of this trapped plume together with trapped freshwater to the ocean occurs offshore of the low tide mark and appears to be a long process driven by density gradient day 1450 the landward part of the split plume continues to travel upward with freshwater to discharge near the low tide mark however a portion of it is further affected by salt fingers and subdivided into two parts day 1350 as a result the discharge of solute near the low tide mark also sustains for a long time 3 2 spatial moments and solute spreading fig 4 a compares the time dependent zeroth order spatial moments of solute concentration normalized by the initial total solute mass i e solute mass fraction m f m m0 between the quasi steady and unstable usp cases in general variation in the mf exhibits a decreasing trend as the plume gradually exits the aquifer in both cases at the early stage before day 800 mf remains at one as the solute plume mainly travels horizontally towards the seaward boundary and has not reached the usp to exit the aquifer when reaching and passing through the usp the solute starts to discharge into the ocean and mf experiences a relatively rapid decrease followed by a slower declining trend until entirely leaving the system despite similar variation patterns the fractions of remained mass in the aquifer differ between the two cases as the solute starts to discharge the decreasing rate of m f in the unstable usp case is slightly faster than that in the quasi steady usp case for a short period from 800th to 1000th day after this period m f in the quasi steady usp case falls much faster than in the unstable usp case leading to a shorter residence time of solute plume in the aquifer by day 1450 the solute plume has completely exited the aquifer in the quasi steady usp case while approximately 18 of the solute mass still remains in the aquifer for being trapped between salt fingers in the unstable usp case and it takes about another 500 days for the trapped solute plume to exit the aquifer the residence time of solute in the beach aquifer counted from the start of the discharge to the ocean i e day 915 for the quasi steady usp case and day 799 for the unstable usp case increases by 119 under the influence of unstable flow 1168 days for the unstable usp case compared with 533 days for the quasi steady usp case the two inflection points on the m f curve for the unstable usp case define three different solute discharge regimes that correspond with different parts of the solute plume separated by the salt fingers these results are consistent with the solute plume behaviours shown in fig 3 the movement of plume centroid fig 4b also reflects the effects of unstable flow on solute transport the plume centroid in the quasi steady usp case displays no downward movement at the early stage and travels upward upon arriving at the usp where tide induced circulation occurs in contrast the centroid in the unstable usp case moves to a greater depth forced by downward penetrating salt fingers after reaching the lowest point the centroid starts to migrate upward towards the sediment water interface note that the upward movement of centroid in the unstable usp case is driven by the salt finger induced vertical flow of ambient groundwater rather than the tidally induced circulation the winding path of the centroid in the unstable usp case reflects a longer residence time indicated by the color bar of solute in the beach aquifer and the exit position is near the low tide mark blue node rather than the mean shoreline as in the quasi steady usp case we also compared the migration paths of the toe of the plume determined based on the concentration of 0 005c 0 between the two cases fig 4b the spreading of the plume leads to downward movement of toe in both cases however the toe in the unstable usp case reaches the aquifer base and remains in the vicinity for almost 300 days due to weak local flow the extents of solute spreading in the x and z directions are indicated by the second order moments fig 4c the change of plume spreading in both cases shows similarly a rising phase followed by a declining phase however as solute plume enters the intertidal zone noticeable differences occur with the variance increased greatly in the unstable usp case unstable flow leads to further spreading of the plume in the horizontal direction compared with the quasi steady usp case fig 4c meanwhile in the vertical direction the plume gets stretched downward resulting in a maximum vertical variance around 82 m2 fig 4c being nine times that of the quasi steady usp case 9 m2 a notable difference is the twin peak feature of the horizontal variance in the unstable usp case in contrast with the single peak in the quasi steady usp case fig 4c this feature reflects the dynamic effect of moving salt fingers on the plume as manifested in the division of the plume into two parts such dynamic effect also occurs in the vertical direction indicated by the oscillations of vertical variance the comparison of spreading area the cross sectional area in which c c0 0 005 shows that plume affected by unstable flow spreads much wider than that influenced by the quasi steady usp with the peak value being 620 m2 and 370 m2 respectively fig 4d meanwhile during the declining stage plume area in the unstable usp case remains much larger than that in the quasi steady usp case consistent with the results in fig 4a the spreading area in both cases drops to zero as the plume exits the aquifer completely 3 3 temporal and spatial variations of solute discharge rate unstable flow also remarkably modifies the temporal variation of total solute efflux integrated across the sediment water interface cde in fig 1 and the spatial distribution of net solute efflux integrated over time fig 5 for the quasi steady usp case the temporal efflux variation exhibits a monotonically increasing trend initially followed by a decreasing trend i e one peak occurs as solute discharges into the ocean in contrast in the unstable usp case the total solute efflux demonstrates a bimodal trend there are two discharge episodes each with a relatively narrow discharge period around the peak compared with the extended discharge pattern in the quasi steady usp case this bimodal mass discharge pattern is due to the split of plume into two parts caused by salt fingers interestingly the second discharge episode associated with the part of plume that is pushed downward by salt finger occurs later than the peak efflux in the quasi steady usp case but with a higher peak value overall the discharge period of the second episode is similar to that of the quasi steady usp case but the occurrence time is delayed fig 5a the spatial distribution of net efflux also differs greatly between the two cases fig 5b in the quasi steady usp case the solute discharge zone is centered on the mean shoreline and relatively confined within a narrow concentrated area in comparison solute discharge in the unstable usp case spreads over a much wider area extending from the mid to lower intertidal zone in a more diffuse fashion these solute discharge results are consistent with and reflect modifications of solute transport paths and mixing made by unstable flow as shown in figs 3 and 4 we further examined the spatial distribution of solute efflux and variation of solute discharge zone at different times fig 6 while the spatial solute efflux distribution remains almost the same in the quasi steady usp case solute discharge pattern in the unstable usp case changes over time as evident in large variations of concentrated discharge areas i e peak discharge occurs in different areas and of different rates these variations are linked to the dynamic nature of unstable flow with salt fingers periodically formed and moved across the intertidal zone 3 4 sensitivity analysis greskowiak 2014 revealed that unstable flow in beach aquifers is affected by various hydrogeological parameters in the following we used the above mentioned unstable usp case as the base case and examined the effects of dispersivity hydraulic conductivity tidal amplitude and inland freshwater flux on solute transport associated with unstable flow indicators chosen for the sensitivity analysis include zeroth order and first order spatial moments and spreading area of solute plume note that all the simulations were run for the same 2000 day period as the quasi steady and unstable usp cases discussed above therefore as shown below in some cases the solute plume did not completely exit the beach aquifer by the end of the simulation 3 4 1 sensitivity to Î± two additional cases were simulated with lower Î± Î±l 0 2 m Î±t 0 02 m and higher Î± Î±l 0 8 m Î±t 0 08 m respectively as expected lower dispersivity leads to more intensive flow instability with reduced finger size while higher dispersivity weakens the unstable flow resulting in larger salt fingers the comparison in fig 7 a1 b7 shows a similar effect of unstable flow on solute transport as reflected in the vertical stretch of the solute plume and corresponding downward penetration to the aquifer base and its further movement offshore despite the above mentioned similarity the results in fig 8 a1 a3 highlight certain differences change of dispersivity leads to different rates of solute discharge generally at the late stage indicated by the black vertical dashed line solute discharge rates are slower in the lower dispersivity aquifer i e a slower decline of residual solute mass fig 8 a1 overall the plume spreading area increases under the condition of lower dispersivity as a result of intensified unstable flow fig 8 a2 the solute transport paths as indicated by the trajectory of the plume centroid remain similar among the three cases all experiencing the initial stage of lateral movement followed by a meander and with the exit point around the low tide mark in all cases fig 8 a3 3 4 2 sensitivity to ks two additional simulations were conducted with a lower ks 7 234 10 5 m s 1 and a higher ks 2 894 10 4 m s 1 hydraulic conductivity respectively fig 7 c1 c7 show that reduction of hydraulic conductivity weakens the downward penetration of salt fingers preventing them from reaching the aquifer base consequently solute plume in the low ks case spreads to a less extent than that in the high ks case fig 7 d1 d7 solute plume in the low ks case merely reaches the middle part e g around z 16 m of the beach aquifer whereas that in the high ks case moves down to and remains near the aquifer base for a rather long period moreover the residence time of plume is extended due to the reduction in hydraulic conductivity part of the solute plume still remains in the aquifer by the 2000th day in the low ks case but has already completely exited the aquifer in the high ks case the variation trends of remaining solute mass inside the beach aquifer do not differ greatly among the three cases fig 8 b1 particularly between the base case and low ks case the increase of hydraulic conductivity slightly accelerates the solute discharge process throughout the simulation period concerning plume spreading fig 8 b2 shows shrunk and enlarged solute plumes under the conditions of lower and higher ks respectively being consistent with the results in fig 7 c1 d7 the maximum plume spreading area falls to approximately 380 m2 in the low ks case but rises to roughly 760 m2 in the high ks case these changes represent a reduction of 38 7 and an increase of 22 6 respectively compared with the maximum spreading area of 620 m2 in the base case plume centroid in the low ks case does not move down to a considerable depth as in the other two cases fig 8 b3 because the downward finger penetration is weakened by reduced hydraulic conductivity plume centroid in the high ks case travels to a depth greater than that in the base case by day 2000 plume centroid in the low ks case is still in the beach aquifer red line in fig 8 b3 and this is consistent with the result in fig 7 c7 for base case and high ks case regardless of the different paths the centroid exits the aquifer near the low tide mark 3 4 3 sensitivity to a tidal amplitude affects the amount of seawater infiltrating into the beach aquifer and thus the intensity of unstable flow greskowiak 2014 the sensitivity of solute transport to tidal amplitude was examined with two additional simulations conducted using a smaller 0 75 m low a case and a larger value 1 25 m high a case respectively similar to the effects of hydraulic conductivity the reduced tidal amplitude leads to less penetrative salt fingers that only travel down to the lower part of the beach aquifer not reaching the aquifer base as in the case of a larger tidal amplitude fig 7 e1 e7 accordingly solute plume in the low a case is less diffuse compared to that in the high a case fig 7 f1 f7 fig 8 c1 shows that the temporal variation of remaining solute mass in the aquifer is affected little by tidal amplitude the reduction of mf in the low a case is slightly faster than that in the other two cases probably because the reduced tidal amplitude shortens the migration distance of solute plume the spatial range of solute plume spreading was also narrowed down greatly fig 8 c2 with the maximum area reduced from 620 m2 in the base case to 430 m2 a reduction of 30 6 in contrast the larger tidal amplitude results in more dispersed solute plume raising the peak value of spreading area to 740 m2 an increase of 19 35 the comparison in fig 8 c3 highlights the shortened and extended trajectory of centroid movement in the low a and high a case respectively consistent with the results in fig 7 e1 f7 moreover fig 8 c3 shows that regardless of the tidal range variation the exit point of plume centroid is around the low tide mark under unstable flow conditions 3 4 4 sensitivity to qf another two simulations were conducted with varied inland freshwater fluxes low qf 0 8 m3 d 1 m 1 and high qf 2 0 m3 d 1 m 1 to examine how sensitive solute transport is to this factor it is clear from fig 7 g1 h7 that smaller and larger qf promotes and impedes unstable flow respectively solute plume in the high qf case travels much faster than that in the low qf case a large proportion of solute plume still remains in the aquifer by day 2000 under the influence of reduced qf whereas that affected by increased qf has already been removed by the 1500th day the quantitative analysis in fig 8 d1 d3 further highlights notable differences compared with the base case the decline of mf slows down in the low qf case but speeds up in the high qf case indicating that mf is more sensitive to qf than other parameters e g dispersivity hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude as shown in fig 8 d1 mf has fallen to zero around day 1350 in the high qf case taking 600 days less than in the base case 1950 days in comparison after a 2000 days elapsed time almost 78 of the solute mass still remains in the beach aquifer for the low qf case as a result of the shortened residence time solute plume in the high qf case does not spread as extensively as that in the base case fig 8 d2 having a smaller maximum spreading area 420 m2 versus 620 m2 however the spreading area of solute plume in the low qf case continues to rise throughout the whole simulated period increasing to 710 m2 by the 2000th day with regard to the centroid position fig 8 d3 clearly shows a relatively low level sensitivity to qf 4 discussions most previous studies that investigated the transport of land sourced conservative solutes in beach aquifers considered a quasi steady usp and revealed that the solute would discharge into the coastal waters through the fdz in between the usp and sw bakhtyar et al 2013 robinson et al 2007a as shown in the quasi steady usp case of present study e g fig 3a however there has been little research considering the effects of an unstable usp as evident from the unstable usp cases simulated here e g fig 3b the more complex behaviour of solute transport in beach aquifers can result from an unstable usp the findings from this study have important ecological and environmental implications firstly driven by salt fingers solute plume moves further downward and impacts on the deeper area with the overall effect likely to be long lasting pore water flow is weak near the aquifer base and the seawater circulation rate within the sw is smaller than that near the usp by two orders of magnitude robinson et al 2007a therefore solutes reaching the aquifer base and entering the sw may reside for a long time as shown by the results in figs 3 b6 and 4b this would extend the duration of biogeochemical reactions involving these solutes if they are reactive e g nutrients meanwhile the high salinity in the sw as a potentially important factor might greatly alter the biogeochemical reactions and hence the fate of reactive solutes prior to their discharge into the ocean the solute residence time in the aquifer is extended considerably by unstable flow fig 4a meanwhile solute plume spreads over a much larger area compared with the quasi steady usp case these results suggest that reactions of chemicals and nutrients in the beach aquifer may occur over wider ranges of spatiotemporal scales in the presence of unstable flow in addition the more widespread solute plume covers areas with different geochemical conditions for example due to the vertical stretching figs 3b5 b6 4c the upper and lower part of the plume may encounter more oxic recirculating seawater and anoxic pore water respectively the sensitivity analysis revealed how sensitive solute transport is to various parameters under the premise of unstable flow in the aquifer the results show that the migration pathway of solute plume is more sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude whereas the residence time and plume spreading is more sensitive to inland freshwater flux the inland freshwater flux is assumed to be constant in this study but likely to vary seasonally in reality such seasonality has been shown to affect the flow and solute transport in beach aquifers liu et al 2016 michael et al 2005 the sensitivity results suggest that a more complex solute transport pattern would be expected under the combined influence of unstable flow and seasonally varied inland freshwater flux also the sensitivity analysis shows that despite changes of the hydraulic parameters the exit point of the plume centroid remains around the low tide mark under unstable flow conditions this finding is important and allows a distinction to be made between the unstable and quasi steady usp cases since the exit point appears to be fixed around the mean shoreline unaffected by even the tidal range however it is noteworthy that such a finding is conditional and only valid for the solute released below the water table when the solute is released at a greater depth e g close to the aquifer base the plume will be unaffected by the usp and exit the aquifer after moving along the edge of the sw under such a condition the exit point in the quasi steady usp case remains at the low tide mark for brevity the results are not shown apart from the above implications the findings may also provide guidance for the design of monitoring programs and instrument deployment in field investigations on nearshore groundwater flow and solute transport processes unstable flow leads to multiple fdzs that vary with time and shift from the upper to the lower part of the beach surface fig 3b majority of previous field studies had the instruments e g piezometers multilevel water samplers installed with sparse port spacing heiss and michael 2014 martin et al 2007 robinson et al 2006 taniguchi 2002 where the unstable flow occurs the port spacing should be dense enough not only along the cross shore transect most field studies were based on such a transect only but also in the horizontal plane due to unstable flow naturally occurring in 3 d also considering the long repetition period of salt patterns affected by unstable flow the salinity at all these positions should be measured hourly daily for a duration of several months otherwise the installations and measurement would be insufficient to monitor the salinity and solute distributions in the beach aquifer and solute fluxes to the sea affected by unstable flow 5 concluding remarks this study numerically examined how unstable flow and usp under certain hydrogeological conditions affect the transport of land sourced conservative solutes in a beach aquifer the key findings include 1 compared with the quasi steady usp case unstable flow in a beach aquifer can greatly delay the residence time of solute plume and enlarge the plume spreading area particularly in the vertical direction 2 unstable flow alters the exit location of the solute plume shifting it from the mean shoreline to the low tide mark also salt fingers drive the plume to the aquifer base and prolong its exit from the aquifer 3 instead of a unimodal solute discharge event the unstable flow may result in a more complicated discharge pattern e g bimodal with multiple episodes and peaks the peak values are comparable or even higher than the maximum solute efflux in the quasi steady usp case 4 sensitivity analysis reveals that in the presence of unstable flow the exit point of plume centroid is always around the low tide mark regardless of the tidal amplitude the migration path of plume centroid is more sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and tidal amplitude whereas mf and the spreading area is more sensitive to inland freshwater flux these findings contribute to better understanding of solute transport in beach aquifers when evaluating the transport and fate of chemicals including nutrients in a beach aquifer the possibility of unstable usp formation and associated influences should be considered with the presence of an unstable usp the time for geochemical reactions of reactive solutes would become much longer and with a wider spreading area the solute plume may affect greatly the overall water quality of the beach aquifer this study considered a simple semidiurnal tidal signal and overlooked multiple tidal constituents e g spring neap tide other variations and factors such as seasonal change of inland freshwater flux heterogeneity and stratigraphy of aquifer soil and 3 d topography were all neglected all these factors would affect the formation and intensity of the unstable flow and thus the migration of solutes in unconfined beach aquifers for example taking the third spatial dimension into consideration unstable flow may develop more easily because the pushing up effect of freshwater is weaker but in the same time the large temporal variations in the discharge of both water and solute as seen in the 2 d simulation results presented in this study may alleviate moreover present study did not examine the effects of aquifer depth which is particularly important for the unstable usp case since the land derived solute plume reaches the aquifer bottom prior to discharging into the ocean aquifer depth will affect the migration characteristics of solute plume e g residence time spreading area and discharge rate for example a greater depth may lengthen the residence time and enlarge the spreading area in addition in this study we considered conservative passive solutes only no reactions and no changes in fluid density due to solute concentrations further investigations should be carried out to explore these factors to advance our understanding of flow and solute transport in beach aquifers beyond the findings presented here acknowledgments this research has been

699,in this work we present a methodology for upscaling solute transport in heterogeneous reservoirs the problem considers upscaling from the darcy scale of a porous medium to the reservoir scale we first define the mathematical problem that governs solute mass transport at the so called darcy scale and then we apply the method of volume averaging this method allows for upscaling the governing equations at the whole reservoir scale and eventually developing physical constraints definitions of average variables and effective coefficients one important characteristic of the volume averaging method is that the so called closure problems for analytical or numerical computation of effective coefficients are identified the closure problems consist of boundary value problems whose solution must be carried out in representative geometries unit cells of the reservoir in this paper we developed the theory for a two facies reservoir but the extension for more facies is straightforward in this context we present the two equation model and the numerical estimation of effective coefficients are presented and discussed for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies in this manner relevant coefficients are identified the numerical solution of the upscaled model agrees well with direct numerical results when the governing equations are solved at the darcy scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mass dispersion reservoir scale volume averaging method two facies two equation model 1 introduction the modeling of solute mass transport in heterogeneous reservoirs has been an active theme for investigation this theme is of interest in areas such as hydrogeology enhanced hydrocarbon recovery environmental sciences as well as geothermal energy commonly classic advection dispersion equations have been extensively used to model the transport of solutes through heterogeneous reservoirs but the physical meaning and rigorous link of effective coefficients with physics at smaller scales are unclear quintard and whitaker 1998 considered the transport of an adsorbing solute in a two region model of a chemically and mechanically heterogeneous porous medium when the condition of large scale for instance at the field scale mechanical equilibrium is valid the authors consider that under these circumstances a one equation model can be used to predict the large scale averaged velocity but a two equation model may be required to predict the regional velocities that are needed to accurately describe the solute transport process if the condition of large scale mass equilibrium is valid the solute transport process can be represented in terms of a one equation model in this context on one hand the two equation model refers to a set of governing equations composed of one equation to model flow inside one region and the other equation models fluid flow in the remaining region in this formulation the properties of each region are required on the other hand for the one equation formulation only one equation is employed that contains global parameters and it is not able to model fluid flow in individual regions the upscaling procedure followed by quintard and whitaker consisted of scaling the point equations i e local scale to the darcy scale i e to the scale of the porous medium then the authors scaled the darcy description to a larger scale applying the volume average method twice which represented a method of systematic upscaling based on upscaling the governing equations in sequential form on the other hand porta et al 2012 presented a volume averaging based theoretical analysis of upscaling of reactive transport processes involving fast bimolecular homogeneous irreversible reactions occurring within a porous medium the authors began from the formulation that drove system dynamics at the pore scale and derived the governing equations at the observation scale associated with laboratory scale scenarios this involved advection dominated transport of two reactants and resulting products in the presence of different relative strengths dahmkÃ¶hler and pÃ©clet numbers in the seminal work by wood 2009 a valuable discussion is presented on the role of scaling laws in upscaling he discussed the process of coarse graining in complex subsurface hydrologic systems with the intention to examine the difference between the mathematical process of averaging and the upscaling process according to this author an averaged description does not contain less information than the original problem for the problem of nonreactive solute transport in heterogeneous media five different scaling laws were identified as necessary i influence of boundaries ii statistical homogeneity iii separation of length scales iv ergodicity and v smallness of the variance another discussion by wood concerns an upscaled mathematical model that has the ability to represent a complex system at the expense of also requiring more parameterization and characterization in order to get the model to work regarding the scales porous systems often exhibit hierarchical configurations e g espinosa paredes 2014 chabanon et al 2015 where for instance the solid matrix at the macroscopic scale is itself microporous another example concerns porous media in which the impermeable solid mesostructure is embedded in a finer saturated porous medium which is also embedded in another finer porous structure and so on for this reason heterogeneous reservoirs can be considered at the following hierarchy of scales local scale darcy scale macroscopic scale and large scale or reservoir scale espinosa paredes 2014 this categorization provides a scheme for applications in geo energetic and hydrogeological systems raoof and hassanizadeh 2010 developed relationships between the pore scale adsorption coefficient and corresponding upscaled adsorption parameters they applied both theoretical averaging and numerical upscaling in the averaging approach equilibrium adsorption is assumed at the pore scale and solute transport equations are averaged over a representative volume rev this leads to explicit expressions for macroscale adsorption rate constants as a function of microscale parameters in the numerical approach raoof and hassanizadeh first simulated solute transport within a single tube undergoing equilibrium adsorption at the pore wall from which flux averaged concentration breakthrough curves were obtained these were used to determine the upscaled adsorption rate constants as functions of the pore scale other upscaling methods for solute transport have been proposed for example a method based on genetic programming was presented by hill et al 2007 and a method based on random walking was proposed by geiger et al 2010 hill et al investigated the development of a domain independent modeling tool that searches the space of mathematical equations for one or more equations to describe a set of training data these methods based on genetic algorithms are promising when there are many field data but in most cases when this information is available the method is no longer necessary that is this method can be applied for post analysis for interpretation of physical properties currently classical dual porosity approaches in conjunction with an advection dispersion equation and macroscopic dispersivity commonly fail to accurately predict the breakthrough of fractured porous media for this a continuous time random walk method can be used as a generalized upscaling approach geiger et al 2010 according to geider et al this procedure allows for predicting breakthrough at other locations accurately and gaining significant insights into the nature of fracture matrix interactions in naturally fractured porous reservoirs with geologically realistic fracture geometries however this method requires the correct estimation of the distribution of retention times which is crucial for understanding the upscaled character of solute transport the upscaling of mass dispersion has also been studied using the percolation theory in combination with scaling methodologies recently sahimi 2012 employed the continuous time random walk method along the power law growth of the mean square displacement of the solute to analyze mass dispersion in heterogeneous media sahimi presented the intrinsic relation of geometrical exponents of percolation with the coefficients involved in the power law of effective conductivity and permeability close the percolation threshold ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2012 extended the analysis of dispersion involving the saturation and porosity effects the studies combined the percolation technique with fractal scaling laws they found that the most important feature for facilitating good experimental predictions is the applicability or not of random or invasion percolation simulations in enhanced hydrocarbon recovery studies combustion tube experiments are conducted in the laboratory to determine the burning characteristics of a particular oil in a rock matrix the data obtained from history matching the tube experiments cannot be directly used for field simulation because grid blocks for the tube simulation are on the order of inches thick whereas grid blocks for a field simulation are typically 100 to 1000 times larger marjerrison and fassihi 1992 as such an upscaling procedure is necessary in this sense on one hand marjerrison and fassihi 1992 presented a procedure for scaling heavy oil combustion tube results to a field model the authors showed that their scaling method for a simulation model was feasible however it is not a systematic method because it is based on empiricisms on the other hand islam and ali 1992 analyzed the scaling criteria for in situ combustion experiments they used partial differential equations in three dimensional systems to derive a set of scaling criteria these criteria can be applied but they do not constitute an upscaling method recently aguilar madera et al 2017 presented an upscaling procedure for in situ combustion by using the volume averaging method considering homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions multiphase and multicomponent features the authors developed closure schemes to estimate effective coefficients but the application of such theory has not yet been done on the other hand the recovery from incompletely water wet fractured reservoirs can be extremely low a reason for low recovery is related to wetting issues whereas the reason for slow recovery may be the nonequilibrium behavior of capillary pressure to incorporate nonequilibrium into larger scale problems salimi and bruining 2012 applied homogenization techniques to derive an upscaled model for fractured reservoirs the association of methods for the complex scaling problem may be a feasible solution for example the association of upscaling by the volume averaging method with the network approach is presented in the work of ahmadi et al 2001 the facies analysis approach is widely used and accepted to study heterogeneous reservoirs as well as in fields such as deep water processes e g pickering et al 1986 shanmugam 2000 cullis et al 2018 glacier formation e g mccarthy et al 2017 mertes et al 2017 watson et al 2018 diagenesis in oil fields e g beigi et al 2017 marchionda et al 2018 carbonate sedimentary systems e g li et al 2017 he et al 2018 other lithological studies e g jadoon et al 2017 pore characterization e g li et al 2018 and heterogeneity and compartmentalization within a reservoir for seismic facies analysis e g song et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 in the work of cullis et al 2018 facies associations were applied to diagnostic criteria used to discern each hierarchical order in the field of deep marine sedimentary geology to assign a spatial and temporal order to the sedimentary architecture of preserved deep marine deposits meanwhile in mertes et al 2017 ground penetration radar gpr was used to identify sedimentary facies the detailed heterogeneity of shale facies and their relationship to pore networks was analyzed in li et al 2017 various approaches are used to develop numerical models for facies distributions within a reservoir however only two approaches are traditionally used strebelle and journel 2001 pixel based and object based techniques it is worth mentioning that both approaches can be used simultaneously for facies distribution numerical models in a recent study advanced modeling approaches for gas field analysis considered multistage constraints and hierarchical facies control as well as multistep modeling zhi et al 2015 according to previous studies facies analysis is fundamental because porosity and permeability control the storage and fluid flow in reservoir rocks which are highly heterogeneous due to their geological evolution influenced by sedimentary origin diagenetic processes and burial history the latter processes influence the size and shape of pores that produce complex pore networks in sedimentary rocks in this regarding lattice boltzmann simulations of fluid flow in continental carbonate reservoir rocks was presented by soete et al 2017 where dominant lithofacies types were identified all of the facies types had pores that varied from at least the nanometer to centimeter scale i e meso and macropore networks which had relevant contributions to fluid flow in the material thus facies modeling is an essential part of reservoir characterization where the connectivity of the facies model is critical for the dynamic modeling of reservoirs according to bayat et al 2016 carbonate reservoirs are so heterogeneous that variogram based methods such as sequential indicator simulations are not very useful for facies modeling the author also proposes the use of multiple point geostatistics mps for facies modeling in oil fields in this work we propose a systematic methodology for modeling solute transport in heterogeneous reservoirs composed by two well defined facies from the point of view of own petrophysical properties the fundamental idea behind this methodology is the upscaling of the model where the darcy scale corresponds to porous media and the application of a volume averaging procedure allows upscaling of the governing equations for solute transport at the reservoir scale the upscaling method generates more unknown variables than equations which are solved with closure problems in representative geometries to obtain the effective coefficients at the reservoir scale a facies analysis of the reservoir must already exist i e the starting point of the methodology developed in this work considers a known hierarchical facies structure although the theory presented in this work corresponds to a two facies reservoir the extension to a larger number of facies could be also carried out however the application to three or more facies reservoirs is extremely complex and it will yield three or more averaged equations strongly coupled through several effective coefficients the application in practical problems of such mathematical model would be an overwhelming task from the point of view of the model solutions and the determination of the various effective coefficients involved nevertheless we state that a simple one equation model can be obtained adding the individual averaged equations for each facies and this model could be more representative for three or more facies reservoirs the extension of the volume averaged methodology here presented to three or more facies is out of the pursued scopes and it will be investigated in future works for the two facies approximation the numerical estimation of effective coefficients is presented and discussed for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies according to results obtained with a numerical solution the upscaled model agrees well with direct numerical results when governing equations are solved at the darcy scale this article is organized as follows section 2 presents the governing equation at the darcy scale for two well defined facies with homogeneous properties in the reservoir section 3 describes the preliminary results of the volume averaging procedure in section 4 the closed system of equations in terms of the spatial deviations of concentrations is developed in section 5 the closed volume averaged equations and the physical meanings of effective coefficients are discussed section 6 presents the numerical estimation and analysis of effective coefficients in section 7 the upscaling model validation reservoir scale is performed through comparison with the darcy scale simulation major observations regarding the proposed methodology for upscaling modeling from the darcy scale to the reservoir scale are presented in section 8 2 governing equations at the darcy scale we begin the study of solute transport at the darcy scale by assuming that there are two well defined facies with homogeneous properties in the reservoir as shown in fig 1 for one heterogeneous reservoir composed of two homogeneous facies called the Ï and Î· regions the accommodation of porous rocks inside the reservoir can be one of two categories a dispersed and b layered two facies reservoir the origin of these geological types of reservoirs is driven by for instance the sedimentary environment and sediment provenance for layered reservoirs only one configuration can be found but for dispersed two facies reservoirs there are four variants namely a flaser b wavy c lenticular and d pin stripe types as depicted in fig 1 for the two region reservoirs depicted in fig 1 the system of equations governing the mass transport of one solute inside a mobile fluid phase is given by in the Ï region 1 c Ï t u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï in the Î· region 2 c Î· t u Î· c Î· d Î· c Î· at t 0 3 c Ï c Ï 0 c Î· c Î· 0 at the Ï Î· boundary 4 c Ï c Î· at the Ï Î· boundary 5 n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï n Ï Î· u Î· c Î· d Î· c Î· in these equations ck and d k are the solute concentration and mass dispersion tensor in the k region respectively in the transport problem represented by eqs 1 5 it is assumed that the seepage velocities u Ï and u Î· can be calculated alternatively according to the type and number of fluids flowing in the reservoir as well as with previous knowledge of petrophysical properties of the reservoir for instance a darcy s law assumption can be used for liquids oil and water but the darcy forchheimer model is commonly employed for gases it is worth mentioning that dispersion coefficients are intrinsic functions of microstructure and pore space characteristics hunt et al 2011 and fluid velocity valdÃ©s parada et al 2016 in eq 5 n ÏÎ· is the unit normal vector pointing from the Ï region to the Î· region see fig 1 the boundary value problem for c Ï is completed by the statement of conditions at external reservoir boundaries these conditions can be set up as known flux j Ï re or concentration c Ï re which can be position dependent i e at the external boundary of the reservoir 6 n Ï r e u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï j Ï r e z or 7 c Ï c Ï r e z here n Ï re is the normal vector pointing outside the reservoir and z is the position vector locating the external boundary eqs 6 and 7 are provided for the sake of completeness but as developed further this information will be not required because boundary effects are discarded in our analysis and representative zones of reservoir bulk are used to predict numerically effective coefficients 3 preliminaries volume averaging procedure in the volume averaging method it is necessary to define superficial and intrinsic volume averaging operators as follows 8 superficial average Ï k 1 v v k Ï k d v k Ï Î· 9 intrinsic average Ï k k 1 v k v k Ï k d v k Ï Î· where Ï k is any variable defined in the k region vk represents the geometrical space only encompassing the k region where the averaging is carried out and v and vk are the volumes of geometrical spaces v and vk respectively the averaging operators 8 and 9 are related by the volume fraction of k region as follows 10 Ï k É k Ï k k k Ï Î· 11 É k v k v k Ï Î· the size and shape of the averaging volume must be appropriate in order to spatially smooth the variable that is to be upscaled in fig 1 it is apparent that for dispersed reservoirs one spherical shape encompassing various Î· type rocks might be the best option meanwhile for layered reservoirs one thin rectangular prism including the entire net pay of the reservoir could be the most appropriate we first conduct the theoretical development to upscale the solute transport inside the Ï region thus applying the operator 8 to eq 1 we have 12 c Ï t u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï to introduce the integral operator within the time and space derivatives we appeal to the spatial averaging theorem howes and whitaker 1985 13 Ï Ï Ï Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· Ï Ï d a and the reynolds general transport theorem 14 Ï Ï t Ï Ï t 1 v a Ï Î· Ï k w Ï Î· n Ï Î· d a 1 v a Ï e Ï k w Ï e n

in contact with the Ï region here rev is equivalent to the averaging volume n Ïe is the unit normal vector pointing from the Ï region outward from the rev as shown in fig 2 considering nondeformable and static reservoir rocks and rev we have 15 w Ï Î· w Ï e 0 it is important to note that the assumption w ÏÎ· 0 implies that mass fluxes at the Ï Î· boundary are equal i e ÏÏ u Ï n ÏÎ· ÏÎ· u Î· n ÏÎ· here ÏÏ and ÏÎ· are the Ï and Î· facies densities respectively this means that there is one impenetrability condition between the Ï and Î· regions in the sense that one facies does not encroach on the other thus eq 14 simplifies to 16 c Ï t c Ï t turning our attention to the advective term of eq 12 and after using the spatial averaging theorem we have 17 u Ï c Ï u Ï c Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d a in the same way the dispersive term becomes 18 d Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· c Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· d Ï c Ï d a note that eqs 17 and 18 contain two types of concentrations the darcy scale c Ï and the average concentration c Ï then the spatial decomposition gray 1975 19 Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï is introduced in the first integral of eq 18 this deviation variable Ï Ï is function of time and space as it is directly related to the darcy scale variable i e Ï Ï t x Ï Ï t x Ï Ï Ï t x thus after some rearrangements eq 12 can be written as 20 É Ï c Ï Ï t u Ï c Ï d Ï É Ï c Ï Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· c Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï Ï d Ï c Ï Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï d a here the intrinsic average concentration was employed as well as the equality 21 É Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· d a which is a direct result of the spatial averaging theorem 13 when ÏÏ constant substituting the spatial deviations for concentration and velocity into the advective term of eq 20 we have 22 u Ï c Ï É Ï u Ï Ï c Ï Ï u Ï c Ï arriving to this equation we discarded the terms containing average of spatial deviations i e 23 Ï Ï 0 such an approximation is valid if 24 r 0 l r 0 2 l c 1 l where r 0 represents the size of volume averaging l is the characteristic length of the reservoir and l c1 is the characteristic length over which significant concentration gradient changes occur the derivation of these inequalities is given in appendix a thus the volume averaged equation for the Ï region is 25 É Ï c Ï Ï t É Ï u Ï Ï c Ï Ï u Ï c Ï d Ï É Ï c Ï Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· c Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï Ï d Ï c Ï Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï d a this equation is impractical because it contains the average concentration and its spatial deviation and additionally the surface integrals confer nonlocal characteristics thus the following stage within the volume averaging method refers to developing the governing equation for spatial deviations we note that a similar procedure is performed to obtain the volume averaged equation for Î· facies but this development is omitted here for brevity 4 the closure scheme to develop a closed system of equations we must find the governing equation for c Ï a simple and direct procedure is subtracting eq 25 from 1 which leads to 26 c Ï t u Ï c Ï u Ï Ï c Ï Ï u Ï c Ï Ï d Ï c Ï d Ï 1 v Ï a Ï Î· n Ï Î· c Ï d a 1 v Ï a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï Ï d Ï c Ï Ï d a 1 v Ï a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï d a here a homogeneous behavior for ÎµÏ was considered i e ÎµÏ 0 which means that the volume fraction of Ï facies within the averaging volume remains constant as the centroid of the averaging volume moves into the reservoir it is a somewhat strong assumption which is straightforwardly satisfied for periodic arrangements of facies nevertheless in practice geological reservoirs can be highly heterogeneous within a given depositional environment thus the validity of ÎµÏ 0 can be applied only to reservoirs that are statistically homogeneous with no strong changes in the accommodation of each lithofacies such as in the bulk of geological formations and sufficiently far from the tops faults base and pinch outs of reservoirs within the geostatistics framework there is a type of reservoir that is considered as stationary when stochastic processes are performed to model the spatial distribution of properties kriging procedures in this context modeling a stationary reservoir implicates that the mean values and variance of petrophysical properties are constants inside the reservoir such implications help qualitatively to satisfy the requirement of a homogeneous

in depth inspection of effective coefficients defined in 48 62 some statements regarding their physics can be concluded each effective coefficient depends on certain closure variable and each closure variable captures the effect of a specific unitary source over solute transport at the darcy scale in this regard we quote for instance the coefficient d ÏÏ which upscales the mass transport by dispersive mechanisms inside the Ï facies when there is a driving source c Ï Ï i e an inter well gradient concentration which is commonly found in tracer transport tests in this manner each effective coefficient is related to one source as follows effects of the source c Ï Ï are quantified in d ÏÏ d Î·Ï and w Ï effects of the source c Î· Î· are quantified in d ÏÎ· d Î·Î· and w Î· effects of the source c Ï Ï are quantified in v ÏÏ v Î·Ï and ÏÏ effects of the source c Î· Î· are quantified in v ÏÎ· v Î·Î· and ÏÎ· effects of the source c Ï Ï c Î· Î· are quantified in avkl k lÏ and k lÎ· the fact that each scale source can be individually quantified is due to the clear separation of scales between the darcy and reservoir scales that is assumed during the theoretical development length scale disparities eq 24 as well as the linearization imposed to some quantities during the estimation of orders of magnitude recall that truncated taylor series expansions were used the final result of estimations of orders of magnitude is summarized through eqs 29 35 the effect of the geometrical arrangement of facies is quantified through the area integrals that are included in the definitions of effective coefficients some coefficients include hydrodynamic darcy scale dispersive effects which lead to additional transport due to flow within facies this phenomenon is quantified through the volume integrals u f x where f stands for any facies and x stands for any closure variable most coefficients d Î·Ï d ÏÎ· v ÏÏ v ÏÎ· v Î·Ï v Î·Î· avkl w Ï w Î· ÏÏ ÏÎ· vanish as long as one facies disappears meanwhile others simplify d ÏÏ d Î·Î· as result of the upscaling procedure two first order absorption like terms appeared naturally ÏÏ c Ï Ï and ÏÎ· c Î· Î· to avoid confusion they are named pseudo absorption terms as they do not truly represent absorption because this phenomenon was not considered in the darcy scale governing equations the physical meaning of these terms can be deduced from the definitions of effective coefficients ÏÏ and ÏÎ· in eqs 61 and 62 they represent inter facies mass flux and its driving forces are the average concentrations c Ï Ï and c Î· Î· for instance for cases when c Ï Ï 0 ÏÏ vanishes note in eqs 46 and 47 that the absorption like terms have opposite signs indicating that the mass of solute disappearing from one facies appears in the other facies 6 numerical estimation of effective coefficients in this section we performed the numerical estimation of all effective coefficients defined in eqs 48 62 to this end the closure problems presented in appendix b are solved in representative geometries at the darcy scale after the closure variables solution is available the calculation of effective coefficients is performed by computing the corresponding integral quantity of definitions 48 62 each closure problem allows the computation of the following effective coefficients closure problem 1 solves for d ÏÏ d Î·Ï and w Ï closure problem 2 solves for d ÏÎ· d Î·Î· and w Î· closure problem 3 solves for v ÏÏ v Î·Ï and ÏÏ closure problem 4 solves for v ÏÎ· v Î·Î· and ÏÎ· closure problem 5 solves for avkl k lÏ and k lÎ· recall that each closure problem requires parameters at the darcy scale if such information is known a priori then this information can be used in the numerical computation in this work we do not intend to predict coefficients using real and measured quantities from geological fields rather we use the approximate values for representative lithologies summarized in table 1 meanwhile the synthetic geometries depicted in fig 3 will be used as cells for the solution of closure problems we stress that our theoretical development is not limited to these simplifications and eventually real geometries and data from the darcy scale can be utilized to estimate the upscaled coefficients within the volume averaging method the use of representative cells assumes that such geometries can be periodically repeated in all directions and eventually the entire reservoir is reproduced the cell pressured drop remained fixed to solve the closure problems in this manner the momentum and mass balance for a unique flowing phase water is solved allowing the computation of the velocity field which is required as input data in closure problems and allowing for recalculating the mass dispersion coefficients at the darcy scale for each facies d Ï and d Î· the darcy scale coefficients are computed according to the expression 63 d f d m i a f u f f Ï Î· where dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient and a f is the mass dispersion tensor which is assumed to be isotropic and the same for each type of rock i e a f Î± i according to eq 63 the molecular diffusion dm is the same for both facies because the flowing fluid water and solute are the same in each facies in this work the closure problems were numerically solved using comsol multiphysics which is based on the finite element method the number of domain elements is shown in fig 3 for each cell we noted that the number of domain elements are sufficient to obtain mesh independent results while not compromising computation efforts other numerical configurations were maintained by default which is optimized for handling nonlinear problems and small relative error tolerance we limited the number of cases under study and only two representative geometries of two facies systems are used i a layered system and ii a dispersed system lenticular arrangement note that for layered systems the height cell is fixed to 20 m and the corresponding computations are representative of thin or ultra thin bed reservoirs 6 1 closure variables field in figs 4 8 closure variables computed in representative cells are plotted for four relevant situations for layered and lenticular two facies arrangements and for when one facies is more hydraulically conductive than the other this is quantified through the permeability ratio kÎ· kÏ the longitudinal components of closure variables involved in closure problem 1 i e b ÏÏ x and b Î·Ï x are depicted in fig 4 these variables can present symmetric or anti symmetric behavior around defined orthogonal planes for the lenticular case and considering a poorly conductive Î· facies a quasi antisymmetry of the closure variables appears the numerical solution of closure variables related to closure problem 2 b ÏÎ· x and b Î·Î· x has similar features to that for closure problem 1 but with opposite values when lenticular cells are used as depicted in fig 5 however notice that color legends for each figure have different value ranges in general the numerical solution of closure problems 1 and 2 suggests that relevant information takes place around the Î· Ï interface the closure variables related to closure problem 3 d ÏÏ and d Î·Ï are deployed in fig 6 it is noted for layered cells that closure variables practically have negligible values whereas for lenticular arrangements significant values and symmetry and antisymmetry appear depending on the permeability ratio considering the closure variables of problem 4 d ÏÎ· and d Î·Î· the general trends of the numerical solution are similar to those of closure problem 3 for a lenticular arrangement as is apparent in fig 7 the closure variables for problems 3 and 4 take major relevance when one facies is dispersed into the other this suggests that the effective coefficients related to the closure problems could take importance for lenticular reservoirs by recalling the effective coefficient definitions we note that closure problems 3 and 4 allow for the computation of pseudo convective coefficients and pseudo absorptive terms of up scaled mass balance equations given by eqs 46 and 47 where some have negligible effects over the global mass transport process this topic is revisited later in the manuscript finally the numerical solution of closure variables related to closure problem 5 s Ï and s Î· is presented in fig 8 in this case for layered and lenticular cells the closure variables have non negligible values regardless of the permeability ratio as in the other closure variables some symmetry planes can be defined 6 2 numerical estimation of effective coefficients after solving all of the closure problems the various effective coefficients can be computed we only compute the longitudinal component of coefficients xx if applicable for two arrangements of facies the effects of the two facies distributions that are depicted in fig 1 will be explored in detail in a future study in the following analysis the dominant parameters are identified allowing for the reduction of model parameters and optimizing the analysis of effective coefficients in tables 3 6 the numerical estimations of coefficients are tabulated and compared several of the coefficients are normalized with the darcy scale mass dispersion coefficients note in the first column that the permeability ratio was changed by one order of magnitude on the basis of their estimations we conclude that dominant coefficients are those in table 2 as complementary information table 6 summarizes the associated pÃ©clet number for each case simulated and for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies the pÃ©clet number was calculated as 64 p e clet number length cell v cell v cell u d v d m u u Ï or u Î· depending on position where v cell is the volume of the cell and u is the norm of the velocity vector in general the pÃ©clet number varies exponentially with the permeability ratio and with the arrangement of facies in the cell finally with the goal to observe the general trends of effective mass dispersion and transfer coefficients they were plotted in fig 9 as function of the permeability ratio from the resulting curves it is clear that all dispersion coefficients are comparable except the crossed coefficient d ÏÎ· xx interestingly a weak dependency on the permeability ratio is observed regarding the mass transfer coefficient it is enhanced as long as the permeability of continuous facies increases and it is more obvious for lenticular geometries 7 validation of model and comparison of dispersion coefficients 7 1 comparison of model results with darcy scale simulation the derived two equation model eqs 46 47 is not commonly used to interpret tracer injection tests in geological reservoirs to the best of our knowledge there are not appropriate data to compare and validate numerical estimations of effective coefficients instead the one equation model is widely used which only contains one mass dispersion tensor and a unique average concentration from the two equation model it is possible to derive the one equation model if validity of local mass equilibrium is assumed however the implications of local mass equilibrium are unclear at this point this will be investigated in a future work one manner to verify the congruency of the upscaling procedure and whether the effective coefficients were correctly computed is by comparing the solution provided by the upscaled model with those from the darcy scale governing equations for each facies eqs 1 5 we must recall that we initiated the analysis by setting governing equations at the darcy scale and then the volume averaging method was applied to upscale the equations thus we expect similar solutions if the darcy scale or upscaled models are employed nevertheless it should be clarified that identical solutions are not expected as some approximations were assumed i e we applied length scale constraints and estimations of orders of magnitude as described in appendix a our intention is to demonstrate that the upscaled model has high congruency with the physics that occur at a smaller scale the usage of darcy scale models involves an overwhelming computational task which in most of the cases is unnecessary and perhaps unsolvable as demonstrated later the upscaled two equation model has important computational advantages as long as effective coefficients are available with these premises we simulate 30 years of a mass transport case in a 2d 200 100 m domain as depicted in fig 10 we select a lenticular synthetic geometry composed of two facies with the following petrophysical properties k Ï 10 md k Î· 0 1 md ÏÏ 0 08 and ÏÎ· 0 01 fig 10 corresponds to one transverse cutting plane where the vertical axis represents reservoir depth at the inlet boundary solute is injected for a short period at a constant pressure the outlet boundary is also maintained at a constant pressure as follows c solu te 2000 mg l t 2 h 0 mg l t 2 h p inje ction 5000 psi p prod ucti on 4900 psi both darcy scale and upscaled mathematical models were solved with comsol multiphysics using the grid mesh shown in fig 10 for a core i7 2 7 ghz laptop computer the computational time for the darcy scale model was 93 s whereas the upscaled model required 6 s 93 5 less computational effort this supports the computational advantages of using average models the model solutions were compared by observing the breakthrough curves at observation points identified in fig 10 as well as the evolution of concentration profiles in continuous facies see fig 11 at first glance close similitude between evolving concentration profiles is met but some differences appear for short times in the upper part of reservoir for 15 years nevertheless interestingly both approaches yield similar mass transport if the global shape of the solute plume and maximum and minimum values are scrutinized this comparison of model solutions is better appreciated with breakthrough curves at observation points as observed in fig 12 there are differences in the time of maximum concentration and for some periods the upscaled model overestimates the concentration however the general trends of the concentration curves are similar 7 1 comparison of dispersion coefficients with field data as mentioned in the previous subsection a strict comparison of effective coefficients with those measured or deduced from field data is not possible at present for two reasons i field tests addressed to evaluate the solute transport in reservoirs are commonly interpreted using the one equation model and furthermore a unique dispersion tensor is reported in the literature ii in this work we computed the effective coefficients for layered and lenticular reservoirs thus in order to validate them similar reservoirs must be used for comparison in practice the in situ arrangement and lithology of fluid reservoirs can vary significantly according to its geological history which leads to large heterogeneities of petrophysical fluid rock and solute transport properties in one attempt to show such heterogeneities we plot dispersion coefficients estimated from tracer tests in water and petroleum reservoirs in fig 13 note the variety of lithologies and the magnitude of coefficient dispersions ranging from 1 10 10 to 1 100 m2 s in our approach we assumed a continuous facies in the Î· region and furthermore the coefficient d Î·Î· is dominant surprisingly depending on the rock permeabilities the numerical estimations of d Î·Î· xx can be very close to those dispersion coefficients estimated for gravel layered compost and limestone gravel laminated clay layers of silt and sand fractured carbonates and open faults 8 conclusions applying the volume averaging method we develop a two equation reservoir scale model for solute mass transport through two well defined geological facies several effective coefficients arose such as mass dispersion tensors pseudo convective and pseudo absorption terms and interfacies mass transfer coefficients the definitions of these coefficients are provided with the closure problems used to estimate them which allows us to link them with physics and the geometrical distribution of facies at a smaller scale i e the darcy scale for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies the longitudinal components if applicable of effective coefficients are computed by solving the associated closure problems as function of rock permeability on the basis of numerical estimations we found that mass dispersion tensors and pseudo velocities are the relevant coefficients the averaged two equation model is compared with direct simulations at the darcy scale when a solute slug is injected into a synthetic lenticular reservoir it was found that general trends of solute plume and breakthrough curves agree well in this work we established the fundamentals to the derive a one equation model which is widely used to interpret tracer injection tests in hydrocarbon water and geothermal reservoirs ongoing work acknowledgments echh thanks the support from uanl during his research stay at ftc linares appendix a estimation of orders of magnitude we start by estimating the

in some cases for this problem each closure problem consists of a steady state boundary value problem with two coupled dependent variables note that the dependent variables are coupled through the inter facies boundary conditions for closure problems 1 4 presented above the eight dependent variables are vectors whereas closure problem 5 has two scalar dependent variables for instance closure problem 1 contains the closure variables b ÏÏ and b Î·Ï whose individual components for 2d cartesian coordinates are b ÏÏ x b ÏÏ y b Î·Ï x and b Î·Ï y furthermore the efforts to find their solutions become overwhelming as the dimensionality of the problem increases additionally the shape of each partial differential equation lies within the advection diffusion reaction form see for instance eq b 1 but containing one integral source which confers nonlocal characteristics within the volume averaging framework whitaker 1999 it is usual that the closure variables are subjected to periodic conditions at the external cell boundaries and the problem is well posed by adding the restriction to the average Ï 0 Ï any closure variable which results from using eq 23 however the usage of homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions has demonstrated to yield similar results to those using periodic conditions ochoa tapia et al 1994 and with the advantage of decreasing the computational or analytical costs in our calculations homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions were used at the external boundaries of cells finally we mention that the usage of the finite element method to solve the closure problems is not a unique manner of solution the solution of these problems have been addressed using other techniques for instance analytical techniques have been employed considering

699,in this work we present a methodology for upscaling solute transport in heterogeneous reservoirs the problem considers upscaling from the darcy scale of a porous medium to the reservoir scale we first define the mathematical problem that governs solute mass transport at the so called darcy scale and then we apply the method of volume averaging this method allows for upscaling the governing equations at the whole reservoir scale and eventually developing physical constraints definitions of average variables and effective coefficients one important characteristic of the volume averaging method is that the so called closure problems for analytical or numerical computation of effective coefficients are identified the closure problems consist of boundary value problems whose solution must be carried out in representative geometries unit cells of the reservoir in this paper we developed the theory for a two facies reservoir but the extension for more facies is straightforward in this context we present the two equation model and the numerical estimation of effective coefficients are presented and discussed for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies in this manner relevant coefficients are identified the numerical solution of the upscaled model agrees well with direct numerical results when the governing equations are solved at the darcy scale graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mass dispersion reservoir scale volume averaging method two facies two equation model 1 introduction the modeling of solute mass transport in heterogeneous reservoirs has been an active theme for investigation this theme is of interest in areas such as hydrogeology enhanced hydrocarbon recovery environmental sciences as well as geothermal energy commonly classic advection dispersion equations have been extensively used to model the transport of solutes through heterogeneous reservoirs but the physical meaning and rigorous link of effective coefficients with physics at smaller scales are unclear quintard and whitaker 1998 considered the transport of an adsorbing solute in a two region model of a chemically and mechanically heterogeneous porous medium when the condition of large scale for instance at the field scale mechanical equilibrium is valid the authors consider that under these circumstances a one equation model can be used to predict the large scale averaged velocity but a two equation model may be required to predict the regional velocities that are needed to accurately describe the solute transport process if the condition of large scale mass equilibrium is valid the solute transport process can be represented in terms of a one equation model in this context on one hand the two equation model refers to a set of governing equations composed of one equation to model flow inside one region and the other equation models fluid flow in the remaining region in this formulation the properties of each region are required on the other hand for the one equation formulation only one equation is employed that contains global parameters and it is not able to model fluid flow in individual regions the upscaling procedure followed by quintard and whitaker consisted of scaling the point equations i e local scale to the darcy scale i e to the scale of the porous medium then the authors scaled the darcy description to a larger scale applying the volume average method twice which represented a method of systematic upscaling based on upscaling the governing equations in sequential form on the other hand porta et al 2012 presented a volume averaging based theoretical analysis of upscaling of reactive transport processes involving fast bimolecular homogeneous irreversible reactions occurring within a porous medium the authors began from the formulation that drove system dynamics at the pore scale and derived the governing equations at the observation scale associated with laboratory scale scenarios this involved advection dominated transport of two reactants and resulting products in the presence of different relative strengths dahmkÃ¶hler and pÃ©clet numbers in the seminal work by wood 2009 a valuable discussion is presented on the role of scaling laws in upscaling he discussed the process of coarse graining in complex subsurface hydrologic systems with the intention to examine the difference between the mathematical process of averaging and the upscaling process according to this author an averaged description does not contain less information than the original problem for the problem of nonreactive solute transport in heterogeneous media five different scaling laws were identified as necessary i influence of boundaries ii statistical homogeneity iii separation of length scales iv ergodicity and v smallness of the variance another discussion by wood concerns an upscaled mathematical model that has the ability to represent a complex system at the expense of also requiring more parameterization and characterization in order to get the model to work regarding the scales porous systems often exhibit hierarchical configurations e g espinosa paredes 2014 chabanon et al 2015 where for instance the solid matrix at the macroscopic scale is itself microporous another example concerns porous media in which the impermeable solid mesostructure is embedded in a finer saturated porous medium which is also embedded in another finer porous structure and so on for this reason heterogeneous reservoirs can be considered at the following hierarchy of scales local scale darcy scale macroscopic scale and large scale or reservoir scale espinosa paredes 2014 this categorization provides a scheme for applications in geo energetic and hydrogeological systems raoof and hassanizadeh 2010 developed relationships between the pore scale adsorption coefficient and corresponding upscaled adsorption parameters they applied both theoretical averaging and numerical upscaling in the averaging approach equilibrium adsorption is assumed at the pore scale and solute transport equations are averaged over a representative volume rev this leads to explicit expressions for macroscale adsorption rate constants as a function of microscale parameters in the numerical approach raoof and hassanizadeh first simulated solute transport within a single tube undergoing equilibrium adsorption at the pore wall from which flux averaged concentration breakthrough curves were obtained these were used to determine the upscaled adsorption rate constants as functions of the pore scale other upscaling methods for solute transport have been proposed for example a method based on genetic programming was presented by hill et al 2007 and a method based on random walking was proposed by geiger et al 2010 hill et al investigated the development of a domain independent modeling tool that searches the space of mathematical equations for one or more equations to describe a set of training data these methods based on genetic algorithms are promising when there are many field data but in most cases when this information is available the method is no longer necessary that is this method can be applied for post analysis for interpretation of physical properties currently classical dual porosity approaches in conjunction with an advection dispersion equation and macroscopic dispersivity commonly fail to accurately predict the breakthrough of fractured porous media for this a continuous time random walk method can be used as a generalized upscaling approach geiger et al 2010 according to geider et al this procedure allows for predicting breakthrough at other locations accurately and gaining significant insights into the nature of fracture matrix interactions in naturally fractured porous reservoirs with geologically realistic fracture geometries however this method requires the correct estimation of the distribution of retention times which is crucial for understanding the upscaled character of solute transport the upscaling of mass dispersion has also been studied using the percolation theory in combination with scaling methodologies recently sahimi 2012 employed the continuous time random walk method along the power law growth of the mean square displacement of the solute to analyze mass dispersion in heterogeneous media sahimi presented the intrinsic relation of geometrical exponents of percolation with the coefficients involved in the power law of effective conductivity and permeability close the percolation threshold ghanbarian alavijeh et al 2012 extended the analysis of dispersion involving the saturation and porosity effects the studies combined the percolation technique with fractal scaling laws they found that the most important feature for facilitating good experimental predictions is the applicability or not of random or invasion percolation simulations in enhanced hydrocarbon recovery studies combustion tube experiments are conducted in the laboratory to determine the burning characteristics of a particular oil in a rock matrix the data obtained from history matching the tube experiments cannot be directly used for field simulation because grid blocks for the tube simulation are on the order of inches thick whereas grid blocks for a field simulation are typically 100 to 1000 times larger marjerrison and fassihi 1992 as such an upscaling procedure is necessary in this sense on one hand marjerrison and fassihi 1992 presented a procedure for scaling heavy oil combustion tube results to a field model the authors showed that their scaling method for a simulation model was feasible however it is not a systematic method because it is based on empiricisms on the other hand islam and ali 1992 analyzed the scaling criteria for in situ combustion experiments they used partial differential equations in three dimensional systems to derive a set of scaling criteria these criteria can be applied but they do not constitute an upscaling method recently aguilar madera et al 2017 presented an upscaling procedure for in situ combustion by using the volume averaging method considering homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reactions multiphase and multicomponent features the authors developed closure schemes to estimate effective coefficients but the application of such theory has not yet been done on the other hand the recovery from incompletely water wet fractured reservoirs can be extremely low a reason for low recovery is related to wetting issues whereas the reason for slow recovery may be the nonequilibrium behavior of capillary pressure to incorporate nonequilibrium into larger scale problems salimi and bruining 2012 applied homogenization techniques to derive an upscaled model for fractured reservoirs the association of methods for the complex scaling problem may be a feasible solution for example the association of upscaling by the volume averaging method with the network approach is presented in the work of ahmadi et al 2001 the facies analysis approach is widely used and accepted to study heterogeneous reservoirs as well as in fields such as deep water processes e g pickering et al 1986 shanmugam 2000 cullis et al 2018 glacier formation e g mccarthy et al 2017 mertes et al 2017 watson et al 2018 diagenesis in oil fields e g beigi et al

compartmentalization within a reservoir for seismic facies analysis e g song et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 in the work of cullis et al 2018 facies associations were applied to diagnostic criteria used to discern each hierarchical order in the field of deep marine sedimentary geology to assign a spatial and temporal order to the sedimentary architecture of preserved deep marine deposits meanwhile in mertes et al 2017 ground penetration radar gpr was used to identify sedimentary facies the detailed heterogeneity of shale facies and their relationship to pore networks was analyzed in li et al 2017 various approaches are used to develop numerical models for facies distributions within a reservoir however only two approaches are traditionally used strebelle and journel 2001 pixel based and object based techniques it is worth mentioning that both approaches can be used simultaneously for facies distribution numerical models in a recent study advanced modeling approaches for gas field analysis considered multistage constraints and hierarchical facies control as well as multistep modeling zhi et al 2015 according to previous studies facies analysis is fundamental because porosity and permeability control the storage and fluid flow in reservoir rocks which are highly heterogeneous due to their geological evolution influenced by sedimentary origin diagenetic processes and burial history the latter processes influence the size and shape of pores that produce complex pore networks in sedimentary rocks in this regarding lattice boltzmann simulations of fluid flow in continental carbonate reservoir rocks was presented by soete et al 2017 where dominant lithofacies types were identified all of the facies types had pores that varied from at least the nanometer to centimeter scale i e meso and macropore networks which had relevant contributions to fluid flow in the material thus facies modeling is an essential part of reservoir characterization where the connectivity of the facies model is critical for the dynamic modeling of reservoirs according to bayat et al 2016 carbonate reservoirs are so heterogeneous that variogram based methods such as sequential indicator simulations are not very useful for facies modeling the author also proposes the use of multiple point geostatistics mps for facies modeling in oil fields in this work we propose a systematic methodology for modeling solute transport in heterogeneous reservoirs composed by two well defined facies from the point of view of own petrophysical properties the fundamental idea behind this methodology is the upscaling of the model where the darcy scale corresponds to porous media and the application of a volume averaging procedure allows upscaling of the governing equations for solute transport at the reservoir scale the upscaling method generates more unknown variables than equations which are solved with closure problems in representative geometries to obtain the effective coefficients at the reservoir scale a facies analysis of the reservoir must already exist i e the starting point of the methodology developed in this work considers a known hierarchical facies structure although the theory presented in this work corresponds to a two facies reservoir the extension to a larger number of facies could be also carried out however the application to three or more facies reservoirs is extremely complex and it will yield three or more averaged equations strongly coupled through several effective coefficients the application in practical problems of such mathematical model would be an overwhelming task from the point of view of the model solutions and the determination of the various effective coefficients involved nevertheless we state that a simple one equation model can be obtained adding the individual averaged equations for each facies and this model could be more representative for three or more facies reservoirs the extension of the volume averaged methodology here presented to three or more facies is out of the pursued scopes and it will be investigated in future works for the two facies approximation the numerical estimation of effective coefficients is presented and discussed for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies according to results obtained with a numerical solution the upscaled model agrees well with direct numerical results when governing equations are solved at the darcy scale this article is organized as follows section 2 presents the governing equation at the darcy scale for two well defined facies with homogeneous properties in the reservoir section 3 describes the preliminary results of the volume averaging procedure in section 4 the closed system of equations in terms of the spatial deviations of concentrations is developed in section 5 the closed volume averaged equations and the physical meanings of effective coefficients are discussed section 6 presents the numerical estimation and analysis of effective coefficients in section 7 the upscaling model validation reservoir scale is performed through comparison with the darcy scale simulation major observations regarding the proposed methodology for upscaling modeling from the darcy scale to the reservoir scale are presented in section 8 2 governing equations at the darcy scale we begin the study of solute transport at the darcy scale by assuming that there are two well defined facies with homogeneous properties in the reservoir as shown in fig 1 for one heterogeneous reservoir composed of two homogeneous facies called the Ï and Î· regions the accommodation of porous rocks inside the reservoir can be one of two categories a dispersed and b layered two facies reservoir the origin of these geological types of reservoirs is driven by for instance the sedimentary environment and sediment provenance for layered reservoirs only one configuration can be found but for dispersed two facies reservoirs there are four variants namely a flaser b wavy c lenticular and d pin stripe types as depicted in fig 1 for the two region reservoirs depicted in fig 1 the system of equations governing the mass transport of one solute inside a mobile fluid phase is given by in the Ï region 1 c Ï t u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï in the Î· region 2 c Î· t u Î· c Î· d Î· c Î· at t 0 3 c Ï c Ï 0 c Î· c Î· 0 at the Ï Î· boundary 4 c Ï c Î· at the Ï Î· boundary 5 n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï n Ï Î· u Î· c Î· d Î· c Î· in these equations ck and d k are the solute concentration and mass dispersion tensor in the k region respectively in the transport problem represented by eqs 1 5 it is assumed that the seepage velocities u Ï and u Î· can be calculated alternatively according to the type and number of fluids flowing in the reservoir as well as with previous knowledge of petrophysical properties of the reservoir for instance a darcy s law assumption can be used for liquids oil and water but the darcy forchheimer model is commonly employed for gases it is worth mentioning that dispersion coefficients are intrinsic functions of microstructure and pore space characteristics hunt et al 2011 and fluid velocity valdÃ©s parada et al 2016 in eq 5 n ÏÎ· is the unit normal vector pointing from the Ï region to the Î· region see fig 1 the boundary value problem for c Ï is completed by the statement of conditions at external reservoir boundaries these conditions can be set up as known flux j Ï re or concentration c Ï re which can be position dependent i e at the external boundary of the reservoir 6 n Ï r e u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï j Ï r e z or 7 c Ï c Ï r e z here n Ï re is the normal vector pointing outside the reservoir and z is the position vector locating the external boundary eqs 6 and 7 are provided for the sake of completeness but as developed further this information will be not required because boundary effects are discarded in our analysis and representative zones of reservoir bulk are used to predict numerically effective coefficients 3 preliminaries volume averaging procedure in the volume averaging method it is necessary to define superficial and intrinsic volume averaging operators as follows 8 superficial average Ï k 1 v v k Ï k d v k Ï Î· 9 intrinsic average Ï k k 1 v k v k Ï k d v k Ï Î· where Ï k is any variable defined in the k region vk represents the geometrical space only encompassing the k region where the averaging is carried out and v and vk are the volumes of geometrical spaces v and vk respectively the averaging operators 8 and 9 are related by the volume fraction of k region as follows 10 Ï k É k Ï k k k Ï Î· 11 É k v k v k Ï Î· the size and shape of the averaging volume must be appropriate in order to spatially smooth the variable that is to be upscaled in fig 1 it is apparent that for dispersed reservoirs one spherical shape encompassing various Î· type rocks might be the best option meanwhile for layered reservoirs one thin rectangular prism including the entire net pay of the reservoir could be the most appropriate we first conduct the theoretical development to upscale the solute transport inside the Ï region thus applying the operator 8 to eq 1 we have 12 c Ï t u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï to introduce the integral operator within the time and space derivatives we appeal to the spatial averaging theorem howes and whitaker 1985 13 Ï Ï Ï Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· Ï Ï d a and the reynolds general transport theorem 14 Ï Ï t Ï Ï t 1 v a Ï Î· Ï k w Ï Î· n Ï Î· d a 1 v a Ï e Ï k w Ï e n

in contact with the Ï region here rev is equivalent to the averaging volume n Ïe is the unit normal vector pointing from the Ï region outward from the rev as shown in fig 2 considering nondeformable and static reservoir rocks and rev we have 15 w Ï Î· w Ï e 0 it is important to note that the assumption w ÏÎ· 0 implies that mass fluxes at the Ï Î· boundary are equal i e ÏÏ u Ï n ÏÎ· ÏÎ· u Î· n ÏÎ· here ÏÏ and ÏÎ· are the Ï and Î· facies densities respectively this means that there is one impenetrability condition between the Ï and Î· regions in the sense that one facies does not encroach on the other thus eq 14 simplifies to 16 c Ï t c Ï t turning our attention to the advective term of eq 12 and after using the spatial averaging theorem we have 17 u Ï c Ï u Ï c Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d a in the same way the dispersive term becomes 18 d Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· c Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· d Ï c Ï d a note that eqs 17 and 18 contain two types of concentrations the darcy scale c Ï and the average concentration c Ï then the spatial decomposition gray 1975 19 Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï Ï is introduced in the first integral of eq

spatial deviations i e 23 Ï Ï 0 such an approximation is valid if 24 r 0 l r 0 2 l c 1 l where r 0 represents the size of volume averaging l is the characteristic length of the reservoir and l c1 is the characteristic length over which significant concentration gradient changes occur the derivation of these inequalities is given in appendix a thus the volume averaged equation for the Ï region is 25 É Ï c Ï Ï t É Ï u Ï Ï c Ï Ï u Ï c Ï d Ï É Ï c Ï Ï 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· c Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï Ï d Ï c Ï Ï d a 1 v a Ï Î· n Ï Î· u Ï c Ï d Ï c Ï d a this equation is impractical because it contains the average concentration and its spatial deviation and additionally the surface integrals confer nonlocal characteristics thus the following stage within the volume averaging method refers to developing the governing equation for spatial deviations we note that a similar procedure is performed to obtain the volume averaged equation for Î· facies but this development is omitted here for brevity 4 the closure scheme to develop a closed system of equations we must find the governing equation for c Ï a simple and direct procedure is subtracting eq

the averaging volume moves into the reservoir it is a somewhat strong assumption which is straightforwardly satisfied for periodic arrangements of facies nevertheless in practice geological reservoirs can be highly heterogeneous within a given depositional environment thus the validity of ÎµÏ 0 can be applied only to reservoirs that are statistically homogeneous with no strong changes in the accommodation of each lithofacies such as in the bulk of geological formations and sufficiently far from the tops faults base and pinch outs of reservoirs within the geostatistics framework there is a type of reservoir that is considered as stationary when stochastic processes are performed to model the spatial distribution of properties kriging procedures in this context modeling a stationary reservoir implicates that the mean values and variance of petrophysical properties are constants inside the reservoir such implications help qualitatively to satisfy the requirement of a homogeneous facies distribution however a more rigorous analysis of physical implications behind the expression ÎµÏ 0 is beyond the scope of this work we recognize the importance of exploring this topic in a future study for which we will study coupling between geostatistical data and the upscaling of geological reservoirs using the spatial decomposition for concentration and velocity the convective term

in depth inspection of effective coefficients defined in 48 62 some statements regarding their physics can be concluded each effective coefficient depends on certain closure variable and each closure variable captures the effect of a specific unitary source over solute transport at the darcy scale in this regard we quote for instance the coefficient d ÏÏ which upscales the mass transport by dispersive mechanisms inside the Ï facies when there is a driving source c Ï Ï i e an inter well gradient concentration which is commonly found in tracer transport tests in this manner each effective coefficient is related to one source as follows effects of the source c Ï Ï are quantified in d ÏÏ d Î·Ï and w Ï effects of the source c Î· Î· are quantified in d ÏÎ· d Î·Î· and w Î· effects of the source c Ï Ï are quantified in v ÏÏ v Î·Ï and ÏÏ effects of the source c Î· Î· are quantified in v ÏÎ· v Î·Î· and ÏÎ· effects of the source c Ï Ï c Î· Î· are quantified in avkl k lÏ and k lÎ· the fact that each scale source can be individually quantified is due to the clear separation of scales between the darcy and reservoir scales that is assumed during the theoretical development length scale disparities eq 24 as well as the linearization imposed to some quantities during the estimation of orders of magnitude recall that truncated taylor series expansions were used the final result of estimations of orders of magnitude is summarized through eqs 29 35 the effect of the geometrical arrangement of facies is quantified through the area integrals that are included in the definitions of effective coefficients some coefficients include hydrodynamic darcy scale dispersive effects which lead to additional transport due to flow within facies this phenomenon is quantified through the volume integrals u f x where f stands for any facies and x stands for any closure variable most coefficients d Î·Ï d ÏÎ· v ÏÏ v ÏÎ· v Î·Ï v Î·Î· avkl w Ï w Î· ÏÏ ÏÎ· vanish as long as one facies disappears meanwhile others simplify d ÏÏ d Î·Î· as result of the upscaling procedure two first order absorption like terms appeared naturally ÏÏ c Ï Ï and ÏÎ· c Î· Î· to avoid confusion they are named pseudo absorption terms as they do not truly represent absorption because this phenomenon was not considered in the darcy scale governing equations the physical meaning of these terms can be deduced from the definitions of effective coefficients ÏÏ and ÏÎ· in eqs 61 and 62 they represent inter facies mass flux and its driving forces are the average concentrations c Ï Ï and c Î· Î· for instance for cases when c Ï Ï 0 ÏÏ vanishes note in eqs 46 and 47 that the absorption like terms have opposite signs indicating that the mass of solute disappearing from one facies appears in the other facies 6 numerical estimation of effective coefficients in this section we performed the numerical estimation of all effective coefficients defined in eqs 48 62 to this end the closure problems presented in appendix b are solved in representative geometries at the darcy scale after the closure variables solution is available the calculation of effective coefficients is performed by computing the corresponding integral quantity of definitions 48 62 each closure problem allows the computation of the following effective coefficients closure problem 1 solves for d ÏÏ d Î·Ï and w Ï closure problem 2 solves for d ÏÎ· d Î·Î· and w Î· closure problem 3 solves for v ÏÏ v Î·Ï and ÏÏ closure problem 4 solves for v ÏÎ· v Î·Î· and ÏÎ· closure problem 5 solves for avkl k lÏ and k lÎ· recall that each closure problem requires parameters at the darcy scale if such information is known a priori then this information can be used in the numerical computation in this work we do not intend to predict coefficients using real and measured quantities from geological fields rather we use the approximate values for representative lithologies summarized in table 1 meanwhile the synthetic geometries depicted in fig 3 will be used as cells for the solution of closure problems we stress that our theoretical development is not limited to these simplifications and eventually real geometries and data from the darcy scale can be utilized to estimate the upscaled coefficients within the volume averaging method the use of representative cells assumes that such geometries can be periodically repeated in all directions and eventually the entire reservoir is reproduced the cell pressured drop remained fixed to solve the closure problems in this manner the momentum and mass balance for a unique flowing phase water is solved allowing the computation of the velocity field which is required as input data in closure problems and allowing for recalculating the mass dispersion coefficients at the darcy scale for each facies d Ï and d Î· the darcy scale coefficients are computed according to the expression 63 d f d m i a f u f f Ï Î· where dm is the molecular diffusion coefficient and a f is the mass dispersion tensor which is assumed to be isotropic and the same for each type of rock i e a f Î± i according to eq 63 the molecular diffusion dm is the same for both facies because the flowing fluid water and solute are the same in each facies in this work the closure problems were numerically solved using comsol multiphysics which is based on the finite element method the number of domain elements is shown in fig 3 for each cell we noted that the number of domain elements are sufficient to obtain mesh independent results while not compromising computation efforts other numerical configurations were maintained by default which is optimized for handling nonlinear problems and small relative error tolerance we limited the number of cases under study and only two representative geometries of two facies systems are used i a layered system and ii a dispersed system lenticular arrangement note that for layered systems the height cell is fixed to 20 m and the corresponding computations are representative of thin or ultra thin bed reservoirs 6 1 closure variables field in figs 4 8 closure variables computed in representative cells are plotted for four relevant situations for layered and lenticular two facies arrangements and for when one facies is more hydraulically conductive than the other this is quantified through the permeability ratio kÎ· kÏ the longitudinal components of closure variables involved in closure problem 1 i e b ÏÏ x and b Î·Ï x are depicted in fig 4 these variables can present symmetric or anti symmetric behavior around defined orthogonal planes for the lenticular case and considering a poorly conductive Î· facies a quasi antisymmetry of the closure variables appears the numerical solution of closure variables related to closure problem 2 b ÏÎ· x and b Î·Î· x has similar features to that for closure problem 1 but with opposite values when lenticular cells are used as depicted in fig 5 however notice that color legends for each figure have different value ranges in general the numerical solution of closure problems 1 and 2 suggests that relevant information takes place around the Î· Ï interface the closure variables related to closure problem 3 d ÏÏ and d Î·Ï are deployed in fig 6 it is noted for layered cells that closure variables practically have negligible values whereas for lenticular arrangements significant values and symmetry and antisymmetry appear depending on the permeability ratio considering the closure variables of problem 4 d ÏÎ· and d Î·Î· the general trends of the numerical solution are similar to those of closure problem 3 for a lenticular arrangement as is apparent in fig 7 the closure variables for problems 3 and 4 take major relevance when one facies is dispersed into the other this suggests that the effective coefficients related to the closure problems could take importance for lenticular reservoirs by recalling the effective coefficient definitions we note that closure problems 3 and 4 allow for the computation of pseudo convective coefficients and pseudo absorptive terms of up scaled mass balance equations given by eqs 46 and 47 where some have negligible effects over the global mass transport process this topic is revisited later in the manuscript finally the numerical solution of closure variables related to closure problem 5 s Ï and s Î· is presented in fig 8 in this case for layered and lenticular cells the closure variables have non negligible values regardless of the permeability ratio as in the other closure variables some symmetry planes can be defined 6 2 numerical estimation of effective coefficients after solving all of the closure problems the various effective coefficients can be computed we only compute the longitudinal component of coefficients xx if applicable for two arrangements of facies the effects of the two facies distributions that are depicted in fig 1 will be explored in detail in a future study in the following analysis the dominant parameters are identified allowing for the reduction of model parameters and optimizing the analysis of effective coefficients in tables 3 6 the numerical estimations of coefficients are tabulated and compared several of the coefficients are normalized with the darcy scale mass dispersion coefficients note in the first column that the permeability ratio was changed by one order of magnitude on the basis of their estimations we conclude that dominant coefficients are those in table 2 as complementary information table 6 summarizes the associated pÃ©clet number for each case simulated and for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies the pÃ©clet number was calculated as 64 p e clet number length cell v cell v cell u d v d m u u Ï or u Î· depending on position where v cell is the volume of the cell and u is the norm of the velocity vector in general the pÃ©clet number varies exponentially with the permeability ratio and with the arrangement of facies in the cell finally with the goal to observe the general trends of effective mass dispersion and transfer coefficients they were plotted in fig 9 as function of the permeability ratio from the resulting curves it is clear that all dispersion coefficients are comparable except the crossed coefficient d ÏÎ· xx interestingly a weak dependency on the permeability ratio is observed regarding the mass transfer coefficient it is enhanced as long as the permeability of continuous facies increases and it is more obvious for lenticular geometries 7 validation of model and comparison of dispersion coefficients 7 1 comparison of model results with darcy scale simulation the derived two equation model eqs 46 47 is not commonly used to interpret tracer injection tests in geological reservoirs to the best of our knowledge there are not appropriate data to compare and validate numerical estimations of effective coefficients instead the one equation model is widely used which only contains one mass dispersion tensor and a unique average concentration from the two equation model it is possible to derive the one equation model if validity of local mass equilibrium is assumed however the implications of local mass equilibrium are unclear at this point this will be investigated in a future work one manner to verify the congruency of the upscaling procedure and whether the effective coefficients were correctly computed is by comparing the solution provided by the upscaled model with those from the darcy scale governing equations for each facies eqs 1 5 we must recall that we initiated the analysis by setting governing equations at the darcy scale and then the volume averaging method was applied to upscale the equations thus we expect similar solutions if the darcy scale or upscaled models are employed nevertheless it should be clarified that identical solutions are not expected as some approximations were assumed i e we applied length scale constraints and estimations of orders of magnitude as described in appendix a our intention is to demonstrate that the upscaled model has high congruency with the physics that occur at a smaller scale the usage of darcy scale models involves an overwhelming computational task which in most of the cases is unnecessary and perhaps unsolvable as demonstrated later the upscaled two equation model has important computational advantages as long as effective coefficients are available with these premises we simulate 30 years of a mass transport case in a 2d 200 100 m domain as depicted in fig 10 we select a lenticular synthetic geometry composed of two facies with the following petrophysical properties k Ï 10 md k Î· 0 1 md ÏÏ 0 08 and ÏÎ· 0 01 fig 10 corresponds to one transverse cutting plane where the vertical axis represents reservoir depth at the inlet boundary solute is injected for a short period at a constant pressure the outlet boundary is also maintained at a constant pressure as follows c solu te 2000 mg l t 2 h 0 mg l t 2 h p inje ction 5000 psi p prod ucti on 4900 psi both darcy scale and upscaled mathematical models were solved with comsol multiphysics using the grid mesh shown in fig 10 for a core i7 2 7 ghz laptop computer the computational time for the darcy scale model was 93 s whereas the upscaled model required 6 s 93 5 less computational effort this supports the computational advantages of using average models the model solutions were compared by observing the breakthrough curves at observation points identified in fig 10 as well as the evolution of concentration profiles in continuous facies see fig 11 at first glance close similitude between evolving concentration profiles is met but some differences appear for short times in the upper part of reservoir for 15 years nevertheless interestingly both approaches yield similar mass transport if the global shape of the solute plume and maximum and minimum values are scrutinized this comparison of model solutions is better appreciated with breakthrough curves at observation points as observed in fig 12 there are differences in the time of maximum concentration and for some periods the upscaled model overestimates the concentration however the general trends of the concentration curves are similar 7 1 comparison of dispersion coefficients with field data as mentioned in the previous subsection a strict comparison of effective coefficients with those measured or deduced from field data is not possible at present for two reasons i field tests addressed to evaluate the solute transport in reservoirs are commonly interpreted using the one equation model and furthermore a unique dispersion tensor is reported in the literature ii in this work we computed the effective coefficients for layered and lenticular reservoirs thus in order to validate them similar reservoirs must be used for comparison in practice the in situ arrangement and lithology of fluid reservoirs can vary significantly according to its geological history which leads to large heterogeneities of petrophysical fluid rock and solute transport properties in one attempt to show such heterogeneities we plot dispersion coefficients estimated from tracer tests in water and petroleum reservoirs in fig 13 note the variety of lithologies and the magnitude of coefficient dispersions ranging from 1 10 10 to 1 100 m2 s in our approach we assumed a continuous facies in the Î· region and furthermore the coefficient d Î·Î· is dominant surprisingly depending on the rock permeabilities the numerical estimations of d Î·Î· xx can be very close to those dispersion coefficients estimated for gravel layered compost and limestone gravel laminated clay layers of silt and sand fractured carbonates and open faults 8 conclusions applying the volume averaging method we develop a two equation reservoir scale model for solute mass transport through two well defined geological facies several effective coefficients arose such as mass dispersion tensors pseudo convective and pseudo absorption terms and interfacies mass transfer coefficients the definitions of these coefficients are provided with the closure problems used to estimate them which allows us to link them with physics and the geometrical distribution of facies at a smaller scale i e the darcy scale for lenticular and layered arrangements of facies the longitudinal components if applicable of effective coefficients are computed by solving the associated closure problems as function of rock permeability on the basis of numerical estimations we found that mass dispersion tensors and pseudo velocities are the relevant coefficients the averaged two equation model is compared with direct simulations at the darcy scale when a solute slug is injected into a synthetic lenticular reservoir it was found that general trends of solute plume and breakthrough curves agree well in this work we established the fundamentals to the derive a one equation model which is widely used to interpret tracer injection tests in hydrocarbon water and geothermal reservoirs ongoing work acknowledgments echh thanks the support from uanl during his research stay at ftc linares appendix a estimation of orders of magnitude we start by estimating the

each facies with the solution of closure variables all effective coefficients can be calculated and used in the average equations nevertheless the solution of closure problems can be a demanding task in some cases for this problem each closure problem consists of a steady state boundary value problem with two coupled dependent variables note that the dependent variables are coupled through the inter facies boundary conditions for closure problems 1 4 presented above the eight dependent variables are vectors whereas closure problem 5 has two scalar dependent variables for instance closure problem 1 contains the closure variables b ÏÏ and b Î·Ï whose individual components for 2d cartesian coordinates are b ÏÏ x b ÏÏ y b Î·Ï x and b Î·Ï y furthermore the efforts to find their solutions become overwhelming as the dimensionality of the problem increases additionally the shape of each partial differential equation lies within the advection diffusion reaction form see for instance eq b 1 but containing one integral source which confers nonlocal characteristics within the volume averaging framework whitaker 1999 it is usual that the closure variables are subjected to periodic conditions at the external cell boundaries and the problem is well posed by adding the restriction to the average Ï 0 Ï any closure variable which results from using eq 23 however the usage of homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions has demonstrated to yield similar results to those using periodic conditions ochoa tapia et al 1994 and with the advantage of decreasing the computational or analytical costs in our calculations homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions were used at the external boundaries of cells finally we mention that the usage of the finite element method to solve the closure problems is not a unique manner of solution the solution of these problems have been addressed using other techniques for instance analytical techniques have been employed considering regular cells chang 1982 continuous time random walk methods in fractured media nÅtinger et al 2001 and pseudo analytic procedures using green functions in reactive mass transport valdÃ©s parada 2010
