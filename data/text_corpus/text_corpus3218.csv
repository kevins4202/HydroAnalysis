16090,watersheds continue to be urbanized across different regions of the united states increasing the number of impaired waterbodies due to urban stormwater using machine learning techniques this study examined how stormwater quality and watershed characteristics are related at a national scale and compared stormwater quality across watersheds in diverse climates we analyzed a selection of data from the national stormwater quality database nsqd comprising 1 881 stormwater samples taken from 182 watersheds in 26 metropolitan areas in the united states between 1992 and 2003 using an ensemble clustering algorithm the stormwater quality in these samples was classified into stormwater signatures defined as distinct combinations of 9 contaminants including metals pb zn cu particulates tss tds and nutrients bod tp tkn nox next multinomial logistic regression was applied to the nsqd data now classified by signature and combined with climate weather land use and imperviousness data obtained from multiple sources the results yielded 5 stormwater signatures with distinct aquatic toxicity implications and relationships to climate weather land use and imperviousness signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic defined by high median concentrations of contaminants likely represents the first flush in moderate to high imperviousness watersheds signature 2 reduced nitrates represents a wet season signature particularly for dry climates signature 3 potentially eutrophic represents the first flush in low imperviousness watersheds signature 4 elevated particulates and metals represents a wet season signature particularly on warmer days finally signature 5 most dilute is primarily a regional signature associated with the warm wet climate of the southeastern us this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating how machine learning techniques can be used to identify patterns in high dimensional and highly variable data applied to stormwater quality these techniques identify major patterns in stormwater quality across the united states using a stormwater signature approach which examines how contaminants co occur and under what climate weather land use and impervious conditions the findings point to dominant processes driving stormwater generation and inform watershed monitoring green infrastructure planning stormwater quality under climate change and opportunities for public engagement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater quality water quality machine learning climate weather imperviousness 1 introduction urban development degrades water quality in aquatic ecosystems by introducing contaminants from stormwater national research council 2009 stormwater currently impairs 79 000 kilometers of rivers 307 000 hectares of lakes and 43 000 square kilometers of bays and estuaries u s epa 2020 future urbanization trends present a concerning outlook for the nation s waterbodies the us population is projected to grow by 79 million people between 2017 and 2060 vespa et al 2020 expanding urbanization and continuing a historic pattern of rural land development alig et al 2004 brown et al 2005 white et al 2009 the projected scale of urbanization could amount to building a new city the size of phoenix every seven months fleming et al 2020 with this scale of projected growth it is reasonable to conclude that future watershed development will further jeopardize the aquatic health of the nation s waterbodies obtaining a more detailed spatially explicit understanding of how development impacts stormwater quality is challenging stormwater quality exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal variability due to the complexity of urban hydrology contaminant generation processes and precipitation patterns stormwater biogeochemistry is affected by materials present in and on urban surfaces anthropogenic activities and drainage systems as well as localized temperature humidity and photolytic conditions al ali et al 2018 liu et al 2013 m√ºller et al 2020 the contaminant masses that build up on urban surfaces depend on the rate of deposition antecedent dry weather period re suspension aggregation and re deposition processes goonetilleke and lampard 2019 these processes are influenced by watershed characteristics particularly imperviousness land use and land cover which have patch size and configuration effects within a watershed lee et al 2009 when a storm arrives rainfall characteristics such as rainfall depth intensity and duration pollution transport in stormwater egodawatta et al 2007 vaze and chiew 2003 meanwhile ambient temperature and sunlight influence the transformation of contaminants thus the climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics of watersheds drive the complex processes that produce stormwater quality in the past stormwater quality has typically been sampled at shorter time scales or small spatial scales which impedes discernment of generalizable patterns and produces results that are supported by low statistical power this study uses machine learning techniques to compare stormwater quality across a large dataset of 1 881 stormwater samples from 182 watersheds in the united states and explores the influence of climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics the data comes from the national stormwater quality database nsqd which has been analyzed in other recent studies moeini et al 2021 bell et al 2020 zivkovich and mays 2018 and granata et al 2017 this study is novel because it analyzes nsqd data using machine learning paired with climate weather land use and imperviousness data from other sources giving context to stormwater quality and watershed characteristics at a national scale it is also novel in its treatment of the high variability inherent to stormwater quality this study employs an ensemble clustering algorithm designed for highly variable data to classify stormwater quality into categories these categories are called stormwater signatures defined as distinct combinations of nine common contaminants in this study we ask the following research questions what are the major stormwater signatures across the united states how are stormwater signatures driven by the climate weather land use and imperviousness of watersheds what dominant biogeochemical processes might each stormwater signature represent how are stormwater signatures produced by different types of watersheds the stormwater signature approach in this study is similar to the kaushal et al 2020 2018 concept of chemical cocktails for understanding water quality in freshwater ecosystems chemical cocktails are described as anthropogenically driven combinations of chemicals that are influenced by the contaminant sources climate land use geology and atmospheric deposition in a watershed this approach focuses on examining multiple contaminants together instead of individually to understand how distinct contaminants are transported and transformed together and how they interact with each other kaushal et al 2020 2018 although kaushal et al developed this approach for surface water quality especially with regard to the salinization of freshwaters we argue that such an approach is also valuable for studying stormwater quality since stormwater flows are an important input to urban surface waters 2 methods contaminants in stormwater reflect multiple simultaneous hydrologic and biogeochemical processes to resolve these overlapping processes this study followed a two step approach informed by expertise in biogeochemistry hydrology urban planning and data science fig 1 first we classified stormwater quality data into stormwater signatures using an ensemble of three machine learning cluster algorithms second we used multinomial logistic regression to understand how the climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics of watersheds are related to each of the identified stormwater signatures 2 1 data curation 2 1 1 stormwater quality we analyzed the national stormwater quality database nsqd a large scale dataset of stormwater quality samples from the united states nsqd 2015 specifically 1 881 stormwater samples taken in 182 watersheds in 26 metropolitan areas from 1992 to 2003 were selected for this study following a tradeoff analysis see section 2 3 1 pre processing nsqd records event mean concentrations of multiple contaminants measured in stormwater samples taken at outfalls usually pipes in urbanized watersheds drained mostly by curb and gutter systems typically multiple storms were sampled at the same location over time each storm event was most commonly sampled using a flow weighted composite sampling method in a flow weighted sample the total volume of the sample is proportional to the total volume of runoff in the storm event however neither the storm event water volume nor the sample volume measurements are available in nsqd composite sampling means that several subsamples were taken during the first three hours of the storm or the entire event if shorter maestre et al 2005 the sampling location land use and watershed area are also available for each storm event in the dataset 2 1 2 climate and weather data from the noaa climate data online cdo api were collected to represent the influence of climate and weather at each watershed in the nsqd dataset noaa 2020a all the variables used in our study are reported in table 1 the variables total annual precipitation and annual average temperature were used to describe local climate because they were the most widely available measurements these variables describe typical conditions for a given place based on recorded observations made from 1981 to 2010 noaa 2020b all storm events from the same watershed were encoded with the same values for the climate variables additionally weather variables for each storm event uniquely describe local conditions on the day of the storm event weather is represented by total daily precipitation daily average temperature and antecedent dry weather period for the day of each storm event 2 1 3 watershed delineation and characteristics in addition to climate and weather land use and imperviousness also influence stormwater quality brabec et al 2002 each nsqd storm event was paired with land use and imperviousness data for its corresponding watershed since watershed boundaries are not part of the nsqd 182 watersheds were delineated using pysheds bartos 2019 a python script that delineates based on elevation using the sampling location as the watershed outlet this method utilizes a snap to mask utility to snap a set of coordinates to the nearest cell that represents a drainage path or waterway the method resulted in a few discrepancies between reported sampling coordinates and the drainage flowpath to adjust watersheds that were underrepresented in total drainage area we delineated those watersheds using streamstats an online delineation service using the usgs national hydrography dataset plus ries iii et al 2009 all delineated watersheds were within 20 of the watershed area reported in nsqd watersheds were delineated by elevation and not based on the stormwater infrastructure network due to the lack of geospatial data availability across the 182 watersheds in the study watershed slope was calculated based on the usgs national elevation dataset the average percent imperviousness within each delineated watershed boundary was calculated based on the national land cover database nlcd 2001 which was the closest to our study period 1992 to 2003 we assume that no major land use or imperviousness changes occurred in watersheds during the study period this assumption is upheld because 1 the nlcd watersheds were already urbanized at the time of the 2001 observation and 2 nsqd sampling sites from 1992 to 2003 were intended to focus on urban or suburban stormwater quality most watersheds had very little to no water barren land forest shrubland herbaceous planted cultivated or wetland area these nlcd categories were dropped from the analysis percent tree cover was also dropped to limit multicollinearity among the variables because the variable was highly negatively correlated with percent imperviousness watershed land use was used based on the categories reported in nsqd residential industrial commercial freeway open space institutional and unknown for simplicity mixed uses were reclassified to observe only the dominant land use for example residential mixed became residential 2 2 study sites in total there were 182 watersheds across 26 us metropolitan areas resulting from the nsqd data curation process fig 2 the total number of storm events per metropolitan area illustrated by the size of the metropolitan area circle in fig 2 range from 4 storm events in boston to 206 events in the dallas fort worth metropolitan area these watersheds fell into two broad climate categories wet or dry fig 2 based on their annual total precipitation distribution the threshold between wet and dry was approximately 700mm annual precipitation a split that also corresponds to distinct k√∂ppen grieger k g climate regions which are shown to contextualize the climate data beck et al 2018 the study watersheds lie in k g dry climates bwh bsh bsk and csa and k g wet climates csb cfa and dfa a greater number of watersheds and storm events were located in the cfa climate region which is defined as a temperate climate with no dry season and hot summers overall 27 of all stormwater samples came from residential watersheds in the cfa climate region 16 from industrial watersheds in cfa and 12 from commercial watersheds in cfa all other climate region and land use combinations constitute 6 or less of the total stormwater samples 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pre processing the stormwater samples from individual events observed in nsqd did not measure all the same contaminants a trade off analysis was used to select a subset of data that optimized the number of metropolitan areas and the number of contaminants measured across all observations including more metropolitan areas in the analysis reduced the number of contaminants with data table a 1 out of a total of 5 817 nsqd storm events the selected subset included 1 998 stormwater samples from 26 metropolitan areas taken in 182 watersheds between 1992 and 2003 with observations of 9 co occurring contaminants the contaminants include total lead pb total zinc zn total copper cu total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds biological oxygen demand bod total phosphorus tp total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and nitrate and nitrite nox the data were standardized by log transforming and robust scaling the contaminant concentration values to reduce variance a total of 117 outliers were eliminated using density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan which is well suited for outlier detection in highly variant data leaving 1 881 stormwater samples for analysis while outliers were likely valid measurements our aim was to find signatures across a range of typical conditions rather than extremes that likely reflect idiosyncratic or edge case conditions the log robust scaled contaminant concentrations were checked for autocorrelation the highest correlation coefficient was 0 36 indicating each of the 9 contaminants contained distinct information 2 3 2 ensemble clustering an ensemble based machine learning clustering algorithm was applied to the preprocessed data to find stable and distinct stormwater signatures fig b 1 clustering algorithms are used to find how multivariate data points naturally group together clusters presumably reflect underlying mechanisms that cause samples to bear a stronger resemblance to each other than to samples in other clusters witten and frank 2005 the clusters identified here which we call stormwater signatures represent groups of stormwater samples with similar contaminant patterns the ensemble was composed of three machine learning algorithms hierarchical clustering k means clustering and k medoids clustering both k medoids and k means clustering algorithms group the data points into k number of clusters represented by a centroid point but they differ in that the k medoids method uses actual data points as centroids whereas k means does not hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters by initially considering each sample as its own cluster then proceeding iteratively to join the two most similar clusters together until there is one single cluster remaining ward s method was used as the agglomeration method in hierarchical clustering murtagh and legendre 2014 these three algorithms were chosen for analysis because the number of clusters can be pre determined to facilitate comparison to decide the number of clusters each algorithm was assigned 4 5 and 6 clusters the 5 cluster methods generated similar structures among the three algorithms ensuring the most stable clustering results when conducting each clustering algorithm separately we found that each generated very different signatures with the same pre defined number of signatures hierarchical clustering in particular differed greatly from k means and k medoids changing the random initial state also generated very different results to increase the robustness and stability of the signatures we designed and implemented a two step ensemble workflow first we ensembled the results of a set of random runs for each algorithm second we ensembled the results of all the three algorithms together in the first step an ensemble was created for each clustering algorithm independently fig b 1 to do so 100 runs were implemented for each clustering algorithm each time with a different random initial state for k means and k medoids clustering or a different subset of data for hierarchical clustering among these 100 runs the most representative run was chosen which was defined as the one sharing the most similar cluster structure with the most other runs for k means and k medoids clustering or the run with complete data for hierarchical clustering the average of the representative run and similar runs became the cluster structure for each algorithm this first step in the workflow yielded three different clustering results one for each algorithm the performance of clustering based on 100 runs versus a single run was evaluated using two metrics first the silhouette coefficient measured how distinct clusters are from each other silhouette coefficients with higher values indicate clusters are well distinguished from each other second the number of samples assigned to the same cluster across pairwise algorithms evaluated the agreement between algorithms a larger number of samples assigned to the same cluster across two algorithms indicates greater stability of clustering results in the second step the above results were combined to create a final ensemble by calculating the mean of the three center points defined by each algorithm for each cluster fig b 1 this mean center point for each cluster became the final ensemble cluster center each stormwater sample was categorized according to which cluster center point it was closest to in addition to silhouette coefficients we also measured the average within cluster standard deviation for each clustering approach if the average within cluster standard deviation is small the samples within each cluster are generally more aggregated and the clustering approach performed better to contextualize each signature s chemistry we compared the median concentration of five contaminants to aquatic toxicity thresholds from the us environmental protection agency u s epa 2021 only five of the nine contaminants had a specified toxicity threshold for metals we used the acute a and chronic c freshwater thresholds from the national recommended aquatic life criteria table pb 82 Œºg l a and 3 2 Œºg l c zn 120 Œºg l for both and cu 13 000 495 000 Œºg l a and 5 720 18 730 Œºg l c for nutrients we used the rivers and streams thresholds from the ecoregional nutrient criteria for tp 0 01 0 08 mg l and tn 0 12 2 18 mg l the selected nsqd data contained measurements for tkn and nox but not tn for each sample in the data we added together the tkn and nox concentration values to create an estimated tn value that could be compared with the ecoregional tn threshold for some contaminants the epa designates a specific threshold value by region the cu tp and tn values presented for context are the minimum and maximum ecoregional thresholds across all regions in the united states 2 3 3 multinomial logistic regression in this phase of the analysis we applied multinomial logistic regression mlr also called multi class logistic regression to understand how climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics drive each stormwater signature derived by the ensemble clustering method as a traditional regression technique mlr is used to predict a categorical dependent variable from multiple independent predictors by generalizing logistic regression from a discrete binary outcome to a discrete multiclass outcome in this study the dependent multiclass outcome variable is represented by one of 5 categorical stormwater signatures and the independent predictors are climate weather land use and imperviousness variables from the original 1 881 storm events used in the previous step 2 3 2 ensemble clustering a subset of 1 172 storm events was used after dropping storm events with incomplete noaa climate or weather data we focused on the quantification of marginal probabilities of each signature to investigate the relationships between each watershed characteristic variable and the stormwater signatures marginal probability is the unconditional probability that quantifies the probability for each stormwater signature with changes in each of the independent variables marginal refers to the fact that this probability is not relative to any baseline outcome in this case it is not relative to another signature the marginal probability of each signature category versus each independent variable was visualized for interpretation since percent imperviousness and land use were highly correlated we ran two separate mlr models to avoid multicollinearity problems each model included all the climate and weather variables daily precipitation daily average temperature annual precipitation annual average temperature and antecedent dry weather but with only percent imperviousness or only land use 3 results 3 1 stormwater signature chemistry the performance metrics showed that our two step ensemble approach outperformed k means k medoids and hierarchical clustering algorithms on their own by achieving a balance between cluster distinction and stability table 2 the two step ensemble approach resulted in a silhouette coefficient of 0 096 this value was close to the highest silhouette coefficient calculated across algorithms 0 110 which was generated by the ensemble of k means runs at the same time the two step ensemble approach resulted in an average within cluster standard deviation of 0 636 this value was close to the lowest value calculated across algorithms 0 633 which was generated by the ensemble of k medoids runs moreover the choice to first ensemble each algorithm using 100 runs instead of running the algorithm with a single run was supported by higher silhouette coefficients and greater agreement between algorithms compared to using only single runs ensembling 100 runs of each algorithm greatly increased the agreement between hierarchical clustering and the other two algorithms table 2 based on the 1 881 storm events the ensemble clustering method identified five stormwater signatures distinguished by different concentration levels for two or more of the nine contaminants analyzed fig 3 compares the composition of all signatures together by plotting each signature s median concentration for each of the nine contaminants in log robust scale median values are used instead of mean values since the latter are affected by outliers in highly skewed data fig 3 shows the range of concentrations for each contaminant in real units by signature with aquatic toxicity thresholds shown where applicable each signature s minimum maximum and median concentrations for all nine contaminants can be found in table c 1 signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic shown in red showed the highest median concentrations of all contaminants except for tss which was second highest by a negligible amount figs 3 and 4 this signature is the only one with a median zn value 232 Œºg l that exceeds both freshwater thresholds 85 of signature 1 storm events have zn at or above 120 Œºg l fig 4 it is one of two signatures that usually exceeds the highest tn threshold 2 18 mg l with 81 of storm events in exceedance and a median of 3 56 mg l signature 1 median tp concentrations 0 48 mg l were above the tp range of thresholds 0 01 0 08 mg l 98 of events exceeded the maximum threshold with high metal and nutrient concentrations signature 1 can be described as both ecotoxic and eutrophic 451 storm events were classified in the signature 1 cluster 24 of 1 881 events signature 2 reduced nitrates shown in purple has lower median concentrations for all contaminants than the population average figs 3 and 4 this signature shows a pattern of median concentrations that are proportionally similar to signature 1 but approximately 3x diluted except for nox which is 6x diluted fig 4 the nox median concentration is the lowest across all signatures despite low nox no sig 2 storm events had estimated tn values below the minimum tn threshold and 10 remained above the maximum threshold 2 18 mg l fig 4 despite lower tp concentrations relative to signature 1 90 of signature 2 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 0 08 mg l 228 storm events were classified as signature 2 12 of 1 881 events signature 3 potentially eutrophic shown in green shows a pattern of median concentrations distinct from signatures 1 and 2 figs 3 and 4 the signature 3 median values for tds and nox are similar to signature 1 yet the signature 3 median nutrient values are roughly the overall storm event average while metals and tss are below overall storm event average similar to signature 1 the estimated tn median concentration 2 33 mg l exceeds the highest threshold 2 18 mg l suggesting the possibility for stormwater driven eutrophication in any us ecoregion fig 4 97 of signature 3 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 0 08 mg l the maximum pb concentration for signature 3 57 Œºg l does not exceed the acute freshwater threshold 82 Œºg l unlike all other signatures 453 storm events were classified as signature 3 24 of 1 881 events signature 4 elevated particulates and metals shown in yellow had elevated median concentrations for pb and tss similar to signature 1 figs 3 and 4 other contaminants were approximately 2x diluted compared to signature 1 yet median zn and cu were still higher than the overall storm event average median zn 116 mg l falls slightly below the freshwater threshold 49 of signature 4 storm events exceed 120 mg l zn threshold fig 4 96 of signature 4 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 0 08 mg l likely particulate bound tp median concentrations for nutrients tp tkn nox and bod were close to the storm events average thus signature 4 is defined by elevated particulates and metals with roughly average concentrations of nutrients relative to other signatures 409 storm events were classified as signature 4 22 of 1 881 events signature 5 most dilute shown in blue has the lowest median concentrations in seven out of nine contaminants figs 3 and 4 this signature had a proportionally similar pattern to signature 3 at approximately 2x dilution nonetheless signature 5 still exceeds some thresholds and therefore may be ecotoxic and or eutrophic in some ecoregions fig 4 like other signatures median pb 5 Œºg l remained above the chronic freshwater threshold 3 2 Œºg l while median tp 0 1 mg l was above the highest ecoregional nutrient threshold 0 08 mg l and median tn 1 12 mg l was above the lowest ecoregional nutrient thresholds 0 12 mg l 67 of signature 5 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 340 storm events were classified as signature 5 18 of 1 881 events comparing each signature s median concentration with the aquatic toxicity thresholds for pb zn and cu showed some overarching trends regarding ecotoxicity fig 4 the median concentration of pb for all signatures ranging from 5 21 Œºg l fell below the acute threshold 82 Œºg l but above the chronic freshwater threshold 3 2 Œºg l the maximum pb concentrations ranging from 100 250 Œºg l exceeded the acute threshold for all but signature 3 57 Œºg l the zn median for all signatures ranging from 40 116 Œºg l fell below the freshwater thresholds 120 Œºg l except for signature 1 232 Œºg l maximum zn concentrations for all signatures ranging from 427 1 400 Œºg l exceed the freshwater threshold maximum cu concentrations for all signatures 60 163 Œºg l were well below the acute 13 000 495 000 Œºg l and chronic 5 720 18 730 Œºg l threshold ranges for nutrients median concentrations of all signatures exceeded tn and tp thresholds indicating most storm events generate runoff that could produce eutrophication in receiving waterbodies fig 4 the estimated tn median concentrations for all signatures 1 16 3 56 mg l were within or above the threshold range 0 12 2 18 mg l signatures 1 and 3 medians exceeded the highest threshold meaning they put receiving water bodies in any ecoregion at risk for eutrophic conditions while the other signatures would only cause eutrophication in more sensitive ecoregions across all the data 44 of storm events exceeded the tn maximum threshold 2 18 mg l and 100 of storm events exceeded the tn minimum threshold 0 12 mg l 91 of storm events have tp concentrations at or above the maximum threshold 0 08 mg l hence median tp values for all signatures were above the maximum threshold in other words the median tp concentration for all signatures is above the threshold for eutrophication in any ecoregion of the united states 3 2 stormwater signature drivers the mlr results illustrate how climate weather land use and imperviousness variables drive each stormwater signature for descriptive statistics of each variable see table d 1 the marginal probability plots show how the probability of each signature changes with different values of these variables fig 5 for example the marginal probability plot for percent imperviousness in fig 5 shows that in a watershed with 100 imperviousness the probability of obtaining signature 1 is about 40 while all the other signatures each have probabilities at 25 or less the plots also reveal tipping points where above or below a certain value the probability of signatures changes greatly or one signature becomes more probable than another one continuing the example of the percent imperviousness plot fig 5 35 imperviousness is a threshold whereby more impervious watersheds have a higher probability of signature 1 whereas less impervious watersheds have a higher probability of signature 3 the two mlr models yielded nearly identical results for simplicity we report the results from the percent imperviousness mlr model in this phase of analysis 1 172 storm events were used after dropping events from the original set of 1 881 events that had incomplete climate and weather data signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic the signature with the highest median concentrations of all 9 contaminants and the most classified storm events is the most probable signature under a variety of conditions fig 5 it is the most probable signature in climates drier than about 1 125 mm of annual precipitation and cooler than 17 c annual average temperature which includes most climates in the dataset it is also the most probable when percent imperviousness is greater than 35 and when daily average temperature is above 12 c in terms of land use signature 1 had the highest probability in commercial freeway and industrial land uses it is the most probable regardless of the length of the antecedent dry weather period the associations with higher imperviousness smaller storms and longer antecedent dry weather periods suggest that signature 1 reflects first flush phenomena since these associations allow for greater contaminant build up although signature 2 reduced nitrates is not very frequent in the data fig 5 it does show notable changes in probabilities for some variables signature 2 is much more probable in drier climates becoming the second most probable signature after signature 1 in climates drier than about 500 mm of annual precipitation its probability also rises dramatically with higher daily precipitation becoming the second most probable signature after signature 4 with more than about 45 mm of daily precipitation signature 2 rises in probability with shorter antecedent dry weather periods or cooler daily temperatures notably its probability is not greatly affected by changes in watershed imperviousness these associations suggest that signature 2 represents the wet season in drier climates and or on cooler days signature 3 potentially eutrophic is the most probable signature in warm climates with annual average temperatures above 17 c and in watersheds with percent imperviousness lower than 35 fig 5 it is also the most probable with cool daily average temperatures under 12 c it becomes the second most probable signature after signature 1 when daily precipitation is 15 mm or less or when antecedent dry weather is longer than about 5 days yet its probability starts to drop with antecedent dry weather longer than about 40 50 days presumably because this much build up of contaminants leads to signature 1 signature 3 has the highest probabilities in institutional and residential land uses at 56 and 27 respectively similar to signature 1 in its association with small rainfall events and longer antecedent dry weather signature 3 may also represent a first flush but from low imperviousness watersheds or on cooler days signature 4 elevated particulates and metals is the most probable signature when annual precipitation is above 1 125 mm the wettest of climates in the data and when daily precipitation is above 20 mm fig 5 its probability rises with short antecedent dry weather periods and with warmer daily average temperatures becoming the second most probable after signature 1 around 15 c and above its probability rises minimally only about 6 with increased percent imperviousness signature 4 is not the most probable in any land use category but it is the second most probable signature in commercial industrial and residential land uses these associations suggest signature 4 represents a large storm event signature particularly for wet climates on warm days characterized by elevated particulates and metals signature 4 is likely driven by mobilization of contaminants due to high rainfall depth and intensity possibly due to erosion as well as temperature since signature 5 most dilute is not very frequent in the data it is never the most probable signature fig 5 yet it does show some notable changes in probability under certain conditions signature 5 greatly increases in probability with higher annual precipitation wetter climates and higher annual average temperature warmer climates in fact 80 of the 176 storm events classified as signature 5 occurred in the warm wet k g cfa climate region no other signature showed such a high degree of regional specificity similar to signatures 2 reduced nitrates and 4 elevated particulates and metals signature 5 also increases in probability with higher daily precipitation and shorter antecedent dry weather periods its probability increases with cooler daily average temperatures signature 5 is the most likely signature in the open space land use with around 47 probability fig 5 land use mlr plot hence signature 5 primarily represents a large storm event signature for the k g cfa climate region in low imperviousness watersheds on cooler days 3 3 watershed typologies each stormwater signature showed unique associations with both place a unique combination of annual precipitation annual average temperature percent imperviousness and land use and weather daily temperature daily precipitation and antecedent dry weather period at the watershed scale most watersheds produced more than one signature reflecting the weather associations of each signature in this section we discuss how place and weather lead to stormwater signatures produced in distinct proportions by comparing different types of watersheds in a post hoc analysis we defined watershed typologies by place using the k g climate regions and marginal probability plots to facilitate grouping we grouped the k g climate regions into warm wet cfa warm dry bwh bsh and csa cold wet csb and dfa and cold dry bsk the marginal probability plot for percent imperviousness suggests that watersheds in the data fall into two broad types fig 5 low imperviousness watersheds 35 dominated by signature 3 and moderate to high imperviousness watersheds 35 dominated by signature 1 and to a lesser extent signature 4 hence the watershed typologies are combinations of climate groups and imperviousness for example low imperviousness watersheds in warm wet climates in this comparison the variables associated with place are held constant climate and imperviousness therefore the production of other signatures is likely related to their associations with weather or seasonality 3 3 1 warm wet climates in the warm wet climate represented by k g cfa climate region fig 2 moderate to high imperviousness watersheds produce the highest proportions of signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and signature 4 elevated particulates and metals as expected given the associations of these signatures with higher levels of imperviousness fig 6 in contrast low imperviousness watersheds produced comparatively more signature 3 potentially eutrophic and signature 5 most dilute 3 3 2 warm dry climates in the warm dry climates represented by the k g climate regions bwh bsh and csa fig 2 signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 2 reduced nitrates dominate the moderate to high imperviousness watersheds meanwhile signatures 1 and 3 potentially eutrophic dominate low imperviousness watersheds however the number of storm events in this comparison is not balanced since there are 188 samples in the moderate to high imperviousness category and only 16 in the low 3 3 3 cold wet climates in the cold wet climates represented by the k g climate regions csb and dfa fig 2 moving from low imperviousness watersheds to moderate to high imperviousness increases the proportions of signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 4 elevated particulates and metals and decreases the proportion of signature 3 potentially eutrophic as we saw in the results for the warm wet climates fig 6 in these cold climates however the proportions of signatures 2 reduced nitrates and 5 most dilute remain constant between imperviousness categories the number of storm events in this comparison is also not balanced since there are 159 storm events in the moderate to high imperviousness category and only 54 in the low 3 3 4 cold dry climates in the cold dry climate represented by the k g climate region bsk fig 2 both moderate to high and low imperviousness watersheds are overwhelmingly dominated by signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic fig 6 since both categories are similar this finding suggests that in cold dry climates the overall climate may be a stronger driver of stormwater quality than weather or watershed imperviousness however in this comparison there are only 15 storm events in the moderate to high imperviousness category and 18 in the low more samples in cold dry climates would be needed to validate this claim 4 discussion the five identified stormwater signatures each show multiple associations with climate weather land use and imperviousness factors underscoring not only the complexity in stormwater generation but also suggesting that different factors may lead to similar stormwater quality in predicting stormwater quality it is necessary to consider a wide set of factors climate weather land use and imperviousness as well as how these factors interact with one another while interactions were outside the scope of this study the results nonetheless point towards some underlying interactions and mechanisms driving stormwater quality 4 1 potential biogeochemical mechanisms and interactions 4 1 1 climate and weather dry climates had a higher frequency of a single or pair of signatures compared to wet climates fig 6 likely reflecting the long antecedent dry weather periods in dry climates ranging from 7 to 9 days on average compared to wet climates ranging from 3 to 6 days it is during periods of low flow that greater exchange between dissolved solids and underlying soils may occur resulting in overall greater retention of dissolved solids and metals within the watershed further long antecedent dry weather periods promote contaminant build up which increases contaminant concentrations in subsequent runoff conversely it is not surprising that the cleanest signature signature 5 most dilute occurred almost exclusively in the wet cfa climate region where frequent rainfall limits the extent of contaminant buildup warm temperatures increase the solubility of contaminants present in the urban environment which leads to higher probabilities of signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 4 elevated particulates and metals above 16 degrees c signature 1 s association with high imperviousness means there is little vegetation to attenuate daytime temperature flux or uv radiation both conditions likely contribute to accelerated breakdown of surfaces and an increase in contaminant loads increased dew point temperature before and after a storm event can accelerate thermal loading in stormwater runoff and therefore lead to a degradation of habitat for cold water or thermal sensitive aquatic species herb et al 2008 the marginal probability plot for daily precipitation fig 5 showed a strikingly clear pattern of two diverging trajectories where signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 3 potentially eutrophic rapidly decrease in probability while signatures 2 reduced nitrates 4 elevated particulates and metals and 5 most dilute rapidly increase with more daily precipitation for this reason signatures 1 and 3 likely reflect first flush contaminant transport while the other signatures likely reflect either a dilution effect in the case of 2 and 5 or erosion signature 4 larger storms discharge stormwater from more areas of the watershed including directly connected and disconnected impervious areas as well as pervious areas national research council 2009 sediment is ordinarily the most important stormwater contaminant in terms of mass and has significance in long term studies because metals are primarily associated with fine suspended particles particularly those less than 63 Œºm deletic and maksimovic 1998 baum et al 2021 observations of tss reveal a significant exponential relationship between event precipitation and associated particulate bound metals during low intensity rain events runoff velocity may be insufficient to mobilize particles and lead to stormwater volume that is dominated by dissolved solids tds as evident in signatures 1 and 3 as event precipitation increases surpassing a tipping point of 25 mm particulates and metals increase in volumetric proportion giving rise to signature 4 elevated particulates and metals signatures 2 and 5 are also associated with high daily precipitation but not elevated particulates and metals these signatures may represent storm events with lower rainfall intensity less soil erosion or low concentrations of road or highway density han et al 2006 compared to signature 4 4 1 2 land use and landscape management land use and imperviousness are common variables used in water quality research and many studies have identified relationships between contaminant concentrations land use and imperviousness chow et al 2013 maestre and pitt 2005 paule mercado et al 2016 shuster et al 2005 walsh et al 2005 generally studies show that watersheds with more imperviousness or commercial and industrial land uses are associated with overall higher contaminant concentrations our results align with these previous studies since we found high probabilities of signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 4 elevated particulates and metals in freeway commercial and industrial land uses which had the highest average percent imperviousness 61 55 and 59 respectively signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic which had the highest contaminant concentrations became the most probable signature at a tipping point of about 35 imperviousness fig 5 and even low imperviousness watersheds in warm wet climates produced some signature 1 fig 6 for reference 35 imperviousness would not be uncommon in neighborhoods with single family residential housing this result suggests that urbanization does not have to be very dense to have the possibility of producing high contaminant concentrations at least some of the time this implication echoes early studies in the pacific northwest that found even 10 imperviousness in a watershed affects stream channel stability booth 1991 booth and reinelt 1993 and a more recent study finding that imperviousness under 11 influence nutrient and sediment levels in streams schneid et al 2017 residential land uses showed a slightly higher probability of signature 3 potentially eutrophic compared to other signatures fig 5 this result may be due to the slightly lower than average percent imperviousness of residential watersheds in the data 37 which implies more managed vegetated area that contributes nutrients from fertilizers and organic matter institutional land use had a very high probability of signature 3 55 perhaps driven by the intensive landscape management practices common on institutional grounds which often involve irrigated high maintenance lawns and ornamental plantings not surprisingly the best stormwater quality came most often from open space land use which showed a 47 probability of signature 5 most dilute open space likely includes natural landscapes that are maintained using fewer chemical fertilizers or are largely unmanaged these conditions may result in landscapes that better retain or transform contaminants overall residential land uses had a more balanced probability across signatures compared to other land uses which often had a single highly probable signature fig 5 this result may reflect urban form diversity which has both hydrologic and contaminant source implications residential neighborhoods which cover the largest extent in area compared to other urban land uses theobald 2014 may be more diverse in urban form and age than other land uses liu et al 2013 2012 showed that using land use categories as lumped parameters in stormwater quality models obscures variability in contaminant concentrations within a land use the land use findings of this study further emphasize the limitation of broad land use categories particularly for residential areas 4 2 implications 4 2 1 watershed monitoring and management as stormwater monitoring efforts produce other large datasets the machine learning approach in this study could be used to find patterns in stormwater quality and their relationship to climate weather land use and imperviousness factors for example stormwater sensor networks measuring stormwater quality in real time have the potential to generate large datasets that would be well suited to machine learning in applying the stormwater signature approach watershed monitoring efforts could identify contaminants that co occur together find important tipping points that change stormwater quality and compare stormwater quality across watersheds prior studies argue that watershed research monitoring or management would benefit from considering multiple contaminants together kaushal et al 2020 2018 yang and toor 2018 4 2 2 green infrastructure the results show that stormwater quality changes categorically more frequently in wet climates than in dry climates suggesting greater variability in wet climates thus green infrastructure in wet climates may have to manage a more diverse set of stormwater signatures than in dry climates where only signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 2 reduced nitrates dominate managing more stormwater signatures may present challenges as the green infrastructure that targets particulates signature 4 may be quite different from that for nutrients signature 3 it has been found that some forms of gravity fed stormwater green infrastructure experience a marked decreased in removal efficiency of particle bound metals and other contaminants during high average peak flows maniquiz redillas kim 2016 additional research is necessary to identify which types of stormwater management structures are most suitable for reducing contaminants from specific land use types and or climates especially in dense urban areas with limited space 4 2 3 climate change the results suggest more degraded stormwater quality under current and future climate scenarios in agreement with climate change water quality modeling studies alamdari et al 2017 wijesiri et al 2020 warmer daily average temperatures above the 12 c tipping point and longer antecedent dry weather periods rapidly increase the probability of signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic which has the highest median concentrations large storm events rapidly increase the probability of signature 4 elevated particulates and metals since both high imperviousness and warm temperatures increase the probability of signature 1 it may become more difficult to avoid highly contaminated stormwater in dense urban areas under climate change cities should also pursue non structural policies that reduce stormwater contaminants at the source such as decreasing traffic a major source of metals regulating materials for example banning copper in brake pads encouraging better landscape management practices or more frequent street sweeping climate change can also be interpreted as a shift in k g classification for a given region these shifts are mapped by beck et al 2018 for example if the climate of northeastern watersheds shifts from the colder dfa climate region to the warmer cfa then the watershed typologies results for cfa see section 3 3 watershed typologies could serve as a high level picture of future stormwater quality for current dfa watersheds 4 2 4 public engagement stormwater signatures could be a good tool for communicating real time stormwater quality to policymakers and the public similar to the well known epa air quality index public education and community engagement have been a part of the phase ii stormwater permits in the us because of the general lack of public awareness about stormwater and its ecosystem impacts a high level stormwater quality index using signatures could simplify the chemistry for non scientists while maintaining adequate understanding about ecosystem and public health effects for regulators and researchers 4 3 future research study limitations as discussed earlier see section 4 1 potential mechanisms and interactions this study points towards the need for more research examining how climate weather land use and imperviousness factors interact to produce different kinds of stormwater quality a better understanding of interaction effects between contaminant sources climate and watershed characteristics is particularly needed in stormwater research yang and lusk 2018 for example a study of the interaction between percent imperviousness and daily average temperature could help answer questions about how much of a decrease in imperviousness is needed to lower the probability of highly concentrated stormwater under a warming climate additionally future research should investigate how particle size fractions scale with various metals and contaminants and whether these relationships are influenced by changes in thermal pollution of stormwater the land use findings of this study in particular suggest that future research in stormwater quality should explore in more detail its relationship to land use and urban development patterns together in other words urban form existing urban stormwater studies emphasize stormwater control measures and green stormwater infrastructure barbosa et al 2012 while largely ignoring the role of urban form yet analyzing urban form poses data challenges one limitation of this study is that nlcd has limited capacity to represent fine scale heterogeneity in areas where percent imperviousness is 10 and 70 smith et al 2010 we also did not quantify different kinds of impervious connectivity in watersheds sytsma et al 2020 focusing on the national scale this study highlights the lack of even data availability across space and time in the us along with the challenges of large scale data curation although the original nsqd data contained samples from as recently as 2015 in order to maximize the size of the dataset and the number of contaminants measured across all samples the selected nsqd data for this study dates from 1992 to 2003 this selected data may or may not be representative of stormwater quality today moreover there was more stormwater data from residential watersheds in the cfa climate region available in the selected nsqd data compared with any other land use and climate region hence the results may be slightly less accurate in dry climate regions the pre processing steps and non parametric methods of this study help smooth out bias from uneven sampling by preventing over fitting yet analyzing a more spatially balanced dataset would derive less biased stormwater signatures hence more monitoring efforts are needed to collect up to date stormwater quality data from different regions and land uses in the us to form a more balanced dataset for future study ideally these efforts should also include measurements of variables important to stormwater quality such as the total water volume of a storm event rainfall intensity or soil moisture that could produce more detailed and accurate results in future studies the climate weather land use and imperviousness variables we analyzed were high level variables that were available for all watersheds machine learning algorithms have much to contribute to stormwater quality studies because of their ability to find relationships between the high dimensional watershed characteristics and stormwater quality indicators in doing so such studies can also point towards new directions for studies of physical processes in this study we applied ensemble based unsupervised learning to cluster noisy stormwater quality data in future research applying novel deep learning algorithms for unsupervised learning e g by neighborhood discovery has potential to uncover the underlying complex grouping effects of multi dimensional data huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 one limitation of this study is that we did not test the predictive capacity of watershed characteristics for stormwater signature with machine learning because we relied on mlr s interpretation power future research could try supervised machine learning algorithms for stormwater quality prediction such as applying tree based algorithms al sulttani et al 2021 5 conclusion this study identifies 5 distinct water quality signatures common in us stormwater and investigated their relationships to climate weather land use and imperviousness all five signatures exceed at least one water quality toxicity or management threshold this indicates a chronic degradation effect wherein nearly every urban storm event creates runoff with aquatic conditions that undermine human health or aquatic life this study serves as a proof of concept for how machine learning can be used to investigate the biogeochemical pathways of urban stormwater as previous research has emphasized the highly variable nature of stormwater quality this study illustrates an ensemble clustering method that produces a concise result from high dimensional data by categorizing stormwater quality into clustered signatures furthermore watersheds produce stormwater signatures in different proportions depending on their geography climate and physical characteristics studying signatures helps to shed light on how localized weather land use and imperviousness factors influence categorical shifts in stormwater quality in the same region through physical and chemical mechanisms such as surface chemistry temperature and runoff intensity interpretable machine learning yielded results validated by empirical studies and points to new

16090,watersheds continue to be urbanized across different regions of the united states increasing the number of impaired waterbodies due to urban stormwater using machine learning techniques this study examined how stormwater quality and watershed characteristics are related at a national scale and compared stormwater quality across watersheds in diverse climates we analyzed a selection of data from the national stormwater quality database nsqd comprising 1 881 stormwater samples taken from 182 watersheds in 26 metropolitan areas in the united states between 1992 and 2003 using an ensemble clustering algorithm the stormwater quality in these samples was classified into stormwater signatures defined as distinct combinations of 9 contaminants including metals pb zn cu particulates tss tds and nutrients bod tp tkn nox next multinomial logistic regression was applied to the nsqd data now classified by signature and combined with climate weather land use and imperviousness data obtained from multiple sources the results yielded 5 stormwater signatures with distinct aquatic toxicity implications and relationships to climate weather land use and imperviousness signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic defined by high median concentrations of contaminants likely represents the first flush in moderate to high imperviousness watersheds signature 2 reduced nitrates represents a wet season signature particularly for dry climates signature 3 potentially eutrophic represents the first flush in low imperviousness watersheds signature 4 elevated particulates and metals represents a wet season signature particularly on warmer days finally signature 5 most dilute is primarily a regional signature associated with the warm wet climate of the southeastern us this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating how machine learning techniques can be used to identify patterns in high dimensional and highly variable data applied to stormwater quality these techniques identify major patterns in stormwater quality across the united states using a stormwater signature approach which examines how contaminants co occur and under what climate weather land use and impervious conditions the findings point to dominant processes driving stormwater generation and inform watershed monitoring green infrastructure planning stormwater quality under climate change and opportunities for public engagement graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater quality water quality machine learning climate weather imperviousness 1 introduction urban development degrades water quality in aquatic ecosystems by introducing contaminants from stormwater national research council 2009 stormwater currently impairs 79 000 kilometers of rivers 307 000 hectares of lakes and 43 000 square kilometers of bays and estuaries u s epa 2020 future urbanization trends present a concerning outlook for the nation s waterbodies the us population is projected to grow by 79 million people between 2017 and 2060 vespa et al 2020 expanding urbanization and continuing a historic pattern of rural land development alig et al 2004 brown et al 2005 white et al 2009 the projected scale of urbanization could amount to building a new city the size of phoenix every seven months fleming et al 2020 with this scale of projected growth it is reasonable to conclude that future watershed development will further jeopardize the aquatic health of the nation s waterbodies obtaining a more detailed spatially explicit understanding of how development impacts stormwater quality is challenging stormwater quality exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal variability due to the complexity of urban hydrology contaminant generation processes and precipitation patterns stormwater biogeochemistry is affected by materials present in and on urban surfaces anthropogenic activities and drainage systems as well as localized temperature humidity and photolytic conditions al ali et al 2018 liu et al 2013 m√ºller et al 2020 the contaminant masses that build up on urban surfaces depend on the rate of deposition antecedent dry weather period re suspension aggregation and re deposition processes goonetilleke and lampard 2019 these processes are influenced by watershed characteristics particularly imperviousness land use and land cover which have patch size and configuration effects within a watershed lee et al 2009 when a storm arrives rainfall characteristics such as rainfall depth intensity and duration pollution transport in stormwater egodawatta et al 2007 vaze and chiew 2003 meanwhile ambient temperature and sunlight influence the transformation of contaminants thus the climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics of watersheds drive the complex processes that produce stormwater quality in the past stormwater quality has typically been sampled at shorter time scales or small spatial scales which impedes discernment of generalizable patterns and produces results that are supported by low statistical power this study uses machine learning techniques to compare stormwater quality across a large dataset of 1 881 stormwater samples from 182 watersheds in the united states and explores the influence of climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics the data comes from the national stormwater quality database nsqd which has been analyzed in other recent studies moeini et al 2021 bell et al 2020 zivkovich and mays 2018 and granata et al 2017 this study is novel because it analyzes nsqd data using machine learning paired with climate weather land use and imperviousness data from other sources giving context to stormwater quality and watershed characteristics at a national scale it is also novel in its treatment of the high variability inherent to stormwater quality this study employs an ensemble clustering algorithm designed for highly variable data to classify stormwater quality into categories these categories are called stormwater signatures defined as distinct combinations of nine common contaminants in this study we ask the following research questions what are the major stormwater signatures across the united states how are stormwater signatures driven by the climate weather land use and imperviousness of watersheds what dominant biogeochemical processes might each stormwater signature represent how are stormwater signatures produced by different types of watersheds the stormwater signature approach in this study is similar to the kaushal et al 2020 2018 concept of chemical cocktails for understanding water quality in freshwater ecosystems chemical cocktails are described as anthropogenically driven combinations of chemicals that are influenced by the contaminant sources climate land use geology and atmospheric deposition in a watershed this approach focuses on examining multiple contaminants together instead of individually to understand how distinct contaminants are transported and transformed together and how they interact with each other kaushal et al 2020 2018 although kaushal et al developed this approach for surface water quality especially with regard to the salinization of freshwaters we argue that such an approach is also valuable for studying stormwater quality since stormwater flows are an important input to urban surface waters 2 methods contaminants in stormwater reflect multiple simultaneous hydrologic and biogeochemical processes to resolve these overlapping processes this study followed a two step approach informed by expertise in biogeochemistry hydrology urban planning and data science fig 1 first we classified stormwater quality data into stormwater signatures using an ensemble of three machine learning cluster algorithms second we used multinomial logistic regression to understand how the climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics of watersheds are related to each of the identified stormwater signatures 2 1 data curation 2 1 1 stormwater quality we analyzed the national stormwater quality database nsqd a large scale dataset of stormwater quality samples from the united states nsqd 2015 specifically 1 881 stormwater samples taken in 182 watersheds in 26 metropolitan areas from 1992 to 2003 were selected for this study following a tradeoff analysis see section 2 3 1 pre processing nsqd records event mean concentrations of multiple contaminants measured in stormwater samples taken at outfalls usually pipes in urbanized watersheds drained mostly by curb and gutter systems typically multiple storms were sampled at the same location over time each storm event was most commonly sampled using a flow weighted composite sampling method in a flow weighted sample the total volume of the sample is proportional to the total volume of runoff in the storm event however neither the storm event water volume nor the sample volume measurements are available in nsqd composite sampling means that several subsamples were taken during the first three hours of the storm or the entire event if shorter maestre et al 2005 the sampling location land use and watershed area are also available for each storm event in the dataset 2 1 2 climate and weather data from the noaa climate data online cdo api were collected to represent the influence of climate and weather at each watershed in the nsqd dataset noaa 2020a all the variables used in our study are reported in table 1 the variables total annual precipitation and annual average temperature were used to describe local climate because they were the most widely available measurements these variables describe typical conditions for a given place based on recorded observations made from 1981 to 2010 noaa 2020b all storm events from the same watershed were encoded with the same values for the climate variables additionally weather variables for each storm event uniquely describe local conditions on the day of the storm event weather is represented by total daily precipitation daily average temperature and antecedent dry weather period for the day of each storm event 2 1 3 watershed delineation and characteristics in addition to climate and weather land use and imperviousness also influence stormwater quality brabec et al 2002 each nsqd storm event was paired with land use and imperviousness data for its corresponding watershed since watershed boundaries are not part of the nsqd 182 watersheds were delineated using pysheds bartos 2019 a python script that delineates based on elevation using the sampling location as the watershed outlet this method utilizes a snap to mask utility to snap a set of coordinates to the nearest cell that represents a drainage path or waterway the method resulted in a few discrepancies between reported sampling coordinates and the drainage flowpath to adjust watersheds that were underrepresented in total drainage area we delineated those watersheds using streamstats an online delineation service using the usgs national hydrography dataset plus ries iii et al 2009 all delineated watersheds were within 20 of the watershed area reported in nsqd watersheds were delineated by elevation and not based on the stormwater infrastructure network due to the lack of geospatial data availability across the 182 watersheds in the study watershed slope was calculated based on the usgs national elevation dataset the average percent imperviousness within each delineated watershed boundary was calculated based on the national land cover database nlcd 2001 which was the closest to our study period 1992 to 2003 we assume that no major land use or imperviousness changes occurred in watersheds during the study period this assumption is upheld because 1 the nlcd watersheds were already urbanized at the time of the 2001 observation and 2 nsqd sampling sites from 1992 to 2003 were intended to focus on urban or suburban stormwater quality most watersheds had very little to no water barren land forest shrubland herbaceous planted cultivated or wetland area these nlcd categories were dropped from the analysis percent tree cover was also dropped to limit multicollinearity among the variables because the variable was highly negatively correlated with percent imperviousness watershed land use was used based on the categories reported in nsqd residential industrial commercial freeway open space institutional and unknown for simplicity mixed uses were reclassified to observe only the dominant land use for example residential mixed became residential 2 2 study sites in total there were 182 watersheds across 26 us metropolitan areas resulting from the nsqd data curation process fig 2 the total number of storm events per metropolitan area illustrated by the size of the metropolitan area circle in fig 2 range from 4 storm events in boston to 206 events in the dallas fort worth metropolitan area these watersheds fell into two broad climate categories wet or dry fig 2 based on their annual total precipitation distribution the threshold between wet and dry was approximately 700mm annual precipitation a split that also corresponds to distinct k√∂ppen grieger k g climate regions which are shown to contextualize the climate data beck et al 2018 the study watersheds lie in k g dry climates bwh bsh bsk and csa and k g wet climates csb cfa and dfa a greater number of watersheds and storm events were located in the cfa climate region which is defined as a temperate climate with no dry season and hot summers overall 27 of all stormwater samples came from residential watersheds in the cfa climate region 16 from industrial watersheds in cfa and 12 from commercial watersheds in cfa all other climate region and land use combinations constitute 6 or less of the total stormwater samples 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 pre processing the stormwater samples from individual events observed in nsqd did not measure all the same contaminants a trade off analysis was used to select a subset of data that optimized the number of metropolitan areas and the number of contaminants measured across all observations including more metropolitan areas in the analysis reduced the number of contaminants with data table a 1 out of a total of 5 817 nsqd storm events the selected subset included 1 998 stormwater samples from 26 metropolitan areas taken in 182 watersheds between 1992 and 2003 with observations of 9 co occurring contaminants the contaminants include total lead pb total zinc zn total copper cu total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds biological oxygen demand bod total phosphorus tp total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and nitrate and nitrite nox the data were standardized by log transforming and robust scaling the contaminant concentration values to reduce variance a total of 117 outliers were eliminated using density based spatial clustering of applications with noise dbscan which is well suited for outlier detection in highly variant data leaving 1 881 stormwater samples for analysis while outliers were likely valid measurements our aim was to find signatures across a range of typical conditions rather than extremes that likely reflect idiosyncratic or edge case conditions the log robust scaled contaminant concentrations were checked for autocorrelation the highest correlation coefficient was 0 36 indicating each of the 9 contaminants contained distinct information 2 3 2 ensemble clustering an ensemble based machine learning clustering algorithm was applied to the preprocessed data to find stable and distinct stormwater signatures fig b 1 clustering algorithms are used to find how multivariate data points naturally group together clusters presumably reflect underlying mechanisms that cause samples to bear a stronger resemblance to each other than to samples in other clusters witten and frank 2005 the clusters identified here which we call stormwater signatures represent groups of stormwater samples with similar contaminant patterns the ensemble was composed of three machine learning algorithms hierarchical clustering k means clustering and k medoids clustering both k medoids and k means clustering algorithms group the data points into k number of clusters represented by a centroid point but they differ in that the k medoids method uses actual data points as centroids whereas k means does not hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters by initially considering each sample as its own cluster then proceeding iteratively to join the two most similar clusters together until there is one single cluster remaining ward s method was used as the agglomeration method in hierarchical clustering murtagh and legendre 2014 these three algorithms were chosen for analysis because the number of clusters can be pre determined to facilitate comparison to decide the number of clusters each algorithm was assigned 4 5 and 6 clusters the 5 cluster methods generated similar structures among the three algorithms ensuring the most stable clustering results when conducting each clustering algorithm separately we found that each generated very different signatures with the same pre defined number of signatures hierarchical clustering in particular differed greatly from k means and k medoids changing the random initial state also generated very different results to increase the robustness and stability of the signatures we designed and implemented a two step ensemble workflow first we ensembled the results of a set of random runs for each algorithm second we ensembled the results of all the three algorithms together in the first step an ensemble was created for each clustering algorithm independently fig b 1 to do so 100 runs were implemented for each clustering algorithm each time with a different random initial state for k means and k medoids clustering or a different subset of data for hierarchical clustering among these 100 runs the most representative run was chosen which was defined as the one sharing the most similar cluster structure with the most other runs for k means and k medoids clustering or the run with complete data for hierarchical clustering the average of the representative run and similar runs became the cluster structure for each algorithm this first step in the workflow yielded three different clustering results one for each algorithm the performance of clustering based on 100 runs versus a single run was evaluated using two metrics first the silhouette coefficient measured how distinct clusters are from each other silhouette coefficients with higher values indicate clusters are well distinguished from each other second the number of samples assigned to the same cluster across pairwise algorithms evaluated the agreement between algorithms a larger number of samples assigned to the same cluster across two algorithms indicates greater stability of clustering results in the second step the above results were combined to create a final ensemble by calculating the mean of the three center points defined by each algorithm for each cluster fig b 1 this mean center point for each cluster became the final ensemble cluster center each stormwater sample was categorized according to which cluster center point it was closest to in addition to silhouette coefficients we also measured the average within cluster standard deviation for each clustering approach if the average within cluster standard deviation is small the samples within each cluster are generally more aggregated and the clustering approach performed better to contextualize each signature s chemistry we compared the median concentration of five contaminants to aquatic toxicity thresholds from the us environmental protection agency u s epa 2021 only five of the nine contaminants had a specified toxicity threshold for metals we used the acute a and chronic c freshwater thresholds from the national recommended aquatic life criteria table pb 82 Œºg l a and 3 2 Œºg l c zn 120 Œºg l for both and cu 13 000 495 000 Œºg l a and 5 720 18 730 Œºg l c for nutrients we used the rivers and streams thresholds from the ecoregional nutrient criteria for tp 0 01 0 08 mg l and tn 0 12 2 18 mg l the selected nsqd data contained measurements for tkn and nox but not tn for each sample in the data we added together the tkn and nox concentration values to create an estimated tn value that could be compared with the ecoregional tn threshold for some contaminants the epa designates a specific threshold value by region the cu tp and tn values presented for context are the minimum and maximum ecoregional thresholds across all regions in the united states 2 3 3 multinomial logistic regression in this phase of the analysis we applied multinomial logistic regression mlr also called multi class logistic regression to understand how climate weather land use and imperviousness characteristics drive each stormwater signature derived by the ensemble clustering method as a traditional regression technique mlr is used to predict a categorical dependent variable from multiple independent predictors by generalizing logistic regression from a discrete binary outcome to a discrete multiclass outcome in this study the dependent multiclass outcome variable is represented by one of 5 categorical stormwater signatures and the independent predictors are climate weather land use and imperviousness variables from the original 1 881 storm events used in the previous step 2 3 2 ensemble clustering a subset of 1 172 storm events was used after dropping storm events with incomplete noaa climate or weather data we focused on the quantification of marginal probabilities of each signature to investigate the relationships between each watershed characteristic variable and the stormwater signatures marginal probability is the unconditional probability that quantifies the probability for each stormwater signature with changes in each of the independent variables marginal refers to the fact that this probability is not relative to any baseline outcome in this case it is not relative to another signature the marginal probability of each signature category versus each independent variable was visualized for interpretation since percent imperviousness and land use were highly correlated we ran two separate mlr models to avoid multicollinearity problems each model included all the climate and weather variables daily precipitation daily average temperature annual precipitation annual average temperature and antecedent dry weather but with only percent imperviousness or only land use 3 results 3 1 stormwater signature chemistry the performance metrics showed that our two step ensemble approach outperformed k means k medoids and hierarchical clustering algorithms on their own by achieving a balance between cluster distinction and stability table 2 the two step ensemble approach resulted in a silhouette coefficient of 0 096 this value was close to the highest silhouette coefficient calculated across algorithms 0 110 which was generated by the ensemble of k means runs at the same time the two step ensemble approach resulted in an average within cluster standard deviation of 0 636 this value was close to the lowest value calculated across algorithms 0 633 which was generated by the ensemble of k medoids runs moreover the choice to first ensemble each algorithm using 100 runs instead of running the algorithm with a single run was supported by higher silhouette coefficients and greater agreement between algorithms compared to using only single runs ensembling 100 runs of each algorithm greatly increased the agreement between hierarchical clustering and the other two algorithms table 2 based on the 1 881 storm events the ensemble clustering method identified five stormwater signatures distinguished by different concentration levels for two or more of the nine contaminants analyzed fig 3 compares the composition of all signatures together by plotting each signature s median concentration for each of the nine contaminants in log robust scale median values are used instead of mean values since the latter are affected by outliers in highly skewed data fig 3 shows the range of concentrations for each contaminant in real units by signature with aquatic toxicity thresholds shown where applicable each signature s minimum maximum and median concentrations for all nine contaminants can be found in table c 1 signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic shown in red showed the highest median concentrations of all contaminants except for tss which was second highest by a negligible amount figs 3 and 4 this signature is the only one with a median zn value 232 Œºg l that exceeds both freshwater thresholds 85 of signature 1 storm events have zn at or above 120 Œºg l fig 4 it is one of two signatures that usually exceeds the highest tn threshold 2 18 mg l with 81 of storm events in exceedance and a median of 3 56 mg l signature 1 median tp concentrations 0 48 mg l were above the tp range of thresholds 0 01 0 08 mg l 98 of events exceeded the maximum threshold with high metal and nutrient concentrations signature 1 can be described as both ecotoxic and eutrophic 451 storm events were classified in the signature 1 cluster 24 of 1 881 events signature 2 reduced nitrates shown in purple has lower median concentrations for all contaminants than the population average figs 3 and 4 this signature shows a pattern of median concentrations that are proportionally similar to signature 1 but approximately 3x diluted except for nox which is 6x diluted fig 4 the nox median concentration is the lowest across all signatures despite low nox no sig 2 storm events had estimated tn values below the minimum tn threshold and 10 remained above the maximum threshold 2 18 mg l fig 4 despite lower tp concentrations relative to signature 1 90 of signature 2 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 0 08 mg l 228 storm events were classified as signature 2 12 of 1 881 events signature 3 potentially eutrophic shown in green shows a pattern of median concentrations distinct from signatures 1 and 2 figs 3 and 4 the signature 3 median values for tds and nox are similar to signature 1 yet the signature 3 median nutrient values are roughly the overall storm event average while metals and tss are below overall storm event average similar to signature 1 the estimated tn median concentration 2 33 mg l exceeds the highest threshold 2 18 mg l suggesting the possibility for stormwater driven eutrophication in any us ecoregion fig 4 97 of signature 3 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 0 08 mg l the maximum pb concentration for signature 3 57 Œºg l does not exceed the acute freshwater threshold 82 Œºg l unlike all other signatures 453 storm events were classified as signature 3 24 of 1 881 events signature 4 elevated particulates and metals shown in yellow had elevated median concentrations for pb and tss similar to signature 1 figs 3 and 4 other contaminants were approximately 2x diluted compared to signature 1 yet median zn and cu were still higher than the overall storm event average median zn 116 mg l falls slightly below the freshwater threshold 49 of signature 4 storm events exceed 120 mg l zn threshold fig 4 96 of signature 4 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 0 08 mg l likely particulate bound tp median concentrations for nutrients tp tkn nox and bod were close to the storm events average thus signature 4 is defined by elevated particulates and metals with roughly average concentrations of nutrients relative to other signatures 409 storm events were classified as signature 4 22 of 1 881 events signature 5 most dilute shown in blue has the lowest median concentrations in seven out of nine contaminants figs 3 and 4 this signature had a proportionally similar pattern to signature 3 at approximately 2x dilution nonetheless signature 5 still exceeds some thresholds and therefore may be ecotoxic and or eutrophic in some ecoregions fig 4 like other signatures median pb 5 Œºg l remained above the chronic freshwater threshold 3 2 Œºg l while median tp 0 1 mg l was above the highest ecoregional nutrient threshold 0 08 mg l and median tn 1 12 mg l was above the lowest ecoregional nutrient thresholds 0 12 mg l 67 of signature 5 events exceeded the maximum tp threshold 340 storm events were classified as signature 5 18 of 1 881 events comparing each signature s median concentration with the aquatic toxicity thresholds for pb zn and cu showed some overarching trends regarding ecotoxicity fig 4 the median concentration of pb for all signatures ranging from 5 21 Œºg l fell below the acute threshold 82 Œºg l but above the chronic freshwater threshold 3 2 Œºg l the maximum pb concentrations ranging from 100 250 Œºg l exceeded the acute threshold for all but signature 3 57 Œºg l the zn median for all signatures ranging from 40 116 Œºg l fell below the freshwater thresholds 120 Œºg l except for signature 1 232 Œºg l maximum zn concentrations for all signatures ranging from 427 1 400 Œºg l exceed the freshwater threshold maximum cu concentrations for all signatures 60 163 Œºg l were well below the acute 13 000 495 000 Œºg l and chronic 5 720 18 730 Œºg l threshold ranges for nutrients median concentrations of all signatures exceeded tn and tp thresholds indicating most storm events generate runoff that could produce eutrophication in receiving waterbodies fig 4 the estimated tn median concentrations for all signatures 1 16 3 56 mg l were within or above the threshold range 0 12 2 18 mg l signatures 1 and 3 medians exceeded the highest threshold meaning they put receiving water bodies in any ecoregion at risk for eutrophic conditions while the other signatures would only cause eutrophication in more sensitive ecoregions across all the data 44 of storm events exceeded the tn maximum threshold 2 18 mg l and 100 of storm events exceeded the tn minimum threshold 0 12 mg l 91 of storm events have tp concentrations at or above the maximum threshold 0 08 mg l hence median tp values for all signatures were above the maximum threshold in other words the median tp concentration for all signatures is above the threshold for eutrophication in any ecoregion of the united states 3 2 stormwater signature drivers the mlr results illustrate how climate weather land use and imperviousness variables drive each stormwater signature for descriptive statistics of each variable see table d 1 the marginal probability plots show how the probability of each signature changes with different values of these variables fig 5 for example the marginal probability plot for percent imperviousness in fig 5 shows that in a watershed with 100 imperviousness the probability of obtaining signature 1 is about 40 while all the other signatures each have probabilities at 25 or less the plots also reveal tipping points where above or below a certain value the probability of signatures changes greatly or one signature becomes more probable than another one continuing the example of the percent imperviousness plot fig 5 35 imperviousness is a threshold whereby more impervious watersheds have a higher probability of signature 1 whereas less impervious watersheds have a higher probability of signature 3 the two mlr models yielded nearly identical results for simplicity we report the results from the percent imperviousness mlr model in this phase of analysis 1 172 storm events were used after dropping events from the original set of 1 881 events that had incomplete climate and weather data signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic the signature with the highest median concentrations of all 9 contaminants and the most classified storm events is the most probable signature under a variety of conditions fig 5 it is the most probable signature in climates drier than about 1 125 mm of annual precipitation and cooler than 17 c annual average temperature which includes most climates in the dataset it is also the most probable when percent imperviousness is greater than 35 and when daily average temperature is above 12 c in terms of land use signature 1 had the highest probability in commercial freeway and industrial land uses it is the most probable regardless of the length of the antecedent dry weather period the associations with higher imperviousness smaller storms and longer antecedent dry weather periods suggest that signature 1 reflects first flush phenomena since these associations allow for greater contaminant build up although signature 2 reduced nitrates is not very frequent in the data fig 5 it does show notable changes in probabilities for some variables signature 2 is much more probable in drier climates becoming the second most probable signature after signature 1 in climates drier than about 500 mm of annual precipitation its probability also rises dramatically with higher daily precipitation becoming the second most probable signature after signature 4 with more than about 45 mm of daily precipitation signature 2 rises in probability with shorter antecedent dry weather periods or cooler daily temperatures notably its probability is not greatly affected by changes in watershed imperviousness these associations suggest that signature 2 represents the wet season in drier climates and or on cooler days signature 3 potentially eutrophic is the most probable signature in warm climates with annual average temperatures above 17 c and in watersheds with percent imperviousness lower than 35 fig 5 it is also the most probable with cool daily average temperatures under 12 c it becomes the second most probable signature after signature 1 when daily precipitation is 15 mm or less or when antecedent dry weather is longer than about 5 days yet its probability starts to drop with antecedent dry weather longer than about 40 50 days presumably because this much build up of contaminants leads to signature 1 signature 3 has the highest probabilities in institutional and residential land uses at 56 and 27 respectively similar to signature 1 in its association with small rainfall events and longer antecedent dry weather signature 3 may also represent a first flush but from low imperviousness watersheds or on cooler days signature 4 elevated particulates and metals is the most probable signature when annual precipitation is above 1 125 mm the wettest of climates in the data and when daily precipitation is above 20 mm fig 5 its probability rises with short antecedent dry weather periods and with warmer daily average temperatures becoming the second most probable after signature 1 around 15 c and above its probability rises minimally only about 6 with increased percent imperviousness signature 4 is not the most probable in any land use category but it is the second most probable signature in commercial industrial and residential land uses these associations suggest signature 4 represents a large storm event signature particularly for wet climates on warm days characterized by elevated particulates and metals signature 4 is likely driven by mobilization of contaminants due to high rainfall depth and intensity possibly due to erosion as well as temperature since signature 5 most dilute is not very frequent in the data it is never the most probable signature fig 5 yet it does show some notable changes in probability under certain conditions signature 5 greatly increases in probability with higher annual precipitation wetter climates and higher annual average temperature warmer climates in fact 80 of the 176 storm events classified as signature 5 occurred in the warm wet k g cfa climate region no other signature showed such a high degree of regional specificity similar to signatures 2 reduced nitrates and 4 elevated particulates and metals signature 5 also increases in probability with higher daily precipitation and shorter antecedent dry weather periods its probability increases with cooler daily average temperatures signature 5 is the most likely signature in the open space land use with around 47 probability fig 5 land use mlr plot hence signature 5 primarily represents a large storm event signature for the k g cfa climate region in low imperviousness watersheds on cooler days 3 3 watershed typologies each stormwater signature showed unique associations with both place a unique combination of annual precipitation annual average temperature percent imperviousness and land use and weather daily temperature daily precipitation and antecedent dry weather period at the watershed scale most watersheds produced more than one signature reflecting the weather associations of each signature in this section we discuss how place and weather lead to stormwater signatures produced in distinct proportions by comparing different types of watersheds in a post hoc analysis we defined watershed typologies by place using the k g climate regions and marginal probability plots to facilitate grouping we grouped the k g climate regions into warm wet cfa warm dry bwh bsh and csa cold wet csb and dfa and cold dry bsk the marginal probability plot for percent imperviousness suggests that watersheds in the data fall into two broad types fig 5 low imperviousness watersheds 35 dominated by signature 3 and moderate to high imperviousness watersheds 35 dominated by signature 1 and to a lesser extent signature 4 hence the watershed typologies are combinations of climate groups and imperviousness for example low imperviousness watersheds in warm wet climates in this comparison the variables associated with place are held constant climate and imperviousness therefore the production of other signatures is likely related to their associations with weather or seasonality 3 3 1 warm wet climates in the warm wet climate represented by k g cfa climate region fig 2 moderate to high imperviousness watersheds produce the highest proportions of signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and signature 4 elevated particulates and metals as expected given the associations of these signatures with higher levels of imperviousness fig 6 in contrast low imperviousness watersheds produced comparatively more signature 3 potentially eutrophic and signature 5 most dilute 3 3 2 warm dry climates in the warm dry climates represented by the k g climate regions bwh bsh and csa fig 2 signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 2 reduced nitrates dominate the moderate to high imperviousness watersheds meanwhile signatures 1 and 3 potentially eutrophic dominate low imperviousness watersheds however the number of storm events in this comparison is not balanced since there are 188 samples in the moderate to high imperviousness category and only 16 in the low 3 3 3 cold wet climates in the cold wet climates represented by the k g climate regions csb and dfa fig 2 moving from low imperviousness watersheds to moderate to high imperviousness increases the proportions of signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 4 elevated particulates and metals and decreases the proportion of signature 3 potentially eutrophic as we saw in the results for the warm wet climates fig 6 in these cold climates however the proportions of signatures 2 reduced nitrates and 5 most dilute remain constant between imperviousness categories the number of storm events in this comparison is also not balanced since there are 159 storm events in the moderate to high imperviousness category and only 54 in the low 3 3 4 cold dry climates in the cold dry climate represented by the k g climate region bsk fig 2 both moderate to high and low imperviousness watersheds are overwhelmingly dominated by signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic fig 6 since both categories are similar this finding suggests that in cold dry climates the overall climate may be a stronger driver of stormwater quality than weather or watershed imperviousness however in this comparison there are only 15 storm events in the moderate to high imperviousness category and 18 in the low more samples in cold dry climates would be needed to validate this claim 4 discussion the five identified stormwater signatures each show multiple associations with climate weather land use and imperviousness factors underscoring not only the complexity in stormwater generation but also suggesting that different factors may lead to similar stormwater quality in predicting stormwater quality it is necessary to consider a wide set of factors climate weather land use and imperviousness as well as how these factors interact with one another while interactions were outside the scope of this study the results nonetheless point towards some underlying interactions and mechanisms driving stormwater quality 4 1 potential biogeochemical mechanisms and interactions 4 1 1 climate and weather dry climates had a higher frequency of a single or pair of signatures compared to wet climates fig 6 likely reflecting the long antecedent dry weather periods in dry climates ranging from 7 to 9 days on average compared to wet climates ranging from 3 to 6 days it is during periods of low flow that greater exchange between dissolved solids and underlying soils may occur resulting in overall greater retention of dissolved solids and metals within the watershed further long antecedent dry weather periods promote contaminant build up which increases contaminant concentrations in subsequent runoff conversely it is not surprising that the cleanest signature signature 5 most dilute occurred almost exclusively in the wet cfa climate region where frequent rainfall limits the extent of contaminant buildup warm temperatures increase the solubility of contaminants present in the urban environment which leads to higher probabilities of signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 4 elevated particulates and metals above 16 degrees c signature 1 s association with high imperviousness means there is little vegetation to attenuate daytime temperature flux or uv radiation both conditions likely contribute to accelerated breakdown of surfaces and an increase in contaminant loads increased dew point temperature before and after a storm event can accelerate thermal loading in stormwater runoff and therefore lead to a degradation of habitat for cold water or thermal sensitive aquatic species herb et al 2008 the marginal probability plot for daily precipitation fig 5 showed a strikingly clear pattern of two diverging trajectories where signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 3 potentially eutrophic rapidly decrease in probability while signatures 2 reduced nitrates 4 elevated particulates and metals and 5 most dilute rapidly increase with more daily precipitation for this reason signatures 1 and 3 likely reflect first flush contaminant transport while the other signatures likely reflect either a dilution effect in the case of 2 and 5 or erosion signature 4 larger storms discharge stormwater from more areas of the watershed including directly connected and disconnected impervious areas as well as pervious areas national research council 2009 sediment is ordinarily the most important stormwater contaminant in terms of mass and has significance in long term studies because metals are primarily associated with fine suspended particles particularly those less than 63 Œºm deletic and maksimovic 1998 baum et al 2021 observations of tss reveal a significant exponential relationship between event precipitation and associated particulate bound metals during low intensity rain events runoff velocity may be insufficient to mobilize particles and lead to stormwater volume that is dominated by dissolved solids tds as evident in signatures 1 and 3 as event precipitation increases surpassing a tipping point of 25 mm particulates and metals increase in volumetric proportion giving rise to signature 4 elevated particulates and metals signatures 2 and 5 are also associated with high daily precipitation but not elevated particulates and metals these signatures may represent storm events with lower rainfall intensity less soil erosion or low concentrations of road or highway density han et al 2006 compared to signature 4 4 1 2 land use and landscape management land use and imperviousness are common variables used in water quality research and many studies have identified relationships between contaminant concentrations land use and imperviousness chow et al 2013 maestre and pitt 2005 paule mercado et al 2016 shuster et al 2005 walsh et al 2005 generally studies show that watersheds with more imperviousness or commercial and industrial land uses are associated with overall higher contaminant concentrations our results align with these previous studies since we found high probabilities of signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 4 elevated particulates and metals in freeway commercial and industrial land uses which had the highest average percent imperviousness 61 55 and 59 respectively signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic which had the highest contaminant concentrations became the most probable signature at a tipping point of about 35 imperviousness fig 5 and even low imperviousness watersheds in warm wet climates produced some signature 1 fig 6 for reference 35 imperviousness would not be uncommon in neighborhoods with single family residential housing this result suggests that urbanization does not have to be very dense to have the possibility of producing high contaminant concentrations at least some of the time this implication echoes early studies in the pacific northwest that found even 10 imperviousness in a watershed affects stream channel stability booth 1991 booth and reinelt 1993 and a more recent study finding that imperviousness under 11 influence nutrient and sediment levels in streams schneid et al 2017 residential land uses showed a slightly higher probability of signature 3 potentially eutrophic compared to other signatures fig 5 this result may be due to the slightly lower than average percent imperviousness of residential watersheds in the data 37 which implies more managed vegetated area that contributes nutrients from fertilizers and organic matter institutional land use had a very high probability of signature 3 55 perhaps driven by the intensive landscape management practices common on institutional grounds which often involve irrigated high maintenance lawns and ornamental plantings not surprisingly the best stormwater quality came most often from open space land use which showed a 47 probability of signature 5 most dilute open space likely includes natural landscapes that are maintained using fewer chemical fertilizers or are largely unmanaged these conditions may result in landscapes that better retain or transform contaminants overall residential land uses had a more balanced probability across signatures compared to other land uses which often had a single highly probable signature fig 5 this result may reflect urban form diversity which has both hydrologic and contaminant source implications residential neighborhoods which cover the largest extent in area compared to other urban land uses theobald 2014 may be more diverse in urban form and age than other land uses liu et al 2013 2012 showed that using land use categories as lumped parameters in stormwater quality models obscures variability in contaminant concentrations within a land use the land use findings of this study further emphasize the limitation of broad land use categories particularly for residential areas 4 2 implications 4 2 1 watershed monitoring and management as stormwater monitoring efforts produce other large datasets the machine learning approach in this study could be used to find patterns in stormwater quality and their relationship to climate weather land use and imperviousness factors for example stormwater sensor networks measuring stormwater quality in real time have the potential to generate large datasets that would be well suited to machine learning in applying the stormwater signature approach watershed monitoring efforts could identify contaminants that co occur together find important tipping points that change stormwater quality and compare stormwater quality across watersheds prior studies argue that watershed research monitoring or management would benefit from considering multiple contaminants together kaushal et al 2020 2018 yang and toor 2018 4 2 2 green infrastructure the results show that stormwater quality changes categorically more frequently in wet climates than in dry climates suggesting greater variability in wet climates thus green infrastructure in wet climates may have to manage a more diverse set of stormwater signatures than in dry climates where only signatures 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic and 2 reduced nitrates dominate managing more stormwater signatures may present challenges as the green infrastructure that targets particulates signature 4 may be quite different from that for nutrients signature 3 it has been found that some forms of gravity fed stormwater green infrastructure experience a marked decreased in removal efficiency of particle bound metals and other contaminants during high average peak flows maniquiz redillas kim 2016 additional research is necessary to identify which types of stormwater management structures are most suitable for reducing contaminants from specific land use types and or climates especially in dense urban areas with limited space 4 2 3 climate change the results suggest more degraded stormwater quality under current and future climate scenarios in agreement with climate change water quality modeling studies alamdari et al 2017 wijesiri et al 2020 warmer daily average temperatures above the 12 c tipping point and longer antecedent dry weather periods rapidly increase the probability of signature 1 ecotoxic and eutrophic which has the highest median concentrations large storm events rapidly increase the probability of signature 4 elevated particulates and metals since both high imperviousness and warm temperatures increase the probability of signature 1 it may become more difficult to avoid highly contaminated stormwater in dense urban areas under climate change cities should also pursue non structural policies that reduce stormwater contaminants at the source such as decreasing traffic a major source of metals regulating materials for example banning copper in brake pads encouraging better landscape management practices or more frequent street sweeping climate change can also be interpreted as a shift in k g classification for a given region these shifts are mapped by beck et al 2018 for example if the climate of northeastern watersheds shifts from the colder dfa climate region to the warmer cfa then the watershed typologies results for cfa see section 3 3 watershed typologies could serve as a high level picture of future stormwater quality for current dfa watersheds 4 2 4 public engagement stormwater signatures could be a good tool for communicating real time stormwater quality to policymakers and the public similar to the well known epa air quality index public education and community engagement have been a part of the phase ii stormwater permits in the us because of the general lack of public awareness about stormwater and its ecosystem impacts a high level stormwater quality index using signatures could simplify the chemistry for non scientists while maintaining adequate understanding about ecosystem and public health effects for regulators and researchers 4 3 future research study limitations as discussed earlier see section 4 1 potential mechanisms and interactions this study points towards the need for more research examining how climate weather land use and imperviousness factors interact to produce different kinds of stormwater quality a better understanding of interaction effects between contaminant sources climate and watershed characteristics is particularly needed in stormwater research yang and lusk 2018 for example a study of the interaction between percent imperviousness and daily average temperature could help answer questions about how much of a decrease in imperviousness is needed to lower the probability of highly concentrated stormwater under a warming climate additionally future research should investigate how particle size fractions scale with various metals and contaminants and whether these relationships are influenced by changes in thermal pollution of stormwater the land use findings of this study in particular suggest that future research in stormwater quality should explore in more detail its relationship to land use and urban development patterns together in other words urban form existing urban stormwater studies emphasize stormwater control measures and green stormwater infrastructure barbosa et al 2012 while largely ignoring the role of urban form yet analyzing urban form poses data challenges one limitation of this study is that nlcd has limited capacity to represent fine scale heterogeneity in areas where percent imperviousness is 10 and 70 smith et al 2010 we also did not quantify different kinds of impervious connectivity in watersheds sytsma et al 2020 focusing on the national scale this study highlights the lack of even data availability across space and time in the us along with the challenges of large scale data curation although the original nsqd data contained samples from as recently as 2015 in order to maximize the size of the dataset and the number of contaminants measured across all samples the selected nsqd data for this study dates from 1992 to 2003 this selected data may or may not be representative of stormwater quality today moreover there was more stormwater data from residential watersheds in the cfa climate region available in the selected nsqd data compared with any other land use and climate region hence the results may be slightly less accurate in dry climate regions the pre processing steps and non parametric methods of this study help smooth out bias from uneven sampling by preventing over fitting yet analyzing a more spatially balanced dataset would derive less biased stormwater signatures hence more monitoring efforts are needed to collect up to date stormwater quality data from different regions and land uses in the us to form a more balanced dataset for future study ideally these efforts should also include measurements of variables important to stormwater quality such as the total water volume of a storm event rainfall intensity or soil moisture that could produce more detailed and accurate results in future studies the climate weather land use and imperviousness variables we analyzed were high level variables that were available for all watersheds machine learning algorithms have much to contribute to stormwater quality studies because of their ability to find relationships between the high dimensional watershed characteristics and stormwater quality indicators in doing so such studies can also point towards new directions for studies of physical processes in this study we applied ensemble based unsupervised learning to cluster noisy stormwater quality data in future research applying novel deep learning algorithms for unsupervised learning e g by neighborhood discovery has potential to uncover the underlying complex grouping effects of multi dimensional data huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 one limitation of this study is that we did not test the predictive capacity of watershed characteristics for stormwater signature with machine learning because we relied on mlr s interpretation power future research could try supervised machine learning algorithms for stormwater quality prediction such as applying tree based algorithms al sulttani et al 2021 5 conclusion this study identifies 5 distinct water quality signatures common in us stormwater and investigated their relationships to climate weather land use and imperviousness all five signatures exceed at least one water quality toxicity or management threshold this indicates a chronic degradation effect wherein nearly every urban storm event creates runoff with aquatic conditions that undermine human health or aquatic life this study serves as a proof of concept for how machine learning can be used to investigate the biogeochemical pathways of urban stormwater as previous research has emphasized the highly variable nature of stormwater quality this study illustrates an ensemble clustering method that produces a concise result from high dimensional data by categorizing stormwater quality into clustered signatures furthermore watersheds produce stormwater signatures in different proportions depending on their geography climate and physical characteristics studying signatures helps to shed light on how localized weather land use and imperviousness factors influence categorical shifts in stormwater quality in the same region through physical and chemical mechanisms such as surface chemistry temperature and runoff intensity interpretable machine learning yielded results validated by empirical studies and points to new

engineering ocean university of china qingdao 266100 china corresponding author coupling microscale zero valent iron mzvi and autotrophic hydrogen bacteria ahb has gained increasing attention owing to its potential to improve dechlorination performance by bridging h2 donors and acceptors however few studies have attempted to test its sustainable remediation performance and to comprehensively unveil the governing mechanisms this study systematically compared the performances of different systems mzvi h2 ahb and mzvi ahb for trichloroethylene tce removal and further optimized dechlorination and h2 evolution of mzvi ahb synchronously by regulating the mzvi particle size and dosage to achieve a win win remediation solution the final removal efficiency and removal rate of tce by mzvi ahb were 1 67 fold and 5 30 fold of those by mzvi alone respectively and mzvi ahb resulted in more complete dechlorination than h2 ahb alone combining h2 evolution kinetics material characterization data and bacterial community analysis results the improved dechlorination performance of mzvi ahb was mainly due to the following mechanisms h2 generated by mzvi corrosion was efficiently utilized by ahb lasting corrosion of mzvi was facilitated by ahb and dechlorination functional bacteria were highly enriched by mzvi finally the remediation performance of mzvi ahb with different mzvi particle sizes and dosages was evaluated comprehensively in terms of dechlorination reactivity h2 utilization efficiency and chemical cost and suggestions for possible engineering applications are provided graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microscale zero valent iron autotrophic hydrogen bacteria coupled system trichloroethylene groundwater interaction mechanism 1 introduction chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs such as trichloroethylene tce and perchloroethylene pce which serve as organic solvents cleaning agent compounds for electronic components and important chemical raw materials have been widely used in modern industries wu et al 2020 however owing to improper treatment and disposal many cahs have entered the subsurface environment with a higher density than water cahs can easily penetrate the vadose zone and infiltrate aquifers to form contaminated plumes within groundwater flows shanbhogue et al 2017 wang and wu 2019 which can pose a serious threat to human health because most are known or suspected carcinogenic or mutagenic agents epa u s 2004 wu et al 2020 therefore seeking efficient groundwater remediation methods for cah contaminated sites has become a worldwide research focus in the evolving field of remediation traditional remediation approaches that focus only on removal results have been gradually replaced by sustainable management concepts that pay more attention to the overall net benefits of remediation braun et al 2019 holland 2011 therefore developing a sustainable remediation technology for cahs is urgently needed and this technology should have the advantages of high removal performance low possibility of producing unwanted by product production simple operation and low cost currently zero valent iron zvi based chemical treatment and autotrophic hydrogen bacteria ahb based reductive dehalogenation are the two most promising strategies for in situ remediation of cah contaminated groundwater however both methods have technical defects that make them unsustainable and hinder their long term large scale applications in the zvi system hydrogen is simultaneously generated from iron corrosion when zvi reacts with the target contaminants as a weak electron donor in the zvi system hydrogen cannot be efficiently utilized as a reducing agent and accumulates in porous media tang et al 2017 this will cause zvi material waste and accelerate material surface passivation and deactivation domga et al 2015 thereby resulting in porous clogging and enhanced remediation costs ahb based anaerobic bioremediation is often limited by the shortage of available electron donors and energy sources and requires injection of exogenous electron donors with high technical difficulties and investment needs thus the enrichment and lack of h2 are key bottleneck restrictions for the sustainable application of the above chemical and microbial remediation technologies respectively chung et al 2006 using h2 as the bridge species connecting the chemical and bacterial systems by coupling the zvi particles and ahb in the same system is expected to reduce the economic cost and alleviate the gas blockage problem thereby improving the contaminated groundwater remediation performance yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the h2 produced by anaerobic corrosion of zvi could be used by ahb as an electron donor and zvi could establish suitable anaerobic conditions for microorganism summer et al 2020 xie et al 2017 in addition zvi can reduce the toxic effect of cahs on bacteria and increase microbial diversity chen et al 2020 2012 in recent years several studies have been dedicated to the study of combining zvi and dechlorinating enrichment cultures to remove cah contaminants from groundwater kocur et al 2015 xu et al 2014 zhong et al 2017 however few studies have been conducted on the removal of cahs by a coupled zvi and ahb zvi ahb system for example wang and tseng 2009 explored the performance of zvi and digest sludge together with the supplementation of exogenous hydrogen but ignored the hydrogen production potential of zvi itself in other words the zvi induced ahb activation process has not yet been clearly elucidated combining the accumulation trend of hydrogen with changes in the bacterial community structure and the composition of iron corrosion products can further improve the understanding of the interaction mechanism between zvi and ahb zvi coupled with bacteria to remediate cah contaminated groundwater has been previously investigated but the remediation performance varied in different studies for instance wang and tseng 2009 found that the dechlorination rate of tce in the coupled system was 3 2 fold higher than that of the microscale zvi mzvi only system whereas honetschl√§gerov√° et al 2018 reported that the removal efficiency of tce by the coupled system was approximately 79 lower than that of the zvi only system owing to the toxic effects of nano zvi nzvi on the activity of microorganisms theoretically the remediation performance of a coupled system is affected by the interactions between the bacteria and zvi which largely depends on the characteristics of the injected zvi studies have shown that zvi dosages that are neither too high nor too low are conducive to the removal of cahs xu et al 2018a in addition by comparing the pce removal efficiency of nzvi and mzvi in the coupled zvi bacteria system it was found that nzvi inhibited but mzvi stimulated anaerobic bacterial pce dechlorination summer et al 2020 to date there is a large knowledge gap with respect to the performance of the coupled system under various conditions thereby making it very difficult to draw conclusions that may have strong implications for the accurate regulation of groundwater cahs removal therefore adjusting the injected zvi parameters to a suitable level so that both the abiotic and biotic dechlorination effects can be optimized simultaneously will be a challenging task in addition the regulation of groundwater cahs removal is not only to focus on the removal efficiency but also to balance the removal efficiency environmental impacts and remediation cost taking tce as a probe contaminant and mzvi which has relatively low biological toxicity and low agglomeration potential as tested zvi material tosco and sethi 2010 vecchia et al 2009 velimirovic et al 2015 this study systematically compared the performances of different systems mzvi h2 ahb and mzvi ahb for tce removal and optimized the sustainable remediation performance of mzvi ahb by regulating the mzvi particle size and dosage the objectives of this study were 1 to determine whether the mzvi ahb system can improve the tce dechlorination performance compared with that of an mzvi only or h2 ahb system 2 to identify the hydrogen evolution in this coupled system and 3 to optimize the sustainable remediation performance of mzvi ahb for tce contaminated groundwater with multiple evaluation indicators by adjusting the injected zvi parameters the results of this study help to deepen the understanding of mzvi ahb coupling mechanism and provide insights into sustainable remediation scheme design for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the mzvi used for the experiments was purchased from basf chemistry co ltd germany and yun fu nanotechnology co ltd shanghai china the iron particles were approximately 2 7 15 and 30 ¬µm in diameter with a smooth surface purity 99 their basic material properties are summarized in table s1 2 2 autotrophic hydrogen bacteria cultivation the activated sludge used in this study was obtained from an anaerobic tank of a domestic sewage treatment plant approximately 20 ml of activated sludge was incubated in 180 ml of growth medium containing the following nahco3 1 0 g l cacl2 2h2o 30 mg l kh2po4 175 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 165 mg l nh4cl 200 mg l and 1 ml l of a trace metal solution composed of zncl2 2h2o 52 mg l h3bo4 30 mg l nicl 6h2o 30 mg l mncl2 4h2o 100 mg l cocl2 6h2o 190 mg l cucl2 h2o 30 mg l andnamoo4 2h2o 36 mg l the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to approximately 7 0 0 2 using n 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine n 2 ethane sulfonic acid hepes buffer solution the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained at less than 0 5 mg o2 l and the temperature of the system was maintained at 37 2 the solution was purged with h2 to provide electron donors for ahb the initial tce concentration in the growth medium was set to 20 mg l after 7 d 30 ml of the resultant culture was transferred to 170 ml of the growth medium this cultivation process was repeated four times and the final culture whose autohydrogenotrophic dechlorination function was verified was then used in batch experiments 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 40 ml glass vials with a teflon lined cap to minimize tce volatilization into the headspace the total volume of the working solution was set to 36 ml a working solution containing simulated groundwater with 20 mg l of tce was freshly prepared for each batch test for comparison the performance of a control system without mzvi and ahb a system containing mzvi alone mzvi a system containing ahb alone with supplementation of exogenous hydrogen h2 ahb and a coupled mzvi ahb system were investigated to further explore the regulatory effects of different mzvi characteristics on the tce removal performance of an mzvi ahb system mzvi with particle sizes ranging from 2 to 30 ¬µm was applied at dosages ranging from 1 to 30 g l a description of the groupings in the batch experiments is presented in table 1 the preparation method for simulated groundwater was described in a previous study xin et al 2018 according to the national standard for groundwater quality in china gb t14848 2017 and bacterial nutrient requirements a specific formula for the simulated groundwater was designed as follows nh4cl 125 mg l k2hpo4 50 mg l mgcl2 75 mg l cacl2 50 mg l nahco3 500 mg l and 1 ml of the trace metal solution as described in section 2 2 the simulated groundwater was deoxygenated using an n2 stream to maintain a do concentration of less than 0 5 mg o2 l before tce addition the initial ph value was adjusted to approximately 7 0 0 2 by adding hepes buffer solution the glass vial filling process was conducted in an anaerobic glove box the discoloration reaction of methylthioninium chloride was used as an indicator of anaerobic condition in the glove box under which the oxygen content can be controlled less than 1 after that all glass vials were completely sealed through the reaction process and placed in a rotary incubator at 18 1 c and 120 rpm and all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate the degradation of tce and the evolution of hydrogen and hydrochemical indexes ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored by destructively sampling at intervals of 1 5 7 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 d the degradation products were measured at the end of the reaction day 60 to further confirm the utilization of hydrogen by ahb in the mzvi ahb system hydrogen accumulation in all the mzvi ahb treatments with different mzvi characteristics and their counterparts without ahb were compared because tce removal by mzvi and ahb is possibly attributed to both adsorption and reduction processes preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the tce concentrations in both the aqueous and solid phases the tce concentrations in the aqueous phase and solid phase were then determined through liquid liquid and liquid solid extractions respectively using n hexane as the solvent the adsorbed tce mass was determined by the difference between the total and aqueous tce masses the results indicated that the tce removal ascribed to adsorption was less than 5 therefore the removed tce mass in these experiments was considered to represent the reduced tce mass 2 4 analytical methods hydrogen production were estimated by quantifying the hydrogen entering both the gas and liquid phases as described by xin et al 2016 the amount of hydrogen in the gas phase was calculated according to the ideal gas law with the total pressure increase measured by a glass u tube manometer and h2 concentration detected by a gas chromatograph gc equipped with a thermal conductivity detector model sp 6890 shandong lu nan inc china the amount of hydrogen in the aqueous phase was calculated using henry s law the tce concentrations were analyzed by a gc agilent 6890a equipped with a mass spectrometer msd 5975 after a liquid liquid extraction procedure and the recovery rate was 94 5 briefly analyses were performed with the initial oven temperature of 40 c for 1 min followed by ramping up at 5 min to 45 c 8 min to 125 c and 25 min to a final temperature of 180 c where it was held for 1 min the injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 250 c respectively more detailed information on tce analysis has been described in our previous work xin et al 2015 the degradation by products of tce were detected using a shimadzu 2010 gc equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the details can be found in text s1 the ph and orp of the systems were measured using a ph or orp meter hq 11d portable ph orp meter hach inc usa do was measured using an oxygen meter jpbj 608 inesa china all samples were filtered through a 0 22 ¬µm syringe filter before analysis 2 5 characterization methods the mzvi particles collected at predetermined intervals 7 20 40 and 60 d in the experiment were freeze dried fd 1a 50 beijing bo yikang experimental instrument co ltd for 48 h and then stored in a vacuum desiccator for subsequent characterization field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s 4800 japan coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to view the morphology and determine the elemental composition raman spectra were collected using a raman spectrometer labram hr evolution horiba scientific france with an excitation light source at 532 nm laser power at 3 5 mw and a scanning range of 50 2000 cm 1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha thermo fisher scientific uk analysis was conducted with a monochromatic al kŒ± x ray source at 1486 6 ev the binding energies were calibrated using the adventitious hydrocarbon c1s peak at 284 6 ev using xps peak xin et al 2016 2 6 bacterial community analysis bacterial samples were collected at 7 d and 20 d corresponding to the fast tce removal period the samples to be tested were stored in a sterile centrifuge tube in a refrigerator at 80 bacterial genome dna extraction and gel electrophoresis were used to determine whether the sample met the requirements of high throughput sequencing machine testing the bacterial universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used for polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna illumina pyrosequencing was performed by major biotech co ltd shanghai china on the miseq pe300 platform illumina inc ca usa the community species composition of each sample was determined at the phylum and genus levels on the majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com and the steps used were similar to those used in previous research xu et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 tce removal kinetics and dechlorination products fig 1 a illustrates the tce removal kinetics over time in the mzvi only ahb h2 and mzvi ahb systems in the mzvi ahb system tce removal was rapid in the initial stage with a maximum tce removal efficiency of 75 at 20 d but plateaued after 20 d and achieved a final removal efficiency of 97 at 60 d both the h2 ahb system and the mzvi ahb system achieved a similar final tce removal efficiency of approximately 100 which showed that the zvi supported hydrogen supplement worked efficiently in the mzvi ahb system in the mzvi only system tce was removed at a slow rate with the removal efficiency reaching only 54 at 20 d and 59 at 60 d throughout the reaction the tce removal efficiency in the mzvi only system was lower than that in the mzvi ahb system as shown in table s2 the pseudo first order rate coefficient of tce removal obtained in the mzvi ahb system was estimated to be 0 069 d 1 which was higher than that in the mzvi only system 0 013 d 1 thereby indicating that the presence of bacteria improved the tce removal efficiency and removal rate in the mzvi ahb system therefore the synergistic effects of mzvi coupled with bacteria show great potential for removing tce the compositions of the degradation products measured at the end of the experiment are shown in table s3 cis dichloroethene cis dce was the most prevalent intermediate 5 47 ¬µmol in the h2 ahb system during the experiment the compositions of the products in the mzvi and mzvi ahb systems were similar to each other yet largely different from those in the h2 ahb system in the mzvi ahb system the removed tce was mainly converted into ethane 0 96 ¬µmol ethylene 1 30 ¬µmol 1 1 dce 0 14 ¬µmol and cis dce 0 19 ¬µmol table s3 although a high tce removal efficiency and removal rate were observed in the h2 ahb system incomplete dechlorination which enhanced the secondary pollution risk hampered its further application 3 2 hydrogen evolution kinetics the time series data for h2 accumulation in the mzvi only and mzvi ahb systems are summarized in fig 1 b in the mzvi only system the h2 accumulation increased rapidly within 32 d accounting for about 85 of the total h2 accumulation at the end of the experiment 60 d in the mzvi ahb system a different h2 increasing tendency was observed in contrast there was no clear accumulation of h2 within 32 d and the h2 content at 32 d was less than 10 of the cumulative amount throughout the experimental process after 32 d h2 gradually accumulated in the system the absence of h2 accumulation in the initial stage coincided with the significant tce removal which could be attributed to the fact that hydrogen acting as an electron donor stimulated the metabolic activity of ahb hwang et al 2019 thereby enhancing the tce removal efficiency of bacteria during late stage of the reaction the gradually increasing accumulation of hydrogen in the mzvi ahb system was attributed to the disappearance of tce in the system as an electron acceptor and the subsequent reduced consumption of hydrogen 3 3 formation and evolution of surface corrosion products in this study undisturbed mzvi was a dark gray powder however after 60 d of incubation in the simulated groundwater the solid mzvi powder changed into different color states in the mzvi only and mzvi ahb systems in the mzvi only system the solid mzvi powder became dark black whereas a dark brown powder was observed at the end of the reaction in the mzvi ahb system this phenomenon suggests that distinct corrosion mechanisms of mzvi are possibly involved in different systems which was further verified by surface passivation product characterization using sem raman spectroscopy and xps at specific time in the batch experiments sem eds was used to visually explore the influence of bacteria on the surface corrosion and reactivity of mzvi fig 2 in the mzvi only system there was a thin and even passive film on the iron surface which had a generally smooth spherical structure however the passive layers of the mzvi samples in the mzvi ahb system were rough and discontinuous which was similar to the layer like precipitates this loose structure undoubtedly increased the number of active sites on the surface of mzvi and enhanced its reactivity the eds data fig 2 c f provided further evidence of the enhanced mzvi corrosion process by bacteria in the mzvi ahb system with a lower relative weight percentage of iron 61 compared with that of the mzvi only system 81 at the end of the experiment 60 d the proposed higher corrosion degree of mzvi in the mzvi ahb system compared with that in the mzvi only system was also supported by the lower orp 350 304 mv and higher ph 7 9 8 1 in the mzvi ahb system compared with those 341 304 mv and 7 5 8 0 respectively in the mzvi only system fig 1 c d the enhanced mzvi corrosion in the presence of ahb was possibly associated with the following two mechanisms 1 with the existence of iron reducing bacterium in ahb the fe iii containing corrosion products on the surface of mzvi can be transformed and dissolved and the originally covered mzvi surface can be exposed to pollutants again and 2 according to the fig 1 c a trend of decreasing ph in the h2 ahb system was observed this reflected that the metabolism of ahb can cause the decrease of solution ph whereas the corrosion of mzvi will increase the solution ph on the contrary so the existence of ahb is believed to have a ph buffering effect in the mzvi ahb coupling system to enhance mzvi corrosion to gain insights into the evolving composition of the iron surface corrosion products in mzvi ahb systems raman spectroscopy and xps were conducted the typical raman bands of the different iron oxide and oxy hydroxide phases are listed in table s4 as shown in fig 3 the mzvi only and mzvi ahb systems exhibited a similar corrosion product evolution process but the raman signal of the materials reacted in the mzvi only system was weaker than that in the mzvi ahb system in the initial stage of the reaction 0 7 d the product composition was mainly Œ± fe2o3 215 280 and 1325 cm 1 and Œ≤ feooh 410 cm 1 which limited the electrons from passing through the zvi oxide shell yang et al 2019 at 20 d fe3o4 670 cm 1 a semiconductor with a low electrical resistance 10 3 œâ cm was observed which facilitated the electron transfer and promoted tce removal by mzvi as the reaction time increased most of the Œ± fe2o3 was converted into Œ± feooh 1003 cm 1 and feo 595 cm 1 correspondingly the xps results in fig 4 and table s5 provide further evidence to support the corrosion product evolution process in the mzvi ahb system the fe ii fe iii ratio in the corrosion products increased from 1 24 at 7 d to 1 62 at 60 d thereby indicating a corrosion product transformation process which corresponded with the morphological and raman spectroscopic changes in the reacted mzvi fig 2 3 and corroborated that ahb played a role in mineral evolution in addition the fe o fe oh ratio decreased from 1 06 at 7 d to 0 86 at 60 d which supported the increased occurrence of feooh together with the raman spectroscopic evidence and corresponded with the accumulation of a large amount of hydrogen in the later stage of the reaction in the mzvi ahb system an et al 2010 3 4 analysis of the bacterial community structure fig 5 a shows the alpha diversity indexes of the bacterial communities in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems the shannon index was used to evaluate community diversity and the chao index was used to assess community richness wang et al 2022 the chao and shannon indexes of the mzvi ahb system were higher than those of the h2 ahb system thereby indicating that the mzvi ahb system exhibited higher microbial richness and diversity to further explore the distributions of bacterial operational taxonomic units otus in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems the characteristics of venn diagrams were compared fig 5 b the total otu numbers were 317 and 837 respectively in the h2 ahb system and mzvi ahb system at 20 d and the mzvi ahb system contained 290 unique otus whereas the h2 ahb system had only 32 unique otus this indicated that the addition of mzvi enhanced the diversity and number of bacteria the community abundances at the phylum level in the h2 ahb system and mzvi ahb system at 7 d and 20 d are shown in fig 5 c in the h2 ahb system firmicutes and proteobacteria were the dominant species and the sum of their relative abundances was 96 and 94 at 7 d and 20 d respectively however in the mzvi ahb system the predominant phyla included firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria and chloroflexi and the sum of their relative abundances was 93 6 and 93 7 at 7 d and 20 d respectively firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi are strict anaerobes and are reported to be capable of degrading organic matter including cahs hug et al 2012 kocur et al 2016 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 chloroflexi which has been confirmed to contain dehalococcoidia that can dechlorinate tce to ethene kocur et al 2016 wu et al 2020 merely existed in the mzvi ahb system accounting for 14 and 4 of the bacterial community at 7 d and 20 d respectively therefore the relative abundance of the species that can remove cahs was stimulated by mzvi in the mzvi ahb system the distributions of the microbial populations at the genus level in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems are shown in fig 5 d in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems acetobacterium was found to be highly enriched and was the most dominant genus 73 and 30 at 7 d and 25 and 24 at 20 d respectively acetobacterium can convert other substances into acetate which can be subsequently utilized by dechlorinating bacteria hug et al 2012 and can produce acids that buffer the increased ph value due to mzvi corrosion in addition various anaerobes with the ability to dechlorinate cahs were detected in the mzvi ahb system but were almost absent in the h2 ahb system such as pseudomonas and hydrogenophaga which can remove cahs by co metabolism bowman et al 2009 and desulfomicrobium and dechlorosoma which can degrade tce into ethylene dugat bony et al 2012 shi et al 2021 these results indicate that mzvi can promote the enrichment of bacteria with dechlorination functions 3 5 effects of mzvi particle sizes and dosages on the remediation performance of the mzvi ahb system the tce removal kinetics in the mzvi ahb systems with different mzvi particle sizes and dosages are presented in fig 6 when the applied mzvi had a smaller particle size 2 and 7 ¬µm the dosage of mzvi had little effect on the removal of tce in the mzvi ahb system the removal efficiency stabilized within a narrow range of 97 100 and the highest removal efficiency 100 and the fastest removal rate 0 100 d 1 were achieved with mzvi of 2 ¬µm and 1 g l in contrast for mzvi with larger particle sizes of 15 ¬µm and 30 ¬µm the removal efficiency of tce in the different treatments followed the order of 10 g l 30 g l 5 g l 1 g l and the highest removal efficiency 98 and fastest removal rate 0 102 d 1 were obtained at 30 ¬µm and 30 g l this suggested that when the mzvi particle size was small the removal efficiency was rarely affected regardless of the dosage increasing the dosage of mzvi was more conducive to the removal of cahs with large mzvi particles to clarify the activation process of mzvi on bacteria this study further investigated the evolutionary trends of h2 in the mzvi ahb system of different treatments as shown in fig 7 the overall h2 content in the coupled system slowly increased and the trend of the cumulative amount of h2 in the mzvi ahb system at the same mzvi dosage was 2 ¬µm 7 ¬µm 15 ¬µm 30 ¬µm this is contrary to the accumulation trend of h2 in the mzvi only system fig s1 the observed rules were possibly attributed to the fact that finer mzvi tends to have a more toxic effect on bacteria velimirovic et al 2015 and mzvi with a larger particle size provides a more favorable living environment for bacteria from another perspective h2 accumulation is highlighted because it reflects the gas clogging potential when the particle size of mzvi was 2 ¬µm and 7 ¬µm the h2 accumulation trend of mzvi was 30 g l 10 g l 5 g l 1 g l in the mzvi ahb system when the particle size of mzvi was 15 and 30 ¬µm the h2 accumulation in the mzvi ahb system was rarely affected by the mzvi dosage but the h2 accumulation were lower than that in the mzvi only system combining the effects of different zvi characteristics on both tce removal kinetics and h2 accumulation kinetics it was suggested that 1 for mzvi with a smaller particle size 2 and 7 ¬µm a lower dosage which would not significantly decrease the removal efficiency but would greatly avoid h2 accumulation is recommended and 2 for mzvi with a larger particle size 15 and 30 ¬µm the scheme designer should strive to balance the removal performance and clogging risk with a suitable dosage that would promote the removal efficiency and simultaneously accelerate h2 production 3 6 mzvi ahb interaction mechanism and engineering implications the results obtained in this study showed that the mzvi ahb system exhibited higher mzvi reactivity than mzvi alone and more complete dechlorination than h2 ahb alone as shown in graphical abstract figure a the promoting effect of coupling mzvi and ahb was mainly associated with the following mechanisms the produced h2 from mzvi corrosion with water can be effectively utilized by ahb mzvi corrosion was promoted by ahb to support a lasting reduction capacity and dechlorination bacteria were stimulated and enriched in the presence of mzvi because of the synchronization of abiotic and biotic dechlorination processes in the mzvi ahb system the electron efficiency of the mzvi was greatly enhanced compared with that when utilizing mzvi alone and the generation of unwanted by products was significantly avoided compared with that of h2 ahb these findings may lead to the development of a sustainable decontamination technology for groundwater cah pollution that is likely to be more cost effective and less environmentally disruptive to optimize zvi ahb technologies for real applications by adjusting the particle sizes and dosages of mzvi multiple criteria should be considered we took this study as an example to address an insight into the sustainable remediation the tce removal efficiency and h2 accumulation of the different treatments under the experimental conditions of this study are summarized in graphical abstract figure b when the removal efficiency is the priority for technical comparison the use of 1 g l of 7 ¬µm mzvi is the best solution to remove tce which can result in a tce removal efficiency of 99 within 60 d in the mzvi ahb system however the negative side of 7 ¬µm mzvi utilization lies in the excessive accumulation of hydrogen in the coupled system and subsequent gas blockage problems owing to its high reactivity and low reduction selectivity in real field applications the cost of material investment and long term remediation performance are other key considerations taking tce removal efficiency h2 accumulation potential and material cost as multiple selection criteria using 10 g l of 30 ¬µm mzvi is the best solution to remove tce under such conditions the removal efficiency of tce within 25 d can reach 82 and tce will be completely degraded within 60 d in addition there is no clear hydrogen accumulation in the mzvi ahb system under this condition which is attributed to the slow hydrogen release of 30 ¬µm mzvi providing favorable conditions for maximizing microbial activity last but not the least important the material cost of 30 ¬µm mzvi is much lower than that of its smaller counterparts for example 2 ¬µm mzvi costs approximately 2 10 times as much as 30 ¬µm zvi although the optimal dosage and size of mzvi we obtained is only relevant to the specific experimental conditions these results demonstrate that before any field treatment extensive laboratory experiments must be conducted to test different injection parameters and optimize the remediation performance most suited to their site specific conditions in addition more evaluation indicators that were not included in our study should be considered such as electron selectivity in the presence of natural co existing electron acceptors e g no3 and so4 2 and the mobility dependent working radius furthermore establishing multi criteria decision analysis methods that can comprehensively rank remediation alternatives is of vital importance for selecting appropriate remediation strategies 4 conclusions the results of this study revealed that coupling mzvi and ahb was significantly superior to mzvi and h2 ahb alone in terms of tce removal efficiency and complete dechlorination respectively in the mzvi ahb system there was a lag period of h2 accumulation coinciding with the significant tce removal which verified that the h2 generated by mzvi was efficiently utilized by ahb within the system based on sem raman spectroscopy and xps data coupled mzvi ahb provided a clearer corrosion product evolution process from Œ± fe2o3 and Œ≤ feooh to fe3o4 within the first 20 d which favored electron transfer and further led to the evolution of Œ± feooh and feo until the end of this reaction which facilitated continuous h2 production meanwhile more functional dechlorination microorganisms were enriched in the presence of mzvi compared with supplying h2 directly in h2 ahb the remediation performance of mzvi ahb varied with different mzvi particle sizes and dosages for mzvi with a smaller particle size 2 and 7 ¬µm a lower dosage which would guarantee a high removal efficiency and avoid h2 accumulation is recommended for mzvi with a larger particle size 15 and 30 ¬µm the scheme designer should strive to balance the removal performance and clogging risk with a suitable dosage that promotes the removal efficiency and simultaneously accelerates h2 production therefore the sustainable applicability of mzvi ahb with mzvi of different properties should be objectively evaluated by comprehensively considering the removal efficiency gas clogging potential and

china key lab of marine environmental science and ecology ministry of education shandong provincial key laboratory of marine environment and geological engineering college of environmental science and engineering ocean university of china qingdao 266100 china corresponding author coupling microscale zero valent iron mzvi and autotrophic hydrogen bacteria ahb has gained increasing attention owing to its potential to improve dechlorination performance by bridging h2 donors and acceptors however few studies have attempted to test its sustainable remediation performance and to comprehensively unveil the governing mechanisms this study systematically compared the performances of different systems mzvi h2 ahb and mzvi ahb for trichloroethylene tce removal and further optimized dechlorination and h2 evolution of mzvi ahb synchronously by regulating the mzvi particle size and dosage to achieve a win win remediation solution the final removal efficiency and removal rate of tce by mzvi ahb were 1 67 fold and 5 30 fold of those by mzvi alone respectively and mzvi ahb resulted in more complete dechlorination than h2 ahb alone combining h2 evolution kinetics material characterization data and bacterial community analysis results the improved dechlorination performance of mzvi ahb was mainly due to the following mechanisms h2 generated by mzvi corrosion was efficiently utilized by ahb lasting corrosion of mzvi was facilitated by ahb and dechlorination functional bacteria were highly enriched by mzvi finally the remediation performance of mzvi ahb with different mzvi particle sizes and dosages was evaluated comprehensively in terms of dechlorination reactivity h2 utilization efficiency and chemical cost and suggestions for possible engineering applications are provided graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microscale zero valent iron autotrophic hydrogen bacteria coupled system trichloroethylene groundwater interaction mechanism 1 introduction chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons cahs such as trichloroethylene tce and perchloroethylene pce which serve as organic solvents cleaning agent compounds for electronic components and important chemical raw materials have been widely used in modern industries wu et al 2020 however owing to improper treatment and disposal many cahs have entered the subsurface environment with a higher density than water cahs can easily penetrate the vadose zone and infiltrate aquifers to form contaminated plumes within groundwater flows shanbhogue et al 2017 wang and wu 2019 which can pose a serious threat to human health because most are known or suspected carcinogenic or mutagenic agents epa u s 2004 wu et al 2020 therefore seeking efficient groundwater remediation methods for cah contaminated sites has become a worldwide research focus in the evolving field of remediation traditional remediation approaches that focus only on removal results have been gradually replaced by sustainable management concepts that pay more attention to the overall net benefits of remediation braun et al 2019 holland 2011 therefore developing a sustainable remediation technology for cahs is urgently needed and this technology should have the advantages of high removal performance low possibility of producing unwanted by product production simple operation and low cost currently zero valent iron zvi based chemical treatment and autotrophic hydrogen bacteria ahb based reductive dehalogenation are the two most promising strategies for in situ remediation of cah contaminated groundwater however both methods have technical defects that make them unsustainable and hinder their long term large scale applications in the zvi system hydrogen is simultaneously generated from iron corrosion when zvi reacts with the target contaminants as a weak electron donor in the zvi system hydrogen cannot be efficiently utilized as a reducing agent and accumulates in porous media tang et al 2017 this will cause zvi material waste and accelerate material surface passivation and deactivation domga et al 2015 thereby resulting in porous clogging and enhanced remediation costs ahb based anaerobic bioremediation is often limited by the shortage of available electron donors and energy sources and requires injection of exogenous electron donors with high technical difficulties and investment needs thus the enrichment and lack of h2 are key bottleneck restrictions for the sustainable application of the above chemical and microbial remediation technologies respectively chung et al 2006 using h2 as the bridge species connecting the chemical and bacterial systems by coupling the zvi particles and ahb in the same system is expected to reduce the economic cost and alleviate the gas blockage problem thereby improving the contaminated groundwater remediation performance yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 the h2 produced by anaerobic corrosion of zvi could be used by ahb as an electron donor and zvi could establish suitable anaerobic conditions for microorganism summer et al 2020 xie et al 2017 in addition zvi can reduce the toxic effect of cahs on bacteria and increase microbial diversity chen et al 2020 2012 in recent years several studies have been dedicated to the study of combining zvi and dechlorinating enrichment cultures to remove cah contaminants from groundwater kocur et al 2015 xu et al 2014 zhong et al 2017 however few studies have been conducted on the removal of cahs by a coupled zvi and ahb zvi ahb system for example wang and tseng 2009 explored the performance of zvi and digest sludge together with the supplementation of exogenous hydrogen but ignored the hydrogen production potential of zvi itself in other words the zvi induced ahb activation process has not yet been clearly elucidated combining the accumulation trend of hydrogen with changes in the bacterial community structure and the composition of iron corrosion products can further improve the understanding of the interaction mechanism between zvi and ahb zvi coupled with bacteria to remediate cah contaminated groundwater has been previously investigated but the remediation performance varied in different studies for instance wang and tseng 2009 found that the dechlorination rate of tce in the coupled system was 3 2 fold higher than that of the microscale zvi mzvi only system whereas honetschl√§gerov√° et al 2018 reported that the removal efficiency of tce by the coupled system was approximately 79 lower than that of the zvi only system owing to the toxic effects of nano zvi nzvi on the activity of microorganisms theoretically the remediation performance of a coupled system is affected by the interactions between the bacteria and zvi which largely depends on the characteristics of the injected zvi studies have shown that zvi dosages that are neither too high nor too low are conducive to the removal of cahs xu et al 2018a in addition by comparing the pce removal efficiency of nzvi and mzvi in the coupled zvi bacteria system it was found that nzvi inhibited but mzvi stimulated anaerobic bacterial pce dechlorination summer et al 2020 to date there is a large knowledge gap with respect to the performance of the coupled system under various conditions thereby making it very difficult to draw conclusions that may have strong implications for the accurate regulation of groundwater cahs removal therefore adjusting the injected zvi parameters to a suitable level so that both the abiotic and biotic dechlorination effects can be optimized simultaneously will be a challenging task in addition the regulation of groundwater cahs removal is not only to focus on the removal efficiency but also to balance the removal efficiency environmental impacts and remediation cost taking tce as a probe contaminant and mzvi which has relatively low biological toxicity and low agglomeration potential as tested zvi material tosco and sethi 2010 vecchia et al 2009 velimirovic et al 2015 this study systematically compared the performances of different systems mzvi h2 ahb and mzvi ahb for tce removal and optimized the sustainable remediation performance of mzvi ahb by regulating the mzvi particle size and dosage the objectives of this study were 1 to determine whether the mzvi ahb system can improve the tce dechlorination performance compared with that of an mzvi only or h2 ahb system 2 to identify the hydrogen evolution in this coupled system and 3 to optimize the sustainable remediation performance of mzvi ahb for tce contaminated groundwater with multiple evaluation indicators by adjusting the injected zvi parameters the results of this study help to deepen the understanding of mzvi ahb coupling mechanism and provide insights into sustainable remediation scheme design for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the mzvi used for the experiments was purchased from basf chemistry co ltd germany and yun fu nanotechnology co ltd shanghai china the iron particles were approximately 2 7 15 and 30 ¬µm in diameter with a smooth surface purity 99 their basic material properties are summarized in table s1 2 2 autotrophic hydrogen bacteria cultivation the activated sludge used in this study was obtained from an anaerobic tank of a domestic sewage treatment plant approximately 20 ml of activated sludge was incubated in 180 ml of growth medium containing the following nahco3 1 0 g l cacl2 2h2o 30 mg l kh2po4 175 mg l mgcl2 6h2o 165 mg l nh4cl 200 mg l and 1 ml l of a trace metal solution composed of zncl2 2h2o 52 mg l h3bo4 30 mg l nicl 6h2o 30 mg l mncl2 4h2o 100 mg l cocl2 6h2o 190 mg l cucl2 h2o 30 mg l andnamoo4 2h2o 36 mg l the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to approximately 7 0 0 2 using n 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine n 2 ethane sulfonic acid hepes buffer solution the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained at less than 0 5 mg o2 l and the temperature of the system was maintained at 37 2 the solution was purged with h2 to provide electron donors for ahb the initial tce concentration in the growth medium was set to 20 mg l after 7 d 30 ml of the resultant culture was transferred to 170 ml of the growth medium this cultivation process was repeated four times and the final culture whose autohydrogenotrophic dechlorination function was verified was then used in batch experiments 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments were conducted in 40 ml glass vials with a teflon lined cap to minimize tce volatilization into the headspace the total volume of the working solution was set to 36 ml a working solution containing simulated groundwater with 20 mg l of tce was freshly prepared for each batch test for comparison the performance of a control system without mzvi and ahb a system containing mzvi alone mzvi a system containing ahb alone with supplementation of exogenous hydrogen h2 ahb and a coupled mzvi ahb system were investigated to further explore the regulatory effects of different mzvi characteristics on the tce removal performance of an mzvi ahb system mzvi with particle sizes ranging from 2 to 30 ¬µm was applied at dosages ranging from 1 to 30 g l a description of the groupings in the batch experiments is presented in table 1 the preparation method for simulated groundwater was described in a previous study xin et al 2018 according to the national standard for groundwater quality in china gb t14848 2017 and bacterial nutrient requirements a specific formula for the simulated groundwater was designed as follows nh4cl 125 mg l k2hpo4 50 mg l mgcl2 75 mg l cacl2 50 mg l nahco3 500 mg l and 1 ml of the trace metal solution as described in section 2 2 the simulated groundwater was deoxygenated using an n2 stream to maintain a do concentration of less than 0 5 mg o2 l before tce addition the initial ph value was adjusted to approximately 7 0 0 2 by adding hepes buffer solution the glass vial filling process was conducted in an anaerobic glove box the discoloration reaction of methylthioninium chloride was used as an indicator of anaerobic condition in the glove box under which the oxygen content can be controlled less than 1 after that all glass vials were completely sealed through the reaction process and placed in a rotary incubator at 18 1 c and 120 rpm and all the batch experiments were performed in triplicate the degradation of tce and the evolution of hydrogen and hydrochemical indexes ph and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored by destructively sampling at intervals of 1 5 7 10 15 20 25 30 40 50 and 60 d the degradation products were measured at the end of the reaction day 60 to further confirm the utilization of hydrogen by ahb in the mzvi ahb system hydrogen accumulation in all the mzvi ahb treatments with different mzvi characteristics and their counterparts without ahb were compared because tce removal by mzvi and ahb is possibly attributed to both adsorption and reduction processes preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the tce concentrations in both the aqueous and solid phases the tce concentrations in the aqueous phase and solid phase were then determined through liquid liquid and liquid solid extractions respectively using n hexane as the solvent the adsorbed tce mass was determined by the difference between the total and aqueous tce masses the results indicated that the tce removal ascribed to adsorption was less than 5 therefore the removed tce mass in these experiments was considered to represent the reduced tce mass 2 4 analytical methods hydrogen production were estimated by quantifying the hydrogen entering both the gas and liquid phases as described by xin et al 2016 the amount of hydrogen in the gas phase was calculated according to the ideal gas law with the total pressure increase measured by a glass u tube manometer and h2 concentration detected by a gas chromatograph gc equipped with a thermal conductivity detector model sp 6890 shandong lu nan inc china the amount of hydrogen in the aqueous phase was calculated using henry s law the tce concentrations were analyzed by a gc agilent 6890a equipped with a mass spectrometer msd 5975 after a liquid liquid extraction procedure and the recovery rate was 94 5 briefly analyses were performed with the initial oven temperature of 40 c for 1 min followed by ramping up at 5 min to 45 c 8 min to 125 c and 25 min to a final temperature of 180 c where it was held for 1 min the injector and detector temperatures were 200 and 250 c respectively more detailed information on tce analysis has been described in our previous work xin et al 2015 the degradation by products of tce were detected using a shimadzu 2010 gc equipped with a flame ionization detector fid the details can be found in text s1 the ph and orp of the systems were measured using a ph or orp meter hq 11d portable ph orp meter hach inc usa do was measured using an oxygen meter jpbj 608 inesa china all samples were filtered through a 0 22 ¬µm syringe filter before analysis 2 5 characterization methods the mzvi particles collected at predetermined intervals 7 20 40 and 60 d in the experiment were freeze dried fd 1a 50 beijing bo yikang experimental instrument co ltd for 48 h and then stored in a vacuum desiccator for subsequent characterization field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s 4800 japan coupled with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds was used to view the morphology and determine the

scanning range of 50 2000 cm 1 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps k alpha thermo fisher scientific uk analysis was conducted with a monochromatic al kŒ± x ray source at 1486 6 ev the binding energies were calibrated using the adventitious hydrocarbon c1s peak at 284 6 ev using xps peak xin et al 2016 2 6 bacterial community analysis bacterial samples were collected at 7 d and 20 d corresponding to the fast tce removal period the samples to be tested were stored in a sterile centrifuge tube in a refrigerator at 80 bacterial genome dna extraction and gel electrophoresis were used to determine whether the sample met the requirements of high throughput sequencing machine testing the bacterial universal primers 338f 5 actcctacgggagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 were used for polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification of the v3 v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna illumina pyrosequencing was performed by major biotech co ltd shanghai china on the miseq pe300 platform illumina inc ca usa the community species composition of each sample was determined at the phylum and genus levels on the majorbio cloud platform www majorbio com and the steps used were similar to those used in previous research xu et al 2018b 3 results and discussion 3 1 tce removal kinetics and dechlorination products fig 1 a illustrates the tce removal kinetics over time in the mzvi only ahb h2 and mzvi ahb systems in the mzvi ahb system tce removal was rapid in the initial stage with a maximum tce removal efficiency of 75 at 20 d but plateaued after 20 d and achieved a final removal efficiency of 97 at 60 d both the h2 ahb system and the mzvi ahb system achieved a similar final tce removal efficiency of approximately 100 which showed that the zvi supported hydrogen supplement worked efficiently in the mzvi ahb system in the mzvi only system tce was removed at a slow rate with the removal efficiency reaching only 54 at 20 d and 59 at 60 d throughout the reaction the tce removal efficiency in the mzvi only system was lower than that in the mzvi ahb system as shown in table s2 the pseudo first order rate coefficient of tce removal obtained in the mzvi ahb system was estimated to be 0 069 d 1 which was higher than that in the mzvi only system 0 013 d 1 thereby indicating that the presence of bacteria improved the tce removal efficiency and removal rate in the mzvi ahb system therefore the synergistic effects of mzvi coupled with bacteria show great potential for removing tce the compositions of the degradation products measured at the end of the experiment are shown in table s3 cis dichloroethene cis dce was the most prevalent intermediate 5 47 ¬µmol in the h2 ahb system during the experiment the compositions of the products in the mzvi and mzvi ahb systems were similar to each other yet largely different from those in the h2 ahb system in the mzvi ahb system the removed tce was mainly converted into ethane 0 96 ¬µmol ethylene 1 30 ¬µmol 1 1 dce 0 14 ¬µmol and cis dce 0 19 ¬µmol table s3 although a high tce removal efficiency and removal rate were observed in the h2 ahb system incomplete dechlorination which enhanced the secondary pollution risk hampered its further application 3 2 hydrogen evolution kinetics the time series data for h2 accumulation in the mzvi only and mzvi ahb systems are summarized in fig 1 b in the mzvi only system the h2 accumulation increased rapidly within 32 d accounting for about 85 of the total h2 accumulation at the end of the experiment 60 d in the mzvi ahb system a different h2 increasing tendency was observed in contrast there was no clear accumulation of h2 within 32 d and the h2 content at 32 d was less than 10 of the cumulative amount throughout the experimental process after 32 d h2 gradually accumulated in the system the absence of h2 accumulation in the initial stage coincided with the significant tce removal which could be attributed to the fact that hydrogen acting as an electron donor stimulated the metabolic activity of ahb hwang et al 2019 thereby enhancing the tce removal efficiency of bacteria during late stage of the reaction the gradually increasing accumulation of hydrogen in the mzvi ahb system was attributed to the disappearance of tce in the system as an electron acceptor and the subsequent reduced consumption of hydrogen 3 3 formation and evolution of surface corrosion products in this study undisturbed mzvi was a dark gray powder however after 60 d of incubation in the simulated groundwater the solid mzvi powder changed into different color states in the mzvi only and mzvi ahb systems in the mzvi only system the solid mzvi powder became dark black whereas a dark brown powder was observed at the end of the reaction in the mzvi ahb system this phenomenon suggests that distinct corrosion mechanisms of mzvi are possibly involved in different systems which was further verified by surface passivation product characterization using sem raman spectroscopy and xps at specific time in the batch experiments sem eds was used to visually explore the influence of bacteria on the surface corrosion and reactivity of mzvi fig 2 in the mzvi only system there was a thin and even passive film on the iron surface which had a generally smooth spherical structure however the passive layers of the mzvi samples in the mzvi ahb system were rough and discontinuous which was similar to the layer like precipitates this loose structure undoubtedly increased the number of active sites on the surface of mzvi and enhanced its reactivity the eds data fig 2 c f provided further evidence of the enhanced mzvi corrosion process by bacteria in the mzvi ahb system with a lower relative weight percentage of iron 61 compared with that of the mzvi only system 81 at the end of the experiment 60 d the proposed higher corrosion degree of mzvi in the mzvi ahb system compared with that in the mzvi only system was also supported by the lower orp 350 304 mv and higher ph 7 9 8 1 in the mzvi ahb system compared with those 341 304 mv and 7 5 8 0 respectively in the mzvi only system fig 1 c d the enhanced mzvi corrosion in the presence of ahb was possibly associated with the following two mechanisms 1 with the existence of iron reducing bacterium in ahb the fe iii containing corrosion products on the surface of mzvi can be transformed and dissolved and the originally covered mzvi surface can be exposed to pollutants again and 2 according to the fig 1 c a trend of decreasing ph in the h2 ahb system was observed this reflected that the metabolism of ahb can cause the decrease of solution ph whereas the corrosion of mzvi will increase the solution ph on the contrary so the existence of ahb is believed to have a ph buffering effect in the mzvi ahb coupling system to enhance mzvi corrosion to gain insights into the evolving composition of the iron surface corrosion products in mzvi ahb systems raman spectroscopy and xps were conducted the typical raman bands of the different iron oxide and oxy hydroxide phases are listed in table s4 as shown in fig 3 the mzvi only and mzvi ahb systems exhibited a similar corrosion product evolution process but the raman signal of the materials reacted in the mzvi only system was weaker than that in the mzvi ahb system in the initial stage of the reaction 0 7 d the product composition was mainly Œ± fe2o3 215 280 and 1325 cm 1 and Œ≤ feooh 410 cm 1 which limited the electrons from passing through the zvi oxide shell yang et al 2019 at 20 d fe3o4 670 cm 1 a semiconductor with a low electrical resistance 10 3 œâ cm was observed which facilitated the electron transfer and promoted tce removal by mzvi as the reaction time increased most of the Œ± fe2o3 was converted into Œ± feooh 1003 cm 1 and feo 595 cm 1 correspondingly the xps results in fig 4 and table s5 provide further evidence to support the corrosion product evolution process in the mzvi ahb system the fe ii fe iii ratio in the corrosion products increased from 1 24 at 7 d to 1 62 at 60 d thereby indicating a corrosion product transformation process which corresponded with the morphological and raman spectroscopic changes in the reacted mzvi fig 2 3 and corroborated that ahb played a role in mineral evolution in addition the fe o fe oh ratio decreased from 1 06 at 7 d to 0 86 at 60 d which supported the increased occurrence of feooh together with the raman spectroscopic evidence and corresponded with the accumulation of a large amount of hydrogen in the later stage of the reaction in the mzvi ahb system an et al 2010 3 4 analysis of the bacterial community structure fig 5 a shows the alpha diversity indexes of the bacterial communities in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems the shannon index was used to evaluate community diversity and the chao index was used to assess community richness wang et al 2022 the chao and shannon indexes of the mzvi ahb system were higher than those of the h2 ahb system thereby indicating that the mzvi ahb system exhibited higher microbial richness and diversity to further explore the distributions of bacterial operational taxonomic units otus in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems the characteristics of venn diagrams were compared fig 5 b the total otu numbers were 317 and 837 respectively in the h2 ahb system and mzvi ahb system at 20 d and the mzvi ahb system contained 290 unique otus whereas the h2 ahb system had only 32 unique otus this indicated that the addition of mzvi enhanced the diversity and number of bacteria the community abundances at the phylum level in the h2 ahb system and mzvi ahb system at 7 d and 20 d are shown in fig 5 c in the h2 ahb system firmicutes and proteobacteria were the dominant species and the sum of their relative abundances was 96 and 94 at 7 d and 20 d respectively however in the mzvi ahb system the predominant phyla included firmicutes proteobacteria actinobacteria and chloroflexi and the sum of their relative abundances was 93 6 and 93 7 at 7 d and 20 d respectively firmicutes proteobacteria and chloroflexi are strict anaerobes and are reported to be capable of degrading organic matter including cahs hug et al 2012 kocur et al 2016 wu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 chloroflexi which has been confirmed to contain dehalococcoidia that can dechlorinate tce to ethene kocur et al 2016 wu et al 2020 merely existed in the mzvi ahb system accounting for 14 and 4 of the bacterial community at 7 d and 20 d respectively therefore the relative abundance of the species that can remove cahs was stimulated by mzvi in the mzvi ahb system the distributions of the microbial populations at the genus level in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems are shown in fig 5 d in the h2 ahb and mzvi ahb systems acetobacterium was found to be highly enriched and was the most dominant genus 73 and 30 at 7 d and 25 and 24 at 20 d respectively acetobacterium can convert other substances into acetate which can be subsequently utilized by dechlorinating bacteria hug et al 2012 and can produce acids that buffer the increased ph value due to mzvi corrosion in addition various anaerobes with the ability to dechlorinate cahs were detected in the mzvi ahb system but were almost absent in the h2 ahb system such as pseudomonas and hydrogenophaga which can remove cahs by co metabolism bowman et al 2009 and desulfomicrobium and dechlorosoma which can degrade tce into ethylene dugat bony et al 2012 shi et al 2021 these results indicate that mzvi can promote the enrichment of bacteria with dechlorination functions 3 5 effects of mzvi particle sizes and dosages on the remediation performance of the mzvi ahb system the tce removal kinetics in the mzvi ahb systems with different mzvi particle sizes and dosages are presented in fig 6 when the applied mzvi had a smaller particle size 2 and 7 ¬µm the dosage of mzvi had little effect on the removal of tce in the mzvi ahb system the removal efficiency stabilized within a narrow range of 97 100 and the highest removal efficiency 100 and the fastest removal rate 0 100 d 1 were achieved with mzvi of 2 ¬µm and 1 g l in contrast for mzvi with larger particle sizes of 15 ¬µm and 30 ¬µm the removal efficiency of tce in the different treatments followed the order of 10 g l 30 g l 5 g l 1 g l and the highest removal efficiency 98 and fastest removal rate 0 102 d 1 were obtained at 30 ¬µm and 30 g l this suggested that when the mzvi particle size was small the removal efficiency was rarely affected regardless of the dosage increasing the dosage of mzvi was more conducive to the removal of cahs with large mzvi particles to clarify the activation process of mzvi on bacteria this study further investigated the evolutionary trends of h2 in the mzvi ahb system of different treatments as shown in fig 7 the overall h2 content in the coupled system slowly increased and the trend of the cumulative amount of h2 in the mzvi ahb system at the same mzvi dosage was 2 ¬µm 7 ¬µm 15 ¬µm 30 ¬µm this is contrary to the accumulation trend of h2 in the mzvi only system fig s1 the observed rules were possibly attributed to the fact that finer mzvi tends to have a more toxic effect on bacteria velimirovic et al 2015 and mzvi with a larger particle size provides a more favorable living environment for bacteria from another perspective h2 accumulation is highlighted because it reflects the gas clogging potential when the particle size of mzvi was 2 ¬µm and 7 ¬µm the h2 accumulation trend of mzvi was 30 g l 10 g l 5 g l 1 g l in the mzvi ahb system when the particle size of mzvi was 15 and 30 ¬µm the h2 accumulation in the mzvi ahb system was rarely affected by the mzvi dosage but the h2 accumulation were lower than that in the mzvi only system combining the effects of different zvi characteristics on both tce removal kinetics and h2 accumulation kinetics it was suggested that 1 for mzvi with a smaller particle size 2 and 7 ¬µm a lower dosage which would not significantly decrease the removal efficiency but would greatly avoid h2 accumulation is recommended and 2 for mzvi with a larger particle size 15 and 30 ¬µm the scheme designer should strive to balance the removal performance and clogging risk with a suitable dosage that would promote the removal efficiency and simultaneously accelerate h2 production 3 6 mzvi ahb interaction mechanism and engineering implications the results obtained in this study showed that the mzvi ahb system exhibited higher mzvi reactivity than mzvi alone and more complete dechlorination than h2 ahb alone as shown in graphical abstract figure a the promoting effect of coupling mzvi and ahb was mainly associated with the following mechanisms the produced h2 from mzvi corrosion with water can be effectively utilized by ahb mzvi corrosion was promoted by ahb to support a lasting reduction capacity and dechlorination bacteria were stimulated and enriched in the presence of mzvi because of the synchronization of abiotic and biotic dechlorination processes in the mzvi ahb system the electron efficiency of the mzvi was greatly enhanced compared with that when utilizing mzvi alone and the generation of unwanted by products was significantly avoided compared with that of h2 ahb these findings may lead to the development of a sustainable decontamination technology for groundwater cah pollution that is likely to be more cost effective and less environmentally disruptive to optimize zvi ahb technologies for real applications by adjusting the particle sizes and dosages of mzvi multiple criteria should be considered we took this study as an example to address an insight into the sustainable remediation the tce removal efficiency and h2 accumulation of the different treatments under the experimental conditions of this study are summarized in graphical abstract figure b when the removal efficiency is the priority for technical comparison the use of 1 g l of 7 ¬µm mzvi is the best solution to remove tce which can result in a tce removal efficiency of 99 within 60 d in the mzvi ahb system however the negative side of 7 ¬µm mzvi utilization lies in the excessive accumulation of hydrogen in the coupled system and subsequent gas blockage problems owing to its high reactivity and low reduction selectivity in real field applications the cost of material investment and long term remediation performance are other key considerations taking tce removal efficiency h2 accumulation potential and material cost as multiple selection criteria using 10 g l of 30 ¬µm mzvi is the best solution to remove tce under such conditions the removal efficiency of tce within 25 d can reach 82 and tce will be completely degraded within 60 d in addition there is no clear hydrogen accumulation in the mzvi ahb system under this condition which is attributed to the slow hydrogen release of 30 ¬µm mzvi providing favorable conditions for maximizing microbial activity last but not the least important the material cost of 30 ¬µm mzvi is much lower than that of its smaller counterparts for example 2 ¬µm mzvi costs approximately 2 10 times as much as 30 ¬µm zvi although the optimal dosage and size of mzvi we obtained is only relevant to the specific experimental conditions these results demonstrate that before any field treatment extensive laboratory experiments must be conducted to test different injection parameters and optimize the remediation performance most suited to their site specific conditions in addition more evaluation indicators that were not included in our study should be considered such as electron selectivity in the presence of natural co existing electron acceptors e g no3 and so4 2 and the mobility dependent working radius furthermore establishing multi criteria decision analysis methods that can comprehensively rank remediation alternatives is of vital importance for selecting appropriate remediation strategies 4 conclusions the results of this study revealed that coupling mzvi and ahb was significantly superior to mzvi and h2 ahb alone in terms of tce removal efficiency and complete dechlorination respectively in the mzvi ahb system there was a lag period of h2 accumulation coinciding with the significant tce removal which verified that the h2 generated by mzvi was efficiently utilized by ahb within the system based on sem raman spectroscopy and xps data coupled mzvi ahb provided a clearer corrosion product evolution process from Œ± fe2o3 and Œ≤ feooh to fe3o4 within the first 20 d which favored electron transfer and further led to the evolution of Œ± feooh and feo until the end of this reaction which facilitated continuous h2 production meanwhile more functional dechlorination microorganisms were enriched in the presence of mzvi compared with supplying h2 directly in h2 ahb the remediation performance of mzvi ahb varied with different mzvi particle sizes and dosages for mzvi with a smaller particle size 2 and 7 ¬µm a lower dosage which would guarantee a high removal efficiency and avoid h2 accumulation is recommended for mzvi with a larger particle size 15 and 30 ¬µm the scheme designer should strive to balance the removal performance and clogging risk with a suitable dosage that promotes the removal efficiency and simultaneously accelerates h2 production therefore the sustainable applicability of mzvi ahb with mzvi of different properties should be objectively evaluated by comprehensively considering the removal efficiency gas clogging potential and engineering cost this study supports sustainable groundwater remediation solution design for cah contaminated sites declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

in this study the spatial distribution of water aerosols was investigated through the molecular sieve adsorption method and predicted by discrete phase model dpm on this basis the health risk regarding legionella pneumophila for specific spray scenarios was evaluated by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra the results showed that the original droplet size can be described by the rosin rommaler distribution r2 0 99 the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from a nozzle spray can be well predicted by the dpm the concentration of water aerosols showed a sharp decline within 5 m from the nozzle and was not significantly different within 5 m p 0 05 as for various spray scenarios however the difference was significant outside 5 m p 0 05 furthermore a safe contact distance of exceeding 8 m is proposed in spray scenarios considering the risk threshold of 0 0001 sensitivity analysis demonstrated the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols as the

introduction reclaimed water is widely used as a supplemental water resource to alleviate urban water resource scarcity because of its stable quality and constant availability michael kordatou et al 2015 teklehaimanot et al 2015 however some of its constituents such as microorganisms can cause potential harm to populations exposed to it cai and zhang 2013 water spray facilities are often designed in places such as parks de man et al 2014 green spaces pepper and gerba 2018 and hospitals palmore et al 2009 haupt et al 2012 to sprinkle or beautify the environment chlorinated water is usually used as source water for water sprays in for example landscape fountains and green space irrigation which once aerosolized pose an inhalation risk to human health de man et al 2014 the aerosolized water can form fine droplets with approximate particle sizes of below 100 Œºm and can be suspended for a long time that is water aerosols asano 2007 dhawan and pratim 2021 containing waterborne pathogenic microorganisms including legionella hlady et al 1993 palmore et al 2009 haupt et al 2012 shigella fleming et al 2000 bancroft et al 2010 cryptosporidium and giardia deneen et al 1998 eisenstein et al 2008 xiao et al 2018 human adenovirus vergara et al 2016 and norovirus hoebe et al 2004 vergara et al 2016 which harm human health people can be exposed to pathogens containing water aerosols by an inhalation pathway under atomization conditions inhaled water aerosols can deposit in the respiratory tract causing allergic reactions or diseases jjemba et al 2015 unlike health hazards posed by chemicals pathogenic microorganisms such as legionella pneumophila can cause acute illness by means of inducing host infection at very low concentrations consequently the single organism hypothesis was proposed which means that even occasional exposure to pathogenic microorganisms can lead to infection carducci et al 2016 therefore health risk assessment for the exposure of people to water aerosols produced from nozzle sprays deserves attention quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a promising method for evaluating health risks based on the four steps of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response modeling and risk characterization haas et al 2014 of which exposure assessment is the key step due to the low concentrations of pathogenic microorganisms in the water aerosol produced from nozzle sprays the exposure dose of a pathogen can be estimated by multiplying the inhaled water aerosol volume by the concentration of pathogens in the water de man et al 2014 pepper and gerba 2018 determining the dose of water aerosols produced from nozzle sprays belongs to the research field of water gas two phase flow and the solutions are volume of fluid vof discrete phase model dpm and mixture the droplet size distribution is a key parameter in the dpm the main methods used to obtain the particle sizes of droplets produced from water sprays include a high speed film camera montazeri et al 2015 particle tracking velocimetry estrada perez et al 2018 etc the droplet size distribution can be modeled by semi empirical maximum entropy formalism and stochastic model the particle size distribution of droplets or water aerosols is determined by fitting the measured data to predetermined mathematical functions ashgriz et al 2011 the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd method is widely used in droplet aerosol research yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b in the process of cfd numerical simulation validation between numerical simulations and experimental measurements should be included experimental measurements offer the advantage of representing real situations and taking the complexity of the problem into account but usually only can be carried out at a limited number of sampling points yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b unlike experimental measurements cfd numerical simulation does not suffer from the limitations of experimental conditions albeit the accuracy and reliability are of concern thus verification and validation studies are imperative blockena 2012 at present there are few cases of using cfd numerical simulation to investigate the water aerosols produced from nozzle sprays and so the transport and dispersion of water aerosols has not been revealed therefore we hope to predict the spatial distribution of water aerosols using cfd numerical simulation and quantitatively calculate the water aerosol concentration and exposure dose in specific spray scenarios to evaluate the infection risk this paper presents a systematic investigation of water aerosol produced from a single nozzle spray system including 1 validation of the water aerosol concentration between experimental measurements and cfd numerical simulation under static wind conditions 2 numerical simulation of water aerosol distribution under windy scenarios and 3 risk analysis for people in specific spray scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale experiments 2 1 1 water spray system the water system used consists of one 300 l storage tank one pump and a nozzle spray device appropriately

was widely used in green spaces and landscape fountains to sprinkle water or beautify the environment the engineering drawing of this nozzle was shown in fig 1 tap water from the storage tank was pumped to the nozzle and sprayed into a space with free from wind interference three working conditions were set for the nozzle spray experiment water pressure of 0 5 bars and water flow rate of 6 l

numerical simulation and experimental measurements under static wind conditions another computational model with dimensions 40 m 40 m 20 m was made for numerical simulation of water aerosol distribution under windy conditions the ansys fluent pre processor icem 16 0 was applied to perform the geometric model construction and computational grid generation and two meshes with 2091 672 hexahedral cells and 3134 423 hexahedral cells were formed for static wind and windy conditions respectively based on mesh independence analysis 2 2 3 boundary conditions water droplets and water aerosols may float in a liquid film and may be reflected or disintegrate into smaller droplets and aerosols sureshkumar et al 2008 as the temperature of the wall in the experiments was lower than the boiling temperature it was assumed that the droplets were entrained in a water film along the walls after impingement anders et al 1993 in this study the trap boundary condition was applied 2 2 4 droplet characteristics the geometric properties of droplets in a water spray system are one of the most important factors the droplet size distribution can be modeled by semi empirical i e rosin rammler rosin and rammler 1933 and nukiyama tanasawa nukiyama and tanasawa 1939 maximum entropy formalism mef sellens and brzustowski 1985 xianguo 1987 and stochastic modeling apte et al 2003 the droplet or aerosol size distribution was determined by fitting the measured data to predetermined mathematical functions ashgriz et al 2011 in this study the rosin rammler model was applied this model assumes an exponential relationship between the droplet diameter d and the mass fraction of droplets with diameters greater than d which can be expressed according to eq 19 17 y d e d d n where y d represents the mass fraction of droplets with diameters greater than d d and n represents the mean diameter and the spread parameter respectively 2 2 5 spray nozzle characteristics the hollow cone model and dpm provided by ansys fluent 16 0 were used water droplets were injected into the computational grid from a location with 16 mm diameter positioned at the origin of 1 m from the bottom ground and oriented vertically the total mass flow rates of the injected water droplets were 0 1 kg s 0 133 kg s and 0 2 kg s respectively the temperature of the injected water droplets was 25 c the total number of particle streams was assumed to be 200 based on the sensitivity analysis 2 2 6 solver settings for the continuous phase flows the 3d steady rans equations were solved in combination with the realizable k epsilon turbulence model shih et al 1995 the simple algorithm was used for pressure velocity coupling pressure interpolation was second order and second order discretization schemes were used for both the convection terms and the viscous terms of the equations lagrangian trajectory simulations were performed by the discrete phase in this study trapezoidal and implicit schemes were used for higher and lower order schemes respectively the solution of the droplet momentum and mass transfer equations were solved in a fully coupled manner 2 3 scenarios analysis for water aerosol producing from nozzle spray under windy conditions for scenarios analysis the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray under the conditions of three spraying flows and two wind speeds were investigated the spraying flows were 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min respectively and the wind speeds were 2 m s and 5 m s respectively 2 4 qmra qmra is a promising method for evaluating the health risks associated with specific pathogens based on the four steps of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response model and risk characterization haas et al 2014 in recent years qmra has been applied to estimate the health risks of pathogens containing water aerosols in water spray de man et al 2014 hamilton et al 2018 2 4 1 hazard identification legionella pneumophila can cause legionnaires disease and even pneumonia pepper and gerba 2018 it has been listed as a candidate contaminant jjemba et al 2015 2 4 2 exposure assessment the exposure dose of water aerosols for people in the scenario of watching fountain was calculated as de man et al 2014 18 d c i w s i r t c f where c i w a represents the concentration of inhalable water aerosol kg m3 i r represents the inhalation rate l min t is the single exposure duration min c f represents conversion factors the exposure dose of pathogens in inhaled water aerosols was calculated as follows 19 d p c p d p c c f where c p represents the concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water legionella pneumophila can be detected in chlorinated reclaimed water at concentrations ranging from 2 3 10 cfu l to 1 8 104 cfu l blanky et al 2015 blanky et al 2017 according to de man et al 2014 c p of 10 101 102 103 and 104 cfu l respectively was assumed in splash parks that use reclaimed rainwater as source water de man et al 2014 besides according to pepper and gerba 2018 the concentration of legionella pneumophila in recycled sprayed water can be assumed to range from 1 cfu 100 ml to 1000 000 cfu 100 ml pepper and gerba 2018 thus this study assumed c p of 1 10 100 1000 and 10 000 cfu l respectively p c represents the partition coefficient 2 4 3 dose response model the exponential dose response model was applied for calculating the infection risk of legionella pneumophila as follows armstrong and haas 2007 pepper and gerba 2018 20 p d i n f 1 e r d p where p d i n f is the infection risk of single exposure r represents an infectivity value of 0 06 for legionella pneumophila armstrong and haas 2007 blanky et al 2017 2 4 4 risk characterization the annual infection risk for exposure of people to legionella pneumophila was calculated as follows 21 p y i n f 1 1 p d i n f n where n represents the annual exposure frequency crystal ball software was applied for risk calculation and the monte carlo method was used for 100 000 sampling calculations detailed of the calculated parameters applied for qmra are shown in table 2 2 5 data analysis microsoft excel software and origin 2021 software were used to display the distribution of water aerosols and to fit the particle size distribution of fine droplets with the rosin rammler model cfd post software was used to display the three dimensional spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray spss software was applied for the t test analysis of water aerosol concentrations in spray scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental measurement of water aerosol produced from nozzle spray under static wind the experimental measurement data of water aerosol concentrations at water spray flow rate of 6 l min 8 l min 12 l min and height of 1 5 m from the ground are shown in fig 2 the results showed an increasing trend for water aerosol concentration which gradually stabilized for all the sampling positions at the water spray flow rate of 6 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the distances of 1 0 m and 2 0 m from the nozzle were 0 0121 0 0012 g l and 0 0015 0 0002 g l respectively fig 2a as the water spray flow rate increased to 8 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the distances of 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0066 0 0007 g l 0 0031 0 0004 g l 0 0008 0 0001 g l and 0 0001 0 0001 g l respectively fig 2b similarly as the water spray flow rate was 12 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the distances of 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0109 0 0012 g l 0 0051 0 006 g l 0 0009 0 0002 g l and 0 0002 0 0001 g l respectively fig 2c therefore overall the water aerosol concentrations showed a gradual stepwise decreasing trend with increasing distance from the nozzle spray 3 2 cfd numerical simulation of nozzle spray under static wind condition 3 2 1 description of droplet size parameters in dpm the droplet sizes produced from the nozzle spray at all water spray flow rates of 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min can be described by the rosin rommaler distribution r2 0 99 at the water spray flow rate of 6 l min the maximum minimum and average particle sizes of droplets were 998 Œºm 308 Œºm and 852 Œºm respectively fig 3 a with a distribution coefficient of 6 6 when the water spray flow rate was increased to 8 l min the maximum minimum and average particle sizes of droplets decreased slightly to 982 Œºm 69 Œºm and 744 Œºm respectively fig 3b with a distribution coefficient of 4 5 at the water spray flow rate of 12 l min the maximum minimum and the average particle sizes of droplets of 756 Œºm 73 Œºm and 524 Œºm respectively fig 3c were recorded with a distribution coefficient was 3 8 3 2 2 water aerosol distribution calculated by cfd numerical simulation under static wind condition under static wind condition the water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray was symmetrically distributed and quickly landed due to the influence of gravity air resistance and other forces fig 4 at the spray flow rates of 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the height of 1 5 m from the ground sharply declined within 2 m and 3 m from the nozzle respectively beyond the above distances the water aerosol concentration quickly reduced to almost zero 3 2 3 validation of numerical simulations and experimental measurements the deviations between numerical simulations and experiment measurements at the height of 1 5 m from the ground are shown in fig 5 the results show the deviations conformed to the acceptable range indicating that the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray can be predicted by dpm at the spray flow rate of 6 l min the numerical simulated value of water aerosol concentration at the position of 1 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0144 g l the deviation between the numerical simulation and experimental measurement was 19 fig 5a as the spray flow rate increased to 8 l min the numerical simulated value at the positions of 1 0 m and 2 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0054 g l and 0 0024 g l with deviations of 18 and 23 respectively fig 5b when the spray flow rate was increased to 12 l min the numerical simulated value at the position 1 0 m 2 0 m and 3 0 m from the nozzle of 0 0112 g l 0 0033 g l and 0 0008 g l respectively were recorded with the deviations of 3 25 and 11 respectively fig 5c these results all conform to the acceptable deviation range for numerical simulations which confirm the feasibility of the dpm however there still are some limitations mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 eulerian lagrangian algorithm was used in the coupled calculation of the continuous phase and discrete phase to avoid hogging too much computing resources and time the droplets were considered to be calculated by a specified number of parcels which is equivalent to the nozzle spray from the entire spray head sun et al 2017 moreover the droplet particles contained in each parcel is assumed to have the same properties including particle size distribution velocity temperature etc in the numerical simulation process only one droplet was calculated to represent the whole parcel and other droplets in the parcel were assumed to have the same expression these assumptions greatly reduce the calculation resources and time albeit they caused inevitable bias 2 the droplet sizes were determined by photographing using high speed film camera method and were analyzed with image j software based on the image pixels sureshkumar et al 2008 montazeri et al 2015 the high speed film camera method has advantages in detecting large size droplets and water aerosols but it is not easy to capture small size droplets and water aerosols especially when the droplets or water aerosols are moving at high speeds 3 the imported udf file was written by the authors to consider the evaporation of droplets when the droplet evaporation was calculated by dpm either it does not evaporate that is the droplet size remains unchanged or it evaporates completely that is the droplet volatilizes into vapor rather than existing as a discrete droplet 3 3 cfd numerical simulation of spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from nozzle spray under windy conditions the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray under windy conditions differed considerably from that under static wind conditions the diffusion range of water aerosols at the wind speed of 5 m s was significantly greater than that at 2 m s fig 6 the diffusion range of water aerosols under the spraying flow rates of 8 l min and 12 l min was also significantly greater than that at 6 l min the difference was due to the smaller droplet sizes produced from nozzle spray at the water spray flows of 8 l min and 12 l min fig 3 droplets with particle size greater than 200 Œºm will quickly settle to the ground in a few seconds dhawan and pratim 2021 conversely particles with particle sizes less than 15 Œºm can suspend in the air for several hours and diffuse over long distances in this study the particle size of droplets produced from the nozzle spray was ranged from 69 Œºm to almost 1 mm therefore the dispersed droplets discharged in the space will evaporate and the loss of water leads to a reduction of the size of the droplets which prolongs the suspension time of the droplets in the space in other words the diffusion distance of droplets in space was determined by the suspension time of droplets and the suspension time was determined by the particle size of the droplets therefore the spatial distribution of small droplets that is water aerosols was not only affected by its own momentum changes but also by the wind speed around the environment furthermore the sedimentation time was shorter than the evaporation time as the droplet size increased to exceed 100 Œºm hence the sedimentation time was evaluated by dividing the height of the droplet that is a typical value of 1 75 m by the sedimentation velocity the evaporation time of the droplet was very fast at the droplet size of less than 100 Œºm and the evaporation process was completed during sedimentation dhawan and pratim 2021 the water aerosol concentration at the height of 1 5 m showed a gradual attenuation trend with distance in the upwind and downwind directions from the nozzle with the water aerosol concentration showing a sharp decline within 5 m fig 7 the distance of the water aerosol drift and diffusion in the downwind direction was greater than that in the upwind direction specifically the water aerosols at 15 20 m in the downwind direction can still be calculated by cfd numerical simulation while the calculated water aerosol concentration beyond 10 m in the upwind direction was zero at the same spray flow and wind speed the difference between water aerosol concentrations within 5 m in the upwind and downwind directions from the nozzle was not significant p 0 05 however the difference was significant beyond 5 m p 0 05 except that the t test cannot be carried out furthermore the water aerosol concentration beyond 5 m from the nozzle at the wind speed of 5 m s was significantly higher than that at 2 m s p 0 05 whereas the difference was not significant within 5 m p 0 05 when the wind speed was the same the difference was the same as above of the scenarios of spray flows of 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min respectively the fine droplets produced from nozzle spray are mainly affected by the nozzle structure type and hydraulic pressure which determine the particle size distribution of the fine droplets felsot et al 2011 the diffuse drift and spread of water aerosol are mainly affected by wind speed wind direction ambient temperature humidity and release height felsot et al 2011 dhawan and pratim 2021 specifically the droplet size distribution is a key factor determining the spatial distribution of water aerosols a smaller water aerosols travels farther 3 4 the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols produced from nozzle spray under windy conditions the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray showed a gradual attenuation trend with distance in the upwind and downwind directions fig 8 the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the water aerosols decreased from approximately 1 cfu m¬≥ in the air near the nozzle to 0 cfu m¬≥ within 5 m away from the nozzle fig 8 the series corresponding to 1 cfu m¬≥ was that the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the reclaimed water was 10 000 cfu l at the same spray flow and wind speed the difference between the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols within 5 m in the upwind and downwind directions was not significant p 0 05 however the difference was significant beyond 5 m p 0 05 furthermore the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols beyond 5 m from the nozzle at the wind speed of 5 m s was significantly higher than that at 2 m s p 0 05 while the difference was not significant within 5 m p 0 05 3 5 health risk assessment of inhalable legionella pneumophila in water aerosols in the scenarios of watching fountain 3 5 1 annual infection risks of inhalable legionella pneumophila in water aerosols in general the annual infection risk for males was slightly lower than that for females in the scenarios of watching fountain the main reason was that the exposure parameters of females were higher than those of males zhang et al 2021 that is the annual exposure frequency and the single exposure duration for females were higher than those for males table 3 the annual infection risk for exposure of people in the downwind direction was significantly higher than that in the upwind direction because of the higher water aerosol concentration in the downwind direction especially at the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the reclaimed water of 1000 cfu l the annual infection risk for both male and female exposure at 3 m in the upwind direction exceeded 0 0001 when the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the reclaimed water was 10 000 cfu l the annual infection risk for both male and female exposure at 5 m in the upwind and downwind directions were also all higher than 0 0001 the mean value of annual infection risk regarding water aerosols containing legionella pneumophila for males and females at 20 m downwind was 1 97 10 5 and 2 16 10 5 and the 95 ci range was 1 81 10 7 7 42 10 5 and 1 28 10 7 8 04 10 5 respectively for males and females at 3 m downwind from the water spray the mean value of annual infection risk was 7 96 10 4 and 8 68 10 4 and the 95 ci range was 7 18 10 6 3 02 10 3 and 5 22 10 6 3 21 10 3 respectively assuming that the concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water and wind speed of 10 000 cfu l and 2 235 m s respectively the annual infection risk at 22 m downwind was 1 0 10 5 pepper and gerba 2018 moreover the mean value of exposure dose and single infection risk regarding water aerosols containing legionella pneumophila for adults was 0 489 Œºl min and 1 1 10 4 de man et al 2014 and the 95 ci range was 0 0494 1 55 Œºl min and 0 82 8 10 4 respectively for people within 2 m from water spray 3 5 2 proposal of safe contact distance in the scenarios of watching fountain the annual infection risk for male and female exposure in the upwind and downwind directions from the nozzle was lower than the risk threshold of 0 0001 at the concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water of below 10 cfu l on the other hand the annual infection risk for expose of people in the upwind and downwind directions exceeds 0 0001 if the legionella pneumophila concentration in the reclaimed water is above 100 cfu l thus at the pathogen concentration of 1000 cfu l a safe contact distance of 3 m can be proposed in the upwind and downwind direction conversely a safe contact distance of more than 8 m should be proposed in the upwind and downwind directions when the pathogen concentration was 10 000 cfu l fig 9 the safe contact distance proposed in the scenario of watching fountains is similar to the buffer zones referred to greenland irrigation felsot et al 2011 it needs to be provided in different spray scenarios with ranges from several meters to tens of meters 3 5 3 sensitivity analysis for annual infection risks of inhalable legionella pneumophila in water aerosols in the scenarios of watching fountain sensitivity analysis showed that the factors that have greatly impact the annual infection risk py inf for males and females include the concentration of inhalable water aerosol ciwa the annual exposure frequency n the single exposure duration t and the pathogen concentration in the reclaimed water cp fig 10 the annual exposure frequency and single exposure duration have a great impact on the annual infection risk which have been confirmed in our previous studies xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the impact of the concentration of inhalable water aerosols on the annual infection risk for exposure of people through the inhalation pathway has also been reported in the literature de man et al 2014b as for the water aerosol concentration and the concentration of pathogens contained in the method of multiplying the concentration of pathogens in reclaimed water by the partition coefficient was applied for estimating the exposure dose of pathogens in this study but this may be questionable thus this issue still requires investigation in future research 5 conclusions the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from single nozzle spray was predicted using dpm and the health risk characterization regarding legionella pneumophila for specific spray scenarios was evaluated by qmra the main conclusions are shown as follows 1 the rosin rammler model adequately fit the size distribution of the original fine droplets and the dpm could predict the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from nozzle spray 2 the water aerosol concentration showed a gradual attenuation under both static and windy conditions the concentration of water aerosols and legionella pneumophila contained in showed sharp declines within 5 m from the nozzle and was not significantly different from that within 5 m p 0 05 albeit the difference was significant beyond 5 m p 0 05 3 the safe contact distance exceeding 8 m is proposed in the downwind and upwind directions in the scenarios of watching fountains as the risk threshold of 0 0001 was set as the benchmark in addition inhalation of water aerosols was the prominent exposure pathway in the health risk regarding legionella pneumophila declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

16092,water spray facilities are widely used in public places for sprinkling or beautifying the environment however the potential health risk induced by water aerosols increasingly calls for attention in this study the spatial distribution of water aerosols was investigated through the molecular sieve adsorption method and predicted by discrete phase model dpm on this basis the health risk regarding legionella pneumophila for specific spray scenarios was evaluated by quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra the results showed that the original droplet size can be described by the rosin rommaler distribution r2 0 99 the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from a nozzle spray can be well predicted by the dpm the concentration of water aerosols showed a sharp decline within 5 m from the nozzle and was not significantly different within 5 m p 0 05 as for various spray scenarios however the difference was significant outside 5 m p 0 05 furthermore a safe contact distance of exceeding 8 m is proposed in spray scenarios considering the risk threshold of 0 0001 sensitivity analysis demonstrated the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols as the critical factor affecting the health risk graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords spray water aerosol computational fluid dynamics cfd quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra 1

in places such as parks de man et al 2014 green spaces pepper and gerba 2018 and hospitals palmore et al 2009 haupt et al 2012 to sprinkle or beautify the environment chlorinated water is usually used as source water for water sprays in for example landscape fountains and green space irrigation which once aerosolized pose an inhalation risk to human health de man et al 2014 the aerosolized water can form fine droplets with approximate particle sizes of below 100 Œºm and can be suspended for a long time that is water aerosols asano 2007 dhawan and pratim 2021 containing waterborne pathogenic microorganisms including legionella hlady et al 1993 palmore et al 2009 haupt et al 2012 shigella fleming et al 2000 bancroft et al 2010 cryptosporidium and giardia deneen et al 1998 eisenstein et al 2008 xiao et al 2018 human adenovirus vergara et al 2016 and norovirus hoebe et al 2004 vergara et al 2016 which harm human health people can be exposed to pathogens containing water aerosols by an inhalation pathway under atomization conditions inhaled water aerosols can deposit in the respiratory tract causing allergic reactions or diseases jjemba et al 2015 unlike health hazards posed by chemicals pathogenic microorganisms such as legionella pneumophila can cause acute illness by means of inducing host infection at very low concentrations consequently the single organism hypothesis was proposed which means that even occasional exposure to pathogenic microorganisms can lead to infection carducci et al 2016 therefore health risk assessment for the exposure of people to water aerosols produced from nozzle sprays deserves attention quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra is a promising method for evaluating health risks based on the four steps of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response modeling and risk characterization haas et al 2014 of which exposure assessment is the key step due to the low concentrations of pathogenic microorganisms in the water aerosol produced from nozzle sprays the exposure dose of a pathogen can be estimated by multiplying the inhaled water aerosol volume by the concentration of pathogens in the water de man et al 2014 pepper and gerba 2018 determining the dose of water aerosols produced from nozzle sprays belongs to the research field of water gas two phase flow and the solutions are volume of fluid vof discrete phase model dpm and mixture the droplet size distribution is a key parameter in the dpm the main methods used to obtain the particle sizes of droplets produced from water sprays include a high speed film camera montazeri et al 2015 particle tracking velocimetry estrada perez et al 2018 etc the droplet size distribution can be modeled by semi empirical maximum entropy formalism and stochastic model the particle size distribution of droplets or water aerosols is determined by fitting the measured data to predetermined mathematical functions ashgriz et al 2011 the application of computational fluid dynamics cfd method is widely used in droplet aerosol research yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b in the process of cfd numerical simulation validation between numerical simulations and experimental measurements should be included experimental measurements offer the advantage of representing real situations and taking the complexity of the problem into account but usually only can be carried out at a limited number of sampling points yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019a yang et al 2019b unlike experimental measurements cfd numerical simulation does not suffer from the limitations of experimental conditions albeit the accuracy and reliability are of concern thus verification and validation studies are imperative blockena 2012 at present there are few cases of using cfd numerical simulation to investigate the water aerosols produced from nozzle sprays and so the transport and dispersion of water aerosols has not been revealed therefore we hope to predict the spatial distribution of water aerosols using cfd numerical simulation and quantitatively calculate the water aerosol concentration and exposure dose in specific spray scenarios to evaluate the infection risk this paper presents a systematic investigation of water aerosol produced from a single nozzle spray system including 1 validation of the water aerosol concentration between experimental measurements and cfd numerical simulation under static wind conditions 2 numerical simulation of water aerosol distribution under windy scenarios and 3 risk analysis for people in specific spray scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 full scale experiments 2 1 1 water spray system the water system used consists of one 300 l storage tank one pump and a nozzle spray device appropriately connected this study used an ordinary commercially hollow cone nozzle installed at the height of 1 0 m from the ground this type of nozzle applied in this study was a typical atomization nozzle which was widely used in green spaces and landscape fountains to sprinkle water or beautify the environment the engineering drawing of this nozzle was shown in fig 1 tap water from the storage tank was pumped to the nozzle and sprayed into a space with free from wind interference three working conditions were set for the nozzle spray experiment water pressure of 0 5 bars and water flow rate of 6 l

numerical simulation and experimental measurements under static wind conditions another computational model with dimensions 40 m 40 m 20 m was made for numerical simulation of water aerosol distribution under windy conditions the ansys fluent pre processor icem 16 0 was applied to perform the geometric model construction and computational grid generation and two meshes with 2091 672 hexahedral cells and 3134 423 hexahedral cells were formed for static wind and windy conditions respectively based on mesh independence analysis 2 2 3 boundary conditions water droplets and water aerosols may float in a liquid film and may be reflected or disintegrate into smaller droplets and aerosols sureshkumar et al 2008 as the temperature of the wall in the experiments was lower than the boiling temperature it was assumed that the droplets were entrained in a water film along the walls after impingement anders et al 1993 in this study the trap boundary condition was applied 2 2 4 droplet characteristics the geometric properties of droplets in a water spray system are one of the most important factors the droplet size distribution can be modeled by semi empirical i e rosin rammler rosin and rammler 1933 and nukiyama tanasawa nukiyama and tanasawa 1939 maximum entropy formalism mef sellens and brzustowski 1985 xianguo 1987 and stochastic modeling apte et al 2003 the droplet or aerosol size distribution was determined by fitting the measured data to predetermined mathematical functions ashgriz et al 2011 in this study the rosin rammler model was applied this model assumes an exponential relationship between the droplet diameter d and the mass fraction of droplets with diameters greater than d which can be expressed according to eq 19 17 y d e d d n where y d represents the mass fraction of droplets with diameters greater than d d and n represents the mean diameter and the spread parameter respectively 2 2 5 spray nozzle characteristics the hollow cone model and dpm provided by ansys fluent 16 0 were used water droplets were injected into the computational grid from a location with 16 mm diameter positioned at the origin of 1 m from the bottom ground and oriented vertically the total mass flow rates of the injected water droplets were 0 1 kg s 0 133 kg s and 0 2 kg s respectively the temperature of the injected water droplets was 25 c the total number of particle streams was assumed to be 200 based on the sensitivity analysis 2 2 6 solver settings for the continuous phase flows the 3d steady rans equations were solved in combination with the realizable k epsilon turbulence model shih et al 1995 the simple algorithm was used for pressure velocity coupling pressure interpolation was second order and second order discretization schemes were used for both the convection terms and the viscous terms of the equations lagrangian trajectory simulations were performed by the discrete phase in this study trapezoidal and implicit schemes were used for higher and lower order schemes respectively the solution of the droplet momentum and mass transfer equations were solved in a fully coupled manner 2 3 scenarios analysis for water aerosol producing from nozzle spray under windy conditions for scenarios analysis the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray under the conditions of three spraying flows and two wind speeds were investigated the spraying flows were 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min respectively and the wind speeds were 2 m s and 5 m s respectively 2 4 qmra qmra is a promising method for evaluating the health risks associated with specific pathogens based on the four steps of hazard identification exposure assessment dose response model and risk characterization haas et al 2014 in recent years qmra has been applied to estimate the health risks of pathogens containing water aerosols in water spray de man et al 2014 hamilton et al 2018 2 4 1 hazard identification legionella pneumophila can cause legionnaires disease and even pneumonia pepper and gerba 2018 it has been listed as a candidate contaminant jjemba et al 2015 2 4 2 exposure assessment the exposure dose of water aerosols for people in the scenario of watching fountain was calculated as de man et al 2014 18 d c i w s i r t c f where c i w a represents the concentration of inhalable water aerosol kg m3 i r represents the inhalation rate l min t is the single exposure duration min c f represents conversion factors the exposure dose of pathogens in inhaled water aerosols was calculated as follows 19 d p c p d p c c f where c p represents the concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water legionella pneumophila can be detected in chlorinated reclaimed water at concentrations ranging from 2 3 10 cfu l to 1 8 104 cfu l blanky et al 2015 blanky et al 2017 according to de man et al 2014 c p of 10 101 102 103 and 104 cfu l respectively was assumed in splash parks that use reclaimed rainwater as source water de man et al 2014 besides according to pepper and gerba 2018 the concentration of legionella pneumophila in recycled sprayed water can be assumed to range from 1 cfu 100 ml to 1000 000 cfu 100 ml pepper and gerba 2018 thus this study assumed c p of 1 10 100 1000 and 10 000 cfu l respectively p c represents the partition coefficient 2 4 3 dose response model the exponential dose response model was applied for calculating the infection risk of legionella pneumophila as follows armstrong and haas 2007 pepper and gerba 2018 20 p d i n f 1 e r d p where p d i n f is the infection risk of single exposure r represents an infectivity value of 0 06 for legionella pneumophila armstrong and haas 2007 blanky et al 2017 2 4 4 risk characterization the annual infection risk for exposure of people to legionella pneumophila was calculated as follows 21 p y i n f 1 1 p d i n f n where n represents the annual exposure frequency crystal ball software was applied for risk calculation and the monte carlo method was used for 100 000 sampling calculations detailed of the calculated parameters applied for qmra are shown in table 2 2 5 data analysis microsoft excel software and origin 2021 software were used to display the distribution of water aerosols and to fit the particle size distribution of fine droplets with the rosin rammler model cfd post software was used to display the three dimensional spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray spss software was applied for the t test analysis of water aerosol concentrations in spray scenarios 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental measurement of water aerosol produced from nozzle spray under static wind the experimental measurement data of water aerosol concentrations at water spray flow rate of 6 l min 8 l min 12 l min and height of 1 5 m from the ground are shown in fig 2 the results showed an increasing trend for water aerosol concentration which gradually stabilized for all the sampling positions at the water spray flow rate of 6 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the distances of 1 0 m and 2 0 m from the nozzle were 0 0121 0 0012 g l and 0 0015 0 0002 g l respectively fig 2a as the water spray flow rate increased to 8 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the distances of 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0066 0 0007 g l 0 0031 0 0004 g l 0 0008 0 0001 g l and 0 0001 0 0001 g l respectively fig 2b similarly as the water spray flow rate was 12 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the distances of 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0109 0 0012 g l 0 0051 0 006 g l 0 0009 0 0002 g l and 0 0002 0 0001 g l respectively fig 2c therefore overall the water aerosol concentrations showed a gradual stepwise decreasing trend with increasing distance from the nozzle spray 3 2 cfd numerical simulation of nozzle spray under static wind condition 3 2 1 description of droplet size parameters in dpm the droplet sizes produced from the nozzle spray at all water spray flow rates of 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min can be described by the rosin rommaler distribution r2 0 99 at the water spray flow rate of 6 l min the maximum minimum and average particle sizes of droplets were 998 Œºm 308 Œºm and 852 Œºm respectively fig 3 a with a distribution coefficient of 6 6 when the water spray flow rate was increased to 8 l min the maximum minimum and average particle sizes of droplets decreased slightly to 982 Œºm 69 Œºm and 744 Œºm respectively fig 3b with a distribution coefficient of 4 5 at the water spray flow rate of 12 l min the maximum minimum and the average particle sizes of droplets of 756 Œºm 73 Œºm and 524 Œºm respectively fig 3c were recorded with a distribution coefficient was 3 8 3 2 2 water aerosol distribution calculated by cfd numerical simulation under static wind condition under static wind condition the water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray was symmetrically distributed and quickly landed due to the influence of gravity air resistance and other forces fig 4 at the spray flow rates of 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min the water aerosol concentrations at the height of 1 5 m from the ground sharply declined within 2 m and 3 m from the nozzle respectively beyond the above distances the water aerosol concentration quickly reduced to almost zero 3 2 3 validation of numerical simulations and experimental measurements the deviations between numerical simulations and experiment measurements at the height of 1 5 m from the ground are shown in fig 5 the results show the deviations conformed to the acceptable range indicating that the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray can be predicted by dpm at the spray flow rate of 6 l min the numerical simulated value of water aerosol concentration at the position of 1 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0144 g l the deviation between the numerical simulation and experimental measurement was 19 fig 5a as the spray flow rate increased to 8 l min the numerical simulated value at the positions of 1 0 m and 2 0 m from the nozzle was 0 0054 g l and 0 0024 g l with deviations of 18 and 23 respectively fig 5b when the spray flow rate was increased to 12 l min the numerical simulated value at the position 1 0 m 2 0 m and 3 0 m from the nozzle of 0 0112 g l 0 0033 g l and 0 0008 g l respectively were recorded with the deviations of 3 25 and 11 respectively fig 5c these results all conform to the acceptable deviation range for numerical simulations which confirm the feasibility of the dpm however there still are some limitations mainly reflected in the following aspects 1 eulerian lagrangian algorithm was used in the coupled calculation of the continuous phase and discrete phase to avoid hogging too much computing resources and time the droplets were considered to be calculated by a specified number of parcels which is equivalent to the nozzle spray from the entire spray head sun et al 2017 moreover the droplet particles contained in each parcel is assumed to have the same properties including particle size distribution velocity temperature etc in the numerical simulation process only one droplet was calculated to represent the whole parcel and other droplets in the parcel were assumed to have the same expression these assumptions greatly reduce the calculation resources and time albeit they caused inevitable bias 2 the droplet sizes were determined by photographing using high speed film camera method and were analyzed with image j software based on the image pixels sureshkumar et al 2008 montazeri et al 2015 the high speed film camera method has advantages in detecting large size droplets and water aerosols but it is not easy to capture small size droplets and water aerosols especially when the droplets or water aerosols are moving at high speeds 3 the imported udf file was written by the authors to consider the evaporation of droplets when the droplet evaporation was calculated by dpm either it does not evaporate that is the droplet size remains unchanged or it evaporates completely that is the droplet volatilizes into vapor rather than existing as a discrete droplet 3 3 cfd numerical simulation of spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from nozzle spray under windy conditions the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray under windy conditions differed considerably from that under static wind conditions the diffusion range of water aerosols at the wind speed of 5 m s was significantly greater than that at 2 m s fig 6 the diffusion range of water aerosols under the spraying flow rates of 8 l min and 12 l min was also significantly greater than that at 6 l min the difference was due to the smaller droplet sizes produced from nozzle spray at the water spray flows of 8 l min and 12 l min fig 3 droplets with particle size greater than 200 Œºm will quickly settle to the ground in a few seconds dhawan and pratim 2021 conversely particles with particle sizes less than 15 Œºm can suspend in the air for several hours and diffuse over long distances in this study the particle size of droplets produced from the nozzle spray was ranged from 69 Œºm to almost 1 mm therefore the dispersed droplets discharged in the space will evaporate and the loss of water leads to a reduction of the size of the droplets which prolongs the suspension time of the droplets in the space in other words the diffusion distance of droplets in space was determined by the suspension time of droplets and the suspension time was determined by the particle size of the droplets therefore the spatial distribution of small droplets that is water aerosols was not only affected by its own momentum changes but also by the wind speed around the environment furthermore the sedimentation time was shorter than the evaporation time as the droplet size increased to exceed 100 Œºm hence the sedimentation time was evaluated by dividing the height of the droplet that is a typical value of 1 75 m by the sedimentation velocity the evaporation time of the droplet was very fast at the droplet size of less than 100 Œºm and the evaporation process was completed during sedimentation dhawan and pratim 2021 the water aerosol concentration at the height of 1 5 m showed a gradual attenuation trend with distance in the upwind and downwind directions from the nozzle with the water aerosol concentration showing a sharp decline within 5 m fig 7 the distance of the water aerosol drift and diffusion in the downwind direction was greater than that in the upwind direction specifically the water aerosols at 15 20 m in the downwind direction can still be calculated by cfd numerical simulation while the calculated water aerosol concentration beyond 10 m in the upwind direction was zero at the same spray flow and wind speed the difference between water aerosol concentrations within 5 m in the upwind and downwind directions from the nozzle was not significant p 0 05 however the difference was significant beyond 5 m p 0 05 except that the t test cannot be carried out furthermore the water aerosol concentration beyond 5 m from the nozzle at the wind speed of 5 m s was significantly higher than that at 2 m s p 0 05 whereas the difference was not significant within 5 m p 0 05 when the wind speed was the same the difference was the same as above of the scenarios of spray flows of 6 l min 8 l min and 12 l min respectively the fine droplets produced from nozzle spray are mainly affected by the nozzle structure type and hydraulic pressure which determine the particle size distribution of the fine droplets felsot et al 2011 the diffuse drift and spread of water aerosol are mainly affected by wind speed wind direction ambient temperature humidity and release height felsot et al 2011 dhawan and pratim 2021 specifically the droplet size distribution is a key factor determining the spatial distribution of water aerosols a smaller water aerosols travels farther 3 4 the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols produced from nozzle spray under windy conditions the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols produced from the nozzle spray showed a gradual attenuation trend with distance in the upwind and downwind directions fig 8 the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the water aerosols decreased from approximately 1 cfu m¬≥ in the air near the nozzle to 0 cfu m¬≥ within 5 m away from the nozzle fig 8 the series corresponding to 1 cfu m¬≥ was that the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the reclaimed water was 10 000 cfu l at the same spray flow and wind speed the difference between the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols within 5 m in the upwind and downwind directions was not significant p 0 05 however the difference was significant beyond 5 m p 0 05 furthermore the concentration of legionella pneumophila in water aerosols beyond 5 m from the nozzle at the wind speed of 5 m s was significantly higher than that at 2 m s p 0 05 while the difference was not significant within 5 m p 0 05 3 5 health risk assessment of inhalable legionella pneumophila in water aerosols in the scenarios of watching fountain 3 5 1 annual infection risks of inhalable legionella pneumophila in water aerosols in general the annual infection risk for males was slightly lower than that for females in the scenarios of watching fountain the main reason was that the exposure parameters of females were higher than those of males zhang et al 2021 that is the annual exposure frequency and the single exposure duration for females were higher than those for males table 3 the annual infection risk for exposure of people in the downwind direction was significantly higher than that in the upwind direction because of the higher water aerosol concentration in the downwind direction especially at the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the reclaimed water of 1000 cfu l the annual infection risk for both male and female exposure at 3 m in the upwind direction exceeded 0 0001 when the concentration of legionella pneumophila in the reclaimed water was 10 000 cfu l the annual infection risk for both male and female exposure at 5 m in the upwind and downwind directions were also all higher than 0 0001 the mean value of annual infection risk regarding water aerosols containing legionella pneumophila for males and females at 20 m downwind was 1 97 10 5 and 2 16 10 5 and the 95 ci range was 1 81 10 7 7 42 10 5 and 1 28 10 7 8 04 10 5 respectively for males and females at 3 m downwind from the water spray the mean value of annual infection risk was 7 96 10 4 and 8 68 10 4 and the 95 ci range was 7 18 10 6 3 02 10 3 and 5 22 10 6 3 21 10 3 respectively assuming that the concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water and wind speed of 10 000 cfu l and 2 235 m s respectively the annual infection risk at 22 m downwind was 1 0 10 5 pepper and gerba 2018 moreover the mean value of exposure dose and single infection risk regarding water aerosols containing legionella pneumophila for adults was 0 489 Œºl min and 1 1 10 4 de man et al 2014 and the 95 ci range was 0 0494 1 55 Œºl min and 0 82 8 10 4 respectively for people within 2 m from water spray 3 5 2 proposal of safe contact distance in the scenarios of watching fountain the annual infection risk for male and female exposure in the upwind and downwind directions from the nozzle was lower than the risk threshold of 0 0001 at the concentration of legionella pneumophila in reclaimed water of below 10 cfu l on the other hand the annual infection risk for expose of people in the upwind and downwind directions exceeds 0 0001 if the legionella pneumophila concentration in the reclaimed water is above 100 cfu l thus at the pathogen concentration of 1000 cfu l a safe contact distance of 3 m can be proposed in the upwind and downwind direction conversely a safe contact distance of more than 8 m should be proposed in the upwind and downwind directions when the pathogen concentration was 10 000 cfu l fig 9 the safe contact distance proposed in the scenario of watching fountains is similar to the buffer zones referred to greenland irrigation felsot et al 2011 it needs to be provided in different spray scenarios with ranges from several meters to tens of meters 3 5 3 sensitivity analysis for annual infection risks of inhalable legionella pneumophila in water aerosols in the scenarios of watching fountain sensitivity analysis showed that the factors that have greatly impact the annual infection risk py inf for males and females include the concentration of inhalable water aerosol ciwa the annual exposure frequency n the single exposure duration t and the pathogen concentration in the reclaimed water cp fig 10 the annual exposure frequency and single exposure duration have a great impact on the annual infection risk which have been confirmed in our previous studies xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the impact of the concentration of inhalable water aerosols on the annual infection risk for exposure of people through the inhalation pathway has also been reported in the literature de man et al 2014b as for the water aerosol concentration and the concentration of pathogens contained in the method of multiplying the concentration of pathogens in reclaimed water by the partition coefficient was applied for estimating the exposure dose of pathogens in this study but this may be questionable thus this issue still requires investigation in future research 5 conclusions the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from single nozzle spray was predicted using dpm and the health risk characterization regarding legionella pneumophila for specific spray scenarios was evaluated by qmra the main conclusions are shown as follows 1 the rosin rammler model adequately fit the size distribution of the original fine droplets and the dpm could predict the spatial distribution of water aerosols produced from nozzle spray 2 the water aerosol concentration showed a gradual attenuation under both static and windy conditions the concentration of water aerosols and legionella pneumophila contained in showed sharp declines within 5 m from the nozzle and was not significantly different from that within 5 m p 0 05 albeit the difference was significant beyond 5 m p 0 05 3 the safe contact distance exceeding 8 m is proposed in the downwind and upwind directions in the scenarios of watching fountains as the risk threshold of 0 0001 was set as the benchmark in addition inhalation of water aerosols was the prominent exposure pathway in the health

16093,although ti4o7 ceramic membrane has been recognized as one of the most promising anode materials for electrochemical advanced oxidation process eaop it suffers from relatively low hydroxyl radical oh production rate and high charge transfer resistance that restricted its oxidation performance of organic pollutants herein we reported an effective interface engineering strategy to develop a ti4o7 reactive electrochemical membrane rem doped by graphene oxide nanoparticles gons gons ti4o7 rem via strong gons o ti bonds results showed that 1 wt gon doping on ti4o7 rem significantly reduced the charge transfer resistance from 73 87 to 8 42 œâ compared with the pristine ti4o7 rem and yielded oh at 2 5 2 8 times higher rate the 1 4 dioxane 1 4 d oxidation rate in batch experiments

after a polarization test of 90 h at 80 ma cm2 and within 15 consecutive cycles its oxidation performance was stable 95 1 99 2 with about 1 of gons lost on the rem in addition rem process can efficiently degrade refractory organic matters in the groundwater and landfill leachate the total organic carbon was removed by 54 5 with a single pass rem a normalized electric energy consumption per

nowadays non active anodes including boron doped diamond bdd and mixed metal oxide mmo such as doped sno2 and pbo2 have attracted great attention because of their excellent electrochemical performance in eaop processes donaghue and chaplin 2013 lin et al 2012 wang et al 2020b zheng et al 2018 however they are suffering from the high cost poor stability and or the risk of releasing highly toxic

ganiyu et al 2016 nayak and chaplin 2018 for instance lin and co workers fabricated a pure magn√©li phase ti4o7 electrode that exhibited greater pfoa pfos oxidation rates than other non active

activated carbon or multi walled carbon nanotubes and ti4o7 markedly promoted electrochemical reduction of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma almassi et al 2019 however the abovementioned electrodes were prepared by mixing polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf as the binder and their performance is difficult to last for long time because their weak surface adhesion caused poor mechanical and chemical stability

energy cost the apparent pseudo first order decay rate constants of 1 4 dioxane and oxalic acid were calculated by eq 4 4 ln c t c 0 k obs t where c 0 mm and ct mm are the concentrations at time 0 and

v a where v m3 is the available solution volume and a m2 is the geometry surface of anode the electric energy cost ee o kwh m3 per log removal of 1 4 dioxane was calculated using eq 6 6 ee o u cell i t v log c 0 c t 1 where u cell v is the cell voltage i a is the applied current and v m3 is the treatment volume 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of gons ti4o7 rem the lattice parameters of ti4o7 structure were calculated from the xrd data a 5 59 b 7 14 c 12 3 Œ± 95 2 Œ≤ 95 2 Œ≥ 109 and were in accordance with the reported crystal structure of ti4o7 nayak and chaplin 2018 gon doping did not shift the characteristics of ti4o7 indicating that the high purity of ti4o7 was uncharged during electrode preparation fig s4 the surface morphology of pristine ti4o7 rem and gons ti4o7 rem electrodes were observed using sem equipped with the elemental mapping of x ray eds fig 1 a and b pristine ti4o7 rem anode contains a uniform distribution of pores with micron size pore structure fig 1a as shown in fig 1b fairly uniform gons clusters with a diameter of 25 80 nm was dispersed on the surface of pristine ti4o7 rem detailed eds mapping results were shown in fig s5 the results of mercury intrusion porosimetry analysis were shown in fig 1c the median pore diameter sizes of 1 gons ti4o7 rem anode were around 1 57 Œºm and the porosity of 43 76 slightly higher than that of pristine ti4o7 rem anode at 1 31 Œºm and 36 54 respectively fig 1d g show the chemical band and elemental composition of electrodes from xps the xps spectrum showed that there were mainly ti o and c on the surface of pristine ti4o7 rem and gons ti4o7 rem anodes fig 1d the ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 characteristic peaks were observed for pristine ti4o7 rem at binding energy be of 458 7 ev and 464 4 ev respectively fig 1e the corresponding be for gons ti4o7 rem shifted 0 4 ev toward higher values probably due to the increase in the surrounding electron density by gons doping ma et al 2016 this big up shift suggested strong chemical interactions between gons and ti4o7 which may accelerate electron transfer between ti4o7 and gons and hence enhance the electro activity of gons ti4o7 rem electrode zhao et al 2020 when the o 1 s spectrum was deconvoluted three peaks were centered at 530 1 531 1 and 532 1 ev fig 1f and these peaks can be indexed to ti oh ti o and c o o c o bonds respectively meng et al 2020 the intensity increase of the ti oh peak of gons ti4o7 rem indicated that gons brought a successive change of the chemical state of the ti lim et al 2019 the spectrum of the ti o showed a declined intensity implying the transfer of electron from ti to o induced by the chemical interactions between these two components in addition no signals of other peaks appeared in the ti 2p spectra suggesting that ti atoms are not directly bonded with carbon and ti4o7 interact with gons through gons o ti bonds the c 1 s spectrum is fitted with four peaks at 284 4 285 1 286 1 286 3 and 286 6 ev fig 1g corresponding to c c c h c oh c o and c ooh bonds respectively for the gons ti4o7 rem the intensity of c oh increased indicating that surface hydroxyl groups displayed prevailingly and the result was similar to those reported in the literature on the ti4o7 electrode doped with carbon based materials xie et al 2020 the shift of be of c o by 0 2 ev toward a higher value indicated the presence gons o ti bonds thus the nano fusion domains with the strong interaction of the chemical bonding between gons and ti4o7 by gons o ti bonds may provide high structural stability and facilitate the electron transfer lim et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 moreover the ftir results were further proving the presence of interactions as shown in fig s6 the peak at 1097 cm 1 on the gons ti4o7 rem were detected owning to the c o ti bond presumido et al 2022 the carbon element came from gons thus it considered to be gons o ti bond the peak at 1158 and 1635 cm 1 was related to c o and c oh bending vibration respectively ding et al 2020 moreover the peak at 3460 cm 1 was according to the asymmetric stretching of hydroxyl groups raman spectra was used to characterize the structural disorder of carbonaceous materials in pristine ti4o7 rem and gons ti4o7 rem anodes containing different amounts gons fig 1h the characteristic d and g peaks at raman shifted from 1332 to 1348 and from 1567 to 1580 cm 1 for the gons doped electrodes duan et al 2016b respectively the i d i g ratio values gradually increased from 1 08 to 1 21 in gons ti4o7 rem as the doping amount of gons increased from 1 to 5 suggesting that higher extent of disorder was created by gon doping xie et al 2020 3 2 electrochemical property reactivity and stability of gons ti4o7 rem 3 2 1 electrochemical reactive sites the cyclic voltammetry cv curves of both pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem were obtained with the scan rate at the range of 5 100 mv s and the current increased with the increase of scan rate fig s7 as shown in fig 2 a the electrical current area of 1 gons ti4o7 rem was about 2 times larger than that of pristine ti4o7 rem suggesting that 1 gons ti4o7 rem has an enhanced electron transfer activity compared with pristine ti4o7 rem the inset in fig 2a shows the linear relationship between the voltammetric charge and the reciprocal square root of scan rate v 1 2 mv1 2 s1 2 by graphical integration method voltammetric charge q mc cm2 represents the number of electroactive sites per area on the electrodes pei et al 2020 which played a significant role on the performance of electrochemical oxidation the slope between q and v 1 2 of 1 gons ti4o7 rem 20 06 was higher than that of pristine ti4o7 rem 12 06 these results demonstrated that 1 gons ti4o7 rem had a large amount of electrochemical reactive sites for electrocatalytic oxidation 3 2 2 interfacial electron transfer eis test was conducted to explore the charge transfer and charge separation on the electrode surface fig 2 b shows the nyquist plots of pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem after fitting the data to an equivalent circuit fig s8 the ohmic resistance r s of 1 gons ti4o7 rem 22 24 œâ was similar to pristine ti4o7 rem 19 12 œâ indicating that homologous configuration of all eaop reactors e g electrode distance and solution conductivity provided the similar ohmic resistance wang et al 2020a notably the charge transfer resistance r ct of 1 gons ti4o7 rem 8 42 œâ was significantly lower than that of pristine ti4o7 rem 73 87 œâ indicating that gon doping decreased the impedance for the electrode this result was attributed to that the increase of oxygen containing functional groups from the oxidation of carbon groups after polarization promoted the interfacial electron transfer xie et al 2020 the higher c oh ratio of the 1 gons ti4o7 rem than that of pristine ti4o7 rem suggested its stronger o2 adsorption of which hydroxyl surface sites may play a significant role in promoting interfacial charge transfer xie et al 2020 high charge transfer rate on the surface of an anode can provide high electrocatalytic performance and then enhance the degradation of organic pollutants in eaop xu et al 2016 carbon nanotubes cnt carbon black cb and graphene nanoplatelets gnp as the dopant have been reported to decrease the interfacial charge transfer resistance almassi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 xu et al 2016 while our study to the best of our knowledge is the first report of ti4o7 electrode doped with gons through strong chemical bond besides a previous study reported that c ooh generation from carbon groups oxidation during long term operation could increase the interfacial resistance and hinder the oxidation process xie et al 2020 however in our study c ooh exhibited no obvious negative effects on interfacial charge transfer which was likely attributed to the different electrode preparation methods gons o ti bonds vs glue bonding 3 2 3 electrochemical reactivity to investigate the oxidation ability det and oh radical oxidation of gons ti4o7 rem in eaop four probes oa cou ta acid and p bq were tested bejan et al 2012 jing and chaplin 2017 xie et al 2020 for det the pseudo first order decay rate k obs oa min 1 of oa increased from 6 9 10 3 to 1 9 10 2 min 1 with the increase of gon amount from 0 to 5 wt fig s9a and s9b the k obs oa exhibited positive linear relationship with the amount of gon dopant r2 0 999 fig s9c indicating that gon doping significantly facilitated det process the increased oxidation rate of oa was likely caused by the enhanced electron charge transfer for gons ti4o7 rem cou and ta were chosen as oh probes because they are resistant to direct oxidation and can react with oh to form known products 7 hydroxy coumarin 7 hcou and 2 hydroxy terephthalic acid 2 hta respectively jing and chaplin 2017 fig 2 c and d shows that the concentrations of produced 7 hcou and 2 hta in 1 gons ti4o7 rem were 2 6 and 2 8 times higher than those of pristine ti4o7 rem respectively indicating the higher oh generating rate of 1 gons ti4o7 rem therefore the chemical bonded interface via gons o ti bonds exhibited strong reactivity to form oh which is prospective for contaminant oxidation fig s10 in addition p bq also reacts readily with oh k oh p bq 1 2 109 m 1s 1 and is highly resistant to direct oxidation bejan et al 2012 after 40 min of reaction 59 9 and 83 5 p bq removal were observed for pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrodes respectively fig 2e which was attributed to oh oxidation these results implied that gon doping can be employed for high in situ production of oh to enhance electrocatalytic oxidation which was consistent with the previous report favaro et al 2015 the structural defects in 1 gons ti4o7 rem by gon doping fig 1h may further promote the transportation of unpaired electrons resulting in positive effects on generating oh zhang et al 2010 3 2 4 electrochemical stability the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode exhibited considerable electrochemical and structural stability in a continuous chronopotentiometry test of 90 h at a current density of 80 ma cm2 the chronopotentiometric curves showed no obvious changes on reaction potential fig 2f indicating that the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode has excellent electrochemical stability xps results of 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode showed no obvious changes on chemical bond before and after 90 h of chronopotentiometry test fig s11 and sem images showed that gons still stably existed in the electrode fig s12 suggesting the strong stability of the chemical bond in 1 gons ti4o7 rem carlo et al reported that go doping could partially passivates the oxygen vacancies defects of tio2 electrode which significantly extended its service lifetime agresti et al 2016 tio2 and ti4o7 have several similar properties and ti4o7 exhibits better conductivity and mineralization performance du et al 2021 go doping may passivate oxygen vacancies defects on ti4o7 crystal surface and hence improve the stability of ti4o7 electrodes the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode exhibited a high stability on oa decay after 90 h polarization operation fig 2g for the pristine ti4o7 rem electrode the oa decay rate decreased from 6 9 10 3 min 1 to 3 7 10 3 min 1 after 90 h polarization however the oa electrooxidation decay rate remained 8 1 8 5 10 3 min 1 after 90 h polarization these results suggested that the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode has an excellent stability and a strong corrosion resistance under anodic conditions in addition a carbon containing materials on the ti4o7 electrodes study with pvdf technology showed that the oxalate electrooxidation decay rate kapp after 96 h were significantly decreased xie et al 2020 that was likely attributed to the strong gons o ti chemical interaction by graphene doped interface engineering strategy could obtain better stability than that of pvdf methods the slight decrease in oa decay rate after 90 h polarization was possibly associated with the gradual deactivation of ti4o7 to less active sub stoichiometric ti n o2 n 1 i e ti5o9 and ti6o11 jing et al 2018 3 3 electrooxidation of 1 4 dioxane 3 3 1 comparison between pristine ti4o7 rem gons ti4o7 rem and bdd electrooxidation ability of 1 gons ti4o7 rem was compared with that of pristine ti4o7 rem and bdd electrode using batch experiments the electro assisted sorption of 1 4 d was negligible 2 4 3 7 removal after 60 min on both pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrodes fig s13 once the current was applied the 1 4 d concentration started to decrease the degradation of 1 4 d followed pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 98 for all three electrodes fig 3 a the decay rate constant of 1 4 d in 1 gons ti4o7 rem k 1 gons ti4o7 rem 1 49 10 2 min 1 was about 2 times faster than that in pristine ti4o7 rem k pristine ti4o7 rem 7 51 10 3 min 1 and similar to bdd k bdd 1 79 10 2 min 1 1 4 d 1 mm was removed by 95 after 6 h for the pristine ti4o7 rem but 3 h for 1 gons ti4o7 rem and bdd fig s14 the 1 4 d decay rate constant for the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode was increased by approximately the same magnitude as the increase of oh yield suggesting that the increase of 1 4 d removal by gon doping may be attributed to the increase of oh production to identify the degradation pathway for 1 4 d radical quenching tests were conducted the results demonstrated that free radicals were dominantly responsible for 1 4 d degradation details shown in text s2 and fig s15 3 3 2 effect of gon doping amounts electrooxidation of 1 4 d by gons ti4o7 rem was studied at different gon doping amounts the increase of gon doping amount from 0 to 5 0 1 2 and 5 wt resulted in an increase of the apparent rate constant k obs from 7 51 10 3 min 1 to 2 26 10 2min 1 fig 3b the slope of ln k obs against ln doping amounts were 0 25 fig 3c the low reaction order of ln doping amounts indicated that a small amount 1 of gon can improve the oxidation of 1 4 d but more doping amount is not cost effective for further evaluate the desirable durability of the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode a consecutive 15 cycles test was employed as shown in fig s16 the 1 4 d electrooxidation decay rate remained 95 1 in 15 cycles test which much higher than that of the pristine ti4o7 rem electrode at 78 8 to explore the removal efficiency of 1 4 d by eaop in different water matrices the effects of cl and hco3 on 1 4 d degradation were further investigated see text s3 and s17 3 4 application in groundwater and landfill leachate treatments by flow through mode and energy consumption 3 4 1 flow through rem experiments flow by experiments demonstrated that the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode can efficiently remove 1 4 d at a high rate which was similar to that by bdd electrode to further evaluate the application of this technology the flow through mode was tested using natural groundwater spiked with 1 4 d at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 01 mm fig 4 a shows the 1 4 d decay at different applied current density from 1 to 40 ma cm2 with the increasing of applied current density the 1 4 d concentration in the effluent decreased to a greater extent but the effect is less when the current density value was more than 20 ma cm2 when the current density increased from 10 to 20 ma cm2 the removal of 1 4 d increased by about 2 times from 39 7 to 62 4 nevertheless the 1 4 d removal was 70 4 at a current density of 30 ma cm2 in addition when the current density was increased to 40 ma cm2 the 1 4 d removal rate was only 56 2 which was attributed to that o2 bubbles occupied the surface of the electrode the removal of 1 4 d by 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode was 2 times higher than that by pristine ti4o7 rem electrode at the current density of 20 ma cm2 fig 4a these results were consistent to previous studies for example chaplin and co workers reported that doping carbonaceous materials created larger electroactive surface area and quicker mass transfer rate than pristine ti4o7 electrode almassi et al 2019 furthermore to meet the drinking water regulation of under 4 Œºm a two stage modules in series system by flow through mode was employed fig 4b the residual concentration of 1 4 d was decreased to 1 74 Œºm by the second stage of treatment to further assess the application of 1 gons ti4o7 rem to the complex water environment the electrooxidation performance of bio treated landfill leachate spiked with 0 01 mm 1 4 d with flow through mode was employed fig 5 the rem system can be optimized by coordinating the two key parameters of the applied current and the water flux lin et al 2021a both the improvement of applied current and the water flux increased the 1 4 d and toc removal at the water flux of 873 l m 2 h 1 only 20 7 1 4 d and 8 9 toc were removed in a single pass at 5 ma cm2 while the 1 4 d and toc removal rate were decreased by 66 5 and 54 5 respectively at 30 ma cm2 at an applied current of 20 ma cm2 increasing the water flux from 680 l m 2 h 1 to 3072 l m 2 h 1 decreased the 1 4 d and toc removal rate from 62 7 and 40 6 to 17 1 and 12 5 respectively these results showed that the 1 4 d and toc decay rate was the key aspect to explore the mechanism by increasing applied current and reducing water flux for the applied current the decay rate of contaminants was improved with increasing it for example at the water flux of 873 l m 2 h 1 the 1 4 d removal rates were 20 7 36 7 59 6 and 67 1 and the toc removal rates were 9 5 17 6 35 0 and 54 5 for the applied current of 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 20 ma cm2 and 30 ma cm2 respectively fig 5a for the water flux it can affect 1 4 d and toc removal rate and when the water flux is lower than 873 l m 2 h 1 the decrease of water flux does not influence the 1 4 d and toc decay rates for example the 1 4 d removal rates were 63 7 59 6 39 6 and 17 1 and the toc removal rates were 41 3 35 0 23 5 and 12 3 for the water flux of 680 873 1567 and 3072 l m 2 h 1 respectively fig 5b when the water flux is higher than 873 l m 2 h 1 the 1 4 d and toc decay rates were obviously improved with the decreasing of water flux the chlorinated byproducts formation with the flow through mode in dependence of the applied current was investigated fig 5c the cl was oxidized because its concentration in the effluent 1395 6 1448 6 mg l became lower than that in the influent 1650 8 mg l the removed cl can be transformed into hocl clo which might be used for disinfection ganzenko et al 2021 for example clo3 and clo4 were only 5 1 5 8 6 7 and 7 3 of the total loss of cl for the applied current at 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 20 ma cm2 and 30 ma cm2 respectively the formation of clo4 might be hindered by oh scavenging effect that inhibiting the reaction of chlorates with oh these results showed that rem system should be optimized at a suitable applied current for avoiding perchlorate formation moreover the increased nitrate concentration with applied current represented the mineralization of total nitrogen 3 4 2 energy consumption to evaluate the feasibility of applying 1 gons ti4o7 rem to practical treatment the energy consumption of 1 4 d removal was assessed for the flow through mode groundwater with 1 4 d at an initial concentration of 0 01 mm the ee o values were calculated to be 0 2 0 6 kwh m3 for the whole process an analysis of the ee o values for various existing anodes including bdd iro2 ti tio2 irtaox ti ti sb sno2 and ir ruox ti for 1 4 d electrooxidation was performed and details were provided in table s3 the efficiency of eaop mainly depends on the anode material lin et al 2021b the ee o value for the ti sb sno2 anode was about 400 kwh m3 at an initial 1 4 d concentration of 0 11 mm mameda et al 2020 while the ee o value for the bdd anode was 18 6 33 kwh m3 an initial 1 4 d concentration of 1 4 mm choi et al 2010 thanks to the porous structure of ti4o7 based rem thus it can operate with a flow through mode leading to 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode significantly improve the electrooxidation efficiency generally the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode in flow through mode exhibited 2 3 orders of magnitude lower ee o than the other electrodes considering that the much lower capital cost of the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode than bdd electrode and its high efficiency in 1 4 d electrooxidation it is expected to be one of most promising anodes for practical application in 1 4 d removal 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that doping gons into ti4o7 electrode via strong gons o ti bonds provided a superior electrooxidation performance with high oh generation strong electrochemical reactivity and high stability the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode yielded oh at a rate that was 2 5 2 8 times faster than that of pristine ti4o7 rem electrode the charge transfer resistance of electrode decreased by 90 at gon dopant amount of 1 wt the 1 4 d decay rate with 1 gons ti4o7 rem was comparable to that of bdd electrode in addition 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode exhibited high electrochemical stability and durability for 1 4 d removal it can effectively degrade 1 4 d in natural groundwater at flow through mode and the residual concentration of 1 4 d was below drinking water regulation moreover the rem process with the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode is an efficient way to remove

et al 2020 the intensity increase of the ti oh peak of gons ti4o7 rem indicated that gons brought a successive change of the chemical state of the ti lim et al 2019 the spectrum of the ti o showed a declined intensity implying the transfer of electron from ti to o induced by the chemical interactions between these two components in addition no signals of other peaks appeared in the ti 2p spectra suggesting that ti atoms are not directly bonded with carbon and ti4o7 interact with gons through gons o ti bonds the c 1 s spectrum is fitted with four peaks at 284 4 285 1 286 1 286 3 and 286 6 ev fig 1g corresponding to c c c h c oh c o and c ooh bonds respectively for the gons ti4o7 rem the intensity of c oh increased indicating that surface hydroxyl groups displayed prevailingly and the result was similar to those reported in the literature on the ti4o7 electrode doped with carbon based materials xie et al 2020 the shift of be of c o by 0 2 ev toward a higher value indicated the presence gons o ti bonds thus the nano fusion domains with the strong interaction of the chemical bonding between gons and ti4o7 by gons o ti bonds may provide high structural stability and facilitate the electron transfer lim et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 zhao et al 2020 moreover the ftir results were further proving the presence of interactions as shown in fig s6 the peak at 1097 cm 1 on the gons ti4o7 rem were detected owning to the c o ti bond presumido et al 2022 the carbon element came from gons thus it considered to be gons o ti bond the peak at 1158 and 1635 cm 1 was related to c o and c oh bending vibration respectively ding et al 2020 moreover the peak at 3460 cm 1 was according to the asymmetric stretching of hydroxyl groups raman spectra was used to characterize the structural disorder of carbonaceous materials in pristine ti4o7 rem and gons ti4o7 rem anodes containing different amounts gons fig 1h the characteristic d and g peaks at raman shifted from 1332 to 1348 and from 1567 to 1580 cm 1 for the gons doped electrodes duan et al 2016b respectively the i d i g ratio values gradually increased from 1 08 to 1 21 in gons ti4o7 rem as the doping amount of gons increased from 1 to 5 suggesting that higher extent of disorder was created by gon doping xie et al 2020 3 2 electrochemical property reactivity and stability of gons ti4o7 rem 3 2 1 electrochemical reactive sites the cyclic voltammetry cv curves of both pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem were obtained with the scan rate at the range of 5 100 mv s and the current increased with the increase of scan rate fig s7 as shown in fig 2 a the electrical current area of 1 gons ti4o7 rem was about 2 times larger than that of pristine ti4o7 rem suggesting that 1 gons ti4o7 rem has an enhanced electron transfer activity compared with pristine ti4o7 rem the inset in fig 2a shows the linear relationship between the voltammetric charge and the reciprocal square root of scan rate v 1 2 mv1 2 s1 2 by graphical integration method voltammetric charge q mc cm2 represents the number of electroactive sites per area on the electrodes pei et al 2020 which played a significant role on the performance of electrochemical oxidation the slope between q and v 1 2 of 1 gons ti4o7 rem 20 06 was higher than that of pristine ti4o7 rem 12 06 these results demonstrated that 1 gons ti4o7 rem had a large amount of electrochemical reactive sites for electrocatalytic oxidation 3 2 2 interfacial electron transfer eis test was conducted to explore the charge transfer and charge separation on the electrode surface fig 2 b shows the nyquist plots of pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem after fitting the data to an equivalent circuit fig s8 the ohmic resistance r s of 1 gons ti4o7 rem 22 24 œâ was similar to pristine ti4o7 rem 19 12 œâ indicating that homologous configuration of all eaop reactors e g electrode distance and solution conductivity provided the similar ohmic resistance wang et al 2020a notably the charge transfer resistance r ct of 1 gons ti4o7 rem 8 42 œâ was significantly lower than that of pristine ti4o7 rem 73 87 œâ indicating that gon doping decreased the impedance for the electrode this result was attributed to that the increase of oxygen containing functional groups from the oxidation of carbon groups after polarization promoted the interfacial electron transfer xie et al 2020 the higher c oh ratio of the 1 gons ti4o7 rem than that of pristine ti4o7 rem suggested its stronger o2 adsorption of which hydroxyl surface sites may play a significant role in promoting interfacial charge transfer xie et al 2020 high charge transfer rate on the surface of an anode can provide high electrocatalytic performance and then enhance the degradation of organic pollutants in eaop xu et al 2016 carbon nanotubes cnt carbon black cb and graphene nanoplatelets gnp as the dopant have been reported to decrease the interfacial charge transfer resistance almassi et al 2019 xie et al 2020 xu et al 2016 while our study to the best of our knowledge is the first report of ti4o7 electrode doped with gons through strong chemical bond besides a previous study reported that c ooh generation from carbon groups oxidation during long term operation could increase the interfacial resistance and hinder the oxidation process xie et al 2020 however in our study c ooh exhibited no obvious negative effects on interfacial charge transfer which was likely attributed to the different electrode preparation methods gons o ti bonds vs glue bonding 3 2 3 electrochemical reactivity to investigate the oxidation ability det and oh radical oxidation of gons ti4o7 rem in eaop four probes oa cou ta acid and p bq were tested bejan et al 2012 jing and chaplin 2017 xie et al 2020 for det the pseudo first order decay rate k obs oa min 1 of oa increased from 6 9 10 3 to 1 9 10 2 min 1 with the increase of gon amount from 0 to 5 wt fig s9a and s9b the k obs oa exhibited positive linear relationship with the amount of gon dopant r2 0 999 fig s9c indicating that gon doping significantly facilitated det process the increased oxidation rate of oa was likely caused by the enhanced electron charge transfer for gons ti4o7 rem cou and ta were chosen as oh probes because they are resistant to direct oxidation and can react with oh to form known products 7 hydroxy coumarin 7 hcou and 2 hydroxy terephthalic acid 2 hta respectively jing and chaplin 2017 fig 2 c and d shows that the concentrations of produced 7 hcou and 2 hta in 1 gons ti4o7 rem were 2 6 and 2 8 times higher than those of pristine ti4o7 rem respectively indicating the higher oh generating rate of 1 gons ti4o7 rem therefore the chemical bonded interface via gons o ti bonds exhibited strong reactivity to form oh which is prospective for contaminant oxidation fig s10 in addition p bq also reacts readily with oh k oh p bq 1 2 109 m 1s 1 and is highly resistant to direct oxidation bejan et al 2012 after 40 min of reaction 59 9 and 83 5 p bq removal were observed for pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrodes respectively fig 2e which was attributed to oh oxidation these results implied that gon doping can be employed for high in situ production of oh to enhance electrocatalytic oxidation which was consistent with the previous report favaro et al 2015 the structural defects in 1 gons ti4o7 rem by gon doping fig 1h may further promote the transportation of unpaired electrons resulting in positive effects on generating oh zhang et al 2010 3 2 4 electrochemical stability the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode exhibited considerable electrochemical and structural stability in a continuous chronopotentiometry test of 90 h at a current density of 80 ma cm2 the chronopotentiometric curves showed no obvious changes on reaction potential fig 2f indicating that the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode has excellent electrochemical stability xps results of 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode showed no obvious changes on chemical bond before and after 90 h of chronopotentiometry test fig s11 and sem images showed that gons still stably existed in the electrode fig s12 suggesting the strong stability of the chemical bond in 1 gons ti4o7 rem carlo et al reported that go doping could partially passivates the oxygen vacancies defects of tio2 electrode which significantly extended its service lifetime agresti et al 2016 tio2 and ti4o7 have several similar properties and ti4o7 exhibits better conductivity and mineralization performance du et al 2021 go doping may passivate oxygen vacancies defects on ti4o7 crystal surface and hence improve the stability of ti4o7 electrodes the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode exhibited a high stability on oa decay after 90 h polarization operation fig 2g for the pristine ti4o7 rem electrode the oa decay rate decreased from 6 9 10 3 min 1 to 3 7 10 3 min 1 after 90 h polarization however the oa electrooxidation decay rate remained 8 1 8 5 10 3 min 1 after 90 h polarization these results suggested that the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode has an excellent stability and a strong corrosion resistance under anodic conditions in addition a carbon containing materials on the ti4o7 electrodes study with pvdf technology showed that the oxalate electrooxidation decay rate kapp after 96 h were significantly decreased xie et al 2020 that was likely attributed to the strong gons o ti chemical interaction by graphene doped interface engineering strategy could obtain better stability than that of pvdf methods the slight decrease in oa decay rate after 90 h polarization was possibly associated with the gradual deactivation of ti4o7 to less active sub stoichiometric ti n o2 n 1 i e ti5o9 and ti6o11 jing et al 2018 3 3 electrooxidation of 1 4 dioxane 3 3 1 comparison between pristine ti4o7 rem gons ti4o7 rem and bdd electrooxidation ability of 1 gons ti4o7 rem was compared with that of pristine ti4o7 rem and bdd electrode using batch experiments the electro assisted sorption of 1 4 d was negligible 2 4 3 7 removal after 60 min on both pristine ti4o7 rem and 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrodes fig s13 once the current was applied the 1 4 d concentration started to decrease the degradation of 1 4 d followed pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 98 for all three electrodes fig 3 a the decay rate constant of 1 4 d in 1 gons ti4o7 rem k 1 gons ti4o7 rem 1 49 10 2 min 1 was about 2 times faster than that in pristine ti4o7 rem k pristine ti4o7 rem 7 51 10 3 min 1 and similar to bdd k bdd 1 79 10 2 min 1 1 4 d 1 mm was removed by 95 after 6 h for the pristine ti4o7 rem but 3 h for 1 gons ti4o7 rem and bdd fig s14 the 1 4 d decay rate constant for the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode was increased by approximately the same magnitude as the increase of oh yield suggesting that the increase of 1 4 d removal by gon doping may be attributed to the increase of oh production to identify the degradation pathway for 1 4 d radical quenching tests were conducted the results demonstrated that free radicals were dominantly responsible for 1 4 d degradation details shown in text s2 and fig s15 3 3 2 effect of gon doping amounts electrooxidation of 1 4 d by gons ti4o7 rem was studied at different gon doping amounts the increase of gon doping amount from 0 to 5 0 1 2 and 5 wt resulted in an increase of the apparent rate constant k obs from 7 51 10 3 min 1 to 2 26 10 2min 1 fig 3b the slope of ln k obs against ln doping amounts were 0 25 fig 3c the low reaction order of ln doping amounts indicated that a small amount 1 of gon can improve the oxidation of 1 4 d but more doping amount is not cost effective for further evaluate the desirable durability of the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode a consecutive 15 cycles test was employed as shown in fig s16 the 1 4 d electrooxidation decay rate remained 95 1 in 15 cycles test which much higher than that of the pristine ti4o7 rem electrode at 78 8 to explore the removal efficiency of 1 4 d by eaop in different water matrices the effects of cl and hco3 on 1 4 d degradation were further investigated see text s3 and s17 3 4 application in groundwater and landfill leachate treatments by flow through mode and energy consumption 3 4 1 flow through rem experiments flow by experiments demonstrated that the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode can efficiently remove 1 4 d at a high rate which was similar to that by bdd electrode to further evaluate the application of this technology the flow through mode was tested using natural groundwater spiked with 1 4 d at environmentally relevant concentrations 0 01 mm fig 4 a shows the 1 4 d decay at different applied current density from 1 to 40 ma cm2 with the increasing of applied current density the 1 4 d concentration in the effluent decreased to a greater extent but the effect is less when the current density value was more than 20 ma cm2 when the current density increased from 10 to 20 ma cm2 the removal of 1 4 d increased by about 2 times from 39 7 to 62 4 nevertheless the 1 4 d removal was 70 4 at a current density of 30 ma cm2 in addition when the current density was increased to 40 ma cm2 the 1 4 d removal rate was only 56 2 which was attributed to that o2 bubbles occupied the surface of the electrode the removal of 1 4 d by 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode was 2 times higher than that by pristine ti4o7 rem electrode at the current density of 20 ma cm2 fig 4a these results were consistent to previous studies for example chaplin and co workers reported that doping carbonaceous materials created larger electroactive surface area and quicker mass transfer rate than pristine ti4o7 electrode almassi et al 2019 furthermore to meet the drinking water regulation of under 4 Œºm a two stage modules in series system by flow through mode was employed fig 4b the residual concentration of 1 4 d was decreased to 1 74 Œºm by the second stage of treatment to further assess the application of 1 gons ti4o7 rem to the complex water environment the electrooxidation performance of bio treated landfill leachate spiked with 0 01 mm 1 4 d with flow through mode was employed fig 5 the rem system can be optimized by coordinating the two key parameters of the applied current and the water flux lin et al 2021a both the improvement of applied current and the water flux increased the 1 4 d and toc removal at the water flux of 873 l m 2 h 1 only 20 7 1 4 d and 8 9 toc were removed in a single pass at 5 ma cm2 while the 1 4 d and toc removal rate were decreased by 66 5 and 54 5 respectively at 30 ma cm2 at an applied current of 20 ma cm2 increasing the water flux from 680 l m 2 h 1 to 3072 l m 2 h 1 decreased the 1 4 d and toc removal rate from 62 7 and 40 6 to 17 1 and 12 5 respectively these results showed that the 1 4 d and toc decay rate was the key aspect to explore the mechanism by increasing applied current and reducing water flux for the applied current the decay rate of contaminants was improved with increasing it for example at the water flux of 873 l m 2 h 1 the 1 4 d removal rates were 20 7 36 7 59 6 and 67 1 and the toc removal rates were 9 5 17 6 35 0 and 54 5 for the applied current of 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 20 ma cm2 and 30 ma cm2 respectively fig 5a for the water flux it can affect 1 4 d and toc removal rate and when the water flux is lower than 873 l m 2 h 1 the decrease of water flux does not influence the 1 4 d and toc decay rates for example the 1 4 d removal rates were 63 7 59 6 39 6 and 17 1 and the toc removal rates were 41 3 35 0 23 5 and 12 3 for the water flux of 680 873 1567 and 3072 l m 2 h 1 respectively fig 5b when the water flux is higher than 873 l m 2 h 1 the 1 4 d and toc decay rates were obviously improved with the decreasing of water flux the chlorinated byproducts formation with the flow through mode in dependence of the applied current was investigated fig 5c the cl was oxidized because its concentration in the effluent 1395 6 1448 6 mg l became lower than that in the influent 1650 8 mg l the removed cl can be transformed into hocl clo which might be used for disinfection ganzenko et al 2021 for example clo3 and clo4 were only 5 1 5 8 6 7 and 7 3 of the total loss of cl for the applied current at 5 ma cm2 10 ma cm2 20 ma cm2 and 30 ma cm2 respectively the formation of clo4 might be hindered by oh scavenging effect that inhibiting the reaction of chlorates with oh these results showed that rem system should be optimized at a suitable applied current for avoiding perchlorate formation moreover the increased nitrate concentration with applied current represented the mineralization of total nitrogen 3 4 2 energy consumption to evaluate the feasibility of applying 1 gons ti4o7 rem to practical treatment the energy consumption of 1 4 d removal was assessed for the flow through mode groundwater with 1 4 d at an initial concentration of 0 01 mm the ee o values were calculated to be 0 2 0 6 kwh m3 for the whole process an analysis of the ee o values for various existing anodes including bdd iro2 ti tio2 irtaox ti ti sb sno2 and ir ruox ti for 1 4 d electrooxidation was performed and details were provided in table s3 the efficiency of eaop mainly depends on the anode material lin et al 2021b the ee o value for the ti sb sno2 anode was about 400 kwh m3 at an initial 1 4 d concentration of 0 11 mm mameda et al 2020 while the ee o value for the bdd anode was 18 6 33 kwh m3 an initial 1 4 d concentration of 1 4 mm choi et al 2010 thanks to the porous structure of ti4o7 based rem thus it can operate with a flow through mode leading to 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode significantly improve the electrooxidation efficiency generally the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode in flow through mode exhibited 2 3 orders of magnitude lower ee o than the other electrodes considering that the much lower capital cost of the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode than bdd electrode and its high efficiency in 1 4 d electrooxidation it is expected to be one of most promising anodes for practical application in 1 4 d removal 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that doping gons into ti4o7 electrode via strong gons o ti bonds provided a superior electrooxidation performance with high oh generation strong electrochemical reactivity and high stability the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode yielded oh at a rate that was 2 5 2 8 times faster than that of pristine ti4o7 rem electrode the charge transfer resistance of electrode decreased by 90 at gon dopant amount of 1 wt the 1 4 d decay rate with 1 gons ti4o7 rem was comparable to that of bdd electrode in addition 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode exhibited high electrochemical stability and durability for 1 4 d removal it can effectively degrade 1 4 d in natural groundwater at flow through mode and the residual concentration of 1 4 d was below drinking water regulation moreover the rem process with the 1 gons ti4o7 rem electrode is an efficient way to remove refractory organics in landfill leachate this work provided insight on chemical bonded interface engineering strategy for boosting eaop performance of ti4o7 electrodes with outstanding reactivity and

transformation products oxidants 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment has been the most widely implemented technology to reduce the organic pollutant loads in municipal and livestock wastewater however inefficient elimination or even production of micropollutants and transformation products mtps in existing plants have led to contamination of surface water patel et al 2019 therefore environmental concerns have led to demand for post treatments but conventional tertiary treatments using ozone and activated carbon kosek et al 2020 impose additional costs to this end electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been increasingly deployed to directly treat domestic and industrial wastewater moreira et al 2017 in particular electrochemical activation of hydrogen peroxide eahp also known as electrochemical peroxidation brillas et al 2009 could be a viable option to reduce the total organic carbon toc in high strength wastewaters olvera vargas et al

specific target micropollutants olvera vargas et al 2021 oturan et al 2015 whereas a minor body of literature considered transformation products and effluent toxicity in relation with the oxidants speciation the fates of mtps during wastewater treatment have mostly been monitored using targeted analyses but incompletely catch the evolution of contaminants i e only a subset of mtps is considered partly due to a lack of available reference materials n√ºrenberg et al 2019 therefore unexpected mtps and oxidation by products could be overlooked and enable their release into water sources these limitations could be circumvented by non target screening nts that utilizes liquid gas chromatography mass spectrometry lc gc ms hollender et al 2017 yang et al 2019 case in point nts could be used for the identification of previously unknown mtps and by products and provide a more complete assessment of water treatment effectiveness than targeted analyses choi et al 2021 parry and young 2016 postigo et al 2021 these merits have intensified calls for the inclusion of nts in existing water monitoring regulations lai et al 2021 moreover nts complements targeted analyses to prioritize the

nist 2008 ms libraries with a minimum match factor of 80 in this study well known compounds e g linear chain carboxylic acids were not reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of primary reactive species it is now widely accepted that both the so4 and feivo2 are the primary reactive species generated in fe ii persulfate process eqs 4 and 5 in table 2 with ho as a secondary reactive species produced from the reaction of so4 with h2o in neutral to acidic solutions eq 11 in table 2 dong et al 2020 to confirm this in the eap probe and quenching experiments were firstly done in 25 mm naclo4 background electrolytes to preclude the formation of other secondary reactive species e g rcs based on nb and ba degradation fig 1 a raw data in fig s2a the ho ss 1 14 10 13 m and so4 ss 1 97 10 13 m were consistent with the literature i e so4 is the dominant radical species in persulfate activation under acidic to neutral ph conditions dong et al 2020 these radical species generation was supported by the progressive conversion of dmso to formaldehyde fig s2b and the relative inhibitory effects of tba ho scavenger and br ho so4 scavenger on the dmpo adducts signal intensities fig s2c during the fe ii persulfate reaction dong et al 2020 changing the persulfate delivery mode to batch addition moderately enhanced the generation of radical species fig s2d because of the known shift in oxidants speciation from feivo2 to ho so4 at high persulfate fe ii molar ratios dong et al 2020 the oxidation of pmso to pmso2 indicated the production of feivo2 fig 1b with the feivo2 ss 8 03 10 9 m fig s2e text s4 was about four orders of magnitude greater than ho ss and so4 ss the identification of feivo2 was corroborated by the inhibitory effects of dmso 1 26 105 m s etoh 2 51 103 m s and tba 6 0 101 m s in pmso2 formation fig s2f wang et al 2018 the probe degradations by eap were also performed in synthetic municipal and livestock wastewater matrices to assess the speciation of oxidants fig 1a raw data in fig s3 that were identified in naclo4 electrolytes vide supra in contrast to naclo4 solutions the ho was the dominant radical species in synthetic wastewater fig 1a this was concurrent with the inhibited pmso2 generation fig 1c alluding to lower feivo2 ss it was previously reported that organic chelators e g polycarboxylates amino carboxylates could promote the generation of so4 ho at the expense of feivo2 wang et al 2019 with ho as the dominant radical species han et al 2015 meanwhile the ho ss estimates fig 1a and pmso2 formation rates fig 1d e in municipal and livestock wastewater were lower than those obtained from the naclo4 electrolyte and synthetic wastewater which could be explained by the competition between organic matter and fe ii for the persulfate fig s4a nevertheless the so4 ss in municipal wastewater was even greater than in naclo4 electrolyte a difference that could be ascribed to the activation of persulfate by the quinone moieties of humic substances that is abundant in environmental samples fang et al 2013 this phenomenon was not observed in livestock wastewater due to the fast conversion of so4 to cl eq 13 in table 2 by a relatively high cl table 1 to verify the radical scavenging effect of cl probe experiments in naclo4 electrolytes containing variable cl were conducted fig 1 f shows that elevated cl gave a more profound decrease in so4 ss than ho ss the one electron transfer from cl by so4 cl generation is ph independent eq 13 in table 2 whereas the ph dependent conversion of ho to cl is only significant at ph 3 eq 14 in table 2 von gunten 2003 therefore the high cl in livestock wastewater could shift the speciation of radicals away from so4 e0 nhe 2 60 v and towards rcs eqs 13 and 15 24 in table 2 such as cl e0 nhe 2 41 v cl2 e0 nhe 2 09 v and cl2 e0 nhe 1 36 v during eap resulting in reduced mineralization efficiency and formation of chlorinated by products lee et al 2020 in comparison feivo2 reacts negligibly with cl jacobsen et al 1998 in eafc experiments 25 mm naclo4 ph 3 0 degradation was more facile for nb than for ba fig 2 a in agreement with the reactivity trend towards feivo2 1050 m s for nb and 80 m s for ba in comparison ho attacks both nb 4 7 109 m s and ba 4 3 109 m s with comparable reactivity while cl selectively reacts with ba 1 8 1010 m s the failure of tba to inhibit the degradation of nb and ba fig 2b confirmed that ho and cl eqs 6 and 7 in table 2 insignificantly contribute to the organic matter oxidation although the relative inhibitory effects of tba and dmso on the dmpo ho adduct signal intensities at equimolar fe ii and free chlorine revealed the generation of both ho and feivo2 fig s5a the molar excess of free chlorine free chlorine fe ii 1 7 utilized in optimum electrochemical reaction conditions could scavenge ho 2 109 m s during the eafc process mart√≠nez huitle and ferro 2006 the stoichiometric conversion of pmso to pmso2 fig 2c in eafc was inhibited by etoh or t buoh fig s5b also indicating that the fe ii hocl couple effectively generates feivo2 eq 8 in table 2 folkes et al 1995 estimated feivo2 ss was 8 13 10 8 m fig s5c text s4 which was an order of magnitude greater than in eap as expected feivo2 generation was diminished fig 2d f in wastewater samples due to the consumption of free cl2 by organic and nitrogenous compounds fig s4b the molar yield of pmso2 was noticeably lower in municipal wastewater with the highest nh3 which alluded formation of other reactive species such as amino radical nh2 from a fe ii catalyzed decomposition of chloramines vikesland and valentine 2000 the most efficient degradation of nb and conversion of dmso to formaldehyde fig s6a b in eahp 25 mm naclo4 ph 3 0 demonstrated the primary function of ho eq 9 in table 2 as in other fenton like eaops brillas et al 2009 the ho ss estimate 6 8 10 13 m was about seven times higher than in eap regardless of the electrolyte with variable cl fig 3 a the pseudo first order degradation rates of ba and nb revealed that increase in cl marginally lowered ho ss without a noticeable build up of cl instead an increase in cl from 30 to 500 mm caused a sharp decrease in cl ss fig 3b by conversion to cl2 which is less reactive than cl the rcs speciation was further investigated using caffeine caf whose degradation rate by rcs kcaf rcs in fig 3c text s4 was compatible with the trend of cl ss fig 3b this behavior was ascribed to the dominance of cl kcaf cl 3 87 1010 m s in cl up to 50 mm at cl 50 mm cl could be converted to cl2 kcaf cl2 9 28 108 m s and this change would decrease the oxidation rate of caf wu et al 2019b density functional theory calculations have suggested that feivo2 is a more energetically favorable product than ho in homogeneous fenton processes at ph 2 2 4 6 eq 10 in table 2 although experimental evidence suggested ho and not feivo2 is generated lee et al 2013 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the eahp in this study led to a continuous loss of pmso without generation of pmso2 fig 3d and identical inhibitory effects of tba and dmso ho and feivo2 quencher on the dmpo ho adduct signal intensity fig s2c during the fe ii h2o2 reaction fig s6c this result ruled out the involvement of feivo2 and was consistent with comparable systems that maintain a low steady state fe ii such as zero valent iron h2o2 at ph 3 0 wang et al 2020 although heterogeneous fenton was recently shown to generate both ho and feivo2 this phenomenon is yet to be investigated for electrochemical fenton based processes chen et al 2021 3 2 process optimization pareto charts and contour diagrams determined the main and interactive effects of operational parameters on the toc removal in synthetic wastewater analysis details in text s6 and model adequacy in table s7 current density had a strong influence on toc removal in eap fig 4 a the positive standardized effect 2 6 coupled with the negative quadratic term 4 8 suggests ambivalent roles of current density provided that the current density dictated the rate of fe ii release from the anode fig s1a an optimal ratio of persulfate to fe ii would exist to maximize the steady state concentrations of ho so4 and feivo2 wang et al 2020 in this study the optimal fe ii release rate 0 12 mmol min corresponded to a current density of 26 5 ma cm2 fig s7a the deterioration of toc removal at current densities 26 5 ma cm2 could be ascribed to the quenching of reactive oxidants by excess fe ii hou et al 2021 a high persulfate dose 0 12 mmol min increased toc removal as indicated by a positive standardized effect 2 8 the high persulfate fe ii could shift the speciation from feivo2 to relatively nonselective ho so4 dong et al 2020 to accelerate mineralization thus the negative interaction ab 3 5 fig s8 between persulfate dose and current density would be primarily attributed to the scavenging effects of fe ii consequently a molar dose ratio of persulfate fe ii 1 was found to maximize the toc removal in eap and this result was compatible with the previous reports wu et al 2019a in eafc fig 4b both the free chlorine input and current density showed positive standardized effects 5 8 and 4 1 and negative quadratic terms 3 2 and 2 4 which would necessitate precise process control the more significant positive effects of free chlorine dose would be associated with the generation of feivo2 and direct reactions of free chlorine with nitrogenous organic compounds and nh3 however excessive free chlorine could reduce the toc removal due to quenching of feivo2 and generation of chlorinated organic matter which is known more recalcitrant to the mineralization than mother compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 similarly fe ii could serve both as source and scavenger of feivo2 whereas a disproportionation of excess feivo2 to fe iii could be another reason for the negative effects of current density a large stoichiometric excess of free chlorine free chlorine fe ii 1 7 mol mol at 37 4 ma cm2 0 17 mmol fe min could maximize the toc removal in eafc because of side reactions consuming free chlorine by nitrogenous organic matter fe ii fe iii oxides could catalyze the decomposition of chlorinated peptides and amino acids into nitrogen centered radicals rnh rnh2 ultimately leading to decarboxylation hawkins and davies 1998 vikesland and valentine 2000 the eahp effectiveness was exclusively dependent on quasi linear effects of current density 15 3 which monotonically increased toc removal by increasing fe ii supply fig 4c the effects of h2o2 dose and higher order factor interactions were insignificant these results could partly be explained by the disproportionately large dose of h2o2 in this study h2o2 fe ii 1 7 3 mol mol the h2o2 fe ii near 1 current density 45 ma cm2 h2o2 dose 0 20 mmol min was determined to be optimal for eahp consistent with other eaops that use fenton reactions and that have an optimal h2o2 0 fe ii range of 0 7 2 mol mol brillas et al 2009 moussavi and aghanejad 2014 shin et al 2017 eahp operation beyond these experimental bounds could entail wasteful consumption of reagents and electricity e g ho scavenging by h2o2 and h2o2 decomposition accelerated by ohmic heat brillas et al 2009 olvera vargas et al 2019 marginal variations in toc removal were reported previously in an electro fenton process under h2o2 fe ii 1 10 mol mol olvera vargas et al 2019 3 3 toc cod and tn degradation in synthetic and real wastewater the toc and cod reduction in the municipal livestock wastewater samples fig 5 could be understood by the reactivity of the identified primary oxidants the eahp almost always provided the best toc removals as a result of the strong oxidation power of ho generated by fenton chemistry the efficient cod removal greatly contributed to decreasing the operational cost of eahp i e the lowest operational cost among the eaops investigated table s8 details in text s7 moreover the toc and cod removal efficiency in eahp were relatively independent on the wastewater type particularly being tolerant to an elevated cl in the environmental samples the eap was less efficient than eahp due to lower yields of ho and the concurrent formation of so4 feivo2 with the latter depending highly on the electrolyte composition fig 1a toc degradation rates in eap were inconsistent with the estimated ho ss and so4 ss fig 1a this result signifies the importance of organic matter composition types of functional moieties and molecular weight among others deng and zhao 2015 the mineralization rate in synthetic wastewater was notably lower than in real wastewater despite the higher ho ss in synthetic samples the nitrogenous organic matter enriched in the synthetic wastewater would be recalcitrant toward ho so4 in an acidic ph because protonated amine groups are less reactive than the conjugate base forms in comparison toc abatement by eafc was inferior to eahp and eap in environmental samples but comparable to eahp in the synthetic wastewater the abundant nitrogenous organic compounds in synthetic wastewater benefitted the mineralization in eafc owing to facile reactions of rcs with the nitrogenous moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 however the selective natures of feivo2 and free chlorine could bring about accumulations of partially oxidized and chlorinated reaction intermediates that are recalcitrant to complete mineralization monotonic increases in carbon oxidation number in eafc fig s10 text s8 supported the proposition that mineralization is retarded in real wastewater samples eap consistently showed inferior cod degradation efficiency than eafc and eahp fig 5b the feivo2 one of the primary oxidants in eap is a weak oxidant with bimolecular rate constants several orders of magnitude smaller than ho so4 towards major constituents such as carboxylic acids alcohols and carbonyls table s10 in contrast free chlorine itself was involved in organic matter oxidation in eafc to provide a significant cod reduction in agreement with fig s4b and optimal free chlorine fe ii ratio far exceeding 1 likewise only eafc led to appreciable tn degradation with almost complete removals in real wastewater samples fig 5c the facile transformation of n functionalities to n2 by rcs was expected by breakpoint chlorination whereas oxidation by ho and so4 could generate inorganic n species such as ammonia nitrite and nitrate chen et al 2019 3 4 removal of mtps in municipal and livestock wastewater our eaops with sacrificial steel anode as alternatives to existing biological methods guaranteed overall effective removal of mtps such as carbamazepine and valsartan table 3 widely known pharmaceuticals and their metabolites such as fexofenadine tramadol fenofibric acid and dextrorphan were mostly eliminated although they are recalcitrant to the conventional biological processes table s11 pilocarpine and tranexamic acid rarely reported in the literature could be fully converted as well the oxidant type specific removal of a subset of compounds could be again rationalized by the primary reactive species involved for example progesterone was eliminated in eap and eahp but was even produced during eafc treatment of municipal wastewater the radical species involved in eap so4 cl and eahp ho could eliminate the progesterone whereas free chlorine is non reactive to it deborde et al 2004 conjugated forms of progesterone could predominate over the free form kjeld et al 1980 the degradation of which by free chlorine and possibly by feivo2 could release free progesterone to yield the negative removal in eafc tranexamic acid which is mostly 95 excreted in free form pilbrant et al 1981 could be naturally bound to proteins e g plasminogen thus effective destruction of proteinaceous compounds in eafc would explain the apparently inefficient removal of tranexamic acid betaxolol and acetanilide were removed less efficiently by eap particularly in livestock wastewater elevated cl in livestock wastewater could efficiently convert so4 to cl and cl2 in eap the bimolecular rate constants of acetanilide betaxolol and other Œ≤ blockers with so4 kso4 3 6 109 3 0 1010 m s and ho kho 5 2 8 39 109 m s are orders of magnitude larger than cl2 kcl2 2 107 5 07 108 m s lei et al 2019 neta et al 1988 tay and ismail 2016 in comparison strong electron donating groups e g phenyl pyrrole attached to the benzene ring could increase the reactivity towards cl2 cativiela and garcia 1990 lei et al 2019 as exemplified by the effective removal of indole in eap the degradation of 12 oxophytodienoic acid was markedly efficient by eahp especially in municipal wastewater owing to significantly larger ho ss fig 3a than in livestock wastewater however the quenching of so4 and feivo2 in livestock wastewater deteriorated its removal by eap and eafc long chain fatty acids and esters such as docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester can form micelles in aqueous solutions reducing the availability of electron rich hydrophobic tails to short lived oxidants such as so4 and ho trellu et al 2017 on the contrary selective and long lived oxidants such as free chlorine and feivo2 in eafc could be more effective for the degradation of docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester as in the cases of ozone and h2o2 dos santos et al 2015 trellu et al 2017 than in eap and eahp 3 5 evolutions of by products and toxicity both eafc and eap produced several halogenated by products table 4 which should increase the toxicity of the effluent the by products formation in eafc was expected deborde and von gunten 2008 whereas rcs generation from reactions between so4 and cl could lead to significant chlorination of electron rich moieties also in eap zhang and parker 2018 in contrast reaction products in eahp effluents were devoid of chlorinated by products and were dominated by partially oxidized carboxylic acids again the ho ss in eahp was marginally scavenged by cl i e ho ss cl ss 6 5 7 7 mol mol in our experimental conditions ecosar estimates suggested that some of the by products can cause acute toxicity table 4 most were classified as hazardous to the aquatic environment by consulting the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals u n 2019 nevertheless these estimations should be interpreted as a guideline only because the toxicity is affected by numerous parameters biodegradability and bioavailability of the toxicants bioaccumulation potential and interactions among the toxicants and other aqueous constituents and can vary widely among species of test organism u n 2019 in this study thus the effluent toxicity was evaluated by comparing inhibition of the dha activity of b megaterium dha inhibition of 10 was used as a criterion for toxicity mansor and tay 2020 effluents from eap and eafc were toxic fig 6 due to the halogenated by products both for municipal and livestock wastewater the notably higher effluent toxicity in eafc could be associated with the formation of 1 3 dichloro 2 propanone dichlorobromonitromethane and dibromochloronitromethane with substantial ecotoxicity table 4 relatively high steady state concentrations of rcs in eafc could oxidize br to hobr or other reactive bromine species to generate the brominated by products that were exclusively detected in eafc the brominated compounds can be at least as toxic as their chlorinated analogs wagner and plewa 2017 specifically the estimated cytotoxicity of dichlorobromonitromethane and dibromochloronitromethane were two to three orders of magnitude higher than regulated disinfection by products dbps such as chloroform and haloacetic acids wagner and plewa 2017 aromatic by products were identified in this study for eap and eafc including furanone 2 6 dichloro 4 methylphenol 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzaldehyde 1 4 dichloro 2 2 chloroethyl benzene 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone have been overlooked in previous reports on targeted analyses these dbps with or without halogenation have even higher ecotoxicological potentials than dichlorobromonitromethane and dibromochloronitromethane based on ecosar using aquatic organisms table 4 aromatic dbps can undergo further transformations e g ring opening side chain cleavage to potentially more toxic aliphatic forms such as haloacetaldehydes and haloacetamides liu et al 2020 consequently the lack of halogenated by products in the non target analysis coupled with the dha inhibition assay collectively confirmed that eahp effluents are relatively non toxic 4 conclusions this study comparatively evaluated eap eafc and eahp for potential applications in centralized municipal and livestock wastewater treatment plants primary conclusions include ho so4 and feivo2 species were concurrently generated in eap whereas ho and feivo2 were the primary oxidants in eahp and eafc respectively the rsm was used to optimize the oxidant dose and current density as the oxidant dose fe ii ratios of 1 1 7 and 1 for eap eafc and eahp respectively the nts identified the evolution of mtps and by products formation partly overlooked in previous targeted analyses which could be coupled with bioassays to assess the effluent toxicity applications of eafc and eap should be avoided in the presence of halide ions pronouncedly in livestock wastewater due to halogenated by products generations despite an efficient tn removal only noted in eafc brominated by products generation in eafc posed a greater ecotoxicological risk than eap the eahp achieved the best mtp removal and effective toc cod degradation which were relatively independent of the halide ions in wastewater eahp had the lowest effluent toxicity with a lack of halogenated by products and therefore could be the best alternative to the existing biological wastewater treatment plants declaration of competing interest

transformation products oxidants 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment has been the most widely implemented technology to reduce the organic pollutant loads in municipal and livestock wastewater however inefficient elimination or even production of micropollutants and transformation products mtps in existing plants have led to contamination of surface water patel et al 2019 therefore environmental concerns have led to demand for post treatments but conventional tertiary treatments using ozone and activated carbon kosek et al 2020 impose additional costs to this end electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops have been increasingly deployed to directly treat domestic and industrial wastewater moreira et al 2017 in particular electrochemical activation of hydrogen peroxide eahp also known as electrochemical peroxidation brillas et al 2009 could be a viable option to reduce the total organic carbon toc in high strength wastewaters olvera vargas et al

specific target micropollutants olvera vargas et al 2021 oturan et al 2015 whereas a minor body of literature considered transformation products and effluent toxicity in relation with the oxidants speciation the fates of mtps during wastewater treatment have mostly been monitored using targeted analyses but incompletely catch the evolution of contaminants i e only a subset of mtps is considered partly due to a lack of available reference materials n√ºrenberg et al 2019 therefore unexpected mtps and oxidation by products could be overlooked and enable their release into water sources these limitations could be circumvented by non target screening nts that utilizes liquid gas chromatography mass spectrometry lc gc ms hollender et al 2017 yang et al 2019 case in point nts could be used for the identification of previously unknown mtps and by products and provide a more complete assessment of water treatment effectiveness than targeted analyses choi et al 2021 parry and young 2016

line and ion source temperature were 300 and 200 c respectively jinya et al 2011 the mass spectrometer was operated in full scan mode with a mass range of 45 450 amu detection was conducted with a solvent delay time of 3 min by products peaks were detected and identified using the automated mass spectral deconvolution and identification system amdis integrated into the chemstation software agilent the amdis deconvolution settings were adjacent peak subtraction 1 resolution low sensitivity very low shape requirements high the deconvoluted spectra were referenced to the wiley 8th edition nist 2008 ms libraries with a minimum match factor of 80 in this study well known compounds e g linear chain carboxylic acids were not reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of primary reactive species it is now widely accepted that both the so4 and feivo2 are the primary reactive species generated in fe ii persulfate process eqs 4 and 5 in table 2 with ho as a secondary reactive species produced from the reaction of so4 with h2o in neutral to acidic solutions eq 11 in table 2 dong et al 2020 to confirm this in the eap probe and quenching experiments were firstly done in 25 mm naclo4 background electrolytes to preclude the formation of other secondary reactive species e g rcs based on nb and ba degradation fig 1 a raw data in fig s2a the ho ss 1 14 10 13 m and so4 ss 1 97 10 13 m were consistent with the literature i e so4 is the dominant radical species in persulfate activation under acidic to neutral ph conditions dong et al 2020 these radical species generation was supported by the progressive conversion of dmso to formaldehyde fig s2b and the relative inhibitory effects of tba ho scavenger and br ho so4 scavenger on the dmpo adducts signal intensities fig s2c during the fe ii persulfate reaction dong et al 2020 changing the persulfate delivery mode to batch addition moderately enhanced the generation of radical species fig s2d because of the known shift in oxidants speciation from feivo2 to ho so4 at high persulfate fe ii molar ratios dong et al 2020 the oxidation of pmso to pmso2 indicated the production of feivo2 fig 1b with the feivo2 ss 8 03 10 9 m fig s2e text s4 was about four orders of magnitude greater than ho ss and so4 ss the identification of feivo2 was corroborated by the inhibitory effects of dmso 1 26 105 m s etoh 2 51 103 m s and tba 6 0 101 m s in pmso2 formation fig s2f wang et al 2018 the probe degradations by eap were also performed in synthetic municipal and livestock wastewater matrices to assess the speciation of oxidants fig 1a raw data in fig s3 that were identified in naclo4 electrolytes vide supra in contrast to naclo4 solutions the ho was the dominant radical species in synthetic wastewater fig 1a this was concurrent with the inhibited pmso2 generation fig 1c alluding to lower feivo2 ss it was previously reported that organic chelators e g polycarboxylates amino carboxylates could promote the generation of so4 ho at the expense of feivo2 wang et al 2019 with ho as the dominant radical species han et al 2015 meanwhile the ho ss estimates fig 1a and pmso2 formation rates fig 1d e in municipal and livestock wastewater were lower than those obtained from the naclo4 electrolyte and synthetic wastewater which could be explained by the competition between organic matter and fe ii for the persulfate fig s4a nevertheless the so4 ss in municipal wastewater was even greater than in naclo4 electrolyte a difference that could be ascribed to the activation of persulfate by the quinone moieties of humic substances that is abundant in environmental samples fang et al 2013 this phenomenon was not observed in livestock wastewater due to the fast conversion of so4 to cl eq 13 in table 2 by a relatively high cl table 1 to verify the radical scavenging effect of cl probe experiments in naclo4 electrolytes containing variable cl were conducted fig 1 f shows that elevated cl gave a more profound decrease in so4 ss than ho ss the one electron transfer from cl by so4 cl generation is ph independent eq 13 in table 2 whereas the ph dependent conversion of ho to cl is only significant at ph 3 eq 14 in table 2 von gunten 2003 therefore the high cl in livestock wastewater could shift the speciation of radicals away from so4 e0 nhe 2 60 v and towards rcs eqs 13 and 15 24 in table 2 such as cl e0 nhe 2 41 v cl2 e0 nhe 2 09 v and cl2 e0 nhe 1 36 v during eap resulting in reduced mineralization efficiency and formation of chlorinated by products lee et al 2020 in comparison feivo2 reacts negligibly with cl jacobsen et al 1998 in eafc experiments 25 mm naclo4 ph 3 0 degradation was more facile for nb than for ba fig 2 a in agreement with the reactivity trend towards feivo2 1050 m s for nb and 80 m s for ba in comparison ho attacks both nb 4 7 109 m s and ba 4 3 109 m s with comparable reactivity while cl selectively reacts with ba 1 8 1010 m s the failure of tba to inhibit the degradation of nb and ba fig 2b confirmed that ho and cl eqs 6 and 7 in table 2 insignificantly contribute to the organic matter oxidation although the relative inhibitory effects of tba and dmso on the dmpo ho adduct signal intensities at equimolar fe ii and free chlorine revealed the generation of both ho and feivo2 fig s5a the molar excess of free chlorine free chlorine fe ii 1 7 utilized in optimum electrochemical reaction conditions could scavenge ho 2 109 m s during the eafc process mart√≠nez huitle and ferro 2006 the stoichiometric conversion of pmso to pmso2 fig 2c in eafc was inhibited by etoh or t buoh fig s5b also indicating that the fe ii hocl couple effectively generates feivo2 eq 8 in table 2 folkes et al 1995 estimated feivo2 ss was 8 13 10 8 m fig s5c text s4 which was an order of magnitude greater than in eap as expected feivo2 generation was diminished fig 2d f in wastewater samples due to the consumption of free cl2 by organic and nitrogenous compounds fig s4b the molar yield of pmso2 was noticeably lower in municipal wastewater with the highest nh3 which alluded formation of other reactive species such as amino radical nh2 from a fe ii catalyzed decomposition of chloramines vikesland and valentine 2000 the most efficient degradation of nb and conversion of dmso to formaldehyde fig s6a b in eahp 25 mm naclo4 ph 3 0 demonstrated the primary function of ho eq 9 in table 2 as in other fenton like eaops brillas et al 2009 the ho ss estimate 6 8 10 13 m was about seven times higher than in eap regardless of the electrolyte with variable cl fig 3 a the pseudo first order degradation rates of ba and nb revealed that increase in cl marginally lowered ho ss without a noticeable build up of cl instead an increase in cl from 30 to 500 mm caused a sharp decrease in cl ss fig 3b by conversion to cl2 which is less reactive than cl the rcs speciation was further investigated using caffeine caf whose degradation rate by rcs kcaf rcs in fig 3c text s4 was compatible with the trend of cl ss fig 3b this behavior was ascribed to the dominance of cl kcaf cl 3 87 1010 m s in cl up to 50 mm at cl 50 mm cl could be converted to cl2 kcaf cl2 9 28 108 m s and this change would decrease the oxidation rate of caf wu et al 2019b density functional theory calculations have suggested that feivo2 is a more energetically favorable product than ho in homogeneous fenton processes at ph 2 2 4 6 eq 10 in table 2 although experimental evidence suggested ho and not feivo2 is generated lee et al 2013 lu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the eahp in this study led to a continuous loss of pmso without generation of pmso2 fig 3d and identical inhibitory effects of tba and dmso ho and feivo2 quencher on the dmpo ho adduct signal intensity fig s2c during the fe ii h2o2 reaction fig s6c this result ruled out the involvement of feivo2 and was consistent with comparable systems that maintain a low steady state fe ii such as zero valent iron h2o2 at ph 3 0 wang et al 2020 although heterogeneous fenton was recently shown to generate both ho and feivo2 this phenomenon is yet to be investigated for electrochemical fenton based processes chen et al 2021 3 2 process optimization pareto charts and contour diagrams determined the main and interactive effects of operational parameters on the toc removal in synthetic wastewater analysis details in text s6 and model adequacy in table s7 current density had a strong influence on toc removal in eap fig 4 a the positive standardized effect 2 6 coupled with the negative quadratic term 4 8 suggests ambivalent roles of current density provided that the current density dictated the rate of fe ii release from the anode fig s1a an optimal ratio of persulfate to fe ii would exist to maximize the steady state concentrations of ho so4 and feivo2 wang et al 2020 in this study the optimal fe ii release rate 0 12 mmol min corresponded to a current density of 26 5 ma cm2 fig s7a the deterioration of toc removal at current densities 26 5 ma cm2 could be ascribed to the quenching of reactive oxidants by excess fe ii hou et al 2021 a high persulfate dose 0 12 mmol min increased toc removal as indicated by a positive standardized effect 2 8 the high persulfate fe ii could shift the speciation from feivo2 to relatively nonselective ho so4 dong et al 2020 to accelerate mineralization thus the negative interaction ab 3 5 fig s8 between persulfate dose and current density would be primarily attributed to the scavenging effects of fe ii consequently a molar dose ratio of persulfate fe ii 1 was found to maximize the toc removal in eap and this result was compatible with the previous reports wu et al 2019a in eafc fig 4b both the free chlorine input and current density showed positive standardized effects 5 8 and 4 1 and negative quadratic terms 3 2 and 2 4 which would necessitate precise process control the more significant positive effects of free chlorine dose would be associated with the generation of feivo2 and direct reactions of free chlorine with nitrogenous organic compounds and nh3 however excessive free chlorine could reduce the toc removal due to quenching of feivo2 and generation of chlorinated organic matter which is known more recalcitrant to the mineralization than mother compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 similarly fe ii could serve both as source and scavenger of feivo2 whereas a disproportionation of excess feivo2 to fe iii could be another reason for the negative effects of current density a large stoichiometric excess of free chlorine free chlorine fe ii 1 7 mol mol at 37 4 ma cm2 0 17 mmol fe min could maximize the toc removal in eafc because of side reactions consuming free chlorine by nitrogenous organic matter fe ii fe iii oxides could catalyze the decomposition of chlorinated peptides and amino acids into nitrogen centered radicals rnh rnh2 ultimately leading to decarboxylation hawkins and davies 1998 vikesland and valentine 2000 the eahp effectiveness was exclusively dependent on quasi linear effects of current density 15 3 which monotonically increased toc removal by increasing fe ii supply fig 4c the effects of h2o2 dose and higher order factor interactions were insignificant these results could partly be explained by the disproportionately large dose of h2o2 in this study h2o2 fe ii 1 7 3 mol mol the h2o2 fe ii near 1 current density 45 ma cm2 h2o2 dose 0 20 mmol min was determined to be optimal for eahp consistent with other eaops that use fenton reactions and that have an optimal h2o2 0 fe ii range of 0 7 2 mol mol brillas et al 2009 moussavi and aghanejad 2014 shin et al 2017 eahp operation beyond these experimental bounds could entail wasteful consumption of reagents and electricity e g ho scavenging by h2o2 and h2o2 decomposition accelerated by ohmic heat brillas et al 2009 olvera vargas et al 2019 marginal variations in toc removal were reported previously in an electro fenton process under h2o2 fe ii 1 10 mol mol olvera vargas et al 2019 3 3 toc cod and tn degradation in synthetic and real wastewater the toc and cod reduction in the municipal livestock wastewater samples fig 5 could be understood by the reactivity of the identified primary oxidants the eahp almost always provided the best toc removals as a result of the strong oxidation power of ho generated by fenton chemistry the efficient cod removal greatly contributed to decreasing the operational cost of eahp i e the lowest operational cost among the eaops investigated table s8 details in text s7 moreover the toc and cod removal efficiency in eahp were relatively independent on the wastewater type particularly being tolerant to an elevated cl in the environmental samples the eap was less efficient than eahp due to lower yields of ho and the concurrent formation of so4 feivo2 with the latter depending highly on the electrolyte composition fig 1a toc degradation rates in eap were inconsistent with the estimated ho ss and so4 ss fig 1a this result signifies the importance of organic matter composition types of functional moieties and molecular weight among others deng and zhao 2015 the mineralization rate in synthetic wastewater was notably lower than in real wastewater despite the higher ho ss in synthetic samples the nitrogenous organic matter enriched in the synthetic wastewater would be recalcitrant toward ho so4 in an acidic ph because protonated amine groups are less reactive than the conjugate base forms in comparison toc abatement by eafc was inferior to eahp and eap in environmental samples but comparable to eahp in the synthetic wastewater the abundant nitrogenous organic compounds in synthetic wastewater benefitted the mineralization in eafc owing to facile reactions of rcs with the nitrogenous moieties deborde and von gunten 2008 however the selective natures of feivo2 and free chlorine could bring about accumulations of partially oxidized and chlorinated reaction intermediates that are recalcitrant to complete mineralization monotonic increases in carbon oxidation number in eafc fig s10 text s8 supported the proposition that mineralization is retarded in real wastewater samples eap consistently showed inferior cod degradation efficiency than eafc and eahp fig 5b the feivo2 one of the primary oxidants in eap is a weak oxidant with bimolecular rate constants several orders of magnitude smaller than ho so4 towards major constituents such as carboxylic acids alcohols and carbonyls table s10 in contrast free chlorine itself was involved in organic matter oxidation in eafc to provide a significant cod reduction in agreement with fig s4b and optimal free chlorine fe ii ratio far exceeding 1 likewise only eafc led to appreciable tn degradation with almost complete removals in real wastewater samples fig 5c the facile transformation of n functionalities to n2 by rcs was expected by breakpoint chlorination whereas oxidation by ho and so4 could generate inorganic n species such as ammonia nitrite and nitrate chen et al 2019 3 4 removal of mtps in municipal and livestock wastewater our eaops with sacrificial steel anode as alternatives to existing biological methods guaranteed overall effective removal of mtps such as carbamazepine and valsartan table 3 widely known pharmaceuticals and their metabolites such as fexofenadine tramadol fenofibric acid and dextrorphan were mostly eliminated although they are recalcitrant to the conventional biological processes table s11 pilocarpine and tranexamic acid rarely reported in the literature could be fully converted as well the oxidant type specific removal of a subset of compounds could be again rationalized by the primary reactive species involved for example progesterone was eliminated in eap and eahp but was even produced during eafc treatment of municipal wastewater the radical species involved in eap so4 cl and eahp ho could eliminate the progesterone whereas free chlorine is non reactive to it deborde et al 2004 conjugated forms of progesterone could predominate over the free form kjeld et al 1980 the degradation of which by free chlorine and possibly by feivo2 could release free progesterone to yield the negative removal in eafc tranexamic acid which is mostly 95 excreted in free form pilbrant et al 1981 could be naturally bound to proteins e g plasminogen thus effective destruction of proteinaceous compounds in eafc would explain the apparently inefficient removal of tranexamic acid betaxolol and acetanilide were removed less efficiently by eap particularly in livestock wastewater elevated cl in livestock wastewater could efficiently convert so4 to cl and cl2 in eap the bimolecular rate constants of acetanilide betaxolol and other Œ≤ blockers with so4 kso4 3 6 109 3 0 1010 m s and ho kho 5 2 8 39 109 m s are orders of magnitude larger than cl2 kcl2 2 107 5 07 108 m s lei et al 2019 neta et al 1988 tay and ismail 2016 in comparison strong electron donating groups e g phenyl pyrrole attached to the benzene ring could increase the reactivity towards cl2 cativiela and garcia 1990 lei et al 2019 as exemplified by the effective removal of indole in eap the degradation of 12 oxophytodienoic acid was markedly efficient by eahp especially in municipal wastewater owing to significantly larger ho ss fig 3a than in livestock wastewater however the quenching of so4 and feivo2 in livestock wastewater deteriorated its removal by eap and eafc long chain fatty acids and esters such as docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester can form micelles in aqueous solutions reducing the availability of electron rich hydrophobic tails to short lived oxidants such as so4 and ho trellu et al 2017 on the contrary selective and long lived oxidants such as free chlorine and feivo2 in eafc could be more effective for the degradation of docosahexaenoic acid ethyl ester as in the cases of ozone and h2o2 dos santos et al 2015 trellu et al 2017 than in eap and eahp 3 5 evolutions of by products and toxicity both eafc and eap produced several halogenated by products table 4 which should increase the toxicity of the effluent the by products formation in eafc was expected deborde and von gunten 2008 whereas rcs generation from reactions between so4 and cl could lead to significant chlorination of electron rich moieties also in eap zhang and parker 2018 in contrast reaction products in eahp effluents were devoid of chlorinated by products and were dominated by partially oxidized carboxylic acids again the ho ss in eahp was marginally scavenged by cl i e ho ss cl ss 6 5 7 7 mol mol in our experimental conditions ecosar estimates suggested that some of the by products can cause acute toxicity table 4 most were classified as hazardous to the aquatic environment by consulting the globally harmonized system of classification and labeling of chemicals u n 2019 nevertheless these estimations should be interpreted as a guideline only because the toxicity is affected by numerous parameters biodegradability and bioavailability of the toxicants bioaccumulation potential and interactions among the toxicants and other aqueous constituents and can vary widely among species of test organism u n 2019 in this study thus the effluent toxicity was evaluated by comparing inhibition of the dha activity of b megaterium dha inhibition of 10 was used as a criterion for toxicity mansor and tay 2020 effluents from eap and eafc were toxic fig 6 due to the halogenated by products both for municipal and livestock wastewater the notably higher effluent toxicity in eafc could be associated with the formation of 1 3 dichloro 2 propanone dichlorobromonitromethane and dibromochloronitromethane with substantial ecotoxicity table 4 relatively high steady state concentrations of rcs in eafc could oxidize br to hobr or other reactive bromine species to generate the brominated by products that were exclusively detected in eafc the brominated compounds can be at least as toxic as their chlorinated analogs wagner and plewa 2017 specifically the estimated cytotoxicity of dichlorobromonitromethane and dibromochloronitromethane were two to three orders of magnitude higher than regulated disinfection by products dbps such as chloroform and haloacetic acids wagner and plewa 2017 aromatic by products were identified in this study for eap and eafc including furanone 2 6 dichloro 4 methylphenol 3 5 dichloro 2 hydroxy benzaldehyde 1 4 dichloro 2 2 chloroethyl benzene 1 hydroxycyclohexyl phenyl ketone have been overlooked in previous reports on targeted analyses these dbps with or without halogenation have even higher ecotoxicological potentials than dichlorobromonitromethane and dibromochloronitromethane based on ecosar using aquatic organisms table 4 aromatic dbps can undergo further transformations e g ring opening side chain cleavage to potentially more toxic aliphatic forms such as haloacetaldehydes and haloacetamides liu et al 2020 consequently the lack of halogenated by products in the non target analysis coupled with the dha inhibition assay collectively confirmed that eahp effluents are relatively non toxic 4 conclusions this study comparatively evaluated eap eafc and eahp for potential applications in centralized municipal and livestock wastewater treatment plants primary conclusions include ho so4 and feivo2 species were concurrently generated in eap whereas ho and feivo2 were the primary oxidants in eahp and eafc respectively the rsm was used to optimize the oxidant dose and current density as the oxidant dose fe ii ratios of 1 1 7 and 1 for eap eafc and eahp respectively the nts identified the evolution of mtps and by products formation partly overlooked in previous targeted analyses which could be coupled with bioassays to assess the effluent toxicity applications of eafc and eap should be avoided in the presence of halide ions pronouncedly in livestock wastewater due to halogenated by products generations despite an efficient tn removal only noted in eafc brominated by products generation in eafc posed a greater ecotoxicological risk than eap the eahp achieved the best mtp removal and effective toc cod degradation which were relatively independent of the halide ions in wastewater eahp had the lowest effluent toxicity with a lack of halogenated by products and therefore could be the best alternative to the existing biological wastewater treatment plants declaration of competing interest
