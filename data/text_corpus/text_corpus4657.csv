23285,deep underwater images suffer from several problems such as low contrast and visibility which reduce the extraction rate of valuable information from the image in this paper we proposed an approach which integrates the three main steps of homomorphic filtering recursive overlapped clahs and dual image wavelet fusion and thus increases the visibility of deep underwater images and the extraction rate of important data additionally this approach implements homomorphic filtering to provide homogeneity in the illumination of the entire image which will be used for subsequent processes recursive overlapped clahs refers to the recursive process of overlapped tiles of divided image channel where half of a tile is processed twice with an adjacent tile half of the tile is overlapped with its next adjacent tile dual image wavelet fusion merging two images obtained from the integration of upper and lower stretched histograms are applied with discrete wavelet transformation before the main process of wavelet fusion is implemented qualitative and quantitative results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the current state of the art methods the highest value of average quantitative evaluations in terms of entropy average gradient measure of enhancement eme and eme by entropy are 7 835 12 802 8 343 and 27 616 respectively in the proposed method keywords contrast enhancement adaptive histogram specification recursive overlapped dual image wavelet fusion deep underwater image 1 introduction most previous research works hitam et al 2013 dwivedi et al 2015 li et al 2015 focused on shallow image where the improvement of the underwater quality is concentrated on images that are captured near the water surface shallow images exhibit a considerably high percentage of red colour channel compared with deep underwater image consequently the low visibility of captured image is obtained because objects in the image are hardly seen these phenomena decreases the amount of data extracted and sometimes results in useless images deep underwater image normally suffers from a high concentration of blue green illumination this phenomenon occurs as the light spectrum that travels in water medium is absorbed according to its wavelength hitam et al 2013 the shortest wavelength that is blue is absorbed last causing deep underwater image to appear bluish some applications such as unmanned underwater robot and ocean floor mapping are required to capture and analyse deep underwater images nevertheless these applications suffer from extremely low visibility as the captured images are dark and affected by blue green illumination in an image processing area no clear border exists to differentiate between shallow and deep underwater images and no clear information is available for determining deep and shallow underwater images in this paper deep and shallow underwater images are assumed to determine the percentage of colour channels in a red green blue rgb colour model red is the first colour channel attenuated and lost during the propagation of light in water medium the loss in the percentage of red colour channel increases the percentages of blue and green colour channels deep underwater images refer to images with 10 red colour percentage compared with that of green and blue colour channels normally deep image contains a high percentage of blue green illumination as the image turns bluish or greenish in deep underwater image the objects are hardly seen and no clear border exists between objects and background thus objects in deep underwater images turn bluish or greenish this paper explains in detail a proposed method that enhances the visibility of deep underwater images and increases overall image quality it integrates the two main methods of recursive overlapped contrast limited adaptive histogram specification ro clahs and dual image wavelet fusion diwf ro clahs involves tiles histogram processing clip limit process rayleigh distribution mapping and grey level mapping diwf implements the discrete wavelet transform of resultant images produced by ro clahs after applying wavelet fusion we applied the resultant image with inverse discrete wavelet transform to produce the final output image the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes literature reviews that are related to the proposed method section 3 explains the proposed method in detail results and discussions are elaborated in section 4 the paper ends with the conclusion which is explained in section 5 2 related works substantial research has been conducted for the enhancement of underwater image most studies focus on images captured near water surfaces where objects are visible these images are normally clearer than images captured in deep water where images are nearly invisible because of the high concentration of blue green illumination and limited light sources chen et al 2017 proposed entropy preserving mapping for contrast enhancement which focuses on producing fine textures in an image to indicate the improvement of image contrast yelmanova and romanyshyn 2017 proposed the adaptive enhancement of monochrome image with low contrast objects as they focus on monochrome image the proposed methodology is not properly applicable for coloured images for security purposes erat et al 2017 addressed the colour cast problem in underwater images through implementation in border security eliminating this problem is the first priority of the proposed steps before contrast enhancement is implemented the method proceeds with contrast stretching and white balance processing to improve the captured overall image quality dwivedi et al 2015 proposed an enhancement method based on distance factor estimation in the proposed method an underwater image is assumed to be nearly identical to a haze image in free space where the image can be modelled as a combination of direct attenuation and scattering parts as a consequence of motion in water medium noise term due to motion of water medium is included in the equation of underwater image rayleigh scattering which is the dominant scattering effect leads to noise which is non additive in nature and can be minimised by statistics based filtering techniques nevertheless this technique produces numerous parameters that must be determined before running the method the output images suffer from the effect of blue green illumination and produce over enhanced areas where images become extremely bright these areas reduce image details and the output image loses its important information underwater image enhancement using inherent optical properties has been proposed by li et al 2015 to enhance shallow ocean optical images and videos through fast dark channel prior descattering the proposed method begins by the estimation of the depth map through dark channels before considering the positions of lighting lamp camera and imaging plane through the implementation of weighted guided median filtering the proposed method can remove the scattering effect finally colour correction is applied through spectral properties the proposed method reduces the effect of blue green illumination but the visibility of the object is inadequately increased the background objects are still hardly seen identical results have also been obtained using adaptive dehazing framework which is proposed by qing et al 2015 as the proposed method inadequately increases the visibility of the background areas in 2012 pixel distribution shifting colour correction pdscc was proposed by naim and isa the method corrects the white reference point of the image and ensures that the white reference point is achromatic by the implementation of shifting process on the pixel distribution of a colour image although the method can reduce the effect of blue green illumination the overall image contrast remains low hitam et al 2013 proposed the mixture contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization clahe mix to increase image visibility and reduce the noise and artefact of the image the output image becomes clear by integrating the clahe rgb and clahe hue saturation value hsv implemented images by using euclidean norm however the images become increasingly green in some cases and produce high noise level by exhibiting low peak signal to noise ratio two famous methods normally used for comparing underwater images are integrated colour model icm 2007 and unsupervised colour correction method ucm 2010 which were proposed by iqbal et al 2007 2010 icm can improve image contrast but produces the effects of over and under enhancement as the output images produce dark and extremely bright areas the proposed method of ucm sometimes produces brownish image that deviates from the nature of the original image abu hassan et al 2017 enhanced under exposed underwater images through enhanced homomorphic filtering and mean histogram matching for object tracking the method successfully increased the contrast and enhanced dark areas in the image consequently the overall visibility of images increased and non uniform illumination improved the next section discusses the proposed method in detail 3 methodology integration ro clahs and diwf 3 1 motivation most underwater images are captured without constant illumination and images are captured with bright areas at the foreground and dark areas at the background precisely the areas near the light source are brighter than the areas that are located far away from the light source this nature of images must be determined before further processing combining bright and dark areas into a tile produces enhanced output distribution because the balanced improvement between both areas is considered in the enhancement process to determine the nature of the capture image we utilised entropy to determine its image detail the high detail of an area indicates that the objects in the image are distinguished well that is with high visibility from the background whereas the low visibility of objects in an area indicates that the area is low in detail this phenomenon reflects the value of entropy when an entropy value is high the visibility level of a particular area is high whereas a low entropy value indicates a low visibility area thus high and low entropy values correspond to bright and dark areas of image respectively therefore as the first stage of the pre processing of the image the entropy at the borders of the image is determined we used entropy to measure the richness of the image details entropy represents an abundance of image information where the higher the value is the more information is present in the image wu et al 2005 entropy is given by 1 h x x 1 k p x log 2 1 p x h x x 1 k p x log 2 p x s u m p x l o g 2 p x where p x is the probability distribution function pdf of the image the detail of the proposed method is explained in the next subsections in some cases conventional clahe process produces improper pixel distribution especially when an object is on the border between tile regions when two tiles containing objects are independently processed they may cause improper intensity distribution as identical objects must exhibit identical colour and contrast clahe also presents several disadvantages such as the fact that it reduces object colour and low frequency colour that are a part of an image the resultant image shows that water veil remains the next section focuses on solving these problems of clahe and presents the proposed technique fig 1 illustrates the flowchart of the proposed integrated ro clahs and diwf method the method begins with the decomposition of the input image the image which is normally in rgb colour model is then decomposed into respective channels namely red green and blue channels the enhancement starts with the implementation of enhanced homomorphic filtering through high pass filtering the image is subsequently divided into small tiles which in this case organised into 8 8 tiles by default as recommended by eustice et al 2002 the image is then applied with ro clahs which involves three main steps as shown in fig 1 i tile histogram generation and matching ii clip limit process and iii rayleigh distribution and grey level mapping before dividing the image into tiles the nature of the image is determined according to the entropy value this entropy based image division compares the entropy values at the sides of the image and thus decides the flow of entropy of the image these entropy based tile division and ro clahs steps are the main significant contributions and improvement of the proposed method additionally entropy based division ro clahs consists of three sub steps whereas the tile histograms of the divided image regions are processed recursively in addition to the tile division rayleigh based histogram distribution and grey level mapping will be implemented bilinear interpolation is applied after the ro clahs step to combine the image tiles as an image and reduces the artificial effects at the tile border that resulted from the combination subsequently the image is applied with diwf before the modification of image saturation and brightness which is implemented in hsv colour model finally the image is converted back into the rgb colour model the detail of the proposed method is explained in the next subsections 3 2 channel decomposition and enhanced homomorphic high pass filter first an image in rgb colour model will be decomposed into respective channels red green and blue the general steps of enhanced homomorphic high pass filter are shown in fig 2 homomorphic filter is applied by converting the image into natural log domain to separate the luminance l x y and reflectance r x y components of the image i x y 2 i x y l x y r x y 3 l n i x y l n l x y l n r x y high pass filter which requires the image to be applied with fast fourier transformation fft is then applied to the image for respective channels in log domain as the image will be processed in frequency domain filtering in the proposed method high pass butterworth filter is implemented as it shows improved quality performance by producing maximal flat magnitude response in pass band and demonstrates minimal phase shift over the pass band soni et al 2015 high pass filter maintains high frequencies in the image while discarding low signal frequencies for an underwater image the blue green illumination of water is regarded as a low frequency signal which is not required for further analysis based on the illumination reflectance model an image f x y is considered as the product of the illumination i x y and of reflectance r x y components as shown in equations 2 and 3 bazeille et al 2006 considering this model we assumed that the illumination factor changes slowly through the view field and thus represents low frequencies in the fourier transform of the image on the other hand reflectance component is associated with high frequency components by multiplying these components with a high pass filter we can suppress low pass frequency signals and thus eliminate non uniform blue green illumination thus by removing blue green illumination the visibility of objects in the image is improved and the object detail is increased high pass filter increases the homogeneity of illumination for the overall image areas butterworth high pass filter has been proposed by zhang and zhao 2011 4 h u v 1 1 d 0 u 2 v 2 n butterworth high pass filter maintains frequencies outside the radius d 0 and discards values inside the distance d 0 butterworth high pass filter exhibits a gradual transition from 0 to 1 to reduce ringing artefacts equation 3 shows that high pass filter provides an enhancement method by adding an offset value ß and scaling parameters α as follows 5 h n e w u v α β h u v 6 h n e w u v α β 1 1 d 0 u 2 v 2 n this equation shows that the high frequency signal is amplified to levels higher than the low frequency signal if α 1 and β 1 as described by eddins 2013 the best values for α and β are 0 5 and 1 5 respectively these values are implemented in the proposed method and improve image contrast and sharpness in most cases these tested offset and scaling values produce improved results for underwater images inverse fft and inverse log are implemented to the image after applying butterworth high pass filter 3 3 image tile division although the implementation of homomorphic filtering reduces the effect of non uniform illumination the bright and dark areas in the image are still visible the next enhancement process is performed according to this nature of image thus dividing the image that is column wise or row wise according to the nature of the input image is important as shown in fig 3 the image borders are divided into t tiles with 8 columns and 8 rows the entropy of each tile is calculated the mean entropy values for all four sides of the image are then calculated and compared with those at the opposite side the right side is compared with the left side and the top side is compared with the bottom side equation 7 is used to determine the average entropy h mean value of the image sides h x refers to the entropy value for each tile at image border where 1 x 8 t is the total tile number which is in this case is 8 7 m e a n e n t r o p y h m e a n h 1 h 2 h 3 h 8 t after determination the nature of the input image the image is divided accordingly the entropy values at the border are compared table 1 summarises the column wise or row wise division of the image for the next process after the determination of the division method the image is further divided into tiles according to the previous step the default number of row and column is 8 which is the best number of division from the tested images eustice et al 2002 because the recursive process leads to 2n 1 times to process the entire image this finding indicates that an image takes 15 times to be recursively processed thus the number of recursive process r is determined using equation 8 where n is the number of column or row in this case the default number of n is 8 8 r 2 n 1 an image will only be divided into rows or columns if the same number of tiles is applied to conventional clahe 64 tiles 8 8 are produced indicating that 64 processing times of histogram equalization is applied to an image fig 4 shows an example of row wise and column wise divisions for an image the next step explains the recursive overlapped clahs process for each tile after the tile division step 3 4 ro clahs 3 4 1 tile histogram processing after determining whether the division method is row or column wise the image is divided into tiles the example in fig 5 shows that the image is divided and processed into row wise tiles starting with the first processed tile that exhibits a purple border the histogram with 256 bins is created the second processed tile with an orange border will then be extracted from the image this second processed tile is extracted from half of the first tile and half of the second tile thus half of the first tile is processed twice half of the second tile orange border is then combined with the third tile blue border this process is recursively applied to the whole image the numbering at the left side of the image in fig 5 and the coloured borders show the order of the recursive tile processing for a clear explanation for each extracted tile a histogram will be generated and applied with clip limit the process of clip limit is explained in the next subsection 3 4 2 applying clip limit the clip limit is applied to the histogram to restrict the maximum number of pixels for a certain grey level value the exceeding number of pixels is distributed uniformly through all grey levels thereby increasing the number of pixels for all grey levels fig 6 illustrates the process of cutting off the exceed pixels at the clip limit value and the distribution of exceed pixels to all grey level values the spikes of the histogram for a certain grey level are cut and the exceeding number of pixels above this clip limit is distributed uniformly to all grey level values by distributing the pixels to all grey level values some regions of grey level exceed the clip limit value the re distributing pixels is considered complete if the excess is small enough to be ignored this distribution causes the number of pixels for all grey levels to increase clip limit results in the improvement of image contrast performance that hinders the concentration of pixels at a certain grey level for the proposed method the clip limit is set to 0 03 normalised to 1 as the optimal clip limit values are tested with a number of underwater images apparently the clip limit process reduces the problems of over and under enhanced areas in an image 3 4 3 rayleigh distribution and grey level mapping in addition to the clip limit process the histogram of the extracted tile will be matched with bell shaped rayleigh distribution rayleigh distribution is the most suitable pixel distribution for underwater images eustice et al 2002 rayleigh distribution concentrates most of the pixels in the middle of the dynamic grey level both sides of the intensity levels that is upper and lower dynamic ranges possess a less number of pixels this type of distribution reduces the concentration of image pixels at the lower and upper regions which contributes towards the production of dark and too bright areas the pdf and cumulative distribution function of rayleigh distribution are expressed in the following equations bibalan and amindavar 2015 9 p d f t α 2 e t 2 2 α 2 10 c d f 1 e t 2 2 α 2 where t is indicated as input pixels and α refers to distribution parameter for rayleigh which is set to 0 4 the distribution parameter α of the rayleigh equation is set based on the finding by eustice et al 2002 they found that the distribution parameter of 0 4 shows the best result for almost all underwater images the tested underwater images in the present study are also in agreement with this finding therefore in the proposed method the value of distribution parameter α 0 4 is set based on this finding and is implemented in the proposed method this value is applied for all types of images regardless of the initial level of image contrast as shown in fig 1 these three main steps are recursively applied to all tiles in an image these steps obviously improve the contrast and visibility of underwater image although the resultant image is not real in the perspective of some human eyes the output image shows significant improvement in terms of image visibility 3 5 bilinear interpolation the combined tiles of the output image will produce artificial border between the tiles to remove artificially induced tile border we applied mapping namely bilinear interpolation hurtik and madrid 2015 to interpolate between the tile mappings through the bilinear interpolation the basic calculation of unknown point can be obtained by the calculation of distance an example of the calculation can be applied by the following explanation and illustration in fig 7 an unknown intensity value of point x y and known intensity values at points x1 y1 x2 y1 x1 y2 and x2 y2 are considered the intensity value at the point of x y can be calculated by means of distance between the point of x y and the four other known points the calculation begins by calculating the intensity values at the points of x y1 and x y2 thus the intensity values at points i x y1 and i x y2 are respectively expressed by equations 11 and 12 the values in boxes 180 240 50 and 40 represent the intensity values of the pixels at respective points 11 i x y 1 x 2 x x 2 x 1 180 x x 1 x 2 x 1 240 a 12 i x y 2 x 2 x x 2 x 1 50 x x 1 x 2 x 1 40 b therefore the intensity value at the point x y is determined by equation 13 13 i x y y y 2 y 1 y 2 a y 1 y y 1 y 2 b the output image is implemented with diwf which is explained in next subsection 3 6 diwf as reported by abdul ghani and mat isa 2014 the integration of dual images which are produced from the integration of over and under enhanced images results in significant improvement in image colour and contrast a histogram of image channel is divided at its mid point for the generation of upper and lower regions this individual histogram is individually stretched for the production of two independent image histograms namely lower and upper stretched histograms an output image is produced by combining all upper stretched histograms and another output image is produced by combining all lower stretched histograms these combinations are under and over enhanced respectively these output images are then applied with discrete wavelet transformation dwt where the fusion process is then implemented through average intensity values between these extreme output images the resultant image is then applied with inverse dwt idwt for the production of an enhanced contrast image which exhibits high visibility fig 8 illustrates the proposed method of integrated ro clahs and diwf the results show that the combination between over and under enhanced images produces enhanced resultant image where the detail is adequately improved the dark areas and high concentration of blue green illumination are significantly reduced producing pleasant view in the perspective of the human visual system 3 7 saturation and brightness modification after the wavelet fusion step the image is further processed for the improvement of saturation and brightness to significantly improve the saturation and brightness of an image we converted the original rgb colour model of an image into an hsv colour model as reported by hitam et al 2013 improving underwater image in hsv colour model can increase image contrast and reduce the noise in the hsv colour model the s and v components are stretched to the entire dynamic ranges stretching process increases image saturation and brightness as all dynamic ranges of the image are occupied 4 results and discussion three hundred underwater images were captured in three different islands in malaysia namely perhentian tioman and payar islands these underwater images suffered from low contrast and were highly affected by blue green illumination these test images can be found in google drive through the following link https drive google com drive folders 1cpsdsoyrmv1nrw7umb0ds ltioj1qm1n usp sharing most of the objects in the images were hardly differentiated from the background and thus possessed extremely low visibility level we used these underwater images to evaluate the proposed method and compare it with other state of the art methods such as clahe mix hitam et al 2013 pdscc naim and isa 2012 clahe ucm iqbal et al 2010 icm iqbal et al 2007 and histogram equalization he these methods are the latest state of the art methods which fall within the identical field of image enhancement to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method we evaluated the output images of these compared methods in terms of contrast and colour visibility the effect of blue green illumination and the production of under and over enhanced areas the compared methods used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed method were included in the identical enhancement group referred to as the histogram based image enhancement group thus all the compared methods improve image contrast and colour by histogram modification clahe mix hitam et al 2013 and pdscc naim and isa 2012 are the latest methods developed 5 6 years before the present study meanwhile clahe ucm iqbal et al 2010 icm iqbal et al 2007 and he are well known methods normally used for comparing enhanced images for evaluation we employed an additional method the dual image rayleigh stretched clahs dirs clahs abdul ghani and mat isa 2015 dirs clahs consists of two main stages that contribute toward the improvement of underwater image contrast that is contrast correction and colour correction dirs clahs combines global and local corrections of image intensity and produces an enhanced contrast of the output image apart from qualitative measurement the proposed method was evaluated in terms of entropy wu et al 2005 padmavathi et al 2010 which describes image information content average gradient wu et al 2005 which shows the fine contrast texture characteristic and clarity of image was used for quantitative measurement the mean of structural similarity mssim wang et al 2004 which is generally used as quality matric based on structural information is another quantitative metric for image quality evaluation this quantitative evaluation approach is not a proper method for measuring image quality because it compares the similarity of the output image and original image which suffers from the problems mentioned in the introduction however mssim is included in this paper for evaluation according to previous research jaya and gopikakumari 2013 mittal et al 2013 wang et al 2004 in addition to these quantitative measurements we included measure of enhancement eme agaian et al 2000 2001 2007 and eme by entropy emee agaian et al 2007 in the evaluation to test the enhancement of output images we added another quantitative evaluation parameter namely contrast to improve the results of the evaluation of image contrast in this comparison 4 of 300 underwater images were selected as samples figs 9 12 show the samples of underwater images and resultant images produced by the state of the art methods with their respective 3d rgb colour model subjective results were added for evaluation purpose these additional images are included in appendix 1 and the quantitative evaluation of these images is featured in appendix 2 the samples and their outputs of 300 underwater can be obtained through google drive from the following link https drive google com drive folders 1cpsdsoyrmv1nrw7umb0ds ltioj1qm1n usp sharing table 2 shows the quantitative dataset for the image in fig 9û12 in terms of entropy average gradient mssim emee and eme in table 3 the average value of quantitative dataset for 300 underwater images is shown the image red fish in fig 9 shows that pdscc inadequately improves the overall image quality as the blue green illumination retains in the image and the background objects are hardly seen the output image is almost identical to the original image this qualitative observation is consistent with the quantitative result as the output image of pdscc exhibits the highest value of mssim 0 978 which indicates high similarity of the resultant image compared with the original image low values of eme and emee compared to the original image indicate that the resultant image is not positively enhanced clahe improves the image insignificantly as the blue green illumination is retained in the output image the background areas are hardly seen ucm produces brownish image whereas icm improves only the foreground areas of the image and darkens the background areas he oversaturates the image as the foreground areas become too bright this phenomenon results in reducing the image detail clahe mix however enhances only a small amount of image contrast as the output image is almost identical to the original image the proposed integrated ro clahs and diwf method significantly enhances the image as the objects in the background can be seen clearly and the blue green illumination is adequately reduced the overall image contrast and colour are highly improved quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed method produces the highest value of entropy 7 892 average gradient 12 399 emee 8 867 and eme 27 807 which shows that the proposed method outperforms the other state of the art methods generally the proposed method produces the best result in terms of image visibility for all sample images quantitative evaluation supports the visual observation of the resultant images which indicates that the output image of the proposed method produces the highest quality image the identical effects of the output images could be observed in the other samples such as stone 1 stone 2 and pillar quantitative evaluation using contrast does not agree with the visual evaluation as shown in tables 2 and 3 the output images from pdscc icm and he obtained the highest values of contrast which shows that the output image contrast from these methods is the best however these values do not represent the actual contrast of the output images 5 conclusion the proposed integrated ro clahs and diwf method is successfully implemented for underwater image as shown in the results the proposed method outperforms other state of the art methods especially in terms of contrast detail and visibility qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed method produces output images with excellent quality the image detail contrast clarity and level of enhancement are adequately improved these qualitative evaluations are highly consistent with the quantitative measurements as the proposed method produces the highest average value for four out of five of these parameters acknowledgement the author would like to thank the

23285,deep underwater images suffer from several problems such as low contrast and visibility which reduce the extraction rate of valuable information from the image in this paper we proposed an approach which integrates the three main steps of homomorphic filtering recursive overlapped clahs and dual image wavelet fusion and thus increases the visibility of deep underwater images and the extraction rate of important data additionally this approach implements homomorphic filtering to provide homogeneity in the illumination of the entire image which will be used for subsequent processes recursive overlapped clahs refers to the recursive process of overlapped tiles of divided image channel where half of a tile is processed twice with an adjacent tile half of the tile is overlapped with its next adjacent tile dual image wavelet fusion merging two images obtained from the integration of upper and lower stretched histograms are applied with discrete wavelet transformation before the main process of wavelet fusion is implemented qualitative and quantitative results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the current state of the art methods the highest value of average quantitative evaluations in terms of entropy average gradient measure of enhancement eme and eme by entropy are 7 835 12 802 8 343 and 27 616 respectively in the proposed method keywords contrast enhancement adaptive histogram specification recursive overlapped dual image wavelet fusion deep underwater image 1 introduction most previous research works hitam et al 2013 dwivedi et al 2015 li et al 2015 focused on shallow image where the improvement of the underwater quality is concentrated on images that are captured near the water surface shallow images exhibit a considerably high percentage of red colour channel compared with deep underwater image consequently the low visibility of captured image is obtained because objects in the image are hardly seen these phenomena decreases the amount of data extracted and sometimes results in useless images deep underwater image normally suffers from a high concentration of blue green illumination this phenomenon occurs as the light spectrum that travels in water medium is absorbed according to its wavelength hitam et al 2013 the shortest wavelength that is blue is absorbed last causing deep underwater image to appear bluish some applications such as unmanned underwater robot and ocean floor mapping are required to capture and analyse deep underwater images nevertheless these applications suffer from extremely low visibility as the captured images are dark and affected by blue green illumination in an image processing area no clear border exists to differentiate between shallow and deep underwater images and no clear information is available for determining deep and shallow underwater images in this paper deep and shallow underwater images are assumed to determine the percentage of colour channels in a red green blue rgb colour model red is the first colour channel attenuated and lost during the propagation of light in water medium the loss in the percentage of red colour channel increases the percentages of blue and green colour channels deep underwater images refer to images with 10 red colour percentage compared with that of green and blue colour channels normally deep image contains a high percentage of blue green illumination as the image turns bluish or greenish in deep underwater image the objects are hardly seen and no clear border exists between objects and background thus objects in deep underwater images turn bluish or greenish this paper explains in detail a proposed method that enhances the visibility of deep underwater images and increases overall image quality it integrates the two main methods of recursive overlapped contrast limited adaptive histogram specification ro clahs and dual image wavelet fusion diwf ro clahs involves tiles histogram processing clip limit process rayleigh distribution mapping and grey level mapping diwf implements the discrete wavelet transform of resultant images produced by ro clahs after applying wavelet fusion we applied the resultant image with inverse discrete wavelet transform to produce the final output image the paper is organised as follows section 2 describes literature reviews that are related to the proposed method section 3 explains the proposed method in detail results and discussions are elaborated in section 4 the paper ends with the conclusion which is explained in section 5 2 related works substantial research has been conducted for the enhancement of underwater image most studies focus on images captured near water surfaces where objects are visible these images are normally clearer than images captured in deep water where images are nearly invisible because of the high concentration of blue green illumination and limited light sources chen et al 2017 proposed entropy preserving mapping for contrast enhancement which focuses on producing fine textures in an image to indicate the improvement of image contrast yelmanova and romanyshyn 2017 proposed the adaptive enhancement of monochrome image with low contrast objects as they focus on monochrome image the proposed methodology is not properly applicable for coloured images for security purposes erat et al 2017 addressed the colour cast problem in underwater images through implementation in border security eliminating this problem is the first priority of the proposed steps before contrast enhancement is implemented the method proceeds with contrast stretching and white balance processing to improve the captured overall image quality dwivedi et al 2015 proposed an enhancement method based on distance factor estimation in the proposed method an underwater image is assumed to be nearly identical to a haze image in free space where the image can be modelled as a combination of direct attenuation and scattering parts as a consequence of motion in water medium noise term due to motion of water medium is included in the equation of underwater image rayleigh scattering which is the dominant scattering effect leads to noise which is non additive in nature and can be minimised by statistics based filtering techniques nevertheless this technique produces numerous parameters that must be determined before running the method the output images suffer from the effect of blue green illumination and produce over enhanced areas where images become extremely bright these areas reduce image details and the output image loses its important information underwater image enhancement using inherent optical properties has been proposed by li et al 2015 to enhance shallow ocean optical images and videos through fast dark channel prior descattering the proposed method begins by the estimation of the depth map through dark channels before considering the positions of lighting lamp camera and imaging plane through the implementation of weighted guided median filtering the proposed method can remove the scattering effect finally colour correction is applied through spectral properties the proposed method reduces the effect of blue green illumination but the visibility of the object is inadequately increased the background objects are still hardly seen identical results have also been obtained using adaptive dehazing framework which is proposed by qing et al 2015 as the proposed method inadequately increases the visibility of the background areas in 2012 pixel distribution shifting colour correction pdscc was proposed by naim and isa the method corrects the white reference point of the image and ensures that the white reference point is achromatic by the implementation of shifting process on the pixel distribution of a colour image although the method can reduce the effect of blue green illumination the overall image contrast remains low hitam et al 2013 proposed the mixture contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization clahe mix to increase image visibility and reduce the noise and artefact of the image the output image becomes clear by integrating the clahe rgb and clahe hue saturation value hsv implemented images by using euclidean norm however the images become increasingly green in some cases and produce high noise level by exhibiting low peak signal to noise ratio two famous methods normally used for comparing underwater images are integrated colour model icm 2007 and unsupervised colour correction method ucm 2010 which were proposed by iqbal et al 2007 2010 icm can improve image contrast but produces the effects of over and under enhancement as the output images produce dark and extremely bright areas the proposed method of ucm sometimes produces brownish image that deviates from the nature of the original image abu hassan et al 2017 enhanced under exposed underwater images through enhanced homomorphic filtering and mean histogram matching for object tracking the method successfully increased the contrast and enhanced dark areas in the image consequently the overall visibility of images increased and non uniform illumination improved the next section discusses the proposed method in detail 3 methodology integration ro clahs and diwf 3 1 motivation most underwater images are captured without constant illumination and images are captured with bright areas at the foreground and dark areas at the background precisely the areas near the light source are brighter than the areas that are located far away from the light source this nature of images must be determined before further processing combining bright and dark areas into a tile produces enhanced output distribution because the balanced improvement between both areas is considered in the enhancement process to determine the nature of the capture image we utilised entropy to determine its image detail the high detail of an area indicates that the objects in the image are distinguished well that is with high visibility from the background whereas the low visibility of objects in an area indicates that the area is low in detail this phenomenon reflects the value of entropy when an entropy value is high the visibility level of a particular area is high whereas a low entropy value indicates a low visibility area thus high and low entropy values correspond to bright and dark areas of image respectively therefore as the first stage of the pre processing of the image the entropy at the borders of the image is determined we used entropy to measure the richness of the image details entropy represents an abundance of image information where the higher the value is the more information is present in the image wu et al 2005 entropy is given by 1 h x x 1 k p x log 2 1 p x h x x 1 k p x log 2 p x s u m p x l o g 2 p x where p x is the probability distribution function pdf of the image the detail of the proposed method is explained in the next subsections in some cases conventional clahe process produces improper pixel distribution especially when an object is on the border between tile regions when two tiles containing objects are independently processed they may cause improper intensity distribution as identical objects must exhibit identical colour and contrast clahe also presents several disadvantages such as the fact that it reduces object colour and low frequency colour that are a part of an image the resultant image shows that water veil remains the next section focuses on solving these problems of clahe and presents the proposed technique fig 1 illustrates the flowchart of the proposed integrated ro clahs and diwf method the method begins with the decomposition of the input image the image which is normally in rgb colour model is then decomposed into respective channels namely red green and blue channels the enhancement starts with the implementation of enhanced homomorphic filtering through high pass filtering the image is subsequently divided into small tiles which in this case organised into 8 8 tiles by default as recommended by eustice et al 2002 the image is then applied with ro clahs which involves three main steps as shown in fig 1 i tile histogram generation and matching ii clip limit process and iii rayleigh distribution and grey level mapping before dividing the image into tiles the nature of the image is determined according to the entropy value this entropy based image division compares the entropy values at the sides of the image and thus decides the flow of entropy of the image these entropy based tile division and ro clahs steps are the main significant contributions and improvement of the proposed method additionally entropy based division ro clahs consists of three sub steps whereas the tile histograms of the divided image regions are processed recursively in addition to the tile division rayleigh based histogram distribution and grey level mapping will be implemented bilinear interpolation is applied after the ro clahs step to combine the image tiles as an image and reduces the artificial effects at the tile border that resulted from the combination subsequently the image is applied with diwf before the modification of image saturation and brightness which is implemented in hsv colour model finally the image is converted back into the rgb colour model the detail of the proposed method is explained in the next subsections 3 2 channel decomposition and enhanced homomorphic high pass filter first an image in rgb colour model will be decomposed into respective channels red green and blue the general steps of enhanced homomorphic high pass filter are shown in fig 2 homomorphic filter is applied by converting the image into natural log domain to separate the luminance l x y and reflectance r x y components of the image i x y 2 i x y l x y r x y 3 l n i x y l n l x y l n r x y high pass filter which requires the image to be applied with fast fourier transformation fft is then applied to the image for respective channels in log domain as the image will be processed in frequency domain filtering in the proposed method high pass butterworth filter is implemented as it shows improved quality performance by producing maximal flat magnitude response in pass band and demonstrates minimal phase shift over the pass band soni et al 2015 high pass filter maintains high frequencies in the image while discarding low signal frequencies for an underwater image the blue green illumination of water is regarded as a low frequency signal which is not required for further analysis based on the illumination reflectance model an image f x y is considered as the product of the illumination i x y and of reflectance r x y components as shown in equations 2 and 3 bazeille et al 2006 considering this model we assumed that the illumination factor changes slowly through the view field and thus represents low frequencies in the fourier transform of the image on the other hand reflectance component is associated with high frequency components by multiplying these components with a high pass filter we can suppress low pass frequency signals and thus eliminate non uniform blue green illumination thus by removing blue green illumination the visibility of objects in the image is improved and the object detail is increased high pass filter increases the homogeneity of illumination for the overall image areas butterworth high pass filter has been proposed by zhang and zhao 2011 4 h u v 1 1 d 0 u 2 v 2 n butterworth high pass filter maintains frequencies outside the radius d 0 and discards values inside the distance d 0 butterworth high pass filter exhibits a gradual transition from 0 to 1 to reduce ringing artefacts equation 3 shows that high pass filter provides an enhancement method by adding an offset value ß and scaling parameters α as follows 5 h n e w u v α β h u v 6 h n e w u v α β 1 1 d 0 u 2 v 2 n this equation shows that the high frequency signal is amplified to levels higher than the low frequency signal if α 1 and β 1 as described by eddins 2013 the best values for α and β are 0 5 and 1 5 respectively these values are implemented in the proposed method and improve image contrast and sharpness in most cases these tested offset and scaling values produce improved results for underwater images inverse fft and inverse log are implemented to the image after applying butterworth high pass filter 3 3 image tile division although the implementation of homomorphic filtering reduces the effect of non uniform illumination the bright and dark areas in the image are still visible the next enhancement process is performed according to this nature of image thus dividing the image that is column wise or row wise according to the nature of the input image is important as shown in fig 3 the image borders are divided into t tiles with 8 columns and 8 rows the entropy of each tile is calculated the mean entropy values for all four sides of the image are then calculated and compared with those at the opposite side the right side is compared with the left side and the top side is compared with the bottom side equation 7 is used to determine the average entropy h mean value of the image sides h x refers to the entropy value for each tile at image border where 1 x 8 t is the total tile number which is in this case is 8 7 m e a n e n t r o p y h m e a n h 1 h 2 h 3 h 8 t after determination the nature of the input image the image is divided accordingly the entropy values at the border are compared table 1 summarises the column wise or row wise division of the image for the next process after the determination of the division method the image is further divided into tiles according to the previous step the default number of row and column is 8 which is the best number of division from the tested images eustice et al 2002 because the recursive process leads to 2n 1 times to process the entire image this finding indicates that an image takes 15 times to be recursively processed thus the number of recursive process r is determined using equation 8 where n is the number of column or row in this case the default number of n is 8 8 r 2 n 1 an image will only be divided into rows or columns if the same number of tiles is applied to conventional clahe 64 tiles 8 8 are produced indicating that 64 processing times of histogram equalization is applied to an image fig 4 shows an example of row wise and column wise divisions for an image the next step explains the recursive overlapped clahs process for each tile after the tile division step 3 4 ro clahs 3 4 1 tile histogram processing after determining whether the division method is row or column wise the image is divided into tiles the example in fig 5 shows that the image is divided and processed into row wise tiles starting with the first processed tile that exhibits a purple border the histogram with 256 bins is created the second processed tile with an orange border will then be extracted from the image this second processed tile is extracted from half of the first tile and half of the second tile thus half of the first tile is processed twice half of the second tile orange border is then combined with the third tile blue border this process is recursively applied to the whole image the numbering at the left side of the image in fig 5 and the coloured borders show the order of the recursive tile processing for a clear explanation for each extracted tile a histogram will be generated and applied with clip limit the process of clip limit is explained in the next subsection 3 4 2 applying clip limit the clip limit is applied to the histogram to restrict the maximum number of pixels for a certain grey level value the exceeding number of pixels is distributed uniformly through all grey levels thereby increasing the number of pixels for all grey levels fig 6 illustrates the process of cutting off the exceed pixels at the clip limit value and the distribution of exceed pixels to all grey level values the spikes of the histogram for a certain grey level are cut and the exceeding number of pixels above this clip limit is distributed uniformly to all grey level values by distributing the pixels to all grey level values some regions of grey level exceed the clip limit value the re distributing pixels is considered complete if the excess is small enough to be ignored this distribution causes the number of pixels for all grey levels to increase clip limit results in the improvement of image contrast performance that hinders the concentration of pixels at a certain grey level for the proposed method the clip limit is set to 0 03 normalised to 1 as the optimal clip limit values are tested with a number of underwater images apparently the clip limit process reduces the problems of over and under enhanced areas in an image 3 4 3 rayleigh distribution and grey level mapping in addition to the clip limit process the histogram of the extracted tile will be matched with bell shaped rayleigh distribution rayleigh distribution is the most suitable pixel distribution for underwater images eustice et al 2002 rayleigh distribution concentrates most of the pixels in the middle of the dynamic grey level both sides of the intensity levels that is upper and lower dynamic ranges possess a less number of pixels this type of distribution reduces the concentration of image pixels at the lower and upper regions which contributes towards the production of dark and too bright areas the pdf and cumulative distribution function of rayleigh distribution are expressed in the following equations bibalan and amindavar 2015 9 p d f t α 2 e t 2 2 α 2 10 c d f 1 e t 2 2 α 2 where t is indicated as input pixels and α refers to distribution parameter for rayleigh which is set to 0 4 the distribution parameter α of the rayleigh equation is set based on the finding by eustice et al 2002 they found that the distribution parameter of 0 4 shows the best result for almost all underwater images the tested underwater images in the present study are also in agreement with this finding therefore in the proposed method the value of distribution parameter α 0 4 is set based on this finding and is implemented in the proposed method this value is applied for all types of images regardless of the initial level of image contrast as shown in fig 1 these three main steps are recursively applied to all tiles in an image these steps obviously improve the contrast and visibility of underwater image although the resultant image is not real in the perspective of some human eyes the output image shows significant improvement in terms of image visibility 3 5 bilinear interpolation the combined tiles of the output image will produce artificial border between the tiles to remove artificially induced tile border we applied mapping namely bilinear interpolation hurtik and madrid 2015 to interpolate between the tile mappings through the bilinear interpolation the basic calculation of unknown point can be obtained by the calculation of distance an example of the calculation can be applied by the following explanation and illustration in fig 7 an unknown intensity value of point x y and known intensity values at points x1 y1 x2 y1 x1 y2 and x2 y2 are considered the intensity value at the point of x y can be calculated by means of distance between the point of x y and the four other known points the calculation begins by calculating the intensity values at the points of x y1 and x y2 thus the intensity values at points i x y1 and i x y2 are respectively expressed by equations 11 and 12 the values in boxes 180 240 50 and 40 represent the intensity values of the pixels at respective points 11 i x y 1 x 2 x x 2 x 1 180 x x 1 x 2 x 1 240 a 12 i x y 2 x 2 x x 2 x 1 50 x x 1 x 2 x 1 40 b therefore the intensity value at the point x y is determined by equation 13 13 i x y y y 2 y 1 y 2 a y 1 y y 1 y 2 b the output image is implemented with diwf which is explained in next subsection 3 6 diwf as reported by abdul ghani and mat isa 2014 the integration of dual images which are produced from the integration of over and under enhanced images results in significant improvement in image colour and contrast a histogram of image channel is divided at its mid point for the generation of upper and lower regions this individual histogram is individually stretched for the production of two independent image histograms namely lower and upper stretched histograms an output image is produced by combining all upper stretched histograms and another output image is produced by combining all lower stretched histograms these combinations are under and over enhanced respectively these output images are then applied with discrete wavelet transformation dwt where the fusion process is then implemented through average intensity values between these extreme output images the resultant image is then applied with inverse dwt idwt for the production of an enhanced contrast image which exhibits high visibility fig 8 illustrates the proposed method of integrated ro clahs and diwf the results show that the combination between over and under enhanced images produces enhanced resultant image where the detail is adequately improved the dark areas and high concentration of blue green illumination are significantly reduced producing pleasant view in the perspective of the human visual system 3 7 saturation and brightness modification after the wavelet fusion step the image is further processed for the improvement of saturation and brightness to significantly improve the saturation and brightness of an image we converted the original rgb colour model of an image into an hsv colour model as reported by hitam et al 2013 improving underwater image in hsv colour model can increase image contrast and reduce the noise in the hsv colour model the s and v components are stretched to the entire dynamic ranges stretching process increases image saturation and brightness as all dynamic ranges of the image are occupied 4 results and discussion three hundred underwater images were captured in three different islands in malaysia namely perhentian tioman and payar islands these underwater images suffered from low contrast and were highly affected by blue green illumination these test images can be found in google drive through the following link https drive google com drive folders 1cpsdsoyrmv1nrw7umb0ds ltioj1qm1n usp sharing most of the objects in the images were hardly differentiated from the background and thus possessed extremely low visibility level we used these underwater images to evaluate the proposed method and compare it with other state of the art methods such as clahe mix hitam et al 2013 pdscc naim and isa 2012 clahe ucm iqbal et al 2010 icm iqbal et al 2007 and histogram equalization he these methods are the latest state of the art methods which fall within the identical field of image enhancement to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method we evaluated the output images of these compared methods in terms of contrast and colour visibility the effect of blue green illumination and the production of under and over enhanced areas the compared methods used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed method were included in the identical enhancement group referred to as the histogram based image enhancement group thus all the compared methods improve image contrast and colour by histogram modification clahe mix hitam et al 2013 and pdscc naim and isa 2012 are the latest methods developed 5 6 years before the present study meanwhile clahe ucm iqbal et al 2010 icm iqbal et al 2007 and he are well known methods normally used for comparing enhanced images for evaluation we employed an additional method the dual image rayleigh stretched clahs dirs clahs abdul ghani and mat isa 2015 dirs clahs consists of two main stages that contribute toward the improvement of underwater image contrast that is contrast correction and colour correction dirs clahs combines global and local corrections of image intensity and produces an enhanced contrast of the output image apart from qualitative measurement the proposed method was evaluated in terms of entropy wu et al 2005 padmavathi et al 2010 which describes image information content average gradient wu et al 2005 which shows the fine contrast texture characteristic and clarity of image was used for quantitative measurement the mean of structural similarity mssim wang et al 2004 which is generally used as quality matric based on structural information is another quantitative metric for image quality evaluation this quantitative evaluation approach is not a proper method for measuring image quality because it compares the similarity of the output image and original image which suffers from the problems mentioned in the introduction however mssim is included in this paper for evaluation according to previous research jaya and gopikakumari 2013 mittal et al 2013 wang et al 2004 in addition to these quantitative measurements we included measure of enhancement eme agaian et al 2000 2001 2007 and eme by entropy emee agaian et al 2007 in the evaluation to test the enhancement of output images we added another quantitative evaluation parameter namely contrast to improve the results of the evaluation of image contrast in this comparison 4 of 300 underwater images were selected as samples figs 9 12 show the samples of underwater images and resultant images produced by the state of the art methods with their respective 3d rgb colour model subjective results were added for evaluation purpose these additional images are included in appendix 1 and the quantitative evaluation of these images is featured in appendix 2 the samples and their outputs of 300 underwater can be obtained through google drive from the following link https drive google com drive folders 1cpsdsoyrmv1nrw7umb0ds ltioj1qm1n usp sharing table 2 shows the quantitative dataset for the image in fig 9û12 in terms of entropy average gradient mssim emee and eme in table 3 the average value of quantitative dataset for 300 underwater images is shown the image red fish in fig 9 shows that pdscc inadequately improves the overall image quality as the blue green illumination retains in the image and the background objects are hardly seen the output image is almost identical to the original image this qualitative observation is consistent with the quantitative result as the output image of pdscc exhibits the highest value of mssim 0 978 which indicates high similarity of the resultant image compared with the original image low values of eme and emee compared to the original image indicate that the resultant image is not positively enhanced clahe improves the image insignificantly as the blue green illumination is retained in the output image the background areas are hardly seen ucm produces brownish image whereas icm improves only the foreground areas of the image and darkens the background areas he oversaturates the image as the foreground areas become too bright this phenomenon results in reducing the image detail clahe mix however enhances only a small amount of image contrast as the output image is almost identical to the original image the proposed integrated ro clahs and diwf method significantly enhances the image as the objects in the background can be seen clearly and the blue green illumination is adequately reduced the overall image contrast and colour are highly improved quantitative evaluation indicates that the proposed method produces the highest value of entropy 7 892 average gradient 12 399 emee 8 867 and eme 27 807 which shows that the proposed method outperforms the other state of the art methods generally the proposed method produces the best result in terms of image visibility for all sample images quantitative evaluation supports the visual observation of the resultant images which indicates that the output image of the proposed method produces the highest quality image the identical effects of the output images could be observed in the other samples such as stone 1 stone 2 and pillar quantitative evaluation using contrast does not agree with the visual evaluation as shown in tables 2 and 3 the output images from pdscc icm and he obtained the highest values of contrast which shows that the output image contrast from these methods is the best however these values do not represent the actual contrast of the output images 5 conclusion the proposed integrated ro clahs and diwf method is successfully implemented for underwater image as shown in the results the proposed method outperforms other state of the art methods especially in terms of contrast detail and visibility qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed method produces output images with excellent quality the image detail contrast clarity and level of enhancement are adequately improved these qualitative evaluations are highly consistent with the quantitative measurements as the proposed method produces the highest average value for four out of five of these parameters acknowledgement the author would like to thank the

23286,energy storage has the potential to reduce the fuel consumption of ships by loading the engine s more efficiently the exact effect of on board energy storage depends on the ship functions the configuration of the on board power system and the energy management strategy previous research in this area consists of detailed modelling design and comparisons of specific on board power systems for explicitly defined operational profiles the necessary inputs for these studies are rarely known initially however since the effect of energy storage on the fuel consumption is not necessarily always positive it is essential to know the limitations of fuel savings obtained by an on board energy storage early in the design stage to that effect the paper proposes a set of algebraic formulas for the equivalent specific fuel consumption of on board power systems equipped with electrical energy storage which give a quick estimation of the maximum fuel savings obtainable depending on the specific fuel consumption of the prime mover the loading point of the system and the use scenario of the battery relative efficiency improvements can vary between 48 and 57 a set of design guidelines is also proposed based on the obtained results keywords hybrid propulsion electric propulsion energy storage ship design 1 introduction the use of large scale energy storage has been a popular research subject in recent years this is not surprising as energy storage is so far the only way of addressing the fluctuating nature of renewable resources and has therefore been a topic of great interest for the energy sector while there is some overlap the maritime industry poses specific challenges to the successful integration of energy storage into on board power systems size and weight are of greater importance the power system is isolated for most of the time and the load characteristic of propellers favours mechanical propulsion nevertheless energy storage is generally identified as an integral part of future marine solutions symington et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016 bolvashenkov et al 2014 haugom et al 2015 geertsma et al 2017 bouman et al 2017 in fact the main reason for using on board energy storage is to allow the internal combustion engines to run in more efficient operating conditions in other words any potential efficiency gains from energy storage are dependent on the functions of the ship the configuration of the on board power system the operational profile and the energy management control strategy used the easiest way to understand the complex interrelation between these factors is to look at them from the perspective of ship design chalfant 2015 identifies three distinct stages of ship design concept design engineering design and production design the concept design phase consists of a functional analysis of the future ship based on which an analysis of alternatives is performed what the major equipment will be is decided in this phase engineering design consists of preliminary design including the specifications of the main equipment and contract design lastly the detailed design and the construction will take place during production design table 1 shows the occurrence of the previously identified relevant factors for determining the viability of on board energy storage within the different design stages the layout of the power system configuration number of engines electrical mechanical propulsion use of energy storage is selected in the concept design stage and the components are subsequently sized in the engineering design stage the level of detail regarding the operational profile of the ship may increase as design progresses and even after the ship is in use and therefore spans all design stages as the most impactful decisions regarding energy efficiency need to be made in the concept design stage when very little information is available it is beneficial to integrate it with engineering design armstrong and banks 2015 considerable progress has been made in this regard mainly through the use of evolutionary optimization algorithms skinner et al 2009 brown et al 1998 brown and salcedo 2003 strock and brown 2008 nelson et al 2013 sekulski 2014 these studies are however focused on ship design as a whole and have very little options regarding the configuration of the on board power system previous studies focused specifically on the design of ship power systems are intended for the engineering design stage skinner et al 2009 dimopoulos and frangopoulos 2008 zahedi and norum 2013 zahedi et al 2014 kim et al 2015 dedes et al 2016 roa 2015 ling chin and roskilly 2016 the complexity and level of detail of such models implies their development on a case by case basis significant effort has also been dedicated to the development of energy management and control strategies which can be employed once the configuration is selected geertsma et al 2017 cupelli et al 2015 trovão et al 2016 lashway et al 2016 vu et al 2015 chen et al 2015 bassam et al 2016 and improved once operation profile data is available trodden et al 2015 until recently the relatively small number of options meant that the selection of the power system configuration was reasonably straight forward however due to the emergence of alternative fuels and the versatility offered by all electric ships and energy storage this is no longer the case steps have been taken towards the integration of these new options into the concept design stage boveri et al 2016 solem et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge no strategy is available for evaluating the use of energy storage in the concept stage of ship design the general consensus is that the fuel savings obtained by using energy storage need to be weighed against other costs in order to design a feasible system however because of the conversion losses in the system using energy storage does not always lead to fuel savings indeed emerging technologies are implemented to various degrees for different ship types rehmatulla et al 2017 using intuitive guidelines in order to decide to investigate energy storage for a particular case such as significant operation at low loads predictable load variation high redundancy requirements can result in significant research and development resources being misdirected the present work identifies quantifiable parameters which determine the feasibility of on board energy storage regarding energy efficiency thus for the wide range of ships for which energy storage will not result in fuel savings this option can be safely eliminated in the concept design stage and for the ships which can benefit from it an initial estimate of this benefit can be made moreover the proposed method offers valuable decision support both before and after an estimation of the operational profile is available the following section will describe the general modelling approach while section 3 provides detailed information on the modelling of specific components the different scenarios for which the use of energy storage is modelled are presented in section 4 additionally section 5 includes other design criteria which can be considered in the early design stages and which can affect the presented results calculations for three sample engines with very different part load performance show a large variety in the potential benefits of using energy storage the results are then compared with more detailed analysis found in literature for specific cases section 6 as mentioned before the model is intended specifically for the early design stages it was therefore important to make its limitations and applicability clear section 7 lastly the main conclusions of the presented work are given in section 8 2 methodology the present work is based on a comparison between the fuel savings achievable by running the engine under more efficient conditions and the fuel used to generate the power necessary for the conversion process there are three primary steps calculating the equivalent specific fuel consumption esfc for the benchmark no energy storage case taking into account transmission losses equation 1 calculating the equivalent specific fuel consumption for the additional power generated which will be used to charge the energy storage equation 2 determining the equivalent specific fuel consumption for the power output of the battery equation 3 note that the conversion losses will be dependent on the configuration and power pathway being investigated this will be explained in more detail in section 4 1 e s f

a d o p t i m u m e n g i n e l o a d l o a d 3 e s f c b a t t e r y e s f c s u r p l u s η b a t t e r y several guiding principles were used in the development of the approach for the present study these are the following 1 the efficiency models used for each component in the system were simplified as much as possible the only variable input parameter for these models is the percentage of the nominal load of the component some components were assumed to have constant efficiency all simplifications are based on a literature review 2 the calculations are done for the best case scenario all necessary simplifications are done in a way that is more likely to under estimates losses rather than over estimate them 3 the study only investigates the cases where the stored energy is produced on board to that effect the equivalent specific fuel consumption for running on batteries will be calculated this allows a more intuitive comparison and highlights the link to c o 2 emissions which in the absence of after treatment are almost exclusively dependent on the amount of fuel used in agreement with the research approach presented it is assumed that the battery is always charged by running the engine at its most efficient point to that effect an equivalent specific fuel consumption can be calculated by determining how many more grams of fuels needed were consumed in order to get the power generated for the battery and dividing this value by the surplus power generated equation 2 note however that the same equation applies if due to capacity constraints for example the engine is run at a sub optimal loading point the new load replacing the optimum engine load in the formula 3 system components 3 1 energy storage reviews on the use of energy storage for high power applications suggest li ion batteries as the most promising candidate for maritime applications luo et al 2015 farhadi and mohammed 2016 chen et al 2009 alternatively super capacitors can offer significant advantages in the area of transient operation and can be used successfully in combination with batteries ghiassi farrokhfal et al 2016 burke et al 2014 hemmati and saboori 2016 however since they are still early in the research and development process the core efficiency study will be performed exclusively for li ion batteries flywheels are also an option that should be investigated in the future faraji et al 2017 state of charge soc is an important parameter for safety and control and much effort has been invested in the development of models that can estimate it zheng et al 2016 zhao and de callafon 2016 zhang et al 2016 barré et al 2013 suresh et al 2016 nonetheless its influence on the efficiency of the battery itself is negligible as long as the battery is not over discharged instead the most important factors influencing battery efficiency are the charge and discharge currents li and tseng 2015 for the purpose of the present work the size of the energy storage is defined by its power output at 1 c a 1 c rate means that the charge discharge current will charge discharge the entire battery in 1 h the value is therefore inter changeable with capacity a n k w h battery will provide n k w of power at 1 c this approach offers an easy link between power demand and c rates the formulas used for the efficiency of the battery are those experimentally obtained by li and tseng 2015 4 η c h a r g e 0 003 c 2 0 0297 c 0 99814 5 η d i s c h a r g e 0 002232 c 2 0 0246 c 1 the effect of self discharge will also not be included as in the case of li ion batteries this is estimated at 0 1 0 3 a day hemmati and saboori 2016 note however that this can be higher if the soc is high and is dependent on temperature schmidt et al 2015 wang et al 2002 pathiyil et al 2016a b so self discharge may be worth including at the detailed design stage 3 2 transmission elements the efficiency of the relevant converters is generally high in the power range commonly found on board moreover the performance of these elements doesn t vary significantly over around 20 load aamir and mekhilef 2016 vazquez et al 2016 davari et al 2016 wang et al 2016 sivakumar et al 2016 szcześniak et al 2015 the highest values encountered in literature for the efficiency of these elements was considered in the present study as dictated by the research approach table 2 shows the values used in the calculations 3 3 internal combustion engines three different variations of the diesel engine were considered traditional diesel engine dual fuel engine in gas mode and diesel engine with sequential turbo charging stc these are the main options for engine selection in early ship design the choice is generally a trade off between efficiency low initial costs and technological maturity traditional diesel engine fuel costs and reduced green house gas emissions dual fuel engine and dynamic response stc engine as fig 1 shows these engines also exhibit different trends in their specific fuel consumption the gas engine has significantly worse relative low load performance than the diesel engine while engines with stc have almost constant sfc over the entire loading range the drop in efficiency at part load characteristic of diesel engines is crucial to any potential benefits of using energy storage to that effect a representative engine from each of the three categories was selected since there is very little difference in the relative part load performance of engines between different manufacturers specific fuel consumption data given by man diesel turbo was used as the basis of the calculations the values extracted from the product guides of these engines can be seen in table 3 the choice in manufacturer was made solely because of the availability of sfc data for the 10 loading point the diesel mode of the df engine was considered instead of another more traditional diesel engine because of the same reason after ensuring that the values were comparable 3 4 electrical machinery for the present study synchronous machines were used as they are the most common in hybrid applications el refaie 2013 calfo et al 2002 the efficiency of ac machines is heavily dependent on their rated power ferreira et al 2015 fortunately as the sizes increases the efficiency levels off at around 97 98 motors generators which can be used for on board power systems are expected to fall within this range the estimation of part load efficiency is more elusive manufacturers generally give a very slight drop in efficiency from nominal to 75 load however measurements done by dedes et al 2016 showed a drop of approximately 4 efficiency points in that load range moreover simulations starting from the individual losses suggested the opposite efficiency trend in the same load range zahedi and norum 2013 zahedi et al 2014 both cases were reported for optimal speed frequency since the main focus of the present study is on the best case scenario the most favourable efficiency will be used for the initial calculations flat 97 efficiency 4 energy storage use scenarios four scenarios are investigated based on combinations of two different criteria the type of propulsion and the intended use of the energy storage there are three main types of transmission on board ships mechanical electrical and hybrid from these only the electrical and hybrid can be combined with electrical energy storage the paths to and from the battery are the same in both transmission types generator rectifier battery charging battery discharging inverter motor however because of the original power flow when no energy storage is involved the relative benefits of using energy storage will differ significantly the second criterion used to differentiate between different use scenarios is whether the battery replaces some of the existing installed power downsizing or adds to the existing installed power providing an alternative power source at low loads 4 1 hybrid transmission hybrid transmission pto pti uses a shaft motor generator which can be used to link a traditional mechanical propulsion to an electric grid or a battery in this case the battery takes the power from the shaft and puts it back into the shaft in other words all the electric transmission losses are associated to the battery the transmission loss associated to the original propulsion system is just the gear box this is reflected in the formulas used to calculate the equivalent specific fuel consumption esfc of the system 6 η b e n c h m a r k η g e a r b o x 7 η b a t t

regardless of the presence of energy storage to that effect the power from the battery will be taken from and returned to the grid the losses of the generator rectifier inverter and motor are associated to the original system and only the charging and discharging losses are associated to the use of energy storage 8 η b e n c h m a r k η g e n e r a t o r η r e c t i f i e r η i n v e r t e

esfc of the original system offset by the necessary amount for low loads and an averaged mean between the esfc of the engine and that of the battery at high loads equation 10 this is mainly representative of situations where energy storage is used to provide a boost to the engine at high speeds making it possible for the same maximum speed to be achieved with a smaller engine consequently the engine would run more efficiently over most of the operating range of the ship in the case of electric propulsion this is also representative of using energy storage to achieve redundancy requirements spinning reserve for example if two generator sets running at 25 load each to ensure the necessary spinning reserve one can be switched off if the energy storage can provide sufficient back up power this would lead to one generator set running at 50 load from the perspective of the equivalent specific fuel consumption this case is the same as the one above the last application reflected by these calculations is load levelling or peak shaving while this is mainly used to reduce severe transient loading of the engine and thus reduce maintenance costs it can also improve efficiency in some cases for example if the load is split between two engines and the load requirements fluctuate between 40 and 60 one of the engine can be turned off if energy storage is used for load levelling this case is also represented by the same esfc as the two above 10 e s f c i n e s f c i n l o a d 100 100 p b a t if l o a d 100 p b a t e s f c i n o p t i m u m e n g i n e

calculations were made under the assumption that the engine will be turned off and the battery will be used as an exclusive power source instead the amount of the installed power replaced by the battery was calculating assuming 1 c rate discharge this is in accordance with the best case scenario principle the equivalent specific fuel consumptions for the battery calculated in equation 7 and equation 9 are used to calculate the specific fuel consumption of the main engine adjusted for losses 11 e s f c i n a d j u s t e d f o r l o s s e s e s f c b a t o p t i m u m e n g i n e l o a d l o a d e s f c i n l o a d l o a d o p t i m u m e n g i n e l o a d 5 additional design criteria the focus in early design stages is very often placed on costs and finding cost effective solutions unfortunately cost models require significant input data which is dependent on local markets it is therefore not feasible to create a generic cost model however several criteria will have a direct and predictable impact on the total life cycle costs of the ship this section presents the three design criteria which will have the biggest influence on different costs the size of the battery will influence both initial costs and maintenance costs through the profile of the battery state of charge and consequently battery ageing barré et al 2013 the engine running hours is the most important criterion influencing maintenance costs and the operational profile together with the energy efficiency will determine the overall fuel costs 5 1 battery size for all types of engines the results will show only a slight benefit to the increase of battery power or capacity see section 3 1 in the case of battery only operation this happens because the only effect of size in the current model is in the dependency of the battery penalty factor efficiency on charge and discharge rates in reality however the capacity of the battery plays a much more important role as a small capacity would result in the engine needing to be turned on and off at a very high frequency the capacity required to obtain the presented results can be calculated by setting a minimum value for uninterrupted engine running time equation 12 if necessary the o p t i m u m l o a d parameter can be replaced with another load in order to obtain a lower battery capacity a subsequent replacement in equations 2 10 and 11 will show the efficiency penalty resulting from the decrease in battery capacity the battery capacity is also a predictor of size weight and initial costs 12 b a t t e r y c a p a c i t y o p t i m u m l o a d l o a d m i n i m u m u n i n t e r u p t e d e n g i n e r u n n i n g t i m e in the case of downsizing there is also a limit to the amount of power which can be replaced by energy storage an initial estimation of this value can be deduced from the basic operational profile of the ship equation 13 the load here was considered to be given as a percentage of the benchmark installed power 13 l o a d 1 100 p e r c e n t a g e o f t i m e s p e n t 100 p b a t m a x l o a d 0 5 2 engine running hours a common reason of using energy storage is to reduce the running hours of the engines on board since engine maintenance is generally performed after a certain number of running hours this can have a significant impact on maintenance costs the potential reduction in engine running hours is also dependent on the loading of the system the greatest reductions will be achieved if the engine is run at nominal load when charging the batteries equation 14 can be used to determine the reduction in engine running hours obtainable at different loading points the value represents the fraction of time the engines will be running if energy storage is present compared to the benchmark scenario 14 r u n n i n g h o u r s r a t i o 1 o p t i m u m e n g i n e l o a d l o a d l o a d 1 5 3 operational profiles in the concept design stage data regarding the operational profile is generally estimated by identifying different operating modes the characteristic load for each mode and the percentage of time the ship will spend in each mode as equations 1 to 3 10 and 11 are all a function of load they can be used to determine the sfc corresponding to each operating mode equation 15 determines the average relative efficiency gain for an operational profile given in this format 15 η g a i n n 1 n o m o d e s min e s f c i n c l o a d n e s f c b e n c h m a r k c l o a d n e s f c b e n c h m a r k c l o a d n e s f c b e n c h m a r k c l o a d n p n where η g a

the potential fuel savings obtainable by energy storage with those obtainable by increasing the number of engines the loading point of the engine needs to be adjusted accordingly and any redundancy requirements need to be accounted for equation 16 shows the appropriate equations to use if two engines are considered and no operating mode has particular redundancy requirements note that the relative efficiency gain obtained through this formula will overestimate the benefits as the decrease in efficiency with engine size is not taken into account 16 η g a i n n 1 n o m o d e s e s f c b

is on comparing the overall fuel costs then it is also important to keep in mind the relevance of the percentage of time the ship is in use 6 results this section shows the relative efficiency of using energy storage for different loading points scenarios and prime movers additionally the obtained results are analysed from two very important aspects the size of the battery and the sfc curve of the prime mover lastly in the case of downsizing a distinction is made between the benefits of energy storage and that of the efficiency driven selection of prime movers 6 1 relative efficiency the results obtained for configurations containing diesel engines are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 as expected the highest efficiency improvements are obtained in the case of diesel electric propulsion in such configurations the majority of transmission losses are present even if energy storage is not used in the case of hybrid transmission a significant amount of the energy saved by running the diesel engine at a more efficient loading point is lost by converting the mechanical energy into electrical energy and back in fact significant improvements in energy efficiency are observed only at the 10 loading point the figures also show that in most cases downsizing provides fewer benefits than increasing the total installed power and allowing battery only operation the drop in efficiency at low loads is much more pronounced in the case of gas engines consequently the efficiency improvements attainable through energy storage are more evident fig 4 and fig 5 in the case of engines equipped with sequential turbo chargers the specific fuel consumption varies very little throughout their entire operating range to that effect almost no benefits can be claimed by adding energy storage to such systems fig 6 6 2 benchmark sfc curve as can be seen from the three cases presented above the shape of the benchmark esfc curve is the main determining factor for the applicability of energy storage to a particular system moreover this also holds true for a specific loading case indeed because of the capacity constraint it might be more efficient to run the engine in a suboptimal loading point from equation 2 and equation 3 it follows that the minimum requirement of the benchmark esfc in order to obtain any efficiency benefits from using energy storage is given by equation 17 note that the units of measurement are irrelevant for this equation 17 e s f c b e n c h m a r k l o a d s u r p l u s e s f c b e n c h m a r k l o a d s u r p l u s b a t t e r y p e n a l t y l o a d s u r p l u s l o a d 6 3 downsizing while the three cases represented by downsizing pti load levelling and spinning reserve all result in the same equivalent specific fuel consumption in the case of pti the benefits obtained are not specific to the use of energy storage in fact better fuel efficiency can be achieved by using an additional engine this is evidently not a good alternative if energy storage is used as spinning reserve as it is the very option it replaces to a certain extent this also holds true for load levelling where dynamic loading would not allow for the additional engine to be turned on and off at the demanded rate in other words it depends on whether the energy storage is used to literally downsize the main engine or if it is used to avoid turning on an additional engine 6 4 validation state of the art in this area generally focuses on advanced techniques in control and energy management to that effect few studies have been done that isolate the benefits of energy storage nonetheless zahedi et al 2014 offers a great opportunity for validation as the results not only isolate the effect of energy storage but are also broken down by operating modes the operating modes are defined by a characteristic loading of the system and therefore are easily comparable with the obtained results as can be seen from table 4 the obtained results are generally overly optimistic in keeping with the best case scenario strategy adopted this discrepancy is further exacerbated by the fact that the dc system in the comparison study allows for variable speed operation at part load of the generator sets which affects the shape of the sfc curve and diminishes the benefits of energy storage the only unexplained result appears in the 33 5 loading point which represents the transit supply operating mode unfortunately the level of detail provided in the comparison study does not allow for a more in depth explanation of this error other studies also seem to support the present results for example dedes et al 2016 reports a 5 81 increase in efficiency at approximately 50 load which is only slightly smaller than the obtained 7 87 in godjevac et al 2017 fuel savings of 15 are reported for the use of energy storage as spinning reserve in the case of dynamic positioning this is similar to the 18 94 reduction obtained for the same case with the proposed method downsizing scenario 7 discussion due to the practical nature of the presented work it is important to emphasize both its applicability and its limitations the structure of this section reflects this fact 7 1 applicability the fact that determining the right capacity for the on board energy storage and designing a suitable control strategy are such complex tasks is the main reason why it is important to have a preliminary assessment of the applicability of energy storage for a specific ship moreover the simplicity of the equations allows for a large number of different configurations to be analysed and thus facilitates a pre selection of the configurations investigated by more complex simulations the exclusive use of algebraic equations also makes the model suitable for integration into complex optimization algorithms the examples presented here were for arbitrarily selected sample engines representing the different operating principles which most affect the shape of the sfc curve naturally the equations can be used with any specific fuel consumption data available further more as was shown in the test case the formulas can be easily scaled for configurations containing multiple engines overall this allows for preliminary estimations of potential fuel savings from energy storage for a specific operational profile to be calculated almost instantly additionally an initial comparison of several competing configurations is easily accessible the additional criteria included can be integrated into cost models for an initial estimation of total life cycle costs 7 2 limitations the proposed method has seven main limitations 1 the constant efficiency of the electric motor generator can artificially inflate the estimated benefits in the case of hybrid transmission and underestimate them in the case of electric transmission this enforces the already noted fact that energy storage offers more benefits when used together with electric propulsion 2 when designing on board power systems with energy storage the capacity of the batteries is generally one of the key parameters however determining this parameter is not only the result of a complex trade off which also needs to take into account battery ageing but it also requires a much more detailed operational profile specifically the order and duration of the different operating modes 3 the control strategy of the power system also plays an important role an advance strategy can lead to savings of around 9 vu et al 2015 4 downsizing and battery operation have been presented here as two distinct scenarios it was assumed that in the case of downsizing battery only operation was not possible as the batteries needed to maintain a minimum state of charge for redundancy purposes in practice for some operational profiles advanced control algorithms can ensure the viability of combined systems in which the energy storage can be used for both downsizing and as an alternative power source 5 several other smaller factors are assumed to be investigated in a more detailed design stage while the main costs considerations are related to the fuel consumption and the size capacity of the battery maintenance costs of the engines are also affected by the use of energy storage positively by avoiding operation at very low loads and negatively by potentially turning them on and off more often another aspect that can influence the results is local environmental restrictions for example reducing noise can be an incentive for battery only operation 6 the availability and price of shore power plays an important role in estimating the benefits of energy storage for a particular case while this was not explicitly included in the model it can be added easily if fuel consumption is replaced with costs 7 at the 10 loading point the efficiency of the transmission elements may be significantly lower than the values used if this loading point is of particular interest the values should be adapted accordingly the limitations presented above reinforce the suitability of the method for the concept design stage 8 conclusions several general observations on the use of energy storage on board ships can be made from the presented results 1 systems with electric transmission benefit more from the use of energy storage than systems with hybrid transmission as there are less losses associated to the battery 2 the size of the battery is mostly relevant through the limitations on its use imposed by capacity in the case of battery only operation or through how much of the installed engine power it can replace by comparison the effect on efficiency resulting from different c rates are negligible 3 gas engines benefit significantly more from energy storage as their efficiency decreases more drastically with load 4 engines with sequential turbo charging are unsuitable for use with energy storage from the perspective of energy efficiency 5 at most operating points using the batteries as an additional power source increasing the installed power results in higher potential fuel savings than downsizing the engines 6 energy storage shows potential for fuel savings only for low load operation using energy storage at high loads can actually lead to increased fuel consumption the conclusions listed above offer some very basic guidelines for the design of on board power systems with energy storage however the strength of the present work lies in its easy adaptability to specific cases providing insight at a very early stage in the design process acknowledgements this

23286,energy storage has the potential to reduce the fuel consumption of ships by loading the engine s more efficiently the exact effect of on board energy storage depends on the ship functions the configuration of the on board power system and the energy management strategy previous research in this area consists of detailed modelling design and comparisons of specific on board power systems for explicitly defined operational profiles the necessary inputs for these studies are rarely known initially however since the effect of energy storage on the fuel consumption is not necessarily always positive it is essential to know the limitations of fuel savings obtained by an on board energy storage early in the design stage to that effect the paper proposes a set of algebraic formulas for the equivalent specific fuel consumption of on board power systems equipped with electrical energy storage which give a quick estimation of the maximum fuel savings obtainable depending on the specific fuel consumption of the prime mover the loading point of the system and the use scenario of the battery relative efficiency improvements can vary between 48 and 57 a set of design guidelines is also proposed based on the obtained results keywords hybrid propulsion electric propulsion energy storage ship design 1 introduction the use of large scale energy storage has been a popular research subject in recent years this is not surprising as energy storage is so far the only way of addressing the fluctuating nature of renewable resources and has therefore been a topic of great interest for the energy sector while there is some overlap the maritime industry poses specific challenges to the successful integration of energy storage into on board power systems size and weight are of greater importance the power system is isolated for most of the time and the load characteristic of propellers favours mechanical propulsion nevertheless energy storage is generally identified as an integral part of future marine solutions symington et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016 bolvashenkov et al 2014 haugom et al 2015 geertsma et al 2017 bouman et al 2017 in fact the main reason for using on board energy storage is to allow the internal combustion engines to run in more efficient operating conditions in other words any potential efficiency gains from energy storage are dependent on the functions of the ship the configuration of the on board power system the operational profile and the energy management control strategy used the easiest way to understand the complex interrelation between these factors is to look at them from the perspective of ship design chalfant 2015 identifies three distinct stages of ship design concept design engineering design and production design the concept design phase consists of a functional analysis of the future ship based on which an analysis of alternatives is performed what the major equipment will be is decided in this phase engineering design consists of preliminary design including the specifications of the main equipment and contract design lastly the detailed design and the construction will take place during production design table 1 shows the occurrence of the previously identified relevant factors for determining the viability of on board energy storage within the different design stages the layout of the power system configuration number of engines electrical mechanical propulsion use of energy storage is selected in the concept design stage and the components are subsequently sized in the engineering design stage the level of detail regarding the operational profile of the ship may increase as design progresses and even after the ship is in use and therefore spans all design stages as the most impactful decisions regarding energy efficiency need to be made in the concept design stage when very little information is available it is beneficial to integrate it with engineering design armstrong and banks 2015 considerable progress has been made in this regard mainly through the use of evolutionary optimization algorithms skinner et al 2009 brown et al 1998 brown and salcedo 2003 strock and brown 2008 nelson et al 2013 sekulski 2014 these studies are however focused on ship design as a whole and have very little options regarding the configuration of the on board power system previous studies focused specifically on the design of ship power systems are intended for the engineering design stage skinner et al 2009 dimopoulos and frangopoulos 2008 zahedi and norum 2013 zahedi et al 2014 kim et al 2015 dedes et al 2016 roa 2015 ling chin and roskilly 2016 the complexity and level of detail of such models implies their development on a case by case basis significant effort has also been dedicated to the development of energy management and control strategies which can be employed once the configuration is selected geertsma et al 2017 cupelli et al 2015 trovão et al 2016 lashway et al 2016 vu et al 2015 chen et al 2015 bassam et al 2016 and improved once operation profile data is available trodden et al 2015 until recently the relatively small number of options meant that the selection of the power system configuration was reasonably straight forward however due to the emergence of alternative fuels and the versatility offered by all electric ships and energy storage this is no longer the case steps have been taken towards the integration of these new options into the concept design stage boveri et al 2016 solem et al 2015 to the best of our knowledge no strategy is available for evaluating the use of energy storage in the concept stage of ship design the general consensus is that the fuel savings obtained by using energy storage need to be weighed against other costs in order to design a feasible system however because of the conversion losses in the system using energy storage does not always lead to fuel savings indeed emerging technologies are implemented to various degrees for different ship types rehmatulla et al 2017 using intuitive guidelines in order to decide to investigate energy storage for a particular case such as significant operation at low loads predictable load variation high redundancy requirements can result in significant research and development resources being misdirected the present work identifies quantifiable parameters which determine the feasibility of on board energy storage regarding energy efficiency thus for the wide range of ships for which energy storage will not result in fuel savings this option can be safely eliminated in the concept design stage and for the ships which can benefit from it an initial estimate of this benefit can be made moreover the proposed method offers valuable decision support both before and after an estimation of the operational profile is available the following section will describe the general modelling approach while section 3 provides detailed information on the modelling of specific components the different scenarios for which the use of energy storage is modelled are presented in section 4 additionally section 5 includes other design criteria which can be considered in the early design stages and which can affect the presented results calculations for three sample engines with very different part load performance show a large variety in the potential benefits of using energy storage the results are then compared with more detailed analysis found in literature for specific cases section 6 as mentioned before the model is intended specifically for the early design stages it was therefore important to make its limitations and applicability clear section 7 lastly the main conclusions of the presented work are given in section 8 2 methodology the present work is based on a comparison between the fuel savings achievable by running the engine under more efficient conditions and the fuel used to generate the power necessary for the conversion process there are three primary steps calculating the equivalent specific fuel consumption esfc for the benchmark no energy storage case taking into account transmission losses equation 1 calculating the equivalent specific fuel consumption for the additional power generated which will be used to charge the energy storage equation 2 determining the equivalent specific fuel consumption for the power output of the battery equation 3 note that the conversion losses will be dependent on the configuration and power pathway being investigated this will be explained in more detail in section 4 1 e s f

a d o p t i m u m e n g i n e l o a d l o a d 3 e s f c b a t t e r y e s f c s u r p l u s η b a t t e r y several guiding principles were used in the development of the approach for the present study these are the following 1 the efficiency models used for each component in the system were simplified as much as possible the only variable input parameter for these models is the percentage of the nominal load of the component some components were assumed to have constant efficiency all simplifications are based on a literature review 2 the calculations are done for the best case scenario all necessary simplifications are done in a way that is more likely to under estimates losses rather than over estimate them 3 the study only investigates the cases where the stored energy is produced on board to that effect the equivalent specific fuel consumption for running on batteries will be calculated this allows a more intuitive comparison and highlights the link to c o 2 emissions which in the absence of after treatment are almost exclusively dependent on the amount of fuel used in agreement with the research approach presented it is assumed that the battery is always charged by running the engine at its most efficient point to that effect an equivalent specific fuel consumption can be calculated by determining how many more grams of fuels needed were consumed in order to get the power generated for the battery and dividing this value by the surplus power generated equation 2 note however that the same equation applies if due to capacity constraints for example the engine is run at a sub optimal loading point the new load replacing the optimum engine load in the formula 3 system components 3 1 energy storage reviews on the use of energy storage for high power applications suggest li ion batteries as the most promising candidate for maritime applications luo et al 2015 farhadi and mohammed 2016 chen et al 2009 alternatively super capacitors can offer significant advantages in the area of transient operation and can be used successfully in combination with batteries ghiassi farrokhfal et al 2016 burke et al 2014 hemmati and saboori 2016 however since they are still early in the research and development process the core efficiency study will be performed exclusively for li ion batteries flywheels are also an option that should be investigated in the future faraji et al 2017 state of charge soc is an important parameter for safety and control and much effort has been invested in the development of models that can estimate it zheng et al 2016 zhao and de callafon 2016 zhang et al 2016 barré et al 2013 suresh et al 2016 nonetheless its influence on the efficiency of the battery itself is negligible as long as the battery is not over discharged instead the most important factors influencing battery efficiency are the charge and discharge currents li and tseng 2015 for the purpose of the present work the size of the energy storage is defined by its power output at 1 c a 1 c rate means that the charge discharge current will charge discharge the entire battery in 1 h the value is therefore inter changeable with capacity a n k w h battery will provide n k w of power at 1 c this approach offers an easy link between power demand and c rates the formulas used for the efficiency of the battery are those experimentally obtained by li and tseng 2015 4 η c h a r g e 0 003 c 2 0 0297 c 0 99814 5 η d i s c h a r g e 0 002232 c 2 0 0246 c 1 the effect of self discharge will also not be included as in the case of li ion batteries this is estimated at 0 1 0 3 a day hemmati and saboori 2016 note however that this can be higher if the soc is high and is dependent on temperature schmidt et al 2015 wang et al 2002 pathiyil et al 2016a b so self discharge may be worth including at the detailed design stage 3 2 transmission elements the efficiency of the relevant converters is generally high in the power range commonly found on board moreover the performance of these elements doesn t vary significantly over around 20 load aamir and mekhilef 2016 vazquez et al 2016 davari et al 2016 wang et al 2016 sivakumar et al 2016 szcześniak et al 2015 the highest values encountered in literature for the efficiency of these elements was considered in the present study as dictated by the research approach table 2 shows the values used in the calculations 3 3 internal combustion engines three different variations of the diesel engine were considered traditional diesel engine dual fuel engine in gas mode and diesel engine with sequential turbo charging stc these are the main options for engine selection in early ship design the choice is generally a trade off between efficiency low initial costs and technological maturity traditional diesel engine fuel costs and reduced green house gas emissions dual fuel engine and dynamic response stc engine as fig 1 shows these engines also exhibit different trends in their specific fuel consumption the gas engine has significantly worse relative low load performance than the diesel engine while engines with stc have almost constant sfc over the entire loading range the drop in efficiency at part load characteristic of diesel engines is crucial to any potential benefits of using energy storage to that effect a representative engine from each of the three categories was selected since there is very little difference in the relative part load performance of engines between different manufacturers specific fuel consumption data given by man diesel turbo was used as the basis of the calculations the values extracted from the product guides of these engines can be seen in table 3 the choice in manufacturer was made solely because of the availability of sfc data for the 10 loading point the diesel mode of the df engine was considered instead of another more traditional diesel engine because of the same reason after ensuring that the values were comparable 3 4 electrical machinery for the present study synchronous machines were used as they are the most common in hybrid applications el refaie 2013 calfo et al 2002 the efficiency of ac machines is heavily dependent on their rated power ferreira et al 2015 fortunately as the sizes increases the efficiency levels off at around 97 98 motors generators which can be used for on board power systems are expected to fall within this range the estimation of part load efficiency is more elusive manufacturers generally give a very slight drop in efficiency from nominal to 75 load however measurements done by dedes et al 2016 showed a drop of approximately 4 efficiency points in that load range moreover simulations starting from the individual losses suggested the opposite efficiency trend in the same load range zahedi and norum 2013 zahedi et al 2014 both cases were reported for optimal speed frequency since the main focus of the present study is on the best case scenario the most favourable efficiency will be used for the initial calculations flat 97 efficiency 4 energy storage use scenarios four scenarios are investigated based on combinations of two different criteria the type of propulsion and the intended use of the energy storage there are three main types of transmission on board ships mechanical electrical and hybrid from these only the electrical and hybrid can be combined with electrical energy storage the paths to and from the battery are the same in both transmission types generator rectifier battery charging battery discharging inverter motor however because of the original power flow when no energy storage is involved the relative benefits of using energy storage will differ significantly the second criterion used to differentiate between different use scenarios is whether the battery replaces some of the existing installed power downsizing or adds to the existing installed power providing an alternative power source at low loads 4 1 hybrid transmission hybrid transmission pto pti uses a shaft motor generator which can be used to link a traditional mechanical propulsion to an electric grid or a battery in this case the battery takes the power from the shaft and puts it back into the shaft in other words all the electric transmission losses are associated to the battery the transmission loss associated to the original propulsion system is just the gear box this is reflected in the formulas used to calculate the equivalent specific fuel consumption esfc of the system 6 η b e n c h m a r k η g e a r b o x 7 η b a t t e r y η g e n e r a t o r η r e c t i f i e r η c h a r g e η d i s c h a r g e η i n v e r t e r η m o t o r 4 2 electric transmission with electric transmission most of the electrical losses occur regardless of the presence of energy storage to that effect the power from the battery will be taken from and returned to the grid the losses of the generator rectifier inverter and motor are associated to the original system and only the charging and discharging losses are associated to the use of energy storage 8 η b e n c h m a r k η g e n e r a t o r η r e c t i f i e r η i n v e r t e r η m o t o r 9 η b a t t e r y η c h a r g e η d i s c h a r g e 4 3 energy storage replaces part of the installed power downsizing in the case of downsizing the esfc presented is composed of the esfc of the original system offset by the necessary amount for low loads and an averaged mean between the esfc of the engine and that of the battery at high loads equation 10 this is mainly representative of situations where energy storage is used to provide a boost to the engine at high speeds making it possible for the same maximum speed to be achieved with a smaller engine consequently the engine would run more efficiently over most of the operating range of the ship in the case of electric propulsion this is also representative of using energy storage to achieve redundancy requirements spinning reserve for example if two generator sets running at 25 load each to ensure the necessary spinning reserve one can be switched off if the energy storage can provide sufficient back up power this would lead to one generator set running at 50 load from the perspective of the equivalent specific fuel consumption this case is the same as the one above the last application reflected by these calculations is load levelling or peak shaving while this is mainly used to reduce severe transient loading of the engine and thus reduce maintenance costs it can also improve efficiency in some cases for example if the load is split between two engines and the load requirements fluctuate between 40 and 60 one of the engine can be turned off if energy storage is used for load levelling this case is also represented by the same esfc as the two above 10 e s f c i n e s f c i n l o a d 100 100 p b a t if l o a d 100 p b a t e s f c i n o p t i m u m e n g i n e

calculations were made under the assumption that the engine will be turned off and the battery will be used as an exclusive power source instead the amount of the installed power replaced by the battery was calculating assuming 1 c rate discharge this is in accordance with the best case scenario principle the equivalent specific fuel consumptions for the battery calculated in equation 7 and equation 9 are used to calculate the specific fuel consumption of the main engine adjusted for losses 11 e s f c i n a d j u s t e d f o r l o s s e s e s f c b a t o p t i m u m e n g i n e l o a d l

unfortunately cost models require significant input data which is dependent on local markets it is therefore not feasible to create a generic cost model however several criteria will have a direct and predictable impact on the total life cycle costs of the ship this section presents the three design criteria which will have the biggest influence on different costs the size of the battery will influence both initial costs and maintenance costs through the profile of the battery state of charge and consequently battery ageing barré et al 2013 the engine running hours is the most important criterion influencing maintenance costs and the operational profile together with the energy efficiency will determine the overall fuel costs 5 1 battery size for all types of engines the results will show only a slight benefit to the increase of battery power or capacity see section 3 1 in the case of battery only operation this happens because the only effect of size in the current model is in the dependency of the battery penalty factor efficiency on charge and discharge rates in reality however the capacity of the battery plays a much more important role as a small capacity would result in the engine needing to be turned on and off at a very high frequency the capacity required to obtain the presented results can be calculated by setting a minimum value for uninterrupted engine running time equation 12 if necessary the o p t i m u m l o a d parameter can be replaced with another load in order to obtain a lower battery capacity a subsequent replacement in equations 2 10 and 11 will show the efficiency penalty resulting from the decrease in battery capacity the battery capacity is also a predictor of size weight and initial costs 12 b a t t e r y c a p a c i t y o p t i m u m l o a d l o a d m i n i m u m u n i n t e r u p t e d e n g i n e r u n n i n g t i m e in the case of downsizing there is also a limit to the amount of power which can be replaced by energy storage an initial estimation of this value can be deduced from the basic operational profile of the ship equation 13 the load here was considered to be given as a percentage of the benchmark installed power 13 l o a d 1 100 p e r c e n t a g e o f t i m e s p e n t 100 p b a t m a x l o a d 0 5 2 engine running hours a common reason of using energy storage is to reduce the running hours of the engines on board since engine maintenance is generally performed after a certain number of running hours this can have a significant impact on maintenance costs the potential reduction in engine running hours is also dependent on the loading of the system the greatest reductions will be achieved if the engine is run at nominal load when charging the batteries equation 14 can be used to determine the reduction in engine running hours obtainable at different loading points the value represents the fraction of time the engines will be running if energy storage is present compared to the benchmark scenario 14 r u n n i n g h o u r s r a t i o 1 o p t i m u m e n g i n e l o a d l o a d l o a d 1 5 3 operational profiles in the concept design stage data regarding the operational profile is generally estimated by identifying different operating modes the characteristic load for each mode and the percentage of time the ship will spend in each mode as equations 1 to 3 10 and 11 are all a function of load they can be used to determine the sfc corresponding to each operating mode equation 15 determines the average relative efficiency gain for an operational profile given in this format 15 η g a i n n 1 n o m o d e s min e s f c i n c l o a d n e s f c b e n c h m a r k c l o a d n e s f c b e n c h m a r k c l o a d n e s f c b e n c h m a r k c l o a d n p n where η g a

the potential fuel savings obtainable by energy storage with those obtainable by increasing the number of engines the loading point of the engine needs to be adjusted accordingly and any redundancy requirements need to be accounted for equation 16 shows the appropriate equations to use if two engines are considered and no operating mode has particular redundancy requirements note that the relative efficiency gain obtained through this formula will overestimate the benefits as the decrease in efficiency with engine size is not taken into account 16 η g a i n n 1 n o m o d e s e s f c b

is on comparing the overall fuel costs then it is also important to keep in mind the relevance of the percentage of time the ship is in use 6 results this section shows the relative efficiency of using energy storage for different loading points scenarios and prime movers additionally the obtained results are analysed from two very important aspects the size of the battery and the sfc curve of the prime mover lastly in the case of downsizing a distinction is made between the benefits of energy storage and that of the efficiency driven selection of prime movers 6 1 relative efficiency the results obtained for configurations containing diesel engines are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 as expected the highest efficiency improvements are obtained in the case of diesel electric propulsion in such configurations the majority of transmission losses are present even if energy storage is not used in the case of hybrid transmission a significant amount of the energy saved by running the diesel engine at a more efficient loading point is lost by converting the mechanical energy into electrical energy and back in fact significant improvements in energy efficiency are observed only at the 10 loading point the figures also show that in most cases downsizing provides fewer benefits than increasing the total installed power and allowing battery only operation the drop in efficiency at low loads is much more pronounced in the case of gas engines consequently the efficiency improvements attainable through energy storage are more evident fig 4 and fig 5 in the case of engines equipped with sequential turbo chargers the specific fuel consumption varies very little throughout their entire operating range to that effect almost no benefits can be claimed by adding energy storage to such systems fig 6 6 2 benchmark sfc curve as can be seen from the three cases presented above the shape of the benchmark esfc curve is the main determining factor for the applicability of energy storage to a particular system moreover this also holds true for a specific loading case indeed because of the capacity constraint it might be more efficient to run the engine in a suboptimal loading point from equation 2 and equation 3 it follows that the minimum requirement of the benchmark esfc in order to obtain any efficiency benefits from using energy storage is given by equation 17 note that the units of measurement are irrelevant for this equation 17 e s f c b e n c h m a r k l o a d s u r p l u s e s f c b e n c h m a r k l o a d s u r p l u s b a t t e r y p e n a l t y l o a d s u r p l u s l o a d 6 3 downsizing while the three cases represented by downsizing pti load levelling and spinning reserve all result in the same equivalent specific fuel consumption in the case of pti the benefits obtained are not specific to the use of energy storage in fact better fuel efficiency can be achieved by using an additional engine this is evidently not a good alternative if energy storage is used as spinning reserve as it is the very option it replaces to a certain extent this also holds true for load levelling where dynamic loading would not allow for the additional engine to be turned on and off at the demanded rate in other words it depends on whether the energy storage is used to literally downsize the main engine or if it is used to avoid turning on an additional engine 6 4 validation state of the art in this area generally focuses on advanced techniques in control and energy management to that effect few studies have been done that isolate the benefits of energy storage nonetheless zahedi et al 2014 offers a great opportunity for validation as the results not only isolate the effect of energy storage but are also broken down by operating modes the operating modes are defined by a characteristic loading of the system and therefore are easily comparable with the obtained results as can be seen from table 4 the obtained results are generally overly optimistic in keeping with the best case scenario strategy adopted this discrepancy is further exacerbated by the fact that the dc system in the comparison study allows for variable speed operation at part load of the generator sets which affects the shape of the sfc curve and diminishes the benefits of energy storage the only unexplained result appears in the 33 5 loading point which represents the transit supply operating mode unfortunately the level of detail provided in the comparison study does not allow for a more in depth explanation of this error other studies also seem to support the present results for example dedes et al 2016 reports a 5 81 increase in efficiency at approximately 50 load which is only slightly smaller than the obtained 7 87 in godjevac et al 2017 fuel savings of 15 are reported for the use of energy storage as spinning reserve in the case of dynamic positioning this is similar to the 18 94 reduction obtained for the same case with the proposed method downsizing scenario 7 discussion due to the practical nature of the presented work it is important to emphasize both its applicability and its limitations the structure of this section reflects this fact 7 1 applicability the fact that determining the right capacity for the on board energy storage and designing a suitable control strategy are such complex tasks is the main reason why it is important to have a preliminary assessment of the applicability of energy storage for a specific ship moreover the simplicity of the equations allows for a large number of different configurations to be analysed and thus facilitates a pre selection of the configurations investigated by more complex simulations the exclusive use of algebraic equations also makes the model suitable for integration into complex optimization algorithms the examples presented here were for arbitrarily selected sample engines representing the different operating principles which most affect the shape of the sfc curve naturally the equations can be used with any specific fuel consumption data available further more as was shown in the test case the formulas can be easily scaled for configurations containing multiple engines overall this allows for preliminary estimations of potential fuel savings from energy storage for a specific operational profile to be calculated almost instantly additionally an initial comparison of several competing configurations is easily accessible the additional criteria included can be integrated into cost models for an initial estimation of total life cycle costs 7 2 limitations the proposed method has seven main limitations 1 the constant efficiency of the electric motor generator can artificially inflate the estimated benefits in the case of hybrid transmission and underestimate them in the case of electric transmission this enforces the already noted fact that energy storage offers more benefits when used together with electric propulsion 2 when designing on board power systems with energy storage the capacity of the batteries is generally one of the key parameters however determining this parameter is not only the result of a complex trade off which also needs to take into account battery ageing but it also requires a much more detailed operational profile specifically the order and duration of the different operating modes 3 the control strategy of the power system also plays an important role an advance strategy can lead to savings of around 9 vu et al 2015 4 downsizing and battery operation have been presented here as two distinct scenarios it was assumed that in the case of downsizing battery only operation was not possible as the batteries needed to maintain a minimum state of charge for redundancy purposes in practice for some operational profiles advanced control algorithms can ensure the viability of combined systems in which the energy storage can be used for both downsizing and as an alternative power source 5 several other smaller factors are assumed to be investigated in a more detailed design stage while the main costs considerations are related to the fuel consumption and the size capacity of the battery maintenance costs of the engines are also affected by the use of energy storage positively by avoiding operation at very low loads and negatively by potentially turning them on and off more often another aspect that can influence the results is local environmental restrictions for example reducing noise can be an incentive for battery only operation 6 the availability and price of shore power plays an important role in estimating the benefits of energy storage for a particular case while this was not explicitly included in the model it can be added easily if fuel consumption is replaced with costs 7 at the 10 loading point the efficiency of the transmission elements may be significantly lower than the values used if this loading point is of particular interest the values should be adapted accordingly the limitations presented above reinforce the suitability of the method for the concept design stage 8 conclusions several general observations on the use of energy storage on board ships can be made from the presented results 1 systems with electric transmission benefit more from the use of energy storage than systems with hybrid transmission as there are less losses associated to the battery 2 the size of the battery is mostly relevant through the limitations on its use imposed by capacity in the case of battery only operation or through how much of the installed engine power it can replace by comparison the effect on efficiency resulting from different c rates are negligible 3 gas engines benefit significantly more from energy storage as their efficiency decreases more drastically with load 4 engines with sequential turbo charging are unsuitable for use with energy storage from the perspective of energy efficiency 5 at most operating points using the batteries as an additional power source increasing the installed power results in higher potential fuel savings than downsizing the engines 6 energy storage shows potential for fuel savings only for low load operation using energy storage at high loads can actually lead to increased fuel consumption the conclusions listed above offer some very basic guidelines for the design of on board power systems with energy storage however the strength of the present work lies in its easy adaptability to specific cases providing insight at a very early stage in the design process acknowledgements this

screw ship hull propeller rudder interaction rans simulation 1 introduction with the increase of ship s tonnage the twin propeller twin rudder configuration which can meet the requirements of operation under different traveling condition is adopted in more ship design schemes however the maneuvering characteristics of the configuration have not been clarified completely for the complicated flow field around stern rudder is a commonly used steering device and its performance determining ship maneuverability is highly affected by the ship wake and propeller slipstream thus it is necessary to clarify the interaction mechanism of hull propeller and rudder several relevant researches using experimental approach have been reported representatively molland and turnock 1991 1995 2002 carried out a series of wind tunnel tests for different configurations of hull propeller and rudder to investigate the effects of hull length drift angle and propeller loading on the performance of rudder nagarajan et al 2009 atsavapranee et al 2010 kang et al 2011 khanfir et al 2011 and ortolani et al 2015a 2015b carried out a series of experiments for a ship model with twin rudder configuration to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristic of propeller and rudder under specified maneuvering motions however it is hard to obtain a sufficient understanding of the interaction mechanism during maneuvers due to the limitation of experiment facilities especially the flow characteristic around the stern computational fluid dynamics cfd approach can be a promising alternative to clarify the interaction phenomenon and can provide more details of flow field and hydrodynamic characteristics a lot of studies on the numerical simulation of flow around propeller and rudder were reported but most of them focused on the isolated rudder or propeller rudder configuration in uniform inflow van nguyen and ikeda 2013 2014 and liu et al 2015 studied the hydrodynamic characteristic of isolated rudder with different geometry operating in open water condition phillips et al 2010 krasilnikov et al 2011 caldas et al 2011 sánchez caja et al 2008 2015 di mascio et al 2015 sun et al 2016 zhao et

be obtained through the simulation of flow field around a fully appended ship model badoe et al 2015 studied the interaction effects for a hull propeller rudder configuration under different drift

longitudinal and transverse rudder position on the performance of propeller and rudder dubbioso et al 2015 2017 muscari et al 2017b 2017c investigated the asymmetric behavior of propeller rudder system and the bearing loads of propeller for the twin screw ships during maneuvers the dynamic simulation of ship maneuvers considering the interaction of hull propeller and rudder is attainable nowadays the approach has the advantage of providing more details about the interaction phenomenon during practical maneuvers enabling a deeper understanding of the physical processes venkatesan and clark 2007 chase et al 2013 and martin et al 2015 performed simulations of maneuvers in the horizontal and vertical planes for a submarine model carrica et al 2013 broglia et al 2013 2015 and dubbioso et al 2016 carried out simulations of turning circle and zigzag maneuvers for a twin screw ship model the dynamic simulation of ship maneuvers can obtain directly the maneuverability parameters such as tactical diameter overshoot angle and so on however it is hard to identify the factors affecting the performance of propeller and rudder and the computation is quite time and computational resource consuming on the whole most studies focused on the interaction of hull propeller and rudder for the typical single screw ship while limited researches on the twin screw ship type were reported actually there are specific characteristics for the flow field around a ship with twin propeller twin rudder configuration such as the asymmetric flow straightening effect in this study the hull propeller rudder interaction phenomenon is investigated by using cfd method and the onr tumblehome ship model with twin propeller twin rudder configuration is selected as the study subject based on

condition is imposed on the top of the domain according to the double body model differently the dimension of computational domain is expanded with 1 1 l z 1 1 l for the self propulsion simulation and the velocity inlet boundary condition with zero pressure gradient is imposed on the top of the domain a smaller cylindrical computational domain is adopted to contain the rotating propeller and the interface boundary condition is imposed on the interface between the cylindrical computational domain and the global computational domain besides the no slip wall boundary condition is applied on the whole solid surface of the ship and appendages the computational domain is discretized with unstructured hexahedral grid the grid refinement is set for hull and appendages to ensure sufficient solution of the flow field around the ship as shown in fig 4 in view of the complicated flow field around stern a refinement block is laid under the stern vault to capture the evolution of the slipstream generated by the propellers and their interaction with the rudders downstream as for the grid on the propeller finer gird spacing is applied to the edge of blade while the coarser grid

small iterative uncertainty u i s g 1 is achieved for the majority of quantities in table 4 all quantities achieve the time step convergence with r t 1 only the thrust k t s torque k q s and rudder normal force f n p present monotonic convergence meanwhile the estimated order of accuracy p t approaches to the theoretical order of accuracy p t e s t for thrust k t s and torque k q s it indicates that the resolution for them with the present time step is close to the asymptotic range the converged components present reasonably small time step uncertainty u t s t 1 the iterative uncertainty u i is also given in table 4 which is estimated on the basis of the convergence history of the case with time step s t 1 the iterative uncertainty u i s t 1 is with small magnitude for all quantities through the convergence study for the selected case the impact of grid spacing and time step on the numerical results is quantified the reasonably small interactive uncertainty demonstrates that the grid and time step uncertainties are less affected by the convergence of calculation it is shown that the thrust torque and rudder normal force are hard to achieve monotonic convergence in terms of grid and time step which may result from the complicated interaction of hull propeller and rudder nonetheless satisfactory grid and time step uncertainties are obtained for the investigated quantities in present resolution considering the small magnitude of ε 21 s g 1 and ε 21 s t 1 the case with grid s g 2 and time step s t 2 presents sufficient accuracy for the present study hence the medium grid and time step are adopted in the subsequent simulations making tradeoff between the computation efficiency and accuracy 5 numerical results 5 1 interaction between hull and propeller the self propulsion test under f r 0 2 is simulated to quantify the interaction between hull and propeller where the effect of free surface is taken into account the propeller revolutions n under the self propulsion point of model is set up in accordance with the published experimental data mofidi et al 2015 since there is no available experimental data of hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and propeller in the self propulsion test the present numerical results are compared with the published cfd data mofidi et al 2015 as listed in table 5 the total resistance friction and pressure coefficients c t c f and c p are defined using the wetted surface area s 0 1 5 m2 and the ship speed u it can be seen that the present computation presents good consistence with the published cfd data in terms of thrust torque and resistance coefficients under the self propulsion point of model based on the present cfd results the thrust deduction fraction can be obtained with the resistance test data cook 2011 while the effective wake fraction can be obtained with the published propeller open water characteristic tokyo 2015 using the thrust identity method it gives t p 0 0854 and w p 0 1101 5 2 propeller side force the propeller side force y p under condition of static drift and cmt with δ 0 is depicted in fig 5 the propeller side force increases with the increasing drift angle and yaw rate indicating that there is a positive correlation between the side force and lateral inflow however the side force presents different tendency for the portside and starboard propellers with the change of drift angle the variation of side force of propeller presents apparent non linearity differently the trend of side force approaches to a linear relationship approximately for the propellers with the increase of yaw rate the portside propeller presents larger side force than that of starboard propeller suggesting a more significant flow straightening effect for the flow field around the leeward propeller for the sake of simplification a linear relationship is determined between the total side force and drift angle and yaw rate according to eq 7 the coefficients c y p and l p are obtained through linear regression giving the values of 0 0334 and 0 4804 respectively 5 3 interaction between hull and rudder the interaction coefficients between hull and rudder are usually determined at a representative propeller load neglecting the slight variation of a h with the increase of propeller load yasukawa 1992 fig 6 summarizes the hydrodynamic forces and moments obtained from the rudder force test under n 538rpm which is the self propulsion point of model at f r 0 2 according to eqs 10 13 the interaction coefficients of t r 0 2011 a h 0 1964 z h r 0 0292 and x h 0 3350 are obtained through linear regression of the numerical results with the longitudinal position of rudder shaft x r 0 4459 5 4 rudder normal force the results of static drift test and cmt simulations with various rudder angles are plotted in fig 7 it is shown that the normal forces of windward and leeward rudders present different tendency demonstrating the asymmetric flow straightening effect for the twin screw ship under maneuvering motions with the numerical results the neutral rudder angle δ f n 0 and the corresponding slope of the normal force coefficient versus rudder angle d f n d δ are determined under different β and r in fig 8 the computed δ f n 0 is compared with the available experimental data umeda et al 2014 and the data for negative drift angle and yaw rate are obtained from the symmetry of cfd results the numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental data overall besides v r p u r is determined by δ f n 0 obtained from the simulation of rudder force test with n 538 rpm the lateral inflow to the rudder v r is obtained with δ f n 0 and d f n d δ under different β and r as plotted in fig 9 according to eq 17 the flow straightening coefficient γ r is determined from the relation between v r and β while the correlation factor l r is determined by the relation of v r and r obviously the flow straightening coefficient γ r and the correlation factor l r are different for the windward and leeward rudders the results of rudder force test with various propeller loads are plotted in fig 10 with the increase of propeller load the rudder normal force is enhanced for the both rudders and the difference between the portside and starboard rudders is slightly enlarged especially under larger rudder angle the longitudinal inflow to the rudder u r is obtained from the slope of the relation between f n and δ at δ 0 and the relation between u r 2 u p 2 and 8 k t π j 2 is plotted in fig 11 the relation obtained from the cfd data exhibits similar slope to that from the efd data umeda et al 2014 it presents a smaller intercept on the axis of u r 2 u p 2 suggesting that the effect of propeller slipstream on the flow around rudder is underestimated by cfd method the coefficients of ε and κ are determined through the nonlinear regression according to eq 16 where the percentage of rudder area in propeller race is η 0 6667 the computed parameters in the module of rudder normal force are summarized in table 6 in comparison with the available experimental data umeda et al 2014 it is worth noting that the original correlation factor l r of efd data was regressed by a function different from eq 17 hence it is recomputed for the purpose of comparison as can be seen in table 6 part of efd data presents different values for the portside and starboard rudders it may be caused by the uncertainty of experiment on the whole the coefficients computed from the present cfd results show reasonable agreement with those from the efd data considering the complicated characteristic of the hull propeller rudder interaction 5 5 velocity fields around stern a series of axial velocity contours around the stern and the pressure distribution on the representative rudder sections are presented to further inspect the interaction phenomenon during maneuvering motions for the twin screw ship the longitudinal position of propeller in relation to the rudder is illustrated in fig 12 where the symbols c and s denote the chord length of mid span and the span length respectively the longitudinal location of x 0 0c is located at the rudder shaft for the sake of comparison and analysis three cases c1 c2 and c3 are chosen and described in table 7 the case c1 is defined as the original case while the cases c2 and c3 are selected to exhibit the effect of ship motion and propeller load respectively the axial velocity contours at four longitudinal positions are plotted in figs 13 15 including x 0 75c behind the propeller disk x 0 25c front part of the rudder x 0 25c aft part of the rudder and x 0 75c behind the rudder trailing edge with two dashed circles illustrating the propeller and its hub these plots show the back views of flow field around stern in fig 13 a there is a high velocity region behind the propeller disk with the acceleration effect of propeller race this effect influences the flow all along the rudder surface inside the slipstream as shown in fig 13 b c and d under the effect of rudder angle the flow is accelerated remarkably nearby the suction sides of the rudders while the flow around the opposite sides is less influenced the effect of rudder angle on the flow field is fading out along the longitudinal direction and the propeller slipstream is deflected slightly in the development process in addition there is an apparent difference between the velocity contours around the portside and starboard rudders a smaller high velocity region appears near the tip of the portside rudder while the high velocity region almost covers the inner side of the starboard rudder in the propeller slipstream from fig 14 it can be seen that the distribution of axial velocity around stern is remarkably influenced by the lateral inflow induced by the drift angle the ship wake and propeller slipstream are apparently deflected along the longitudinal direction besides the impact of drift angle on the flow field around the portside and starboard rudders is different the magnitude of axial velocity exhibits an indistinctive difference nearby the both sides of the portside rudder on the contrast the high velocity region is still apparent around the inner side of the starboard rudder while a smaller high velocity region appears near the tip of the outer side of the starboard rudder the flow field demonstrates an asymmetric flow straightening effect for the rudders of twin screw ship during maneuvers and the leeward rudder would be less affected by the lateral inflow as for the case c3 with higher propeller revolutions the axial velocity contours present similar distribution to the original case but the magnitude of axial velocity is larger as shown in fig 15 it can be concluded that the acceleration effect of propeller slipstream on the flow around the rudders is more remarkable with the increase of propeller load 5 6 pressure distribution on rudder surface to further investigate the local load acting on the rudder during maneuvers the pressure distributions on the rudder surface at some representative spanwise positions z 0 25s z 0 5s and z 0 75s as shown in fig 12 are presented in fig 16 the calculated pressure distribution is plotted separately for inner and outer surfaces of the rudders the pressure is expressed by the non dimensional coefficient c p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the local pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure from fig 16 it can be seen that in the case c1 the suction and pressure sides are clearly to distinguish for the both rudders the pressure distributions on the portside and starboard rudders are different especially at the position of z 0 25s and z 0 5s in fig 16 a b c and d the high pressure regions are observed on the leading edge of the portside rudder while they move forward along the chordwise direction on the outer side of the starboard rudder overall the starboard rudder presents a larger pressure difference than that of the portside rudder this difference is mainly caused by the circumferential slipstreams of propeller it results in the moving of the stationary points on the rudder surface and produces a low pressure region due to the blocking effect of rudder surface the circumferential slipstreams induced by the propeller hub is relatively weak hence the pressure distribution on the position of z 0 75s is similar for the both rudders as shown in fig 16 e and f compared to the original case c1 the case c2 with the applied drift angle presents different pressure distribution on the rudder surface the portside rudder presents a smaller pressure difference between its outer and inner sides due to the effect of lateral inflow on the contrary the starboard rudder is less influenced by the lateral inflow and presents a similar pressure distribution as that in the case c1 it also presents an asymmetric flow straightening effect for the twin screw ship during maneuvers in the case c3 with higher propeller load the pressure distribution shows a similar tendency as that in the case c1 while the peak value of pressure is enlarged however the pressure difference at different spanwise positions presents a non monotonic tendency with the increase of propeller load especially at z 0 25s and 0 5s it is caused by the combined effect of the strengthened longitudinal and circumferential slipstreams the longitudinal slipstream enhances the magnitudes of high pressure and low pressure for the both rudders on the contrast the circumferential slipstream has opposite effect on the portside rudder and starboard rudder decreasing the pressure difference of the portside rudder while increasing that of the starboard rudder 6 free maneuvers simulation in order to further verify the reasonability of the numerical results the system based sb simulation of free maneuvers is performed using the computed hydrodynamic coefficients a 4 dof mmg mathematical model proposed by araki et al 2012 is adopted to describe the ship motion the hydrodynamic derivatives for the hull are obtained from the cfd simulation of cmt static drift and static heel test while the inertia terms of m x m y j x and j z and the linear damping coefficient k p are taken from guo and zou 2017 as given in table 8 the relation between k t and j is determined with the propeller open water characteristic data published at the tokyo 2015 workshop on cfd in ship hydrodynamics tokyo 2015 the computed parameters in the modules of propeller and rudder in this study are summarized in table 9 the turning circle test of δ 35 at f r 0 2 is simulated by solving the established mmg model with runge kutta 4 rk4 algorithm and the rudder deflects with the rate of 35 s at the beginning in fig 17 and table 10 the simulated trajectory and time histories of kinematic parameters are compared with the available experimental data elshiekh 2014 and the published dynamic cfd simulation results wang et al 2016 it is shown that the trajectories of turning circle test obtained by both the dynamic cfd simulation and the present sb simulation match well with the experimental data with respect to the predicted maneuverability parameters advance transfer tactical diameter and turning diameter the present sb simulation presents a similar level of accuracy as that of the dynamic cfd simulation on the whole satisfactory accuracy is obtained for the prediction of the maneuverability parameters with the deviation less than 5 in addition it can be seen that the overall trends of the kinematic parameters predicted by the present sb simulation match well with the experimental data the speed drift angle and yaw rate after reaching to the steady turning condition are slightly overestimated with the deviation less than 10 the time history of lateral force acting on the rudders during the turning circle test are presented in fig 18 there is an obvious difference between the lateral forces acting on the portside and starboard rudders the portside rudder is on the leeward side and the starboard rudder is on the windward side during the present turning circle test simulation due to the asymmetric flow straightening effect the starboard rudder is more influenced by the lateral inflow resulting in a remarkably smaller lateral force than that of the portside rudder the difference is close to 50 of the lateral force acting on the portside rudder under the steady turning condition in fig 19 the phase of rudder executing is compared with the dynamic cfd simulation there is a good coherence in the lateral forces on portside rudder predicted by the dynamic cfd simulation and present sb simulation however remarkable difference appears in the lateral force on starboard rudder especially at the beginning and end of rudder executing on the whole a similar tendency is obtained by the dynamic cfd simulation and the present sb simulation 7 conclusions in this study the interaction of hull propeller and rudder during maneuvers is investigated for a twin screw ship by using cfd method the modified modules of propeller and rudder in mmg model are introduced to describe the hydrodynamic performance of propellers and rudders during maneuvers for the twin screw ship and the propeller side force and the asymmetric flow straightening effect are taken into account the self propulsion test rudder force test static drift test and cmt are simulated with rans method the interaction factors among the hull propeller and rudder are computed from the numerical results and the propeller side force and rudder normal force are modelled for the twin screw ship besides the numerical results are compared with the available experimental data and reasonable agreement is achieved the velocity field around the stern is presented to visualize the influence of ship motion and propeller load on the flow around the rudder meanwhile the pressure distribution on the rudder surface at some representative spanwise positions is plotted to clarify the change of local load on the rudder surface under conditions of static drift and higher propeller load the analysis of flow field and the pressure distribution on the rudder surface provide further information on the mechanism affecting the rudder performance by the ship motion and propeller load during maneuvers for the twin screw ship the system based simulation of turning circle test is performed using the obtained modules of propeller and rudder the simulated trajectory and time histories of some kinematic and dynamic quantities exhibit good agreement with the available experimental data and other cfd results particularly satisfactory accuracy is obtained in the prediction of the maneuverability parameters of advance transfer tactical diameter and turning diameter it demonstrates the reasonability of the propeller and rudder force modules for the twin screw ship and the promising applicability of the cfd method in the investigation of hull propeller rudder interaction however it should be pointed out that the present work mainly focuses on the rudder force modelling for the twin screw ship using cfd method the module of propeller is simplified without considering the asymmetry of propeller load and propeller side force therefore to further improve the applicability of the system based method in maneuverability prediction of twin screw ships the hydrodynamic characteristic of propellers during maneuvers should be investigated in the future study acknowledgements this work is financially

available experimental data and other cfd results indicating the validity of the cfd based modelling method for hull propeller rudder interaction of twin screw ships keywords ship maneuvering twin screw ship hull propeller rudder interaction rans simulation 1 introduction with the increase of ship s tonnage the twin propeller twin rudder configuration which can meet the requirements of operation under different traveling condition is adopted in more ship design schemes however the maneuvering characteristics of the configuration have not been clarified completely for the complicated flow field around stern rudder is a commonly used steering device and its performance determining ship maneuverability is highly affected by the ship wake and propeller slipstream thus it is necessary to clarify the interaction mechanism of hull propeller and rudder several relevant researches using experimental approach have been reported representatively molland and turnock 1991 1995 2002 carried out a series of wind tunnel tests for different configurations of hull propeller and rudder to investigate the effects of hull length drift angle and propeller loading on the performance of rudder nagarajan et al 2009 atsavapranee et al 2010 kang et al 2011 khanfir et al 2011 and ortolani et al 2015a 2015b carried out a series of experiments for a ship model with twin rudder configuration to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristic of propeller and rudder under specified maneuvering motions however it is hard to obtain a sufficient understanding of the interaction mechanism during maneuvers due to the limitation of experiment facilities especially the flow characteristic around the stern computational fluid dynamics cfd approach can be a promising alternative to clarify the interaction phenomenon and can provide more details of flow field and hydrodynamic characteristics a lot of studies on the numerical simulation of flow around propeller and rudder were reported but most of them focused on the isolated rudder or propeller rudder configuration in uniform inflow van nguyen and ikeda 2013 2014 and liu et al 2015 studied the hydrodynamic characteristic of isolated rudder with different geometry operating in open water condition phillips et al 2010 krasilnikov et al 2011 caldas et al 2011 sánchez caja et al 2008 2015 di mascio et al 2015 sun et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 and muscari et al 2017a studied the interaction of propeller and rudder including the details of flow field and rudder performance a more sufficient understanding of interaction mechanism can be obtained through the simulation of flow field around a fully appended ship model badoe et al 2015 studied the interaction effects for a hull propeller rudder configuration under different drift angles and hull lengths lee et al 2008 investigated the flow characteristic around a kind of high lift rudder interacting with upstream hull and propeller jamali 2011 studied the effect of different longitudinal and transverse rudder position on the performance of propeller and rudder dubbioso et al 2015 2017 muscari et al 2017b 2017c investigated the asymmetric behavior of propeller rudder system and the bearing loads of propeller for the twin screw ships during maneuvers the dynamic simulation of ship maneuvers considering the interaction of hull propeller and rudder is attainable nowadays the approach has the advantage of providing more details about the interaction phenomenon during practical maneuvers enabling a deeper understanding of the physical processes venkatesan and clark 2007 chase et al 2013 and martin et al 2015 performed simulations of maneuvers in the horizontal and vertical planes for a submarine model carrica et al 2013 broglia et al 2013 2015 and dubbioso et al 2016 carried out simulations of turning circle and zigzag maneuvers for a twin screw ship model the dynamic simulation of ship maneuvers can obtain directly the maneuverability parameters such as tactical diameter overshoot angle and so on however it is hard to identify the factors affecting the performance of propeller and rudder and the computation is quite time and computational resource consuming on the whole most studies focused on the interaction of hull propeller and rudder for the typical single screw ship while limited researches on the twin screw ship type were reported actually there are specific characteristics for the flow field around a ship with twin propeller twin rudder configuration such as the asymmetric flow straightening effect in this study the hull propeller rudder interaction phenomenon is investigated by using cfd method and the onr tumblehome ship model with twin propeller twin rudder configuration is selected as the study subject based on the solution of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations numerical simulations of self propulsion test rudder force test static drift test and circular motion test cmt are performed for the ship model the hydrodynamic models of propeller and rudder are established based on the numerical results part of the computed parameters in the hydrodynamic models is compared with the available experimental data and other numerical results the principal characteristics of velocity field around the stern and the pressure distribution on the rudder surface are presented to provide a deeper insight into the effect of ship motion and propeller load on the rudder performance finally the system based simulation of turning circle test is performed using the established modules of propeller and rudder the simulated trajectory and time histories of kinematic and dynamic quantities are compared with the available experimental data and other numerical results 2 mathematical model the 4 dof

forces and moments on propellers and rudders can be formulated considering interaction phenomenon and ship moving state for the propeller module the thrust is described by eq 5 the propeller side force is relevant to the total hydrodynamic force acting on the ship during maneuvers especially for the twin screw ship type referring to the related research of broglia et al 2013 it can be expressed with the relation to drift angle and yaw rate as given in eq 7 correspondingly the roll and yaw moments on the propeller is presented in eqs 8 and 9 the subscripts p and s in parenthesis or refer to portside and starboard of the twin screw ship respectively 5 x p u n 1 t p 0 ρ n 2 d p 4 k t p j p k t s j s 6 j p s 1 w p 0 u n d p 7 y p u v r c y p β l p r 8 k p u v r z p y p u v r 9 n p

motion and propeller load referring to the modelling process presented by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 a series of captive model tests are needed to clarify the hydrodynamic characteristic of propeller and rudder during ship maneuvers 3 numerical method numerical simulation of the flow around a moving ship is performed using the rans solver of the commercial cfd platform star ccm the governing equations for the viscous flow are closed by the isotropic blended sst k ω turbulence model an all y treatment is selected for near wall flow solution which is a hybrid treatment employing wall

dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi module is adopted to simulate the ship motion the earth fixed and ship fixed coordinate systems are applied to describe the ship motion the desired motions are implemented in the earth fixed coordinate system by moving the whole computational domain in order to capture the effect of free surface the two phase volume of fluid vof method is adopted for self propulsion simulation while the double body method is employed to simplify the resolution of free surface for the simulation of rudder force test static drift test and cmt two numerical schemes moving reference frame mrf and sliding mesh sm are used to simulate the flow field around the rotating propeller the computation with mrf scheme is performed to obtain an approximate initial flow field and then the simulation with sm scheme continues for several propeller revolutions until convergence 3 1 geometry and condition the onr tumblehome ship onrt published by the us office of naval research is selected as the study object which is a kind of twin screw ship appended with skeg bilge keels shafts and brackets the ship is equipped with two spade rudders which are a kind of balanced rudders with

condition with zero pressure gradient is imposed on the surrounding surfaces and the bottom of the cuboid computational domain to describe the flow in far field while the symmetry plane boundary condition is imposed on the top of the domain according to the double body model differently the dimension of computational domain is expanded with 1 1 l z 1 1 l for the self propulsion simulation and the velocity inlet boundary condition with zero pressure gradient is imposed on the top of the domain a smaller cylindrical computational domain is adopted to contain the rotating propeller and the interface boundary condition is imposed on the interface between the cylindrical computational domain and the global computational domain besides the no slip wall boundary condition is applied on the whole solid surface of the ship and appendages the computational domain is discretized with unstructured hexahedral grid the grid refinement is set for hull and appendages to ensure sufficient solution of the flow field around the ship as shown in fig 4 in view of the complicated flow field around stern a refinement block is laid under the stern vault to capture the evolution of the slipstream generated by the propellers and their interaction with the rudders downstream as for the grid on the propeller finer gird spacing is applied to the edge of blade while the coarser grid

convergence study the convergence study is performed with the methodology presented by stern et al 1999 xing and stern 2010 since it is hard to carry out the convergence study for the whole computation the pure rudder force test with n 538rpm δ 10 under f r 0 2 is selected as the study case the convergence study focuses on the hydrodynamic force acting on the propellers and rudders three grid points of 7 34 106 s g 1 3 34 106 s g 2 and 1 67 106 s g 3 are generated based on the refinement ratio of 2 meanwhile three time steps of 0 93 10 3s s t 1 1 86 10 3s s t 2 and 3 72 10 3s s t 3 are selected based on refinement ratio of 2 corresponding to a propeller rotation of 3 6 and 12 per time step the grid convergence study is performed with medium time step s t 2 and the time step convergence study is performed with the medium grid s g 2 the results of grid and time step convergence study are given in table 3 and table 4 according to the spatial and temporal discretization scheme the theoretical order of accuracy p g e s t 2 and p t e s t 1 are adopted respectively mon osc and div denote monotonic convergence oscillatory convergence and divergence respectively in table 3 the grid convergence is achieved for all quantities with r g 1 most of them present monotonic convergence except for torque k q s and rudder normal force f n p the estimated order of accuracy p g approaches to the theoretical order of accuracy p g e s t for thrust k t p and torque k q p indicating that the resolution for them is close to the asymptotic range overall the majority of quantities shows reasonably small grid uncertainty u g s g 1 the iterative uncertainty u i is given in table 3 which is estimated on the basis of the convergence history of the case with grid s g 1 the rather small iterative uncertainty u i s g 1 is achieved for the majority of quantities in table 4 all quantities achieve the time step convergence with r t 1 only the thrust k t s torque k q s and rudder normal force f n p present monotonic convergence meanwhile the estimated order of accuracy p t approaches to the theoretical order of accuracy p t e s t for thrust k t s and torque k q s it indicates that the resolution for them with the present time step is close to the asymptotic range the converged components present reasonably small time step uncertainty u t s t 1 the iterative uncertainty u i is also given in table 4 which is estimated on the basis of the convergence history of the case with time step s t 1 the iterative uncertainty u i s t 1 is with small magnitude for all quantities through the convergence study for the selected case the impact of grid spacing and time step on the numerical results is quantified the reasonably small interactive uncertainty demonstrates that the grid and time step uncertainties are less affected by the convergence of calculation it is shown that the thrust torque and rudder normal force are hard to achieve monotonic convergence in terms of grid and time step which may result from the complicated interaction of hull propeller and rudder nonetheless satisfactory grid and time step uncertainties are obtained for the investigated quantities in present resolution considering the small magnitude of ε 21 s g 1 and ε 21 s t 1 the case with grid s g 2 and time step s t 2 presents sufficient accuracy for the present study hence the medium grid and time step are adopted in the subsequent simulations making tradeoff between the computation efficiency and accuracy 5 numerical results 5 1 interaction between hull and propeller the self propulsion test under f r 0 2 is simulated to quantify the interaction between hull and propeller where the effect of free surface is taken into account the propeller revolutions n under the self propulsion point of model is set up in accordance with the published experimental data mofidi et al 2015 since there is no available experimental data of hydrodynamic forces acting on the hull and propeller in the self propulsion test the present numerical results are compared with the published cfd data mofidi et al 2015 as listed in table 5 the total resistance friction and pressure coefficients c t c f and c p are defined using the wetted surface area s 0 1 5 m2 and the ship speed u it can be seen that the present computation presents good consistence with the published cfd data in terms of thrust torque and resistance coefficients under the self propulsion point of model based on the present cfd results the thrust deduction fraction can be obtained with the resistance test data cook 2011 while the effective wake fraction can be obtained with the published propeller open water characteristic tokyo 2015 using the thrust identity method it gives t p 0 0854 and w p 0 1101 5 2 propeller side force the propeller side force y p under condition of static drift and cmt with δ 0 is depicted in fig 5 the propeller side force increases with the increasing drift angle and yaw rate indicating that there is a positive correlation between the side force and lateral inflow however the side force presents different tendency for the portside and starboard propellers with the change of drift angle the variation of side force of propeller presents apparent non linearity differently the trend of side force approaches to a linear relationship approximately for the propellers with the increase of yaw rate the portside propeller presents larger side force than that of starboard propeller suggesting a more significant flow straightening effect for the flow field around the leeward propeller for the sake of simplification a linear relationship is determined between the total side force and drift angle and yaw rate according to eq 7 the coefficients c y p and l p are obtained through linear regression giving the values of 0 0334 and 0 4804 respectively 5 3 interaction between hull and rudder the interaction coefficients between hull and rudder are usually determined at a representative propeller load neglecting the slight variation of a h with the increase of propeller load yasukawa 1992 fig 6 summarizes the hydrodynamic forces and moments obtained from the rudder force test under n 538rpm which is the self propulsion point of model at f r 0 2 according to eqs 10 13 the interaction coefficients of t r 0 2011 a h 0 1964 z h r 0 0292 and x h 0 3350 are obtained through linear regression of the numerical results with the longitudinal position of rudder shaft x r 0 4459 5 4 rudder normal force the results of static drift test and cmt simulations with various rudder angles are plotted in fig 7 it is shown that the normal forces of windward and leeward rudders present different tendency demonstrating the asymmetric flow straightening effect for the twin screw ship under maneuvering motions with the numerical results the neutral rudder angle δ f n 0 and the corresponding slope of the normal force coefficient versus rudder angle d f n d δ are determined under different β and r in fig 8 the computed δ f n 0 is compared with the available experimental data umeda et al 2014 and the data for negative drift angle and yaw rate are obtained from the symmetry of cfd results the numerical results show a good agreement with the experimental data overall besides v r p u r is determined by δ f n 0 obtained from the simulation of rudder force test with n 538 rpm the lateral inflow to the rudder v r is obtained with δ f n 0 and d f n d δ under different β and r as plotted in fig 9 according to eq 17 the flow straightening coefficient γ r is determined from the relation between v r and β while the correlation factor l r is determined by the relation of v r and r obviously the flow straightening coefficient γ r and the correlation factor l r are different for the windward and leeward rudders the results of rudder force test with various propeller loads are plotted in fig 10 with the increase of propeller load the rudder normal force is enhanced for the both rudders and the difference between the portside and starboard rudders is slightly enlarged especially under larger rudder angle the longitudinal inflow to the rudder u r is obtained from the slope of the relation between f n and δ at δ 0 and the relation between u r 2 u p 2 and 8 k t π j 2 is plotted in fig 11 the relation obtained from the cfd data exhibits similar slope to that from the efd data umeda et al 2014 it presents a smaller intercept on the axis of u r 2 u p 2 suggesting that the effect of propeller slipstream on the flow around rudder is underestimated by cfd method the coefficients of ε and κ are determined through the nonlinear regression according to eq 16 where the percentage of rudder area in propeller race is η 0 6667 the computed parameters in the module of rudder normal force are summarized in table 6 in comparison with the available experimental data umeda et al 2014 it is worth noting that the original correlation factor l r of efd data was regressed by a function different from eq 17 hence it is recomputed for the purpose of comparison as can be seen in table 6 part of efd data presents different values for the portside and starboard rudders it may be caused by the uncertainty of experiment on the whole the coefficients computed from the present cfd results show reasonable agreement with those from the efd data considering the complicated characteristic of the hull propeller rudder interaction 5 5 velocity fields around stern a series of axial velocity contours around the stern and the pressure distribution on the representative rudder sections are presented to further inspect the interaction phenomenon during maneuvering motions for the twin screw ship the longitudinal position of propeller in relation to the rudder is illustrated in fig 12 where the symbols c and s denote the chord length of mid span and the span length respectively the longitudinal location of x 0 0c is located at the rudder shaft for the sake of comparison and analysis three cases c1 c2 and c3 are chosen and described in table 7 the case c1 is defined as the original case while the cases c2 and c3 are selected to exhibit the effect of ship motion and propeller load respectively the axial velocity contours at four longitudinal positions are plotted in figs 13 15 including x 0 75c behind the propeller disk x 0 25c front part of the rudder x 0 25c aft part of the rudder and x 0 75c behind the rudder trailing edge with two dashed circles illustrating the propeller and its hub these plots show the back views of flow field around stern in fig 13 a there is a high velocity region behind the propeller disk with the acceleration effect of propeller race this effect influences the flow all along the rudder surface inside the slipstream as shown in fig 13 b c and d under the effect of rudder angle the flow is accelerated remarkably nearby the suction sides of the rudders while the flow around the opposite sides is less influenced the effect of rudder angle on the flow field is fading out along the longitudinal direction and the propeller slipstream is deflected slightly in the development process in addition there is an apparent difference between the velocity contours around the portside and starboard rudders a smaller high velocity region appears near the tip of the portside rudder while the high velocity region almost covers the inner side of the starboard rudder in the propeller slipstream from fig 14 it can be seen that the distribution of axial velocity around stern is remarkably influenced by the lateral inflow induced by the drift angle the ship wake and propeller slipstream are apparently deflected along the longitudinal direction besides the impact of drift angle on the flow field around the portside and starboard rudders is different the magnitude of axial velocity exhibits an indistinctive difference nearby the both sides of the portside rudder on the contrast the high velocity region is still apparent around the inner side of the starboard rudder while a smaller high velocity region appears near the tip of the outer side of the starboard rudder the flow field demonstrates an asymmetric flow straightening effect for the rudders of twin screw ship during maneuvers and the leeward rudder would be less affected by the lateral inflow as for the case c3 with higher propeller revolutions the axial velocity contours present similar distribution to the original case but the magnitude of axial velocity is larger as shown in fig 15 it can be concluded that the acceleration effect of propeller slipstream on the flow around the rudders is more remarkable with the increase of propeller load 5 6 pressure distribution on rudder surface to further investigate the local load acting on the rudder during maneuvers the pressure distributions on the rudder surface at some representative spanwise positions z 0 25s z 0 5s and z 0 75s as shown in fig 12 are presented in fig 16 the calculated pressure distribution is plotted separately for inner and outer surfaces of the rudders the pressure is expressed by the non dimensional coefficient c p p 0 5 ρ u 2 where p is the local pressure relative to the atmospheric pressure from fig 16 it can be seen that in the case c1 the suction and pressure sides are clearly to distinguish for the both rudders the pressure distributions on the portside and starboard rudders are different especially at the position of z 0 25s and z 0 5s in fig 16 a b c and d the high pressure regions are observed on the leading edge of the portside rudder while they move forward along the chordwise direction on the outer side of the starboard rudder overall the starboard rudder presents a larger pressure difference than that of the portside rudder this difference is mainly caused by the circumferential slipstreams of propeller it results in the moving of the stationary points on the rudder surface and produces a low pressure region due to the blocking effect of rudder surface the circumferential slipstreams induced by the propeller hub is relatively weak hence the pressure distribution on the position of z 0 75s is similar for the both rudders as shown in fig 16 e and f compared to the original case c1 the case c2 with the applied drift angle presents different pressure distribution on the rudder surface the portside rudder presents a smaller pressure difference between its outer and inner sides due to the effect of lateral inflow on the contrary the starboard rudder is less influenced by the lateral inflow and presents a similar pressure distribution as that in the case c1 it also presents an asymmetric flow straightening effect for the twin screw ship during maneuvers in the case c3 with higher propeller load the pressure distribution shows a similar tendency as that in the case c1 while the peak value of pressure is enlarged however the pressure difference at different spanwise positions presents a non monotonic tendency with the increase of propeller load especially at z 0 25s and 0 5s it is caused by the combined effect of the strengthened longitudinal and circumferential slipstreams the longitudinal slipstream enhances the magnitudes of high pressure and low pressure for the both rudders on the contrast the circumferential slipstream has opposite effect on the portside rudder and starboard rudder decreasing the pressure difference of the portside rudder while increasing that of the starboard rudder 6 free maneuvers simulation in order to further verify the reasonability of the numerical results the system based sb simulation of free maneuvers is performed using the computed hydrodynamic coefficients a 4 dof mmg mathematical model proposed by araki et al 2012 is adopted to describe the ship motion the hydrodynamic derivatives for the hull are obtained from the cfd simulation of cmt static drift and static heel test while the inertia terms of m x m y j x and j z and the linear damping coefficient k p are taken from guo and zou 2017 as given in table 8 the relation between k t and j is determined with the propeller open water characteristic data published at the tokyo 2015 workshop on cfd in ship hydrodynamics tokyo 2015 the computed parameters in the modules of propeller and rudder in this study are summarized in table 9 the turning circle test of δ 35 at f r 0 2 is simulated by solving the established mmg model with runge kutta 4 rk4 algorithm and the rudder deflects with the rate of 35 s at the beginning in fig 17 and table 10 the simulated trajectory and time histories of kinematic parameters are compared with the available experimental data elshiekh 2014 and the published dynamic cfd simulation results wang et al 2016 it is shown that the trajectories of turning circle test obtained by both the dynamic cfd simulation and the present sb simulation match well with the experimental data with respect to the predicted maneuverability parameters advance transfer tactical diameter and turning diameter the present sb simulation presents a similar level of accuracy as that of the dynamic cfd simulation on the whole satisfactory accuracy is obtained for the prediction of the maneuverability parameters with the deviation less than 5 in addition it can be seen that the overall trends of the kinematic parameters predicted by the present sb simulation match well with the experimental data the speed drift angle and yaw rate after reaching to the steady turning condition are slightly overestimated with the deviation less than 10 the time history of lateral force acting on the rudders during the turning circle test are presented in fig 18 there is an obvious difference between the lateral forces acting on the portside and starboard rudders the portside rudder is on the leeward side and the starboard rudder is on the windward side during the present turning circle test simulation due to the asymmetric flow straightening effect the starboard rudder is more influenced by the lateral inflow resulting in a remarkably smaller lateral force than that of the portside rudder the difference is close to 50 of the lateral force acting on the portside rudder under the steady turning condition in fig 19 the phase of rudder executing is compared with the dynamic cfd simulation there is a good coherence in the lateral forces on portside rudder predicted by the dynamic cfd simulation and present sb simulation however remarkable difference appears in the lateral force on starboard rudder especially at the beginning and end of rudder executing on the whole a similar tendency is obtained by the dynamic cfd simulation and the present sb simulation 7 conclusions in this study the interaction of hull propeller and rudder during maneuvers is investigated for a twin screw ship by using cfd method the modified modules of propeller and rudder in mmg model are introduced to describe the hydrodynamic performance of propellers and rudders during maneuvers for the twin screw ship and the propeller side force and the asymmetric flow straightening effect are taken into account the self propulsion test rudder force test static drift test and cmt are simulated with rans method the interaction factors among the hull propeller and rudder are computed from the numerical results and the propeller side force and rudder normal force are modelled for the twin screw ship besides the numerical results are compared with the available experimental data and reasonable agreement is achieved the velocity field around the stern is presented to visualize the influence of ship motion and propeller load on the flow around the rudder meanwhile the pressure distribution on the rudder surface at some representative spanwise positions is plotted to clarify the change of local load on the rudder surface under conditions of static drift and higher propeller load the analysis of flow field and the pressure distribution on the rudder surface provide further information on the mechanism affecting the rudder performance by the ship motion and propeller load during maneuvers for the twin screw ship the system based simulation of turning circle test is performed using the obtained modules of propeller and rudder the simulated trajectory and time histories of some kinematic and dynamic quantities exhibit good agreement with the available experimental data and other cfd results particularly satisfactory accuracy is obtained in the prediction of the maneuverability parameters of advance transfer tactical diameter and turning diameter it demonstrates the reasonability of the propeller and rudder force modules for the twin screw ship and the promising applicability of the cfd method in the investigation of hull propeller rudder interaction however it should be pointed out that the present work mainly focuses on the rudder force modelling for the twin screw ship using cfd method the module of propeller is simplified without considering the asymmetry of propeller load and propeller side force therefore to further improve the applicability of the system based method in maneuverability prediction of twin screw ships the hydrodynamic characteristic of propellers during maneuvers should be investigated in the future study acknowledgements this work is financially

23288,this paper numerically investigated the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under individually or jointly applied torsion and bending loads series of nonlinear finite element analyses were carried out with varying the crack length location and orientation angle to assess their effects on the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders three types of cracks namely longitudinal crack transverse crack and inclined crack are considered in this paper the residual ultimate strength are obtained and discussed for the three types of cracks under torsional or bending moment loading condition based on the numerical results under individually applied torsion or bending moment two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are adopted for analyzing the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads an interaction equation is proposed for predicting the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads the validity of this simple equation is verified by some crack damage cases of varying crack length keywords residual ultimate strength large opening box girder crack damage bending torsion nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction the ultimate strength analysis of ship hull structures has been regarded as a necessary safety index in ship design and safety assessment for common vessels vertical bending moment is frequently evaluated as one primary component of the hull girder loads however it has been recognized that torsional moment is also very important for some types of ships such as container ships or large bulk carriers these ship types with a lower torsional rigidity are much more vulnerable to the torsional moment due to the large opening deck on the other hand ship hull structures are inevitable to suffer various kinds of damages during their lifetime in service one of the most fatal damage is cracks which is known to have a significant effect on the buckling and ultimate strength behaviors of thin walled structures so it is necessary to take combined loads into consideration when making assessment on the residual ultimate strength of ship hull structures with crack damage in this respect many experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to study the post buckling behavior and residual ultimate capacity of ship hull structures with crack damage under combined loads paik et al paik et al 2005 paik 2008 2009 numerically and experimentally investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of plates with transverse and longitudinal cracks under axial compression or tension major crack parameters including crack direction crack location crack size plate thickness and plate aspect ratio are considered later a similar study on cracked panels under shear loading had been conducted by alinia et al 2007 bayatfar et al 2014 numerically discussed the effect of transverse cracks on the ultimate compressive strength of unstiffened and stiffened plate margaritis et al margaritis and toulios 2012 conducted series of nonlinear finite element analyses to investigate the post buckling behavior and residual ultimate capacity of stiffened plates with straight cracks wang et al wang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 carried out the ultimate shear strength analyses of intact and cracked stiffened panels with single or multiple crack damage multiple crack damage consists of one lead crack and several disturbing cracks the effects of the location and size of the disturbing cracks on the ultimate strength of central cracked stiffened panels were investigated xu et al 2014 investigated the ultimate strength characteristic of stiffened panels with locked cracks in their research the orientation angle and the length of cracks are varied to examine their effect on the failure modes and equivalent stress distributions of cracked stiffened panels it had been concluded that projected length of the crack should be regarded as an important index for the effect of crack more recently more attentions have been paid to large scale ship hull structures ao and wang 2012 numerically investigated the post torsional buckling behavior and residual ultimate torsional strength of stiffened box girders with large deck opening and made a comparison with the torsional experiment conducted by sun saad eldeen et al 2016a then shi and wang 2012a 2012b made some explorations on residual ultimate strength of the similar box girder model under different loading conditions three types of cracks in regard to crack locations namely central crack edge crack and double edge crack were considered shi and gao et al 2012 carried out investigations about the collapse behavior of box girders and hull structures with cracks and corrosion damage soares et al saad eldeen et al 2016a 2016b conducted numerous studies on the ultimate bending moment capacity of a single hull structure with multiple large openings or locked cracks and provided specific emergency repairs for locked crack damage tekgoz et al 2015 carried out series of nonlinear finite element analyses to investigate ultimate load carrying capacity of ship shaped structures subjected to asymmetrical longitudinal bending moments other contributions about residual ultimate strength assessment of ship hull structures with crack damage can refer to sun and soares 2003 issc committee ⅲ 1 2000 issc committee ⅲ 1 2012 paik et al 2004 cui et al 2016 cui et al 2017 nishihara 1983 msc 2010 paik and thayamballi 2003 rahbar ranji and zarookian 2014 harada et al 2007 shi et al 2017 gannon et al 2012 smith et al 1987 saad eldeen et al 2016c yao et al 1998 from all the literature mentioned above it can be known that most of studies paik et al 2005 paik 2008 2009 bayatfar et al 2014 margaritis and toulios 2012 wang et al 2009 2015 ao and wang 2012 shi and wang 2012a 2012b gao et al 2012 saad eldeen et al 2016a 2016b assumed crack type as longitudinal or transverse cracks however few investigations have been conducted for inclined cracks that are common in aging ship structures furthermore there are fewer researches on the crack location and combined loads in this paper special attentions are paid to the impact of these respects for the status and problems about the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage series of analyses for ship hull structures with crack damage have been carried out by using the nonlinear finite element method to evaluate the effect of crack damages the aim of the present study is to gain insights into the residual ultimate strength behavior of large opening box girder with crack damage under individually applied load torsion or bending only and combined loads torsion and bending together based on the numerical results under individually applied torsion or bending moment two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are adopted for analyzing the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads an interaction equation is proposed for predicting the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads the validity of this simple equation is verified by some crack damage cases of varying crack length 2 finite element analysis models 2 1 geometric and material properties a simplified large opening box girder which is similar to the literature shi and wang 2012a 2012b is designed based on the torsional experiment conducted by sun sun and soares 2003 fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the large opening box girder and the cross section as shown in fig 1 the large opening box girder model consists of 1 2 1 1 2 bays in the longitudinal direction for the consideration of the influence of boundary condition and two transverse frames support at the two ends of large opening table 1 gives the main dimensions of the model the thickness of model plates is 5 mm the size of two transverse frames is 60 mm 10 mm the cracks discussed in the paper are located in the side of the box girder three types of cracks are taken into consideration namely transverse crack longitudinal crack and inclined crack fig 2 presented the configuration of three types of cracks the crack size is expressed as 2c w and s and h are the distances from the crack center to the transverse frame and deck side line respectively a semi circle with small diameter at the two crack tips is adopted as the reference xu et al 2014 in practice cracks in relatively thin plate used in ship and offshore structures are generally considered as through thickness paik and thayamballi 2003 the premised cracks can propagate as the torsion and bending loads are applied and subsequently structural responses can significantly differ from those where the premised cracks are constant in size and geometry however the unstable cracks can cause unstable propagation at a certain stress level which means the crack propagation path and the increased crack length due to crack growth are indefinite it is the fact that the crack propagation is another issue mainly focusing on the proposition of reasonable crack propagation criteria based on fracture mechanics or damage mechanics in such case the cracks are considered as a variable model and their evolvement rules are defined accurately for the time variant reliability assessment this issue is much more different from that discussed in this paper meanwhile the torsional buckling usually occurs prior to the crack propagation due to the thin thickness of the plates ao and wang 2012 in order to simplify the analysis the cracks are presumed to be through thickness having no friction between their edges and no propagation is allowed in the present study shi and wang 2012a the material used in this paper is a high tensile strength steel in general steel material has strain hardening tangent modulus e t typically in the range of 5 15 of the young s modulus some authors such as paik paik and thayamballi 2003 have indicated that due to the strain hardening effect the ultimate strength of steel plate is larger than that obtained without considering it for pessimistic assessment of ultimate strength of steel thin walled structures an elastic perfectly plastic steel material model is considered sufficient and adequate in this respect the behavior of the material used in this paper is assumed to follow elastic perfectly plastic manner without considering strain hardening effect the detailed material properties are the same as the vessel steel plate in the issc 2012 issc committee ⅲ 1 2012 listed in table 2 2 2 boundary and loading conditions two independent reference nodes are built at the torsional center of front end and back end of box girder respectively the other nodes of end face and reference node are coupled in six degrees of freedom by using multipoint constraints mpc in marc software simply supported constraint is applied to two independent reference nodes as front end u x u y u z 0 and back end u y u z 0 in the subsequent nonlinear finite element analysis the external loads such as vertical bending moment and torsion are also applied on the two independent reference nodes in the form of enforced moment or displacement the boundary and loading conditions of large opening box girder with crack damage are illustrated in fig 3 2 3 initial imperfection during welding in fabrication initial imperfection is inevitable it has been shown that initial imperfection can reduce the ultimate bearing capacity to a certain extent so the initial imperfection must be taken into account in ultimate strength assessment of ship structures paik et al 2004 and yao et al 1998 investigated the effect of initial imperfections on the ultimate strength behavior of welded steel plate in their research it was found that the effect of welding residual stress on the ultimate strength is less importance compared to the welding induced residual deformation so for simplicity the welding residual stress is not accounted for in the present study as for the initial deformation the most accurate data comes from the actual measurement data but the more commonly used way in the finite element simulation is to assume that the initial deformation equivalent to the geometric deformation of first order buckling mode issc committee ⅲ 1 2000 issc committee ⅲ 1 2012 in the present application it is assumed that initial deformations of box girder without and with crack damage are equivalent to that of the first order buckling mode as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the initial deformation amplitude is a 0 0 1 β 2 t paik et al 2004 where β b t σ y e is the slenderness ratio of side plate 2 4 adopted element type and convergence study the commercial fem software marc has been applied for all the nonlinear finite element analyses the shell139 element is chosen from the element library of marc to simulate the mechanical behavior of large opening box girder shell139 a four node element with six degrees of freedom at each node is suitable for analyzing thin to moderate thick shell structures it also can take into account the effect of membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deformation msc 2010 in order to accurately simulate the collapse behavior of large opening box girder the mesh size of fe model should be fine enough on the other hand finer mesh will cause more computational efforts in this aspect a balance between computational time and accuracy must be made in order to select reasonable mesh size 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm are selected as the global mesh size for analysis and comparison the torsional moment versus twisting angle curves for different mesh size are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 the difference of ultimate strength between these three meshing sizes is relatively small but among them the mesh size 40 mm can t perform the post buckling behavior very well due to the convergence of nonlinear solution and computational time of mesh size 20 mm is too long so 30 mm is used as the global mesh size in the subsequent finite element calculations cui et al 2016 2017 conducted series of sensitivity analyses about different crack width 1 mm 3 mm 10 mm to examine its effect on the ultimate strength of cracked plate in their research average stress average strain curves of cracked plates with width w 3 mm is similar to those with the other two different crack widths furthermore it is observed that there are no contacts between the crack s faces at the ultimate limited state thus the crack width of w 3 mm is adopted for the subsequent finite element calculations due to the stress concentration the refined mesh must be allocated near the crack xu xu et al 2014 conducted sensitivity analysis of the number of elements ne near the crack tips in his research it had been found out that the ultimate strength values are almost unchanged with the increase of ne whereas the maximum equivalent stress increases at the crack tips thus the number of elements ne near the crack tips is set to 16 for all the nonlinear finite element analyses dense mesh is adopted near the crack and the mesh size gradually increases away from the crack fig 7 shows a box girder model with a refined mesh around the crack and dense mesh near the crack tips 2 5 finite element model validation in order to verify the reliability of numerical results by applying nonlinear finite element method nishihara s mst 3 and mst 4 box girders test models nishihara 1983 which have test results are adopted for verification the numerical analysis for mst 3 and mst 4 has been conducted by control arc length al solving strategy namely riks algorithm which is available in marc software msc 2010 the cross section and member dimensions of nishihara s test models are shown in fig 8 and the material properties are shown in table 3 the obtained numerical analysis curves of bending moment versus end rotated angle are shown in fig 9 the corresponding nishihara s test model results are also presented in fig 8 the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of mst 3 and mst 4 at the ultimate limit state uls are represented in fig 10 as it can be seen from fig 10 no significant difference is observed between the results from fe and those of nishihara test the fe calculation results of ultimate bending moment is slightly greater than those of nishihara test which may be due to welding residual stress that is not considered in the finite element analysis the reliability of present fe simulations for predicting ultimate strength of large opening box girder is verified 3 numerical results and discussions in this section series of elasto plastic large deformation analyses for large opening box girder under single load and combined loads were carried out with varying crack type length orientation angle and location moment versus angle curves buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girders with crack damage are obtained and presented in figs 11 31 three types of cracks namely transverse crack longitudinal crack and inclined crack are discussed the corresponding intact large opening box girder is also included as a reference 3 1 torsional loading conditions 3 1 1 transverse crack in torsional loading condition fig 11a shows the curve of reduction factor of ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage i e h d 0 5 of varying crack length the ordinate of fig 11a t u t uo represents the reduction factor of ultimate torsional strength where t u and t uo represent the ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder with and without crack damage respectively from fig 11a it can be observed that when the crack length 2c d 0 2 the ultimate torsional strength reduces significantly as the crack length increases and is approximately linearly reduced for the case of crack length 2c 0 5d the difference of ultimate strength of large opening box girder with and without crack damage reaches 27 8 fig 11b shows the curves of torsional moment versus twisting angle of the large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage varying crack length it can be seen from fig 11b that the existence of the crack affects the unloading path although initial loading paths are nearly the same for different crack lengths in another words the crack length nearly has no effect on the initial stiffness of box girder but has significant effect on the reduction of post ultimate strength it is noticed that the initial stiffness of all large opening box girders with crack damage is less than that of intact large opening box girder in order to assess the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength characteristic the case of transverse crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from transverse crack center to transverse frame and deck side line i e s and h are varied respectively fig 12 shows the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength when the transverse crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the ultimate torsional strength increases gradually this may be caused by larger structural stiffness near the transverse frame when the transverse crack approaches large opening of the deck the ultimate torsional strength decreases gradually this may be caused by smaller structural stiffness near the large opening it is interesting to note that when h d 0 25 crack has become an edge crack and edge crack leads to a sudden drop of ultimate torsional strength because of weak structural stiffness of large opening the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the large opening box girder with crack length and location changed at the uls are represented in figs 13 and 14 as show in figs 13 and 14 the side plates of box girder near the large opening have an obvious torsional buckling when the crack length is small the equivalent stress distribution of box girder with transverse crack is similar to intact box girder but when the crack length increases to 2c d 0 5 the high stress region around the crack tip occurs a substantial increase and stress of other zones away from the crack decreases to a certain extent which results in a decline of ultimate torsional strength it is shown from fig 14 that high stress region around the crack tip varies with the crack location 3 1 2 longitudinal crack in torsional loading condition fig 15 shows the reduction of the ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage of varying crack length from fig 15a it can be observed that when the crack lengths are of 2c d 0 3 the ultimate torsional strength reduces significantly as the crack length increases and is approximately linearly reduced whereas when the crack lengths are of 2c d 0 3 the effect of longitudinal crack on the ultimate torsional strength is almost negligible for the case of crack length 2c 0 5d the difference of ultimate strength of large opening box girder with and without crack damage reaches 12 6 and this descending percentage is smaller than the corresponding descending percentage of transverse crack 27 8 fig 15b shows the curves of torsional moment versus twisting angle for large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage of varying crack length as the same with transverse crack the crack length has slight effect on the initial stiffness of cracked plates but has significant effect on the ultimate strength values in order to assess the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength characteristic the case of longitudinal crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from longitudinal crack center to transverse frame and deck side line respectively are varied fig 16 shows the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength it can be clearly seen that when the longitudinal crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the ultimate torsional strength increases gradually the same reason is that the structural stiffness near the transverse frame is larger when the longitudinal crack approaches large opening of deck the ultimate torsional strength increased very slightly namely the transverse location of longitudinal crack has slight effect on the residual ultimate torsional strength the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder with changed longitudinal crack length and location at the uls are represented in figs 17 and 18 as show in figs 17 and 18 side plate of box girder has an obvious torsional buckling and crack length and location have a certain effect on the amplitude of torsional buckling deformation in comparison with fig 13a the torsional buckling deformation is larger as the crack length increases or the crack is closer to large opening 3 1 3 inclined crack in torsional loading condition the orientation angle of crack i e θ as shown in fig 2c is changed in the range of 15 75 to assess its effect on the ultimate torsional strength the crack length is also changed simultaneously for the simplicity only the central inclined crack i e the center of inclined crack is aligned with that of side plate h d s a 0 5 is taken into consideration table 4 shows the reduction factor t u t uo of the ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder vs orientation angle of the crack as well as crack length and the reduction factor values are plotted in fig 19 for comparative analysis the relevant data of transverse crack θ 0 and longitudinal crack θ 90 are also shown in table 4 and fig 19 it can be seen from fig 19 that when the crack length is small the residual ultimate torsional strength increases slightly with the increase of the crack angle however for box girder model with the crack length of 2c d 0 4 and 0 5 when the orientation angle of the crack is θ 60 the residual ultimate torsional strength increases significantly with the increase of the crack angle and when the orientation angle of the crack is θ 60 the residual ultimate torsional strength reaches a peak when the orientation angle of the crack is θ 60 the residual ultimate torsional strength began to decline the reason for the phenomena may be that θ 60 is closer to side plate deformation angle arctan a d 51 3 of the first order torsional buckling mode that leads to slightest effect on the deformation when the orientation angle of crack reaches zero as a transverse crack the residual ultimate torsional strength will be the lowest value regardless of crack length namely the transverse crack has the greatest effect on the reduction of residual ultimate torsional strength due to abrupt change of residual ultimate torsional strength at θ 60 threes crack angles close to θ 60 are paid extra attentions the corresponding buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the large opening box girder with the crack of specified angle at the uls are represented in fig 20 3 2 vertical bending loading conditions 3 2 1 intact large opening box girder in vertical bending loading condition because large opening leads to great loss of deck area the ultimate bearing capacity of large opening box girder in the sagging condition is usually smaller than that in the hogging condition in order to know the difference of them the ultimate strength of intact large opening box girder in the sagging and hogging condition are calculated by fem and compared with that in pure torsion condition as shown in table 5 fig 21 shows bending moment versus angle curves of intact large opening box in the sagging and hogging condition the peak values of ultimate bending moment are shown in table 5 the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of intact large opening box girder at the uls in the sagging and hogging condition are shown in fig 22 it can be seen from table 5 that the ultimate bending moment in the sagging condition is slightly larger than the ultimate torsional moment while ultimate bending moment in the hogging condition is far greater than the ultimate torsional moment therefore in the following calculation and analysis for vertical bending condition only the sagging condition is taken into account 3 2 2 transverse crack in vertical bending loading condition table 6 shows reduction factor m u m u0 of residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage varying crack length where m u represents the residual ultimate bending moment of large opening box girder with crack damage and m u0 represents the ultimate bending moment of intact large opening box girder the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of intact large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage at the uls varying crack length are depicted in fig 23 it can be clearly seen in table 6 that the residual ultimate bending moment decreases slowly with the increase of the crack length at the same time it can be seen from fig 23 that the crack length of transverse crack located at side plate has slight effect on the equivalent stress distribution of the box girder so the crack length of transverse crack located at side plate has little effect on the residual ultimate bending strength for the purpose of examining the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength characteristic the case of transverse crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from transverse crack center to transverse frame and deck side line respectively are varied fig 24 shows the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength fig 24 illustrates that when the transverse crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the initial stiffness and the residual ultimate bending strength are almost unchanged however when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck the residual ultimate bending strength decreases rapidly compared with the central transverse crack h d 0 5 the residual ultimate bending moment with transverse location h d 0 25 decreases by approximately 28 the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder at the uls varying crack location of transverse crack are represented in fig 25 as can be seen from fig 25 for the transverse crack close to the transverse frame of the box girder equivalent stress distribution of box girder with crack damage is almost the same as that of intact box girder but when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck high stress range of the upper section decreased significantly leading to decrease the residual ultimate bending strength significantly this phenomenon is particularly evident for the case of transverse location h d 0 25 because the transverse crack has become an edge crack at this case 3 2 3 longitudinal crack in vertical bending loading condition table 7 shows reduction factor m u m u0 of residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage varying crack length the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of intact large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage at the uls varying crack length are depicted in fig 26 all reduction factors of large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage in table 7 are almost close to 1 there is no denial that central longitudinal crack length almost has no effect on the residual ultimate bending strength of box girder this may be for the reason that the center longitudinal crack is always near the neutral axis of box girder and has slight effect on the stress distribution of box girder as shown in fig 26 for the purpose of examining the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength characteristics the case of longitudinal crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from longitudinal crack center to transverse frame and deck side line respectively are varied fig 27 shows the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength fig 27 illustrates that when the longitudinal crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the effect of longitudinal location of central longitudinal crack on the initial stiffness unloading paths and residual ultimate bending strength is almost negligible and also the effect of transverse location is very slight the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder at the uls varying crack location of longitudinal crack are depicted in fig 28 in addition one feature observed from fig 28 is that high stress region of the upper section decreased for the case of transverse location h d 0 1 3 2 4 inclined crack in vertical bending loading condition the orientation angle of crack is changed in the range of 15 75 to assess its effect on the residual ultimate torsional strength in this section for the simplicity only the central inclined crack with the crack length of 2c d 0 5 and crack location of h d s a 0 5 is taken into consideration in this section table 8 shows the reduction factor m u m u0 of residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with crack 2c d 0 5 s a h d 0 5 damage varying orientation angle of the crack and the reduction factor values are plotted in fig 29 it can be seen from table 8 that the residual ultimate bending strength of box girder with inclined crack is between those of transverse cracks and longitudinal cracks in which the transverse crack θ 0 has the greatest effect on the residual ultimate bending moment several noteworthy features seen from fig 29 are that reduction factor of residual ultimate bending strength almost has no change as the orientation angle of crack increases but a slight increase occurs between 45 and 60 for the reason that the range of orientation angle is closer to the deformation angle of the first order buckling mode under pure vertical bending moment 3 3 combined loading conditions based on the above numerical results of the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder under individually applied torsion or vertical bending moment sagging condition two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are selected to analyze the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder under combined loading conditions the reason of choosing these two of the most dangerous crack damage situations is in the following explanation for the central crack the transverse crack has the greatest effect on the residual ultimate torsional moment and residual ultimate bending moment of large opening box girder based on series of analyses about the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate torsional strength similar feature can be observed that when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck a sudden drop of residual ultimate torsional or bending strength will occur because the transverse crack has become an edge crack at this point that is not evident for the longitudinal crack two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are listed as follows case1 transverse central crack s a h d 0 5 2c d 0 5 case2 transverse edge crack s a 0 5 h d 0 25 2c d 0 5 in the subsequent nonlinear finite element analysis for combined loads five load ratios of vertical bending moment m versus torsion t i e 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 are selected to apply the enforced moments on the two independent reference nodes in the calculation process the applied vertical bending moment and torsion will increase gradually together until large opening box girder model collapses table 9 and table 10 present the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder with the two cases of crack damage under combined loads varying load ratios in the two tables 9 and 10 lpf is the abbreviation of load proportionality factor m u0 and t u0 represent the residual ultimate strength of intact large opening box girder under the torsion and vertical bending loads respectively reduction factor of residual ultimate torsional or bending strength is denoted by t u t u0 or m u m u0 in addition the load ratios 1 0 and 0 1 i e under pure vertical bending moment and pure torsion are also included as the supplements the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder with two cases of crack damage at the uls varying load ratios are depicted in figs 30 and 31 the greatest change seen from fig 31 is that equivalent stress increases gradually as the load ratio decreases gradually based on the calculated results of reduction factor seen in tables 9 and 10 two interaction curves under the torsion and vertical bending loads are presented in fig 32 the interaction curves under the torsion and vertical bending loads for case1 and case2 are approximately elliptical shape and the interaction curve of case2 is completely inside that of case1 which indicates that the residual ultimate strength of case2 is less than that of case1 thus transverse edge crack i e case2 is the most dangerous crack damage situation 3 4 proposed formula as can be seen evidently from fig 30 the residual ultimate torsional strength gradually decreases as the residual ultimate bending strength increases and vice versa therefore the interaction relationship between them can be approximately described as a circular curve cui et al 2017 1 m u m u 0 2 t u t u 0 2 1 paik et al paik et al 2005 paik 2008 2009 proposed a frequently used formula based on net section theory to predict the residual ultimate strength of simply supported steel plates with crack damage under axial compression or tension 2 r f σ u σ u 0 o r τ u τ u 0 a c a 0 in eq 2 r f is the abbreviation of reduction factor a 0 and a c denote the total cross sectional area of large opening box girder without and with crack damage respectively however the opening edge of the box girder may have a lower stiffness than that of the other three edges supported by continuous plating so the boundary condition for the side plate near the large opening cannot be assumed as a simply supported but a free boundary condition thus the crack damage in a large opening box girder will result in a lower value than eq 2 here a coefficient α is introduced to account for the influence of this boundary condition 3 r f σ u σ u 0 o r τ u τ u 0 a c a 0 4 d α 2 c t 4 d t 1 α 4 2 c d in eq 3 r f is the reduction factor and a c denote total cross sectional area of large opening box girder with crack damage considering the coefficient in the present study a similar formula as eq 1 is proposed considering the effect of crack damage in the term of eq 3 4 m u m u 0 2 t u t u 0 2 a c a 0 2 α 4 2 c d 2 when 2c 0 5d and assuming reduction factor of combined loads is equal to the product of single load shi and wang 2012b the right side of eq 4 can be rewritten into 5 r f t r f b a c a 0 2 1 α 4 2 c d 2 1 α 8 2 when 2 c d 0 5 in eq 5 r f t and r f b denote reduction factor of residual ultimate torsional and bending strength of large opening box girder with case2 crack damage respectively their values equal to t u t u0 and m u m u0 here t u and m u denote the residual ultimate torsional or bending strength value of box girder with case2 crack damage under single load which can be obtained from figs 12b and 24b substitute these two values into eq 5 it is obtained that coefficient α 2 72 thus proposed formula can be summarized into 6 m u m u 0 2 t u t u 0 2 1 1 36 c d 2 eq 6 is also shown in fig 32 to verify its accuracy and applicability as for other crack length the same work with the above mentioned two cases of crack damage has been done fig 33 shows the interaction curves under combined loads of varying crack length it needs to note that proposed formula is just suitable for the crack length of 2c d 0 2 because short crack has only slight effect on the residual ultimate torsional or bending strength nfea results of similar models obtained from the literature ao and wang 2012 shi and wang 2012a 2012b are listed in table 11 which are presented for the references of proposed formula reduction factor of proposed formula represents the ellipse focal length of interaction curve in table 11 as can be seen from table 11 that reduction factor of proposed formula is slightly smaller than that of the literature ao and wang 2012 shi and wang 2012a 2012b and this also verifies the accuracy of proposed formula again 4 conclusions in the present study the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder under torsion and bending loads has been investigated by the nonlinear finite element analysis series of elasto plastic large deformation analyses have been carried out with varying crack length location and orientation angle based on the nonlinear numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the torsional loading condition the residual ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder decreases as the crack length increases but the effect of transverse crack on the ultimate torsional strength is far greater than that of longitudinal crack 2 in the torsional loading condition when the transverse crack approaches large opening of the deck the ultimate torsional strength decreases slowly whereas when the location of transverse crack is of h d 0 25 a sudden drop of ultimate torsional strength will occur it is the reason that transverse crack has become an edge crack on the other hand the location of longitudinal crack has sight effect on the residual ultimate torsional strength 3 when the orientation angle of crack is changed the reduction factor of residual ultimate torsional strength has the minimum value for the transverse crack θ 0 however the reduction factor reaches a peak for the crack orientation angle θ 60 4 in the vertical bending loading condition transverse crack length has little effect on the residual ultimate bending strength but is larger in comparison with longitudinal crack which has no effect on the ultimate bending strength 5 in the vertical bending loading condition when the transverse crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the initial stiffness and the ultimate bending strength are almost unchanged however when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck the ultimate bending strength decreases rapidly on the other hand the location of longitudinal crack regardless of transverse location or longitudinal location has slight effect on the ultimate bending strength 6 the residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with inclined crack is between those of transverse cracks and longitudinal cracks in which the transverse crack θ 0 has the greatest effect on the ultimate bending moment the residual ultimate bending strength almost has no change as the orientation angle of crack increases but a slight increase occurs between 45 and 60 7 based on the interaction relationship and the shape of interaction curves a simple formula is proposed to predict the residual strength of large opening box girder with crack damage the validity of this simple formula is verified by some cases of varying the crack length 8 the research work has some contributions in the assessment of the residual strength of ship hull girder with crack damage under individually applied loading torsion or bending only or combined loading torsion and bending together acknowledgements the present

23288,this paper numerically investigated the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under individually or jointly applied torsion and bending loads series of nonlinear finite element analyses were carried out with varying the crack length location and orientation angle to assess their effects on the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders three types of cracks namely longitudinal crack transverse crack and inclined crack are considered in this paper the residual ultimate strength are obtained and discussed for the three types of cracks under torsional or bending moment loading condition based on the numerical results under individually applied torsion or bending moment two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are adopted for analyzing the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads an interaction equation is proposed for predicting the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads the validity of this simple equation is verified by some crack damage cases of varying crack length keywords residual ultimate strength large opening box girder crack damage bending torsion nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction the ultimate strength analysis of ship hull structures has been regarded as a necessary safety index in ship design and safety assessment for common vessels vertical bending moment is frequently evaluated as one primary component of the hull girder loads however it has been recognized that torsional moment is also very important for some types of ships such as container ships or large bulk carriers these ship types with a lower torsional rigidity are much more vulnerable to the torsional moment due to the large opening deck on the other hand ship hull structures are inevitable to suffer various kinds of damages during their lifetime in service one of the most fatal damage is cracks which is known to have a significant effect on the buckling and ultimate strength behaviors of thin walled structures so it is necessary to take combined loads into consideration when making assessment on the residual ultimate strength of ship hull structures with crack damage in this respect many experimental and theoretical investigations have been carried out to study the post buckling behavior and residual ultimate capacity of ship hull structures with crack damage under combined loads paik et al paik et al 2005 paik 2008 2009 numerically and experimentally investigated the ultimate strength characteristics of plates with transverse and longitudinal cracks under axial compression or tension major crack parameters including crack direction crack location crack size plate thickness and plate aspect ratio are considered later a similar study on cracked panels under shear loading had been conducted by alinia et al 2007 bayatfar et al 2014 numerically discussed the effect of transverse cracks on the ultimate compressive strength of unstiffened and stiffened plate margaritis et al margaritis and toulios 2012 conducted series of nonlinear finite element analyses to investigate the post buckling behavior and residual ultimate capacity of stiffened plates with straight cracks wang et al wang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 carried out the ultimate shear strength analyses of intact and cracked stiffened panels with single or multiple crack damage multiple crack damage consists of one lead crack and several disturbing cracks the effects of the location and size of the disturbing cracks on the ultimate strength of central cracked stiffened panels were investigated xu et al 2014 investigated the ultimate strength characteristic of stiffened panels with locked cracks in their research the orientation angle and the length of cracks are varied to examine their effect on the failure modes and equivalent stress distributions of cracked stiffened panels it had been concluded that projected length of the crack should be regarded as an important index for the effect of crack more recently more attentions have been paid to large scale ship hull structures ao and wang 2012 numerically investigated the post torsional buckling behavior and residual ultimate torsional strength of stiffened box girders with large deck opening and made a comparison with the torsional experiment conducted by sun saad eldeen et al 2016a then shi and wang 2012a 2012b made some explorations on residual ultimate strength of the similar box girder model under different loading conditions three types of cracks in regard to crack locations namely central crack edge crack and double edge crack were considered shi and gao et al 2012 carried out investigations about the collapse behavior of box girders and hull structures with cracks and corrosion damage soares et al saad eldeen et al 2016a 2016b conducted numerous studies on the ultimate bending moment capacity of a single hull structure with multiple large openings or locked cracks and provided specific emergency repairs for locked crack damage tekgoz et al 2015 carried out series of nonlinear finite element analyses to investigate ultimate load carrying capacity of ship shaped structures subjected to asymmetrical longitudinal bending moments other contributions about residual ultimate strength assessment of ship hull structures with crack damage can refer to sun and soares 2003 issc committee ⅲ 1 2000 issc committee ⅲ 1 2012 paik et al 2004 cui et al 2016 cui et al 2017 nishihara 1983 msc 2010 paik and thayamballi 2003 rahbar ranji and zarookian 2014 harada et al 2007 shi et al 2017 gannon et al 2012 smith et al 1987 saad eldeen et al 2016c yao et al 1998 from all the literature mentioned above it can be known that most of studies paik et al 2005 paik 2008 2009 bayatfar et al 2014 margaritis and toulios 2012 wang et al 2009 2015 ao and wang 2012 shi and wang 2012a 2012b gao et al 2012 saad eldeen et al 2016a 2016b assumed crack type as longitudinal or transverse cracks however few investigations have been conducted for inclined cracks that are common in aging ship structures furthermore there are fewer researches on the crack location and combined loads in this paper special attentions are paid to the impact of these respects for the status and problems about the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage series of analyses for ship hull structures with crack damage have been carried out by using the nonlinear finite element method to evaluate the effect of crack damages the aim of the present study is to gain insights into the residual ultimate strength behavior of large opening box girder with crack damage under individually applied load torsion or bending only and combined loads torsion and bending together based on the numerical results under individually applied torsion or bending moment two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are adopted for analyzing the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads an interaction equation is proposed for predicting the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girders with crack damage under combined loads the validity of this simple equation is verified by some crack damage cases of varying crack length 2 finite element analysis models 2 1 geometric and material properties a simplified large opening box girder which is similar to the literature shi and wang 2012a 2012b is designed based on the torsional experiment conducted by sun sun and soares 2003 fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of the large opening box girder and the cross section as shown in fig 1 the large opening box girder model consists of 1 2 1 1 2 bays in the longitudinal direction for the consideration of the influence of boundary condition and two transverse frames support at the two ends of large opening table 1 gives the main dimensions of the model the thickness of model plates is 5 mm the size of two transverse frames is 60 mm 10 mm the cracks discussed in the paper are located in the side of the box girder three types of cracks are taken into consideration namely transverse crack longitudinal crack and inclined crack fig 2 presented the configuration of three types of cracks the crack size is expressed as 2c w and s and h are the distances from the crack center to the transverse frame and deck side line respectively a semi circle with small diameter at the two crack tips is adopted as the reference xu et al 2014 in practice cracks in relatively thin plate used in ship and offshore structures are generally considered as through thickness paik and thayamballi 2003 the premised cracks can propagate as the torsion and bending loads are applied and subsequently structural responses can significantly differ from those where the premised cracks are constant in size and geometry however the unstable cracks can cause unstable propagation at a certain stress level which means the crack propagation path and the increased crack length due to crack growth are indefinite it is the fact that the crack propagation is another issue mainly focusing on the proposition of reasonable crack propagation criteria based on fracture mechanics or damage mechanics in such case the cracks are considered as a variable model and their evolvement rules are defined accurately for the time variant reliability assessment this issue is much more different from that discussed in this paper meanwhile the torsional buckling usually occurs prior to the crack propagation due to the thin thickness of the plates ao and wang 2012 in order to simplify the analysis the cracks are presumed to be through thickness having no friction between their edges and no propagation is allowed in the present study shi and wang 2012a the material used in this paper is a high tensile strength steel in general steel material has strain hardening tangent modulus e t typically in the range of 5 15 of the young s modulus some authors such as paik paik and thayamballi 2003 have indicated that due to the strain hardening effect the ultimate strength of steel plate is larger than that obtained without considering it for pessimistic assessment of ultimate strength of steel thin walled structures an elastic perfectly plastic steel material model is considered sufficient and adequate in this respect the behavior of the material used in this paper is assumed to follow elastic perfectly plastic manner without considering strain hardening effect the detailed material properties are the same as the vessel steel plate in the issc 2012 issc committee ⅲ 1 2012 listed in table 2 2 2 boundary and loading conditions two independent reference nodes are built at the torsional center of front end and back end of box girder respectively the other nodes of end face and reference node are coupled in six degrees of freedom by using multipoint constraints mpc in marc software simply supported constraint is applied to two independent reference nodes as front end u x u y u z 0 and back end u y u z 0 in the subsequent nonlinear finite element analysis the external loads such as vertical bending moment and torsion are also applied on the two independent reference nodes in the form of enforced moment or displacement the boundary and loading conditions of large opening box girder with crack damage are illustrated in fig 3 2 3 initial imperfection during welding in fabrication initial imperfection is inevitable it has been shown that initial imperfection can reduce the ultimate bearing capacity to a certain extent so the initial imperfection must be taken into account in ultimate strength assessment of ship structures paik et al 2004 and yao et al 1998 investigated the effect of initial imperfections on the ultimate strength behavior of welded steel plate in their research it was found that the effect of welding residual stress on the ultimate strength is less importance compared to the welding induced residual deformation so for simplicity the welding residual stress is not accounted for in the present study as for the initial deformation the most accurate data comes from the actual measurement data but the more commonly used way in the finite element simulation is to assume that the initial deformation equivalent to the geometric deformation of first order buckling mode issc committee ⅲ 1 2000 issc committee ⅲ 1 2012 in the present application it is assumed that initial deformations of box girder without and with crack damage are equivalent to that of the first order buckling mode as shown in fig 4 and fig 5 the initial deformation amplitude is a 0 0 1 β 2 t paik et al 2004 where β b t σ y e is the slenderness ratio of side plate 2 4 adopted element type and convergence study the commercial fem software marc has been applied for all the nonlinear finite element analyses the shell139 element is chosen from the element library of marc to simulate the mechanical behavior of large opening box girder shell139 a four node element with six degrees of freedom at each node is suitable for analyzing thin to moderate thick shell structures it also can take into account the effect of membrane rigidity bending rigidity and large deformation msc 2010 in order to accurately simulate the collapse behavior of large opening box girder the mesh size of fe model should be fine enough on the other hand finer mesh will cause more computational efforts in this aspect a balance between computational time and accuracy must be made in order to select reasonable mesh size 20 mm 30 mm and 40 mm are selected as the global mesh size for analysis and comparison the torsional moment versus twisting angle curves for different mesh size are shown in fig 6 as can be seen from fig 6 the difference of ultimate strength between these three meshing sizes is relatively small but among them the mesh size 40 mm can t perform the post buckling behavior very well due to the convergence of nonlinear solution and computational time of mesh size 20 mm is too long so 30 mm is used as the global mesh size in the subsequent finite element calculations cui et al 2016 2017 conducted series of sensitivity analyses about different crack width 1 mm 3 mm 10 mm to examine its effect on the ultimate strength of cracked plate in their research average stress average strain curves of cracked plates with width w 3 mm is similar to those with the other two different crack widths furthermore it is observed that there are no contacts between the crack s faces at the ultimate limited state thus the crack width of w 3 mm is adopted for the subsequent finite element calculations due to the stress concentration the refined mesh must be allocated near the crack xu xu et al 2014 conducted sensitivity analysis of the number of elements ne near the crack tips in his research it had been found out that the ultimate strength values are almost unchanged with the increase of ne whereas the maximum equivalent stress increases at the crack tips thus the number of elements ne near the crack tips is set to 16 for all the nonlinear finite element analyses dense mesh is adopted near the crack and the mesh size gradually increases away from the crack fig 7 shows a box girder model with a refined mesh around the crack and dense mesh near the crack tips 2 5 finite element model validation in order to verify the reliability of numerical results by applying nonlinear finite element method nishihara s mst 3 and mst 4 box girders test models nishihara 1983 which have test results are adopted for verification the numerical analysis for mst 3 and mst 4 has been conducted by control arc length al solving strategy namely riks algorithm which is available in marc software msc 2010 the cross section and member dimensions of nishihara s test models are shown in fig 8 and the material properties are shown in table 3 the obtained numerical analysis curves of bending moment versus end rotated angle are shown in fig 9 the corresponding nishihara s test model results are also presented in fig 8 the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of mst 3 and mst 4 at the ultimate limit state uls are represented in fig 10 as it can be seen from fig 10 no significant difference is observed between the results from fe and those of nishihara test the fe calculation results of ultimate bending moment is slightly greater than those of nishihara test which may be due to welding residual stress that is not considered in the finite element analysis the reliability of present fe simulations for predicting ultimate strength of large opening box girder is verified 3 numerical results and discussions in this section series of elasto plastic large deformation analyses for large opening box girder under single load and combined loads were carried out with varying crack type length orientation angle and location moment versus angle curves buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girders with crack damage are obtained and presented in figs 11 31 three types of cracks namely transverse crack longitudinal crack and inclined crack are discussed the corresponding intact large opening box girder is also included as a reference 3 1 torsional loading conditions 3 1 1 transverse crack in torsional loading condition fig 11a shows the curve of reduction factor of ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage i e h d 0 5 of varying crack length the ordinate of fig 11a t u t uo represents the reduction factor of ultimate torsional strength where t u and t uo represent the ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder with and without crack damage respectively from fig 11a it can be observed that when the crack length 2c d 0 2 the ultimate torsional strength reduces significantly as the crack length increases and is approximately linearly reduced for the case of crack length 2c 0 5d the difference of ultimate strength of large opening box girder with and without crack damage reaches 27 8 fig 11b shows the curves of torsional moment versus twisting angle of the large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage varying crack length it can be seen from fig 11b that the existence of the crack affects the unloading path although initial loading paths are nearly the same for different crack lengths in another words the crack length nearly has no effect on the initial stiffness of box girder but has significant effect on the reduction of post ultimate strength it is noticed that the initial stiffness of all large opening box girders with crack damage is less than that of intact large opening box girder in order to assess the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength characteristic the case of transverse crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from transverse crack center to transverse frame and deck side line i e s and h are varied respectively fig 12 shows the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength when the transverse crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the ultimate torsional strength increases gradually this may be caused by larger structural stiffness near the transverse frame when the transverse crack approaches large opening of the deck the ultimate torsional strength decreases gradually this may be caused by smaller structural stiffness near the large opening it is interesting to note that when h d 0 25 crack has become an edge crack and edge crack leads to a sudden drop of ultimate torsional strength because of weak structural stiffness of large opening the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the large opening box girder with crack length and location changed at the uls are represented in figs 13 and 14 as show in figs 13 and 14 the side plates of box girder near the large opening have an obvious torsional buckling when the crack length is small the equivalent stress distribution of box girder with transverse crack is similar to intact box girder but when the crack length increases to 2c d 0 5 the high stress region around the crack tip occurs a substantial increase and stress of other zones away from the crack decreases to a certain extent which results in a decline of ultimate torsional strength it is shown from fig 14 that high stress region around the crack tip varies with the crack location 3 1 2 longitudinal crack in torsional loading condition fig 15 shows the reduction of the ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage of varying crack length from fig 15a it can be observed that when the crack lengths are of 2c d 0 3 the ultimate torsional strength reduces significantly as the crack length increases and is approximately linearly reduced whereas when the crack lengths are of 2c d 0 3 the effect of longitudinal crack on the ultimate torsional strength is almost negligible for the case of crack length 2c 0 5d the difference of ultimate strength of large opening box girder with and without crack damage reaches 12 6 and this descending percentage is smaller than the corresponding descending percentage of transverse crack 27 8 fig 15b shows the curves of torsional moment versus twisting angle for large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage of varying crack length as the same with transverse crack the crack length has slight effect on the initial stiffness of cracked plates but has significant effect on the ultimate strength values in order to assess the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength characteristic the case of longitudinal crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from longitudinal crack center to transverse frame and deck side line respectively are varied fig 16 shows the effect of crack location on the ultimate torsional strength it can be clearly seen that when the longitudinal crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the ultimate torsional strength increases gradually the same reason is that the structural stiffness near the transverse frame is larger when the longitudinal crack approaches large opening of deck the ultimate torsional strength increased very slightly namely the transverse location of longitudinal crack has slight effect on the residual ultimate torsional strength the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder with changed longitudinal crack length and location at the uls are represented in figs 17 and 18 as show in figs 17 and 18 side plate of box girder has an obvious torsional buckling and crack length and location have a certain effect on the amplitude of torsional buckling deformation in comparison with fig 13a the torsional buckling deformation is larger as the crack length increases or the crack is closer to large opening 3 1 3 inclined crack in torsional loading condition the orientation angle of crack i e θ as shown in fig 2c is changed in the range of 15 75 to assess its effect on the ultimate torsional strength the crack length is also changed simultaneously for the simplicity only the central inclined crack i e the center of inclined crack is aligned with that of side plate h d s a 0 5 is taken into consideration table 4 shows the reduction factor t u t uo of the ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder vs orientation angle of the crack as well as crack length and the reduction factor values are plotted in fig 19 for comparative analysis the relevant data of transverse crack θ 0 and longitudinal crack θ 90 are also shown in table 4 and fig 19 it can be seen from fig 19 that when the crack length is small the residual ultimate torsional strength increases slightly with the increase of the crack angle however for box girder model with the crack length of 2c d 0 4 and 0 5 when the orientation angle of the crack is θ 60 the residual ultimate torsional strength increases significantly with the increase of the crack angle and when the orientation angle of the crack is θ 60 the residual ultimate torsional strength reaches a peak when the orientation angle of the crack is θ 60 the residual ultimate torsional strength began to decline the reason for the phenomena may be that θ 60 is closer to side plate deformation angle arctan a d 51 3 of the first order torsional buckling mode that leads to slightest effect on the deformation when the orientation angle of crack reaches zero as a transverse crack the residual ultimate torsional strength will be the lowest value regardless of crack length namely the transverse crack has the greatest effect on the reduction of residual ultimate torsional strength due to abrupt change of residual ultimate torsional strength at θ 60 threes crack angles close to θ 60 are paid extra attentions the corresponding buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the large opening box girder with the crack of specified angle at the uls are represented in fig 20 3 2 vertical bending loading conditions 3 2 1 intact large opening box girder in vertical bending loading condition because large opening leads to great loss of deck area the ultimate bearing capacity of large opening box girder in the sagging condition is usually smaller than that in the hogging condition in order to know the difference of them the ultimate strength of intact large opening box girder in the sagging and hogging condition are calculated by fem and compared with that in pure torsion condition as shown in table 5 fig 21 shows bending moment versus angle curves of intact large opening box in the sagging and hogging condition the peak values of ultimate bending moment are shown in table 5 the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of intact large opening box girder at the uls in the sagging and hogging condition are shown in fig 22 it can be seen from table 5 that the ultimate bending moment in the sagging condition is slightly larger than the ultimate torsional moment while ultimate bending moment in the hogging condition is far greater than the ultimate torsional moment therefore in the following calculation and analysis for vertical bending condition only the sagging condition is taken into account 3 2 2 transverse crack in vertical bending loading condition table 6 shows reduction factor m u m u0 of residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage varying crack length where m u represents the residual ultimate bending moment of large opening box girder with crack damage and m u0 represents the ultimate bending moment of intact large opening box girder the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of intact large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage at the uls varying crack length are depicted in fig 23 it can be clearly seen in table 6 that the residual ultimate bending moment decreases slowly with the increase of the crack length at the same time it can be seen from fig 23 that the crack length of transverse crack located at side plate has slight effect on the equivalent stress distribution of the box girder so the crack length of transverse crack located at side plate has little effect on the residual ultimate bending strength for the purpose of examining the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength characteristic the case of transverse crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from transverse crack center to transverse frame and deck side line respectively are varied fig 24 shows the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength fig 24 illustrates that when the transverse crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the initial stiffness and the residual ultimate bending strength are almost unchanged however when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck the residual ultimate bending strength decreases rapidly compared with the central transverse crack h d 0 5 the residual ultimate bending moment with transverse location h d 0 25 decreases by approximately 28 the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder at the uls varying crack location of transverse crack are represented in fig 25 as can be seen from fig 25 for the transverse crack close to the transverse frame of the box girder equivalent stress distribution of box girder with crack damage is almost the same as that of intact box girder but when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck high stress range of the upper section decreased significantly leading to decrease the residual ultimate bending strength significantly this phenomenon is particularly evident for the case of transverse location h d 0 25 because the transverse crack has become an edge crack at this case 3 2 3 longitudinal crack in vertical bending loading condition table 7 shows reduction factor m u m u0 of residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage varying crack length the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of intact large opening box girder with central transverse crack damage at the uls varying crack length are depicted in fig 26 all reduction factors of large opening box girder with central longitudinal crack damage in table 7 are almost close to 1 there is no denial that central longitudinal crack length almost has no effect on the residual ultimate bending strength of box girder this may be for the reason that the center longitudinal crack is always near the neutral axis of box girder and has slight effect on the stress distribution of box girder as shown in fig 26 for the purpose of examining the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength characteristics the case of longitudinal crack length 2c d 0 5 is selected while the distances from longitudinal crack center to transverse frame and deck side line respectively are varied fig 27 shows the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate bending strength fig 27 illustrates that when the longitudinal crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the effect of longitudinal location of central longitudinal crack on the initial stiffness unloading paths and residual ultimate bending strength is almost negligible and also the effect of transverse location is very slight the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder at the uls varying crack location of longitudinal crack are depicted in fig 28 in addition one feature observed from fig 28 is that high stress region of the upper section decreased for the case of transverse location h d 0 1 3 2 4 inclined crack in vertical bending loading condition the orientation angle of crack is changed in the range of 15 75 to assess its effect on the residual ultimate torsional strength in this section for the simplicity only the central inclined crack with the crack length of 2c d 0 5 and crack location of h d s a 0 5 is taken into consideration in this section table 8 shows the reduction factor m u m u0 of residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with crack 2c d 0 5 s a h d 0 5 damage varying orientation angle of the crack and the reduction factor values are plotted in fig 29 it can be seen from table 8 that the residual ultimate bending strength of box girder with inclined crack is between those of transverse cracks and longitudinal cracks in which the transverse crack θ 0 has the greatest effect on the residual ultimate bending moment several noteworthy features seen from fig 29 are that reduction factor of residual ultimate bending strength almost has no change as the orientation angle of crack increases but a slight increase occurs between 45 and 60 for the reason that the range of orientation angle is closer to the deformation angle of the first order buckling mode under pure vertical bending moment 3 3 combined loading conditions based on the above numerical results of the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder under individually applied torsion or vertical bending moment sagging condition two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are selected to analyze the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder under combined loading conditions the reason of choosing these two of the most dangerous crack damage situations is in the following explanation for the central crack the transverse crack has the greatest effect on the residual ultimate torsional moment and residual ultimate bending moment of large opening box girder based on series of analyses about the effect of crack location on the residual ultimate torsional strength similar feature can be observed that when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck a sudden drop of residual ultimate torsional or bending strength will occur because the transverse crack has become an edge crack at this point that is not evident for the longitudinal crack two of the most dangerous crack damage situations are listed as follows case1 transverse central crack s a h d 0 5 2c d 0 5 case2 transverse edge crack s a 0 5 h d 0 25 2c d 0 5 in the subsequent nonlinear finite element analysis for combined loads five load ratios of vertical bending moment m versus torsion t i e 3 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 and 1 3 are selected to apply the enforced moments on the two independent reference nodes in the calculation process the applied vertical bending moment and torsion will increase gradually together until large opening box girder model collapses table 9 and table 10 present the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder with the two cases of crack damage under combined loads varying load ratios in the two tables 9 and 10 lpf is the abbreviation of load proportionality factor m u0 and t u0 represent the residual ultimate strength of intact large opening box girder under the torsion and vertical bending loads respectively reduction factor of residual ultimate torsional or bending strength is denoted by t u t u0 or m u m u0 in addition the load ratios 1 0 and 0 1 i e under pure vertical bending moment and pure torsion are also included as the supplements the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of large opening box girder with two cases of crack damage at the uls varying load ratios are depicted in figs 30 and 31 the greatest change seen from fig 31 is that equivalent stress increases gradually as the load ratio decreases gradually based on the calculated results of reduction factor seen in tables 9 and 10 two interaction curves under the torsion and vertical bending loads are presented in fig 32 the interaction curves under the torsion and vertical bending loads for case1 and case2 are approximately elliptical shape and the interaction curve of case2 is completely inside that of case1 which indicates that the residual ultimate strength of case2 is less than that of case1 thus transverse edge crack i e case2 is the most dangerous crack damage situation 3 4 proposed formula as can be seen evidently from fig 30 the residual ultimate torsional strength gradually decreases as the residual ultimate bending strength increases and vice versa therefore the interaction relationship between them can be approximately described as a circular curve cui et al 2017 1 m u m u 0 2 t u t u 0 2 1 paik et al paik et al 2005 paik 2008 2009 proposed a frequently used formula based on net section theory to predict the residual ultimate strength of simply supported steel plates with crack damage under axial compression or tension 2 r f σ u σ u 0 o r τ u τ u 0 a c a 0 in eq 2 r f is the abbreviation of reduction factor a 0 and a c denote the total cross sectional area of large opening box girder without and with crack damage respectively however the opening edge of the box girder may have a lower stiffness than that of the other three edges supported by continuous plating so the boundary condition for the side plate near the large opening cannot be assumed as a simply supported but a free boundary condition thus the crack damage in a large opening box girder will result in a lower value than eq 2 here a coefficient α is introduced to account for the influence of this boundary condition 3 r f σ u σ u 0 o r τ u τ u 0 a c a 0 4 d α 2 c t 4 d t 1 α 4 2 c d in eq 3 r f is the reduction factor and a c denote total cross sectional area of large opening box girder with crack damage considering the coefficient in the present study a similar formula as eq 1 is proposed considering the effect of crack damage in the term of eq 3 4 m u m u 0 2 t u t u 0 2 a c a 0 2 α 4 2 c d 2 when 2c 0 5d and assuming reduction factor of combined loads is equal to the product of single load shi and wang 2012b the right side of eq 4 can be rewritten into 5 r f t r f b a c a 0 2 1 α 4 2 c d 2 1 α 8 2 when 2 c d 0 5 in eq 5 r f t and r f b denote reduction factor of residual ultimate torsional and bending strength of large opening box girder with case2 crack damage respectively their values equal to t u t u0 and m u m u0 here t u and m u denote the residual ultimate torsional or bending strength value of box girder with case2 crack damage under single load which can be obtained from figs 12b and 24b substitute these two values into eq 5 it is obtained that coefficient α 2 72 thus proposed formula can be summarized into 6 m u m u 0 2 t u t u 0 2 1 1 36 c d 2 eq 6 is also shown in fig 32 to verify its accuracy and applicability as for other crack length the same work with the above mentioned two cases of crack damage has been done fig 33 shows the interaction curves under combined loads of varying crack length it needs to note that proposed formula is just suitable for the crack length of 2c d 0 2 because short crack has only slight effect on the residual ultimate torsional or bending strength nfea results of similar models obtained from the literature ao and wang 2012 shi and wang 2012a 2012b are listed in table 11 which are presented for the references of proposed formula reduction factor of proposed formula represents the ellipse focal length of interaction curve in table 11 as can be seen from table 11 that reduction factor of proposed formula is slightly smaller than that of the literature ao and wang 2012 shi and wang 2012a 2012b and this also verifies the accuracy of proposed formula again 4 conclusions in the present study the residual ultimate strength of large opening box girder under torsion and bending loads has been investigated by the nonlinear finite element analysis series of elasto plastic large deformation analyses have been carried out with varying crack length location and orientation angle based on the nonlinear numerical results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 in the torsional loading condition the residual ultimate torsional strength of large opening box girder decreases as the crack length increases but the effect of transverse crack on the ultimate torsional strength is far greater than that of longitudinal crack 2 in the torsional loading condition when the transverse crack approaches large opening of the deck the ultimate torsional strength decreases slowly whereas when the location of transverse crack is of h d 0 25 a sudden drop of ultimate torsional strength will occur it is the reason that transverse crack has become an edge crack on the other hand the location of longitudinal crack has sight effect on the residual ultimate torsional strength 3 when the orientation angle of crack is changed the reduction factor of residual ultimate torsional strength has the minimum value for the transverse crack θ 0 however the reduction factor reaches a peak for the crack orientation angle θ 60 4 in the vertical bending loading condition transverse crack length has little effect on the residual ultimate bending strength but is larger in comparison with longitudinal crack which has no effect on the ultimate bending strength 5 in the vertical bending loading condition when the transverse crack moves towards the transverse frame of box girder the initial stiffness and the ultimate bending strength are almost unchanged however when the transverse crack approaches large opening of deck the ultimate bending strength decreases rapidly on the other hand the location of longitudinal crack regardless of transverse location or longitudinal location has slight effect on the ultimate bending strength 6 the residual ultimate bending strength of large opening box girder with inclined crack is between those of transverse cracks and longitudinal cracks in which the transverse crack θ 0 has the greatest effect on the ultimate bending moment the residual ultimate bending strength almost has no change as the orientation angle of crack increases but a slight increase occurs between 45 and 60 7 based on the interaction relationship and the shape of interaction curves a simple formula is proposed to predict the residual strength of large opening box girder with crack damage the validity of this simple formula is verified by some cases of varying the crack length 8 the research work has some contributions in the assessment of the residual strength of ship hull girder with crack damage under individually applied loading torsion or bending only or combined loading torsion and bending together acknowledgements the present

23289,linear boundary element methods generally provide accurately enough predictions of ship motions in small amplitude waves however when the wave induced added resistance is investigated nonlinear effects are to be accounted for higher order effects such as second order wave induced drift forces depend largely on ships forward speed this article presents a nonlinear time domain rankine source method to calculate the wave induced added resistance of ships advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves the fully nonlinear steady flow was computed nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic forces were obtained by integrating pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface undisturbed incident wave radiation forces were computed in time domain using convolution integrals cummins approach diffraction forces were computed using the complex force amplitude resulting from the linear seakeeping problem of incident wave diffraction radiation and diffraction effects caused by the changing wetted surface were accounted for an empirical approach to account for the viscous wave added resistance was introduced numerical results for a 14 000teu container ship and a very large tanker were compared to results from a frequency domain method cfd calculations and experimental towing tank measurements keywords added resistance in waves viscous added resistance in waves nonlinear boundary element method comparative study 1 introduction optimizing and dimensioning a ship s hull and its propulsion system are relevant design issues in this regard speed loss in waves has become important as it effects fuel consumption which contributes to operational costs speed loss must be considered not only to meet a ship s time schedule but it has become also a safety issue because maneuverability has to be maintained under adverse weather conditions see e g papanikolaou et al 2015 kwon 2008 prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 sigmund and el moctar 2018 kim et al 2016 indeed the international maritime organization 2013 2015 requires that ships be equipped with a minimum engine output furthermore ship pollution and carbon emissions have come into focus to reduce the carbon emissions of ships the imo 2011 published regulations and introduced the energy efficiency design index eedi relating carbon emissions and transported amount of cargo to ship speed to meet these requirements in future ships need to become more efficient one way to improve efficiency regarding eedi is to reduce ship speed however reducing a ship s design speed leads to a decrease of the required maximum engine output and this raises the question whether the ship is able to maintain minimum forward speed under adverse weather condition to ensure safe maneuverability an alternative to improving ship efficiency is to design its hull and propulsion system for the representative sea conditions generally ships are designed for a service speed in calm water actually the ship seldomly operates under these ideal fair weather conditions in practice an experience based allowance called sea margin accounts for the additional resistance in actual weather conditions and ensures that the ship is maneuverable also in severe seas however this approach does not always meet the requirements of a modern ship design and may lead to an unnecessary power reserve or to an underpowered ship that cannot maneuver safely under adverse sea conditions rathje et al 2011 therefore the maneuverability of ships in waves is of growing interest see e g skejic and faltinsen 2008 zhang et al 2017 furthermore ship lines seem to be optimized for sea conditions the ship may rarely experience rather than for the actual sea conditions service operational conditions should be considered already during the design processes to more accurately optimize the ship s resistance in waves see e g park et al 2014 kim et al 2014 2015 modern ship design calls for tools to assess added resistance in waves conventional methods comprise model tests empirical formulas and numerical techniques these methods differ significantly in accuracy and cost model tests are still one of the most reliable methods exemplified by recent tests conducted within the framework of the european research projects shopera papanikolaou et al 2015 for a cruise ship valanto and hong 2015 and a containership sprenger et al 2017 however model tests are expensive and therefore the number of test runs has to be limited empirical formulas need constant updating and although useful at the preliminary design stage are of limited use for the design of new ship types numerical methods are generally based on potential theory or field methods that solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the latter method has been proven useful for ship hydrodynamics problems associated with strong nonlinear effects such as the changing wetted surface breaking waves and viscous effects el moctar et al 2017 sigmund and el moctar 2018 for example used a field method to demonstrate that forward speed strongly affects wave added resistance and that viscous effects influence wave added resistance in short waves others notably sportelli and huijsmans 2012 lyu and el moctar 2017 kim et al 2017 ley et al 2014 gue et al 2012 and sadat hosseini et al 2010 2013 also used this method to study wave added resistance in all cases however the computational effort was high and only an experienced user was able to obtain reliable results the obvious advantage of potential theory based methods is their computational efficiency and their use predominated before the development of modern computers maruo 1960 1963 was one of the first to assess wave added resistance using the far field method to calculate radiated and diffracted wave energy and momentum flux at infinity gerritsma and beukelman 1972 and journee 2001 modified this approach within a linear strip theory method and demonstrated the importance of bow wave diffraction for the prediction of wave added resistance in short waves following maruo s approach kashiwagi 1995 2009 2011 also accounted for the effect of bow wave diffraction salvesen 1978 using gerritsma s and beukelman s approach within a strip theory method showed the importance of an accurate prediction of ship motions when calculating wave added resistance most of these potential theory based solvers however turned out to be unreliable to asses wave added resistance in short waves boese 1970 tried to resolve this shortcoming by integrating hydrodynamic pressures later faltinsen et al 1980 developed a more accurate pressure integration method for short waves söding et al 2014 introduced a frequency domain potential flow solver based on rankine sources which couples the effect of the nonlinear stationary forward speed problem with the linear seakeeping problem his method directly integrates the pressure at the hull accounts for the changing wetted surface boese s approach and time averages the second order pressure field lui et al 2017 compared his results obtained with this method to rans based predictions and model test measurements and found generally favorable agreement however wave added resistance in short waves was underestimated strongly for several cases later developments were characterized by time domain potential flow solvers using such an approach kim et al 2010 for example calculated the added resistance from diffraction and radiation components and liu et al 2011 employed a three dimensional frequency domain panel method and a hybrid time domain rankine source solver based on green functions and a far field approach to calculate wave added resistance at small froude numbers predictions from these methods compared well to experiments however at large froude numbers errors increased a distinct advantage of time domain solvers is that nonlinear froude krylov forces are calculated more accurately because the instantaneous wetted surface is accounted for without excessive numerical effort these forces often contribute strongly to wave added resistance the quintessence of this review is that three aspects should be considered to accurately predict wave added resistance namely forward speed effects the changing wetted surface geometrical nonlinearity and viscous effects our method presented here started from the ship motions solver of riesner et al 2016 following cummins approach cummins 1962 we modelled radiation forces via convolution integrals and froude krylov as well as restoring forces via integration over the instantaneous wetted surface we used a frequency domain technique of söding s et al 2012 to obtain frequency dependent response coefficients and to determine forward speed effects caused by the steady wave system as well as the associated dynamic trim and sinkage we also accounted for geometrical nonlinearities caused by radiation and diffraction using the approach of boese 1970 to account for viscous effects we introduced an empirical procedure based on results obtained by sigmund and el moctar et al 2018 which proved effective especially in short waves for a 14 000teu containership and a very large tanker advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves we compared our wave added resistance predictions to those obtained from a rans solver a frequency domain method and model test measurements compared to frequency domain predictions our method resulted in more accurate predictions especially in short and medium length waves 2 numerical method following standard practice two right handed coordinate systems describe ship motions namely an inertial system x x y z t moving with the ship s forward speed and a ship bound coordinate system x x y z t used to simplify the description of external forces acting on the ship coordinate x points positive to the bow y positive to port and z positive upward the origin of these coordinate systems is located at the centre of gravity the following equation solves ship motions 1 m a x t b x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ f d i f t f f k r t f w l t the left hand side of 1 includes radiation forces based on the approach of cummins 1962 and ogilvie 1964 thus radiation forces in time domain result from fourier transforms of hydrodynamic response forces from a frequency domain solution namely the hydrodynamic added mass at infinite frequency a the hydrodynamic damping at infinite frequency b and the convolution integral that calculates the elapsed history of the radiation forces based on the impulse response function k t and the body velocities x times t and τ represent respectively current time and time of the past history inertial ship reactions to the ship s mass are calculated using ship mass matrix m multiplied by ship acceleration vector x the right hand site of 1 includes diffraction forces f dif based on the complex diffraction force amplitude resulting from the linear problem of the incident wave diffraction as well as the combined nonlinear froude krylov and restoring forces f fk r taking into account the changing wetted surface caused by incident radiated and diffracted waves and the dynamic trim and sinkage caused by the ship s constant forward speed a frequency domain method that couples the stationary nonlinear forward speed problem with the linear seakeeping problem obtains radiation and diffraction forces in 1 by integrating first order pressures over the mean wetted surface to accurately calculate wave added resistance an additional force component f wl accounts for the changing wetted surface caused by these radiation and diffraction forces 2 1 frequency dependent response coefficients the rankine source frequency domain method of söding et al 2012 and von graefe 2014 calculates frequency dependent hydrodynamic response coefficients and diffraction forces this method accounts for the interaction between the nonlinear stationary flow in calm water including steady ship waves and dynamic trim and sinkage and its interaction with the periodic flow in waves following hachmann s approach for seakeeping hachmann 1991 the total potential ϕ t ω e in waves is written as a superposition of the steady potential ϕ 0 and the periodic potential ϕ ˆ 1 as follows 2 ϕ t x t u x ϕ t x t u x ϕ 0 x r e ϕ ˆ 1 e i ω e t the dynamic boundary condition is expressed as 3 ϕ 0 u ϕ ˆ 1 α ˆ ϕ 0 2 ϕ 0 v ˆ i ω e ϕ ˆ 1 v ˆ ϕ 0 g ς ˆ 1 v ˆ ς 0 0 where α ˆ is the amplitude of the ship rotation vector v ˆ is the amplitude of the total motion of a point on the ship and i is the imaginary unit number the kinematic boundary condition reads as follows 4 i ω e ς ˆ 1 v ˆ ς 0 ς 0 ϕ ˆ 1 ϕ 0 u ς ˆ 1 z ϕ ˆ 1 α ˆ ϕ 0 y ϕ 0 x u ς 0 y t a ˆ 0 where a ˆ includes all second order derivatives and is written as 5 a ˆ v ˆ n o n o 2 n o 2 ϕ 0 n o 2 ς 0 ϕ 0 u with n being the unit vector normal to the stationary free surface 6 n o ς 0 x ς 0 y 1 t the corresponding body boundary condition is as follows 7 n x ϕ ˆ 1 α ˆ u i ω e v ˆ 0 finally the frequency dependent part of the first order pressure is calculated from 8 p ˆ 1 ρ u ϕ 0 ϕ ˆ 1 i ω i ϕ ˆ 1 v ˆ ϕ 0 to determine hydrodynamic added mass and damping at infinite encounter frequency a simplified boundary value problem is solved the free surface condition prevails instead of the high frequency condition 9 ϕ ˆ 1 0 this condition is satisfied analytically by placing image sources of opposite sign source strengths symmetrically on the undisturbed free surface in addition more accurate results are obtained by locating mirrored sources on the nonlinear stationary free surface when considering the steady wave system söding 2009 although not satisfied exactly the associated boundary condition 9 is fulfilled to a sufficient level of accuracy 2 2 radiation diffraction and froude krylov forces regarding the radiation forces the impulse response functions k t are calculated using hydrodynamic added mass and damping coefficients computed with a rankine source frequency domain method riesner et al 2016 here only the impulse response functions from damping are needed and calculated as follows 10 k t 2 π 0 ω m a x b ω e b cos ω e t d ω 2 π ω m a x 2 b ω m a x b t s i ω m a x t π t 2 cos ω m a x t ω m a x where ω e is the wave encounter frequency ω m a x is the angular frequency corresponding to the maximum value obtained from frequency domain computations and s i x s i n x x d x the diffraction force is derived from the complex diffraction force amplitude f ˆ d i f which is obtained from the frequency domain rankine source method calculation 11 f d i f t re f ˆ d i f e i w e t integrating the hydrostatic pressure p f k r up to the instantaneous wetted surface of an undisturbed wave known as the smith effect while also accounting for wave elevation ship motions and the stationary wave system caused by the steady forward speed in calm water yields the combined froude krylov and restoring force f f k r 12 f f k r t s t p f k r x t n x t d s the linearized bernoulli equation is solved to calculate the hydrostatic pressure p f k r using wheeler stretching wheeler 1979 to more accurately calculate the pressure near the free surface assuming infinitely deep water the hydrostatic pressure p f k r then is expressed as follows 13 p f k r x k ω e t ρ g z ζ 0 x ζ 1 x t e k z ζ 1 x t where ζ 1 x t is the free surface elevation caused by the undisturbed incident wave and ζ 0 x is the stationary free surface elevation caused by the ship s forward speed to accurately integrate pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface panels intersecting the free surface are modified according to the approach of riesner et al 2016 2 3 radiation and diffraction forces caused by changing wetted surface a linear frequency domain boundary element method yields radiation and diffraction pressures which are then integrated over the mean wetted surface neglecting variations of hull submergence caused by the incident wave and the ship motions relative motions between wave contour and hull and the associated pressure distribution on the hull surface are approximated from first order pressure at the mean waterline boese 1970 implemented a similar approach into a linear frequency domain boundary element method to successfully calculate time average drift forces however our technique calculates the drift force in time domain at a typical ship section shown in fig 1 the relative motion is the distance d t above the mean water surface w l and the instantaneous wave elevation w l t the pressure at the hull is p x t the pressure at the mean water line p w l t a linear frequency domain calculation neglects pressures within the red colored triangle assuming a linear pressure distribution between the mean water surface w l and the instantaneous wave elevation w l t the corresponding force summed over all waterline panels f wl t is calculated as follows 14 f w l t w l p a n e l s p w l 2 t s n s 2 ρ g n s 3 a waterline panel wl panel is a triangular body panel having two of its three corners at the mean waterline s is the vector between these two corners and index 3 designates the third component vertical of the resulting vector in a linear frequency domain method p w l t is the sum of the pressure contributions from radiation including restoring diffraction and froude krylov forces however our weakly nonlinear time domain method already integrates froude krylov and restoring force pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface therefore we must only include coupling effects between these pressures contributions and this leads to the following expression 15 p w l 2 t p r a d 2 t p d i f 2 t 2 p r a d t p d i f t 2 p r a d t p f k r t 2 p d i f t p f k r t the first two terms on the right hand side of 15 result directly from radiation and diffraction and had linear froude krylov forces been used instead of the nonlinear froude krylov forces integrated over the instantaneous wetted surface 15 would also include a term p f r 2 t the last three terms on the right hand side of 15 account for coupling effects between pressures caused by radiation diffraction and froude krylov effects pressure p d i f t is calculated from the frequency domain results using 11 applied over every waterline panel pressure p f k r t is the froude krylov and radiation pressure pressure p r a d t is calculated using convolution integrals in a manner similar to the calculation of total radiation forces acting on the ship see 1 accounting for contributions from all six rigid body motions p r a d t is calculated as follows 16 p r a d t a x t b x t t k t τ x t d τ the radiation force in 1 acts over the entire ship whereas 16 stands for the radiation pressure acting at a single water line panel therefore a x and b x are here pressure induced force components of added mass and damping and k t accounts for the time history of the pressure caused by only an impulse on the ship here a b and k t are vectors and multiplied by the velocity and acceleration vector using the scalar product a and b yield from 17 a i w e 2 r e p ˆ i 1 b i w e 1 i m p ˆ i 1 where index i stands for the rigid body motion components the impulse response function k t is calculated similarly to 10 the memory storage necessary to calculate pressures acting on a waterline panel is six times less than the memory storage to calculate the radiation forces and moments acting on the hull using 1 nevertheless the coefficients in 16 need to be stored for every waterline panel whereas 1 already includes the radiation response of the complete ship our sample calculations required about 200 waterline panels the computational time using one core of a standard personal computer for simulations of the freely moving ship was approximately 200s for a time step of 0 05s the computational time for 20 time steps was about one second 3 results we compared results from our time domain rankine source boundary element method tdir to experimental measurements efd and to numerical results from a reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse solver cfd and a linear frequency domain method glr we focused on wave added resistance in regular head waves of a 14 000teu container ship here referred to as the duisburg test case dtc el moctar et al 2012 and a very large tanker here referred to as the kvlcc2 tanker table 1 lists their main particulars and forward speeds benchmark model test measurements for the dtc containership were carried out at marintek within the framework of the eu funded project shopera papanikolaou et al 2015 sprenger et al 2017 the model test results for kvlcc2 were taken from sadat hosseini et al 2013 cfd results were taken from sigmund and el moctar 2018 their cfd simulations were performed using the ranse solver openfoam and comet all comparisons were made for model scale first we compared time histories of longitudinal hydrodynamic forces obtained from our tdir method and the cfd method although the velocity potential of our tdir method accounted for wave elevation and the dynamic trim and sinkage obtained from a previous solution of the stationary flow problem the total hydrodynamic force in time domain did not include calm water resistance therefore to compare time histories from our tdir to time histories from the cfd method calm water resistance had to be subtracted from the total hydrodynamic force obtained from the cfd method in general hydrodynamic force components acting on a ship in regular head waves depend on the relation between wave length λ and ship length l therefore we compared time histories obtained in a long wave in a wave of length close to the ship s length and in a short wave for greater clarity the froude krylov radiation diffraction and waterline forces were plotted separately then the time average drift force wave added resistance obtained from tdir cfd efd and glr methods were compared the associated normalized wave drift force here known as the wave added resistance coefficient c aw ω was expressed as follows 18 c a w ω r a w ω l p p ρ g b 2 ζ 2 where r a w is the wave added resistance g the gravity constant ρ is the fluid density and ζ is the wave amplitude the time averaged values were calculated based on a fourier analysis the transition phase first periods of the simulation was not considered in the analysis our method considered the changing undisturbed wetted surface caused by incident waves and the ship motions to separate effects from radiation and diffraction we compared time histories of forces on the fixed ships first and afterwards forces on the ships moving freely in heave and pitch for a fixed ship radiation forces are zero for the ship being free in heave and pitch first harmonic motion amplitudes were compared the dimensionless amplitude of heave z is 19 z z ζ where z is the corresponding heave first harmonic amplitude the dimensionless amplitude of pitch θ is 20 θ θ k ζ where k is the wave number 3 1 force components for the fixed dtc containership for the fixed containership dtc in regular head waves of length corresponding to λ l 2 5 and an amplitude of ζ 6 365m full scale the upper graph in fig 2 plots time histories of the nonlinear froude krylov force f k the center graph time histories of the diffraction force dif and its nonlinear contribution wl the lower graph compares the total hydrodynamic force obtained from our tdir method total and the force from the cfd method cfd the amplitude of the nonlinear f k force is about six times higher than the amplitude of the diffraction force dif and the phase shift is about 180deg furthermore the diffraction force is harmonic only linear diffraction pressure acted on the non moving ship hull but the nonlinear f k force is non harmonic indicated by the longer time span between a positive peak and a negative peak than the corresponding time span between a negative and a positive peak the force component caused by the diffraction pressure acting on the non average wetted surface plus its coupling effects with the froude krylov pressure wl is three times smaller than the diffraction force and its main period equals half of the wave encounter period second order effect however its time average value of 8 99n is negative and its magnitude is almost twice as large as the magnitude of the time average f k force of 4 77n consequently although the waterline force did not strongly influence the amplitude of the total hydrodynamic force it needed to be considered for the calculation of drift forces the sum of all forces is the total hydrodynamic force total plotted in the lower graph in fig 2 the phase shift between the nonlinear froude krylov force f k and the diffraction force dif caused its amplitude to be slightly smaller than the amplitude of the f k force which agrees favorably to the force obtained from the cfd method the amplitude of their first harmonics is nearly equal from our tdir method this amplitude is 211 3n from the cfd method 219 34n however their time average forces differ from our tdir method this time average force is 13 76n from the cfd method 19 70n for the fixed containership dtc in regular head waves of length corresponding to λ l 1 09 and an amplitude of ζ 5 60m full scale the upper graph in fig 3 plots time histories of the nonlinear froude krylov force f k the center graph time histories of the diffraction force dif and its nonlinear contribution wl similar to the time histories plots in waves of λ l 2 50 the froude krylov force f k is again non harmonic however in this case the time span between a positive and a negative peak is shorter than the time span between a negative and a positive peak the difference between the first order harmonic amplitude of the froude krylov force f k and the diffraction force dif is smaller than for the case of λ l 2 50 the amplitude of the f k force is about twice as large the time average of the f k force is 3 33n the first order harmonic amplitude of the nonlinear water line force is still small compared to the f k and dif amplitudes however its time average of 8 96n is the largest contribution to the total drift force the time history of total hydrodynamic force from our tdir method total compared favorably to the time history from the cfd method cfd the first order harmonic amplitude from our tdir method is 166 23n from the cfd method 177 41n furthermore the time average for this case i e for waves of λ l 1 09 agrees more favorably to the case of λ l 2 50 our tdir computed a time average of 12 30n is close to the cfd computed time average of 14 78n for the fixed containership dtc in regular head waves of length corresponding to λ l 0 60 and an amplitude of ζ 3 775m full scale the overall behavior of hydrodynamic force components did not change much compared to the behavior of in waves of λ l ratios discussed above see fig 4 compared to the previous case of λ l 1 09 the difference between amplitudes of the first order harmonic of the froude krylov force f k and the diffraction force dif increased again i e f k amplitudes were about four times higher than dif amplitudes the time average of the froude krylov force was 1 20n the time average of the water line force 4 41n for this case of λ l 0 60 the total hydrodynamic force from our tdir method total compares slightly less favorably to this force from the cfd method cfd than for the cases of λ l 2 50 and λ l 1 09 as seen in fig 4 the first harmonic amplitudes of 41 02n from our tdir method total and of 38 17n from the cfd method cfd are still similar and their respective time averages values of 5 69n from our tdir method and 6 40n from the cfd method cfd correlate more closely than for the case of λ l 2 50 3 2 wave added resistance for the fixed dtc containership overall our computed time histories tdir agreed favorably to those obtained from the cfd method cfd however sometimes the time average forces from these two methods differed significantly to gain additional insight fig 5 plots comparative wave added resistance coefficient caw i e the normalized quadratic transfer function of wave drift forces for the fixed dtc containership in regular head waves of differing lengths corresponding to λ l ratios ranging between 0 22 and 2 50 generally seakeeping methods based on potential theory underestimate wave added resistance in short waves see e g lyu and el moctar et al 2017 to more easily focus on short waves we plotted the wave added resistance coefficient against not only the wave length ratio λ l but also the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 together with wave added resistance coefficients from our tdir method tdir and the cfd method cfd fig 5 plots also comparable coefficients from the linear frequency domain potential method glr as for the case of λ l 2 50 coefficients from our tdir method tdir and the cfd method cfd differ in long waves but this difference decreases with decreasing wave length until it increases again in short waves in long waves coefficients from the potential method glr behave similarly however with decreasing wave length the coefficient from the linear potential method glr decreases markedly whereas the coefficients from our tdir method tdir and the cfd method cfd remain approximately constant over the whole range of wave lengths indicating that our tdir method tdir constituted a significant improvement for the calculation of the wave added resistance coefficient in waves of almost every wave length except in very long waves 3 3 motions for the freely floating dtc containership generally our tdir method reliably predicted ship motions for a freely moving ship however the cfd simulations were conducted for the dtc containership fixed in surge only and free to move in heave and pitch in contrast to the totally fixed ship hydrodynamic forces then included radiation components caused by the ship s heave and pitch motions for the cases we considered table 2 lists the associated wave length via ratio λ l wave amplitude ζ and wave steepness via ratio h λ where h is wave height 2 ζ the wave conditions were selected based on the physical model tests sprenger et al 2017 depending on the relation of wave length and ship length the wave added resistance was in some cases strongly affected by radiation forces to calculate the wave added resistance more precisely an accurate computation of ship motions is important salvesen 1978 therefore we first calculated and compared ship motions with experimental results riesner et al 2016 against wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 fig 6 and fig 7 plot transfer functions of normalized heave see equation 19 and pitch motions see equation 20 respectively obtained from our nonlinear tdir method tdir form the cfd method cfd from linear frequency domain method glr and from riesner et al 2016 efd in general the agreement was favorable our tdir method underestimated heave motions slightly in waves of 1 1 l λ 0 5 1 4 the glr method overestimated heave motions in waves of l λ 0 5 1 0 pitch motions obtained from all three methods agree favorably compared to the results of riesner et al 2016 heave and pitch transfer function from our tdir method did not change significantly by including nonlinear radiation and diffraction force components ship motions were only slightly affected because we assumed that amplitudes of waterline force are small compared to amplitudes of nonlinear froude krylov forces and linear radiation and diffraction forces however we also assumed that the contribution of the waterline force dominates the wave added resistance also for the freely moving ship the comparative time histories of all force components confirmed our assumptions according to journee 2001 and kashiwagi 1995 2009 and 2011 wave bow interactions are important for an accurate calculation of wave added resistance relative motions of a ship s bow and the free surface result from coupled heave and pitch motions and incident waves to investigate this relationship fig 8 and fig 9 plot phase angles between incident waves and heave and pitch motions respectively again against wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 obtained from our nonlinear tdir method tdir form the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr the incident wave elevation was calculated with respect to the ship s center of gravity a positive heave motion was defined as a vertical upward motion and a positive pitch motion was defined to be bow down a negative phase angle means that the motion follows the wave fig 8 shows that in long waves heave is in phase with the incident wave φ 0 and that the phase angle increases with decreasing wave length in fig 9 the phase angle between incident wave and the pitch shows that in long waves the phase angle converges towards 90deg and decreases with decreasing wave length overall our tdir phase angles agree favorably with cfd phase angles only for the heave phase angle in waves of l λ 0 5 1 1 differences are noticeable compared to glr predictions our tdir phase angles are closer to the cfd phase angles for most waves the glr phase angles differ most in waves of 1 0 l λ 0 5 1 2 3 4 force components for the freely moving containership fig 10 compares force components of our computed time histories for the freely moving containership in regular head waves of λ l 2 5 in contrast to the fixed ship the froude krylov force f k oscillates harmonically about its time average of 3 02 n its first harmonic amplitude 198n was 157 times higher than its second harmonic amplitude 1 26n the first harmonic amplitude of the diffraction force 30 71n and the first harmonic amplitude of the radiation force 40 83n were smaller than the first harmonic amplitude of the froude krylov force however their second harmonic amplitudes were higher being 11 65n for the diffraction force and 16 38n for the radiation force these time histories were influenced by the second harmonic amplitudes of radiation and diffraction forces consequently the time average of the radiation force 7 82n and diffraction force 6 73 n were higher the time average of the radiation force was positive in this long wave of λ l 2 5 the first harmonic amplitude of the waterline force was small 0 646n however the second harmonic 5 82n and the third harmonic 0 921n amplitudes were considerable larger demonstrating that the coupled waterline force wl accounted for higher order effects although the time average of the waterline force 1 47n contributed to total wave added resistance its contribution was the smallest of all other force components our tdir computed total hydrodynamic force total compared favorably to comparable cfd predictions cfd whereas our associated time average tdir force 3 40n differed somewhat from the time average cfd force 2 75n however relative to their first harmonic amplitudes the differences was less than one percent fig 11 compares force components of our computed time histories for the freely moving containership in regular head waves of λ l 1 00 usually wave added resistance is greatest in such wave lengths because of the phase shift between the incident wave and relatively large ship motions see figs 8 and 9 the wave hit the bow of the ship as it is pointing downwards consequently a large and long lasting restoring force negative was generated as seen by the time history of the froude krylov f k the negative part of this froude krylov force lasts relatively long compared to its positive part consequently the time average magnitude of the froude krylov force of 23 13 n is relatively large the time histories of the radiation rad diffraction dif and waterline wl forces revealed that higher order effects declined compared to the previous case of λ l 2 50 the first and second harmonic amplitudes of the radiation force amounted to128 8n and 6 57n respectively and its time average value was 6 15n the first and second harmonic amplitudes of the diffraction force were 89 3n and 6 07n respectively and its time average value was 1 39n the first second and third harmonic amplitudes of the waterline force were 2 73n 22 11n and 1 93n respectively and its time average value was 2 99n consequently the froude krylov force contributed most to the time average drift force however the other force components had to be included compared to the previous case of λ l 2 50 the total hydrodynamic force from our tdir method total agreed slightly less favorably to this force obtained from cfd method a small oscillation at a frequency of 4 ω e characterizes this latter time history our tdir method was not able to account for these high frequency oscillations because the relative motion between the ship s bow and the free surface was excessive for this case of λ l 1 0 although accounted for in our tdir method this case caused too large changes of the wetted surface regarding diffraction and radiation our waterline force accounted for relative motions between ship hull and free surface however our approach did not consider angular changes of the hull normal vectors our approach assumed that relative motions between ship and free surface are small however here the relative motions were large which could have caused our tdir and the cfd predictions to differ by a small amount and their time averages were similar our tdir method yielded a time average force of 33 67n the and cfd method 30 75n in contrast to the previous case of λ l 2 5 where the diffraction and radiation forces contributed most to the time average force here the froude krylov force provided the largest contribution the time average value of the waterline force was twice as large as for the case of λ l 2 5 however its contribution was small compared to the froude krylov force fig 12 compares force components of our computed time histories for the freely moving containership in regular head waves of λ l 0 60 the relatively small ship motions in waves of this length caused second harmonic amplitudes of froude krylov radiation and diffraction forces to be reduced relative to their first harmonic amplitudes the first harmonic amplitude of the froude krylov force amounted to 40 62n its second harmonic amplitude 1 00n its the time average 2 92 n the first and second harmonic amplitudes of the diffraction force were 9 59n and 0 406n respectively its time average 0 371n the first second and third harmonic amplitudes of the waterline force were 0 285n 5 32n and 0 0696 n its time average 2 93n consequently the waterline force contributed about the same amount to the total drift force as the froude krylov force our total hydrodynamic force total agreed favorably to the cfd predictions cfd their amplitudes are almost identical however their time histories differ somewhat which we were unable explain their time averages form our tdir method and the cfd method were 5 48n and of 6 81n respectively sigmund and el moctar 2018 showed that viscous surface shear forces may contribute considerably to wave added resistance in short waves in waves of λ l 0 6 such shear forces for the container ship contributed about six percent however this does not fully explain the differences between tdir and cfd a simplified approach to account for shear force empirically is presented below fig 13 plots comparative values of wave added resistance coefficient caw obtained from our tdir method tdir from the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd these coefficients associated with the normalized wave drift force are plotted against the wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 in long waves coefficients from our tdir method and from the glr method compare favorably to those obtained from the cfd method and from measurements however in short waves coefficients from our tdir method and from the glr method underestimated values based on model test measurements nevertheless our tdir computed coefficients agree more closely to measurement based values than the glr computed coefficients recall that the comparative predictions for the fixed containership were similar 3 5 force components for the fixed kvlcc2 tanker for the fixed tanker in regular 6 0m high head waves of λ l 2 0 1 0 and 0 6 fig 14 plots time histories of longitudinal force the general behavior of each force component did not change significantly compared to those for the dtc containership therefore we present only our computed total force total and the cfd force cfd in waves of λ l 2 0 first harmonic amplitudes of total force from our tdir method 59 73n and from the cfd method 58 54n are similar however their respective time average forces of 1 27n and 2 13 differed in waves of λ l 1 0 agreement is seen to be less favorable even comparative first harmonic amplitudes differ our tdir method yielded 31 02 n the cfd method 39 65 n their respective time average forces turned out to be 1 71n and 2 32n in waves of λ l 0 6 predictions from our tdir method agree more closely to predictions from the cfd method the first harmonic amplitude from our tdir method was 39 11n from the cfd method 39 88n their respective time average forces were 2 06n and 2 07n 3 6 wave added resistance for the fixed kvlcc2 tanker fig 15 plots comparative time histories of the wave added resistance coefficient caw for the fixed tanker kvlcc2 in regular head waves of differing lengths corresponding to λ l ratios ranging between 0 2 and 2 0 compared to cfd predictions cfd our tdir method tdir the cfd method cfd and the frequency domain method glr underestimated wave added resistance in long waves however all predictions converge with decreasing wave length in short waves coefficients from our tdir method and from the cfd method agree well whereas coefficients from the glr method still underestimates wave added resistance 3 7 motions for the freely floating kvlcc2 tanker we performed simulations of the tanker free to move in heave and pitch in regular 3 0m amplitude head waves of 0 4 λ l 2 0 against wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 fig 16 and fig 17 plot transfer functions of normalized heave and pitch motions respectively obtained from our nonlinear tdir method tdir form the cfd method cfd from a linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd fig 16 shows that in waves of 0 9 l λ 0 5 1 1 our tdir method tdir underestimates heave in these wave lengths deck immersion most likely affected heave in long waves heave predicted by the cfd method cfd and the linear method glr correlate favorably to measurements fig 17 shows that pitch predictions from our tdir method tdir agree favorably to measurements efd especially in long waves whereas predictions from glr method glr and cfd method cfd overestimate pitch compared to measurements efd fig 18 and fig 19 plot phase angles between the incident wave and respectively the tanker s heave motions and pitch motions these phase angles behaved similarly to those for the containership fig 18 shows that except in waves of l λ 0 5 0 9 heave from our tdir method tdir generally agree favorably to heave from the cfd method cfd and to measured heave efd in waves of l λ 0 5 0 9 heave from the linear glr method glr overestimated measured heave fig 19 shows that pitch behaved similarly to heave in that pitch from our tdir method tdir generally agrees favorably to pitch from the cfd method cfd and to measured pitch efd as a conclusion our weakly nonlinear tdir method improved the prediction of motion phase angles compared to the linear frequency domain glr method for ship motions froude krylov forces often dominated to obtain the froude krylov forces recall that our tdir method integrated over the exact wetted surface which contributed significantly to more accurate predictions fig 20 plots time histories of longitudinal total force in waves of λ l 2 0 1 0 and 0 6 similar to the containership simulations in long waves of λ l 2 0 our tdir predictions tdir agree favorably to cfd predictions cfd their respective first harmonic amplitudes of 53 93n and 56 41n were close similar could be shown for their time average forces of 0 40n and 0 37n however these average forces were small compared to the total force amplitudes in waves of λ l 1 0 first harmonic amplitudes from our tdir method and the cfd method agree well however in waves of this length the bow of the tanker emerged and immersed largely recall that our tdir method was then unable to compute the flow around the bow thereby causing a small time shift of the negative part and also a deviation from the harmonic behavior at times t 0 5 and 1 5s nevertheless overall the agreement was accurate enough to compute first harmonic amplitudes the time average force of 6 4n from our tdir method was slightly overestimated compared to the average force of 5 18n from the cfd method in waves of λ l 0 6 first harmonic amplitudes from our tdir and cfd are seen to be similar although the small time shift of the negative part was still present their respective time average forces of 2 09n and 2 11n were close together fig 21 plots comparative values of wave added resistance coefficient caw obtained from our tdir method tdir from the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd these coefficients associated with the normalized wave drift force are plotted against the wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 over almost the entire range of wave lengths coefficients from our tdir method compare favorably to those obtained from measurements coefficients from the glr method compared favorably to measurement based coefficients only in long waves and in short waves in waves of 1 2 λ l 0 6 the glr method underestimated the wave added resistance 3 8 effect of wave steepness on wave added resistance the effect of different wave heights on the wave added resistance was investigated experimentally by yasukawa et al 2016 they measured the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance for three ship models with the same main dimensions and different block coefficients 0 81 0 84 and 0 87 the experiments were performed for two different wave amplitudes further on two loading conditions full loading and ballast conditions were investigated for the full loading conditions the authors shown that the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance was clearly effected by the wave amplitude for ballast conditions effects of wave amplitude on the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance could only be seen for few single wave frequencies sigmund and el moctar 2018 investigated the effect of the wave steepness on the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance for the containership dtc and the tanker kvlcc2 using cfd they showed that the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance of the tanker was sensitive to the wave steepness in long and mid size waves the non dimensional wave added resistance increased with decreasing wave steepness similar behavior was shown by yasukawa et al 2016 as aforementioned yasukawa et al 2016 showed that in short waves the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance of the vlcc tanker with a block coefficient of 0 81 seemed to be only slightly effected by the wave steepness and a decreasing wave steepness resulted in an increasing non dimensional wave added resistance however sigmund and el moctar 2018 showed a different behavior in short waves the non dimensional wave added resistance was strongly affected by the wave steepness in short waves and decreased with decreasing wave steepness however in contrast to yasukawa et al 2016 sigmund and el moctar 2018 investigated very short waves with a high steepness this might be a reason for the contrary findings in the present study we investigated the effect of wave steepness on the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance for the container ship and tanker using the weakly nonlinear time domain method the wave added resistance of the container ship was computed for the wave conditions listed in table 2 since we used a potential flow solver we tried to avoid water on deck thus the wave steepness had to be limited and only waves with a small to moderate steepness were investigated as a result the added resistance of the containership depended almost quadratically on the wave amplitude for the investigated waves slightly more effects were found for the kvlcc2 tanker fig 22 plots the corresponding quadratic transfer functions of the wave added resistance for three different wave steepness the effects of wave steepness were found to be moderate similar effects were shown by yasukawa et al 2016 the weakly nonlinear time domain solver is able to account for geometrical nonlinearities these nonlinearities may affect the non dimensional wave added resistance slightly when the wave steepness varies see e g fig 22 however the major effect of the wave steepness on the added resistance seemed to result from the nonlinear behavior of steep waves this effect is not considered in the bem method tdir consequently the effect of wave steepness may be clearly underestimated by the bem method as shown by yasukawa et al 2016 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 3 9 estimation of the viscous wave added resistance generally it is assumed that wave drift forces are caused by pressure variations at the ship s hull however sigmund and el moctar 2018 showed that also viscous effects play a significant role in short waves of λ l 0 5 and that it vanishes in longer waves when the ship is free to heave and pitch further work regarding the wave added resistance of the kvlcc2 tanker in short waves can be found in yang et al 2018 and seo et al 2014 so far our time domain method based on potential theory neglected viscous effects however to remedy this defect we introduced a simplified exponential function to account for viscous effects on the wave added resistance in head waves thus the total wave added resistance coefficient c a w t o t ω was calculated as the sum of the wave induced pressure added resistance coefficient c a w ω and the viscous wave added resistance coefficient c v i s c ω relating the viscous wave added resistance to the pressure based wave added resistance 21 f v i s c ω c v i s c ω c a w ω the total wave added resistance coefficient follows from 22 c a w t o t ω c a w ω 1 f v i s c ω with f v i s c ω being the relative viscous wave added resistance we assumed that the relationship between the pressure wave induced part and viscous wave added resistance does not dependent on ship speed we expressed f v i s c ω by an exponential function with the following parameters wave length to ship length ratio λ l and ship s block coefficient cb 23 f v i s c c 1 c b c 2 e c 3 λ l where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are assumed to be ship independent constants c 1 c 2 and c 3 were determined by applying the least square fit technique to the results presented by sigmund and el moctar 2018 24 f v i s c 0 4 c b 1 67 e 5 8 λ l for the containership dtc and the tanker kvlcc2 fig 23 compares the relative viscous wave added resistance f v i s c obtained from our empirical function 24 with results from the cfd method index emp designates values from 24 index cfd values from the cfd method it is seen that the viscous contribution to total added resistance was higher for the container ship than for the tanker fig 24 and fig 25 plot comparative values of wave added resistance coefficient caw obtained from our tdir method including viscous effects tdir fric from the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd for the containership it is seen that the additional viscous force component yields a better agreement between tdir and cfd predictions as well as measurement based efd predictions for the tanker differences were smaller furthermore in short waves our tdir method slightly overestimated wave added resistance compared to cfd predictions even without considering the viscous force contribution nevertheless including the viscous component improved our predictions compared to measurement based efd predictions wave length strongly influenced the viscous wave added resistance component especially in shorter waves furthermore ship motions were mitigated in shorter waves from that perspective it seemed reasonable to relate viscous wave added resistance to relative ship motions heave and pitch instead of wave length if wave added resistance were to be calculated for the fixed ship a significant viscous components should result also in long waves and perhaps explain why our tdir predictions of wave added resistance for the freely moving ship in long waves agreed so favorably to the cfd predictions but differenced for the fixed ship to clarify whether viscous wave added resistance is relevant also in long waves when the ship is fixed additional cfd computations would be necessary 4 conclusions we presented a partially nonlinear time domain numerical method to predict the wave added resistance of ships advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves following the approach of cummins our method relied on frequency domain coefficients to calculate radiation forces in the time domain on integration of pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface of the ships to yield nonlinear froude krylov and restoring forces and on an additional force component to account for the effect of the changing wetted surface caused by radiation and diffraction of the undisturbed incident waves for a modern container ship and very large tanker we computed time histories of wave induced longitudinal forces and quadratic transfer functions of wave added resistance coefficients and compared our predictions to results from a ranse based cfd method from a linear frequency domain technique and model test based measurements we considered the fixed ships and the ships free to move in heave and pitch generally our computed time histories agreed favorably to those from the cfd method only for the fixed tanker in wave lengths close to the ship s length did first harmonic amplitudes of longitudinal forces differ by a relatively small amount for the freely moving ships time average wave added resistances were closer to those from the cfd method and from model test based measurements for the fixed ships our method underestimated wave added resistance also in long waves in shorter waves the differences between our method and the cfd results decreased especially for the tanker agreement in short waves was favorable compared to the frequency domain approach our method yielded more accurate predictions in waves of almost every wave length especially for the fixed containership in short waves the frequency domain method strongly underestimated wave added resistance for the freely moving ships our results agreed favorably to those based on model test measurements over the whole range of wave lengths especially for the containership in short waves and the tanker in mid to long waves our method obtained more accurate predictions compared to the frequency domain method to consider the viscous component of wave added resistance we introduced an empirical formula for the containership in short waves its inclusion led to a reduction of the differences between prediction from our method and those from the cfd method and from model test based wave added resistance for the tanker the viscous wave added resistance played a minor role and the use of the empirical function did not change the results significantly however for the tanker in short waves our tdir results and cfd results were almost identical acknowledgments the research was supported by the german research

23289,linear boundary element methods generally provide accurately enough predictions of ship motions in small amplitude waves however when the wave induced added resistance is investigated nonlinear effects are to be accounted for higher order effects such as second order wave induced drift forces depend largely on ships forward speed this article presents a nonlinear time domain rankine source method to calculate the wave induced added resistance of ships advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves the fully nonlinear steady flow was computed nonlinear froude krylov and hydrostatic forces were obtained by integrating pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface undisturbed incident wave radiation forces were computed in time domain using convolution integrals cummins approach diffraction forces were computed using the complex force amplitude resulting from the linear seakeeping problem of incident wave diffraction radiation and diffraction effects caused by the changing wetted surface were accounted for an empirical approach to account for the viscous wave added resistance was introduced numerical results for a 14 000teu container ship and a very large tanker were compared to results from a frequency domain method cfd calculations and experimental towing tank measurements keywords added resistance in waves viscous added resistance in waves nonlinear boundary element method comparative study 1 introduction optimizing and dimensioning a ship s hull and its propulsion system are relevant design issues in this regard speed loss in waves has become important as it effects fuel consumption which contributes to operational costs speed loss must be considered not only to meet a ship s time schedule but it has become also a safety issue because maneuverability has to be maintained under adverse weather conditions see e g papanikolaou et al 2015 kwon 2008 prpić oršić and faltinsen 2012 sigmund and el moctar 2018 kim et al 2016 indeed the international maritime organization 2013 2015 requires that ships be equipped with a minimum engine output furthermore ship pollution and carbon emissions have come into focus to reduce the carbon emissions of ships the imo 2011 published regulations and introduced the energy efficiency design index eedi relating carbon emissions and transported amount of cargo to ship speed to meet these requirements in future ships need to become more efficient one way to improve efficiency regarding eedi is to reduce ship speed however reducing a ship s design speed leads to a decrease of the required maximum engine output and this raises the question whether the ship is able to maintain minimum forward speed under adverse weather condition to ensure safe maneuverability an alternative to improving ship efficiency is to design its hull and propulsion system for the representative sea conditions generally ships are designed for a service speed in calm water actually the ship seldomly operates under these ideal fair weather conditions in practice an experience based allowance called sea margin accounts for the additional resistance in actual weather conditions and ensures that the ship is maneuverable also in severe seas however this approach does not always meet the requirements of a modern ship design and may lead to an unnecessary power reserve or to an underpowered ship that cannot maneuver safely under adverse sea conditions rathje et al 2011 therefore the maneuverability of ships in waves is of growing interest see e g skejic and faltinsen 2008 zhang et al 2017 furthermore ship lines seem to be optimized for sea conditions the ship may rarely experience rather than for the actual sea conditions service operational conditions should be considered already during the design processes to more accurately optimize the ship s resistance in waves see e g park et al 2014 kim et al 2014 2015 modern ship design calls for tools to assess added resistance in waves conventional methods comprise model tests empirical formulas and numerical techniques these methods differ significantly in accuracy and cost model tests are still one of the most reliable methods exemplified by recent tests conducted within the framework of the european research projects shopera papanikolaou et al 2015 for a cruise ship valanto and hong 2015 and a containership sprenger et al 2017 however model tests are expensive and therefore the number of test runs has to be limited empirical formulas need constant updating and although useful at the preliminary design stage are of limited use for the design of new ship types numerical methods are generally based on potential theory or field methods that solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations the latter method has been proven useful for ship hydrodynamics problems associated with strong nonlinear effects such as the changing wetted surface breaking waves and viscous effects el moctar et al 2017 sigmund and el moctar 2018 for example used a field method to demonstrate that forward speed strongly affects wave added resistance and that viscous effects influence wave added resistance in short waves others notably sportelli and huijsmans 2012 lyu and el moctar 2017 kim et al 2017 ley et al 2014 gue et al 2012 and sadat hosseini et al 2010 2013 also used this method to study wave added resistance in all cases however the computational effort was high and only an experienced user was able to obtain reliable results the obvious advantage of potential theory based methods is their computational efficiency and their use predominated before the development of modern computers maruo 1960 1963 was one of the first to assess wave added resistance using the far field method to calculate radiated and diffracted wave energy and momentum flux at infinity gerritsma and beukelman 1972 and journee 2001 modified this approach within a linear strip theory method and demonstrated the importance of bow wave diffraction for the prediction of wave added resistance in short waves following maruo s approach kashiwagi 1995 2009 2011 also accounted for the effect of bow wave diffraction salvesen 1978 using gerritsma s and beukelman s approach within a strip theory method showed the importance of an accurate prediction of ship motions when calculating wave added resistance most of these potential theory based solvers however turned out to be unreliable to asses wave added resistance in short waves boese 1970 tried to resolve this shortcoming by integrating hydrodynamic pressures later faltinsen et al 1980 developed a more accurate pressure integration method for short waves söding et al 2014 introduced a frequency domain potential flow solver based on rankine sources which couples the effect of the nonlinear stationary forward speed problem with the linear seakeeping problem his method directly integrates the pressure at the hull accounts for the changing wetted surface boese s approach and time averages the second order pressure field lui et al 2017 compared his results obtained with this method to rans based predictions and model test measurements and found generally favorable agreement however wave added resistance in short waves was underestimated strongly for several cases later developments were characterized by time domain potential flow solvers using such an approach kim et al 2010 for example calculated the added resistance from diffraction and radiation components and liu et al 2011 employed a three dimensional frequency domain panel method and a hybrid time domain rankine source solver based on green functions and a far field approach to calculate wave added resistance at small froude numbers predictions from these methods compared well to experiments however at large froude numbers errors increased a distinct advantage of time domain solvers is that nonlinear froude krylov forces are calculated more accurately because the instantaneous wetted surface is accounted for without excessive numerical effort these forces often contribute strongly to wave added resistance the quintessence of this review is that three aspects should be considered to accurately predict wave added resistance namely forward speed effects the changing wetted surface geometrical nonlinearity and viscous effects our method presented here started from the ship motions solver of riesner et al 2016 following cummins approach cummins 1962 we modelled radiation forces via convolution integrals and froude krylov as well as restoring forces via integration over the instantaneous wetted surface we used a frequency domain technique of söding s et al 2012 to obtain frequency dependent response coefficients and to determine forward speed effects caused by the steady wave system as well as the associated dynamic trim and sinkage we also accounted for geometrical nonlinearities caused by radiation and diffraction using the approach of boese 1970 to account for viscous effects we introduced an empirical procedure based on results obtained by sigmund and el moctar et al 2018 which proved effective especially in short waves for a 14 000teu containership and a very large tanker advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves we compared our wave added resistance predictions to those obtained from a rans solver a frequency domain method and model test measurements compared to frequency domain predictions our method resulted in more accurate predictions especially in short and medium length waves 2 numerical method following standard practice two right handed coordinate systems describe ship motions namely an inertial system x x y z t moving with the ship s forward speed and a ship bound coordinate system x x y z t used to simplify the description of external forces acting on the ship coordinate x points positive to the bow y positive to port and z positive upward the origin of these coordinate systems is located at the centre of gravity the following equation solves ship motions 1 m a x t b x t 0 t k t τ x τ d τ f d i f t f f k r t f w l t the left hand side of 1 includes radiation forces based on the approach of cummins 1962 and ogilvie 1964 thus radiation forces in time domain result from fourier transforms of hydrodynamic response forces from a frequency domain solution namely the hydrodynamic added mass at infinite frequency a the hydrodynamic damping at infinite frequency b and the convolution integral that calculates the elapsed history of the radiation forces based on the impulse response function k t and the body velocities x times t and τ represent respectively current time and time of the past history inertial ship reactions to the ship s mass are calculated using ship mass matrix m multiplied by ship acceleration vector x the right hand site of 1 includes diffraction forces f dif based on the complex diffraction force amplitude resulting from the linear problem of the incident wave diffraction as well as the combined nonlinear froude krylov and restoring forces f fk r taking into account the changing wetted surface caused by incident radiated and diffracted waves and the dynamic trim and sinkage caused by the ship s constant forward speed a frequency domain method that couples the stationary nonlinear forward speed problem with the linear seakeeping problem obtains radiation and diffraction forces in 1 by integrating first order pressures over the mean wetted surface to accurately calculate wave added resistance an additional force component f wl accounts for the changing wetted surface caused by these radiation and diffraction forces 2 1 frequency dependent response coefficients the rankine source frequency domain method of söding et al 2012 and von graefe 2014 calculates frequency dependent hydrodynamic response coefficients and diffraction forces this method accounts for the interaction between the nonlinear stationary flow in calm water including steady ship waves and dynamic trim and sinkage and its interaction with the periodic flow in waves following hachmann s approach for seakeeping hachmann 1991 the total potential ϕ t ω e in waves is written as a superposition of the steady potential ϕ 0 and the periodic potential ϕ ˆ 1 as follows 2 ϕ t x t u x ϕ t x t u x ϕ 0 x r e ϕ ˆ 1 e i ω e t the dynamic boundary condition is expressed as 3 ϕ 0 u ϕ ˆ 1 α ˆ ϕ 0 2 ϕ 0 v ˆ i ω e ϕ ˆ 1 v ˆ ϕ 0 g ς ˆ 1 v ˆ ς 0 0 where α ˆ is the amplitude of the ship rotation vector v ˆ is the amplitude of the total motion of a point on the ship and i is the imaginary unit number the kinematic boundary condition reads as follows 4 i ω e ς ˆ 1 v ˆ ς 0 ς 0 ϕ ˆ 1 ϕ 0 u ς ˆ 1 z ϕ ˆ 1 α ˆ ϕ 0 y ϕ 0 x u ς 0 y t a ˆ 0 where a ˆ includes all second order derivatives and is written as 5 a ˆ v ˆ n o n o 2 n o 2 ϕ 0 n o 2 ς 0 ϕ 0 u with n being the unit vector normal to the stationary free surface 6 n o ς 0 x ς 0 y 1 t the corresponding body boundary condition is as follows 7 n x ϕ ˆ 1 α ˆ u i ω e v ˆ 0 finally the frequency dependent part of the first order pressure is calculated from 8 p ˆ 1 ρ u ϕ 0 ϕ ˆ 1 i ω i ϕ ˆ 1 v ˆ ϕ 0 to determine hydrodynamic added mass and damping at infinite encounter frequency a simplified boundary value problem is solved the free surface condition prevails instead of the high frequency condition 9 ϕ ˆ 1 0 this condition is satisfied analytically by placing image sources of opposite sign source strengths symmetrically on the undisturbed free surface in addition more accurate results are obtained by locating mirrored sources on the nonlinear stationary free surface when considering the steady wave system söding 2009 although not satisfied exactly the associated boundary condition 9 is fulfilled to a sufficient level of accuracy 2 2 radiation diffraction and froude krylov forces regarding the radiation forces the impulse response functions k t are calculated using hydrodynamic added mass and damping coefficients computed with a rankine source frequency domain method riesner et al 2016 here only the impulse response functions from damping are needed and calculated as follows 10 k t 2 π 0 ω m a x b ω e b cos ω e t d ω 2 π ω m a x 2 b ω m a x b t s i ω m a x t π t 2 cos ω m a x t ω m a x where ω e is the wave encounter frequency ω m a x is the angular frequency corresponding to the maximum value obtained from frequency domain computations and s i x s i n x x d x the diffraction force is derived from the complex diffraction force amplitude f ˆ d i f which is obtained from the frequency domain rankine source method calculation 11 f d i f t re f ˆ d i f e i w e t integrating the hydrostatic pressure p f k r up to the instantaneous wetted surface of an undisturbed wave known as the smith effect while also accounting for wave elevation ship motions and the stationary wave system caused by the steady forward speed in calm water yields the combined froude krylov and restoring force f f k r 12 f f k r t s t p f k r x t n x t d s the linearized bernoulli equation is solved to calculate the hydrostatic pressure p f k r using wheeler stretching wheeler 1979 to more accurately calculate the pressure near the free surface assuming infinitely deep water the hydrostatic pressure p f k r then is expressed as follows 13 p f k r x k ω e t ρ g z ζ 0 x ζ 1 x t e k z ζ 1 x t where ζ 1 x t is the free surface elevation caused by the undisturbed incident wave and ζ 0 x is the stationary free surface elevation caused by the ship s forward speed to accurately integrate pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface panels intersecting the free surface are modified according to the approach of riesner et al 2016 2 3 radiation and diffraction forces caused by changing wetted surface a linear frequency domain boundary element method yields radiation and diffraction pressures which are then integrated over the mean wetted surface neglecting variations of hull submergence caused by the incident wave and the ship motions relative motions between wave contour and hull and the associated pressure distribution on the hull surface are approximated from first order pressure at the mean waterline boese 1970 implemented a similar approach into a linear frequency domain boundary element method to successfully calculate time average drift forces however our technique calculates the drift force in time domain at a typical ship section shown in fig 1 the relative motion is the distance d t above the mean water surface w l and the instantaneous wave elevation w l t the pressure at the hull is p x t the pressure at the mean water line p w l t a linear frequency domain calculation neglects pressures within the red colored triangle assuming a linear pressure distribution between the mean water surface w l and the instantaneous wave elevation w l t the corresponding force summed over all waterline panels f wl t is calculated as follows 14 f w l t w l p a n e l s p w l 2 t s n s 2 ρ g n s 3 a waterline panel wl panel is a triangular body panel having two of its three corners at the mean waterline s is the vector between these two corners and index 3 designates the third component vertical of the resulting vector in a linear frequency domain method p w l t is the sum of the pressure contributions from radiation including restoring diffraction and froude krylov forces however our weakly nonlinear time domain method already integrates froude krylov and restoring force pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface therefore we must only include coupling effects between these pressures contributions and this leads to the following expression 15 p w l 2 t p r a d 2 t p d i f 2 t 2 p r a d t p d i f t 2 p r a d t p f k r t 2 p d i f t p f k r t the first two terms on the right hand side of 15 result directly from radiation and diffraction and had linear froude krylov forces been used instead of the nonlinear froude krylov forces integrated over the instantaneous wetted surface 15 would also include a term p f r 2 t the last three terms on the right hand side of 15 account for coupling effects between pressures caused by radiation diffraction and froude krylov effects pressure p d i f t is calculated from the frequency domain results using 11 applied over every waterline panel pressure p f k r t is the froude krylov and radiation pressure pressure p r a d t is calculated using convolution integrals in a manner similar to the calculation of total radiation forces acting on the ship see 1 accounting for contributions from all six rigid body motions p r a d t is calculated as follows 16 p r a d t a x t b x t t k t τ x t d τ the radiation force in 1 acts over the entire ship whereas 16 stands for the radiation pressure acting at a single water line panel therefore a x and b x are here pressure induced force components of added mass and damping and k t accounts for the time history of the pressure caused by only an impulse on the ship here a b and k t are vectors and multiplied by the velocity and acceleration vector using the scalar product a and b yield from 17 a i w e 2 r e p ˆ i 1 b i w e 1 i m p ˆ i 1 where index i stands for the rigid body motion components the impulse response function k t is calculated similarly to 10 the memory storage necessary to calculate pressures acting on a waterline panel is six times less than the memory storage to calculate the radiation forces and moments acting on the hull using 1 nevertheless the coefficients in 16 need to be stored for every waterline panel whereas 1 already includes the radiation response of the complete ship our sample calculations required about 200 waterline panels the computational time using one core of a standard personal computer for simulations of the freely moving ship was approximately 200s for a time step of 0 05s the computational time for 20 time steps was about one second 3 results we compared results from our time domain rankine source boundary element method tdir to experimental measurements efd and to numerical results from a reynolds averaged navier stokes equations ranse solver cfd and a linear frequency domain method glr we focused on wave added resistance in regular head waves of a 14 000teu container ship here referred to as the duisburg test case dtc el moctar et al 2012 and a very large tanker here referred to as the kvlcc2 tanker table 1 lists their main particulars and forward speeds benchmark model test measurements for the dtc containership were carried out at marintek within the framework of the eu funded project shopera papanikolaou et al 2015 sprenger et al 2017 the model test results for kvlcc2 were taken from sadat hosseini et al 2013 cfd results were taken from sigmund and el moctar 2018 their cfd simulations were performed using the ranse solver openfoam and comet all comparisons were made for model scale first we compared time histories of longitudinal hydrodynamic forces obtained from our tdir method and the cfd method although the velocity potential of our tdir method accounted for wave elevation and the dynamic trim and sinkage obtained from a previous solution of the stationary flow problem the total hydrodynamic force in time domain did not include calm water resistance therefore to compare time histories from our tdir to time histories from the cfd method calm water resistance had to be subtracted from the total hydrodynamic force obtained from the cfd method in general hydrodynamic force components acting on a ship in regular head waves depend on the relation between wave length λ and ship length l therefore we compared time histories obtained in a long wave in a wave of length close to the ship s length and in a short wave for greater clarity the froude krylov radiation diffraction and waterline forces were plotted separately then the time average drift force wave added resistance obtained from tdir cfd efd and glr methods were compared the associated normalized wave drift force here known as the wave added resistance coefficient c aw ω was expressed as follows 18 c a w ω r a w ω l p p ρ g b 2 ζ 2 where r a w is the wave added resistance g the gravity constant ρ is the fluid density and ζ is the wave amplitude the time averaged values were calculated based on a fourier analysis the transition phase first periods of the simulation was not considered in the analysis our method considered the changing undisturbed wetted surface caused by incident waves and the ship motions to separate effects from radiation and diffraction we compared time histories of forces on the fixed ships first and afterwards forces on the ships moving freely in heave and pitch for a fixed ship radiation forces are zero for the ship being free in heave and pitch first harmonic motion amplitudes were compared the dimensionless amplitude of heave z is 19 z z ζ where z is the corresponding heave first harmonic amplitude the dimensionless amplitude of pitch θ is 20 θ θ k ζ where k is the wave number 3 1 force components for the fixed dtc containership for the fixed containership dtc in regular head waves of length corresponding to λ l 2 5 and an amplitude of ζ 6 365m full scale the upper graph in fig 2 plots time histories of the nonlinear froude krylov force f k the center graph time histories of the diffraction force dif and its nonlinear contribution wl the lower graph compares the total hydrodynamic force obtained from our tdir method total and the force from the cfd method cfd the amplitude of the nonlinear f k force is about six times higher than the amplitude of the diffraction force dif and the phase shift is about 180deg furthermore the diffraction force is harmonic only linear diffraction pressure acted on the non moving ship hull but the nonlinear f k force is non harmonic indicated by the longer time span between a positive peak and a negative peak than the corresponding time span between a negative and a positive peak the force component caused by the diffraction pressure acting on the non average wetted surface plus its coupling effects with the froude krylov pressure wl is three times smaller than the diffraction force and its main period equals half of the wave encounter period second order effect however its time average value of 8 99n is negative and its magnitude is almost twice as large as the magnitude of the time average f k force of 4 77n consequently although the waterline force did not strongly influence the amplitude of the total hydrodynamic force it needed to be considered for the calculation of drift forces the sum of all forces is the total hydrodynamic force total plotted in the lower graph in fig 2 the phase shift between the nonlinear froude krylov force f k and the diffraction force dif caused its amplitude to be slightly smaller than the amplitude of the f k force which agrees favorably to the force obtained from the cfd method the amplitude of their first harmonics is nearly equal from our tdir method this amplitude is 211 3n from the cfd method 219 34n however their time average forces differ from our tdir method this time average force is 13 76n from the cfd method 19 70n for the fixed containership dtc in regular head waves of length corresponding to λ l 1 09 and an amplitude of ζ 5 60m full scale the upper graph in fig 3 plots time histories of the nonlinear froude krylov force f k the center graph time histories of the diffraction force dif and its nonlinear contribution wl similar to the time histories plots in waves of λ l 2 50 the froude krylov force f k is again non harmonic however in this case the time span between a positive and a negative peak is shorter than the time span between a negative and a positive peak the difference between the first order harmonic amplitude of the froude krylov force f k and the diffraction force dif is smaller than for the case of λ l 2 50 the amplitude of the f k force is about twice as large the time average of the f k force is 3 33n the first order harmonic amplitude of the nonlinear water line force is still small compared to the f k and dif amplitudes however its time average of 8 96n is the largest contribution to the total drift force the time history of total hydrodynamic force from our tdir method total compared favorably to the time history from the cfd method cfd the first order harmonic amplitude from our tdir method is 166 23n from the cfd method 177 41n furthermore the time average for this case i e for waves of λ l 1 09 agrees more favorably to the case of λ l 2 50 our tdir computed a time average of 12 30n is close to the cfd computed time average of 14 78n for the fixed containership dtc in regular head waves of length corresponding to λ l 0 60 and an amplitude of ζ 3 775m full scale the overall behavior of hydrodynamic force components did not change much compared to the behavior of in waves of λ l ratios discussed above see fig 4 compared to the previous case of λ l 1 09 the difference between amplitudes of the first order harmonic of the froude krylov force f k and the diffraction force dif increased again i e f k amplitudes were about four times higher than dif amplitudes the time average of the froude krylov force was 1 20n the time average of the water line force 4 41n for this case of λ l 0 60 the total hydrodynamic force from our tdir method total compares slightly less favorably to this force from the cfd method cfd than for the cases of λ l 2 50 and λ l 1 09 as seen in fig 4 the first harmonic amplitudes of 41 02n from our tdir method total and of 38 17n from the cfd method cfd are still similar and their respective time averages values of 5 69n from our tdir method and 6 40n from the cfd method cfd correlate more closely than for the case of λ l 2 50 3 2 wave added resistance for the fixed dtc containership overall our computed time histories tdir agreed favorably to those obtained from the cfd method cfd however sometimes the time average forces from these two methods differed significantly to gain additional insight fig 5 plots comparative wave added resistance coefficient caw i e the normalized quadratic transfer function of wave drift forces for the fixed dtc containership in regular head waves of differing lengths corresponding to λ l ratios ranging between 0 22 and 2 50 generally seakeeping methods based on potential theory underestimate wave added resistance in short waves see e g lyu and el moctar et al 2017 to more easily focus on short waves we plotted the wave added resistance coefficient against not only the wave length ratio λ l but also the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 together with wave added resistance coefficients from our tdir method tdir and the cfd method cfd fig 5 plots also comparable coefficients from the linear frequency domain potential method glr as for the case of λ l 2 50 coefficients from our tdir method tdir and the cfd method cfd differ in long waves but this difference decreases with decreasing wave length until it increases again in short waves in long waves coefficients from the potential method glr behave similarly however with decreasing wave length the coefficient from the linear potential method glr decreases markedly whereas the coefficients from our tdir method tdir and the cfd method cfd remain approximately constant over the whole range of wave lengths indicating that our tdir method tdir constituted a significant improvement for the calculation of the wave added resistance coefficient in waves of almost every wave length except in very long waves 3 3 motions for the freely floating dtc containership generally our tdir method reliably predicted ship motions for a freely moving ship however the cfd simulations were conducted for the dtc containership fixed in surge only and free to move in heave and pitch in contrast to the totally fixed ship hydrodynamic forces then included radiation components caused by the ship s heave and pitch motions for the cases we considered table 2 lists the associated wave length via ratio λ l wave amplitude ζ and wave steepness via ratio h λ where h is wave height 2 ζ the wave conditions were selected based on the physical model tests sprenger et al 2017 depending on the relation of wave length and ship length the wave added resistance was in some cases strongly affected by radiation forces to calculate the wave added resistance more precisely an accurate computation of ship motions is important salvesen 1978 therefore we first calculated and compared ship motions with experimental results riesner et al 2016 against wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 fig 6 and fig 7 plot transfer functions of normalized heave see equation 19 and pitch motions see equation 20 respectively obtained from our nonlinear tdir method tdir form the cfd method cfd from linear frequency domain method glr and from riesner et al 2016 efd in general the agreement was favorable our tdir method underestimated heave motions slightly in waves of 1 1 l λ 0 5 1 4 the glr method overestimated heave motions in waves of l λ 0 5 1 0 pitch motions obtained from all three methods agree favorably compared to the results of riesner et al 2016 heave and pitch transfer function from our tdir method did not change significantly by including nonlinear radiation and diffraction force components ship motions were only slightly affected because we assumed that amplitudes of waterline force are small compared to amplitudes of nonlinear froude krylov forces and linear radiation and diffraction forces however we also assumed that the contribution of the waterline force dominates the wave added resistance also for the freely moving ship the comparative time histories of all force components confirmed our assumptions according to journee 2001 and kashiwagi 1995 2009 and 2011 wave bow interactions are important for an accurate calculation of wave added resistance relative motions of a ship s bow and the free surface result from coupled heave and pitch motions and incident waves to investigate this relationship fig 8 and fig 9 plot phase angles between incident waves and heave and pitch motions respectively again against wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 obtained from our nonlinear tdir method tdir form the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr the incident wave elevation was calculated with respect to the ship s center of gravity a positive heave motion was defined as a vertical upward motion and a positive pitch motion was defined to be bow down a negative phase angle means that the motion follows the wave fig 8 shows that in long waves heave is in phase with the incident wave φ 0 and that the phase angle increases with decreasing wave length in fig 9 the phase angle between incident wave and the pitch shows that in long waves the phase angle converges towards 90deg and decreases with decreasing wave length overall our tdir phase angles agree favorably with cfd phase angles only for the heave phase angle in waves of l λ 0 5 1 1 differences are noticeable compared to glr predictions our tdir phase angles are closer to the cfd phase angles for most waves the glr phase angles differ most in waves of 1 0 l λ 0 5 1 2 3 4 force components for the freely moving containership fig 10 compares force components of our computed time histories for the freely moving containership in regular head waves of λ l 2 5 in contrast to the fixed ship the froude krylov force f k oscillates harmonically about its time average of 3 02 n its first harmonic amplitude 198n was 157 times higher than its second harmonic amplitude 1 26n the first harmonic amplitude of the diffraction force 30 71n and the first harmonic amplitude of the radiation force 40 83n were smaller than the first harmonic amplitude of the froude krylov force however their second harmonic amplitudes were higher being 11 65n for the diffraction force and 16 38n for the radiation force these time histories were influenced by the second harmonic amplitudes of radiation and diffraction forces consequently the time average of the radiation force 7 82n and diffraction force 6 73 n were higher the time average of the radiation force was positive in this long wave of λ l 2 5 the first harmonic amplitude of the waterline force was small 0 646n however the second harmonic 5 82n and the third harmonic 0 921n amplitudes were considerable larger demonstrating that the coupled waterline force wl accounted for higher order effects although the time average of the waterline force 1 47n contributed to total wave added resistance its contribution was the smallest of all other force components our tdir computed total hydrodynamic force total compared favorably to comparable cfd predictions cfd whereas our associated time average tdir force 3 40n differed somewhat from the time average cfd force 2 75n however relative to their first harmonic amplitudes the differences was less than one percent fig 11 compares force components of our computed time histories for the freely moving containership in regular head waves of λ l 1 00 usually wave added resistance is greatest in such wave lengths because of the phase shift between the incident wave and relatively large ship motions see figs 8 and 9 the wave hit the bow of the ship as it is pointing downwards consequently a large and long lasting restoring force negative was generated as seen by the time history of the froude krylov f k the negative part of this froude krylov force lasts relatively long compared to its positive part consequently the time average magnitude of the froude krylov force of 23 13 n is relatively large the time histories of the radiation rad diffraction dif and waterline wl forces revealed that higher order effects declined compared to the previous case of λ l 2 50 the first and second harmonic amplitudes of the radiation force amounted to128 8n and 6 57n respectively and its time average value was 6 15n the first and second harmonic amplitudes of the diffraction force were 89 3n and 6 07n respectively and its time average value was 1 39n the first second and third harmonic amplitudes of the waterline force were 2 73n 22 11n and 1 93n respectively and its time average value was 2 99n consequently the froude krylov force contributed most to the time average drift force however the other force components had to be included compared to the previous case of λ l 2 50 the total hydrodynamic force from our tdir method total agreed slightly less favorably to this force obtained from cfd method a small oscillation at a frequency of 4 ω e characterizes this latter time history our tdir method was not able to account for these high frequency oscillations because the relative motion between the ship s bow and the free surface was excessive for this case of λ l 1 0 although accounted for in our tdir method this case caused too large changes of the wetted surface regarding diffraction and radiation our waterline force accounted for relative motions between ship hull and free surface however our approach did not consider angular changes of the hull normal vectors our approach assumed that relative motions between ship and free surface are small however here the relative motions were large which could have caused our tdir and the cfd predictions to differ by a small amount and their time averages were similar our tdir method yielded a time average force of 33 67n the and cfd method 30 75n in contrast to the previous case of λ l 2 5 where the diffraction and radiation forces contributed most to the time average force here the froude krylov force provided the largest contribution the time average value of the waterline force was twice as large as for the case of λ l 2 5 however its contribution was small compared to the froude krylov force fig 12 compares force components of our computed time histories for the freely moving containership in regular head waves of λ l 0 60 the relatively small ship motions in waves of this length caused second harmonic amplitudes of froude krylov radiation and diffraction forces to be reduced relative to their first harmonic amplitudes the first harmonic amplitude of the froude krylov force amounted to 40 62n its second harmonic amplitude 1 00n its the time average 2 92 n the first and second harmonic amplitudes of the diffraction force were 9 59n and 0 406n respectively its time average 0 371n the first second and third harmonic amplitudes of the waterline force were 0 285n 5 32n and 0 0696 n its time average 2 93n consequently the waterline force contributed about the same amount to the total drift force as the froude krylov force our total hydrodynamic force total agreed favorably to the cfd predictions cfd their amplitudes are almost identical however their time histories differ somewhat which we were unable explain their time averages form our tdir method and the cfd method were 5 48n and of 6 81n respectively sigmund and el moctar 2018 showed that viscous surface shear forces may contribute considerably to wave added resistance in short waves in waves of λ l 0 6 such shear forces for the container ship contributed about six percent however this does not fully explain the differences between tdir and cfd a simplified approach to account for shear force empirically is presented below fig 13 plots comparative values of wave added resistance coefficient caw obtained from our tdir method tdir from the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd these coefficients associated with the normalized wave drift force are plotted against the wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 in long waves coefficients from our tdir method and from the glr method compare favorably to those obtained from the cfd method and from measurements however in short waves coefficients from our tdir method and from the glr method underestimated values based on model test measurements nevertheless our tdir computed coefficients agree more closely to measurement based values than the glr computed coefficients recall that the comparative predictions for the fixed containership were similar 3 5 force components for the fixed kvlcc2 tanker for the fixed tanker in regular 6 0m high head waves of λ l 2 0 1 0 and 0 6 fig 14 plots time histories of longitudinal force the general behavior of each force component did not change significantly compared to those for the dtc containership therefore we present only our computed total force total and the cfd force cfd in waves of λ l 2 0 first harmonic amplitudes of total force from our tdir method 59 73n and from the cfd method 58 54n are similar however their respective time average forces of 1 27n and 2 13 differed in waves of λ l 1 0 agreement is seen to be less favorable even comparative first harmonic amplitudes differ our tdir method yielded 31 02 n the cfd method 39 65 n their respective time average forces turned out to be 1 71n and 2 32n in waves of λ l 0 6 predictions from our tdir method agree more closely to predictions from the cfd method the first harmonic amplitude from our tdir method was 39 11n from the cfd method 39 88n their respective time average forces were 2 06n and 2 07n 3 6 wave added resistance for the fixed kvlcc2 tanker fig 15 plots comparative time histories of the wave added resistance coefficient caw for the fixed tanker kvlcc2 in regular head waves of differing lengths corresponding to λ l ratios ranging between 0 2 and 2 0 compared to cfd predictions cfd our tdir method tdir the cfd method cfd and the frequency domain method glr underestimated wave added resistance in long waves however all predictions converge with decreasing wave length in short waves coefficients from our tdir method and from the cfd method agree well whereas coefficients from the glr method still underestimates wave added resistance 3 7 motions for the freely floating kvlcc2 tanker we performed simulations of the tanker free to move in heave and pitch in regular 3 0m amplitude head waves of 0 4 λ l 2 0 against wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 fig 16 and fig 17 plot transfer functions of normalized heave and pitch motions respectively obtained from our nonlinear tdir method tdir form the cfd method cfd from a linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd fig 16 shows that in waves of 0 9 l λ 0 5 1 1 our tdir method tdir underestimates heave in these wave lengths deck immersion most likely affected heave in long waves heave predicted by the cfd method cfd and the linear method glr correlate favorably to measurements fig 17 shows that pitch predictions from our tdir method tdir agree favorably to measurements efd especially in long waves whereas predictions from glr method glr and cfd method cfd overestimate pitch compared to measurements efd fig 18 and fig 19 plot phase angles between the incident wave and respectively the tanker s heave motions and pitch motions these phase angles behaved similarly to those for the containership fig 18 shows that except in waves of l λ 0 5 0 9 heave from our tdir method tdir generally agree favorably to heave from the cfd method cfd and to measured heave efd in waves of l λ 0 5 0 9 heave from the linear glr method glr overestimated measured heave fig 19 shows that pitch behaved similarly to heave in that pitch from our tdir method tdir generally agrees favorably to pitch from the cfd method cfd and to measured pitch efd as a conclusion our weakly nonlinear tdir method improved the prediction of motion phase angles compared to the linear frequency domain glr method for ship motions froude krylov forces often dominated to obtain the froude krylov forces recall that our tdir method integrated over the exact wetted surface which contributed significantly to more accurate predictions fig 20 plots time histories of longitudinal total force in waves of λ l 2 0 1 0 and 0 6 similar to the containership simulations in long waves of λ l 2 0 our tdir predictions tdir agree favorably to cfd predictions cfd their respective first harmonic amplitudes of 53 93n and 56 41n were close similar could be shown for their time average forces of 0 40n and 0 37n however these average forces were small compared to the total force amplitudes in waves of λ l 1 0 first harmonic amplitudes from our tdir method and the cfd method agree well however in waves of this length the bow of the tanker emerged and immersed largely recall that our tdir method was then unable to compute the flow around the bow thereby causing a small time shift of the negative part and also a deviation from the harmonic behavior at times t 0 5 and 1 5s nevertheless overall the agreement was accurate enough to compute first harmonic amplitudes the time average force of 6 4n from our tdir method was slightly overestimated compared to the average force of 5 18n from the cfd method in waves of λ l 0 6 first harmonic amplitudes from our tdir and cfd are seen to be similar although the small time shift of the negative part was still present their respective time average forces of 2 09n and 2 11n were close together fig 21 plots comparative values of wave added resistance coefficient caw obtained from our tdir method tdir from the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd these coefficients associated with the normalized wave drift force are plotted against the wave length to ship length ratio λ l and the square root of its inverse l λ 0 5 over almost the entire range of wave lengths coefficients from our tdir method compare favorably to those obtained from measurements coefficients from the glr method compared favorably to measurement based coefficients only in long waves and in short waves in waves of 1 2 λ l 0 6 the glr method underestimated the wave added resistance 3 8 effect of wave steepness on wave added resistance the effect of different wave heights on the wave added resistance was investigated experimentally by yasukawa et al 2016 they measured the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance for three ship models with the same main dimensions and different block coefficients 0 81 0 84 and 0 87 the experiments were performed for two different wave amplitudes further on two loading conditions full loading and ballast conditions were investigated for the full loading conditions the authors shown that the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance was clearly effected by the wave amplitude for ballast conditions effects of wave amplitude on the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance could only be seen for few single wave frequencies sigmund and el moctar 2018 investigated the effect of the wave steepness on the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance for the containership dtc and the tanker kvlcc2 using cfd they showed that the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance of the tanker was sensitive to the wave steepness in long and mid size waves the non dimensional wave added resistance increased with decreasing wave steepness similar behavior was shown by yasukawa et al 2016 as aforementioned yasukawa et al 2016 showed that in short waves the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance of the vlcc tanker with a block coefficient of 0 81 seemed to be only slightly effected by the wave steepness and a decreasing wave steepness resulted in an increasing non dimensional wave added resistance however sigmund and el moctar 2018 showed a different behavior in short waves the non dimensional wave added resistance was strongly affected by the wave steepness in short waves and decreased with decreasing wave steepness however in contrast to yasukawa et al 2016 sigmund and el moctar 2018 investigated very short waves with a high steepness this might be a reason for the contrary findings in the present study we investigated the effect of wave steepness on the quadratic transfer function of the wave added resistance for the container ship and tanker using the weakly nonlinear time domain method the wave added resistance of the container ship was computed for the wave conditions listed in table 2 since we used a potential flow solver we tried to avoid water on deck thus the wave steepness had to be limited and only waves with a small to moderate steepness were investigated as a result the added resistance of the containership depended almost quadratically on the wave amplitude for the investigated waves slightly more effects were found for the kvlcc2 tanker fig 22 plots the corresponding quadratic transfer functions of the wave added resistance for three different wave steepness the effects of wave steepness were found to be moderate similar effects were shown by yasukawa et al 2016 the weakly nonlinear time domain solver is able to account for geometrical nonlinearities these nonlinearities may affect the non dimensional wave added resistance slightly when the wave steepness varies see e g fig 22 however the major effect of the wave steepness on the added resistance seemed to result from the nonlinear behavior of steep waves this effect is not considered in the bem method tdir consequently the effect of wave steepness may be clearly underestimated by the bem method as shown by yasukawa et al 2016 and sigmund and el moctar 2018 3 9 estimation of the viscous wave added resistance generally it is assumed that wave drift forces are caused by pressure variations at the ship s hull however sigmund and el moctar 2018 showed that also viscous effects play a significant role in short waves of λ l 0 5 and that it vanishes in longer waves when the ship is free to heave and pitch further work regarding the wave added resistance of the kvlcc2 tanker in short waves can be found in yang et al 2018 and seo et al 2014 so far our time domain method based on potential theory neglected viscous effects however to remedy this defect we introduced a simplified exponential function to account for viscous effects on the wave added resistance in head waves thus the total wave added resistance coefficient c a w t o t ω was calculated as the sum of the wave induced pressure added resistance coefficient c a w ω and the viscous wave added resistance coefficient c v i s c ω relating the viscous wave added resistance to the pressure based wave added resistance 21 f v i s c ω c v i s c ω c a w ω the total wave added resistance coefficient follows from 22 c a w t o t ω c a w ω 1 f v i s c ω with f v i s c ω being the relative viscous wave added resistance we assumed that the relationship between the pressure wave induced part and viscous wave added resistance does not dependent on ship speed we expressed f v i s c ω by an exponential function with the following parameters wave length to ship length ratio λ l and ship s block coefficient cb 23 f v i s c c 1 c b c 2 e c 3 λ l where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are assumed to be ship independent constants c 1 c 2 and c 3 were determined by applying the least square fit technique to the results presented by sigmund and el moctar 2018 24 f v i s c 0 4 c b 1 67 e 5 8 λ l for the containership dtc and the tanker kvlcc2 fig 23 compares the relative viscous wave added resistance f v i s c obtained from our empirical function 24 with results from the cfd method index emp designates values from 24 index cfd values from the cfd method it is seen that the viscous contribution to total added resistance was higher for the container ship than for the tanker fig 24 and fig 25 plot comparative values of wave added resistance coefficient caw obtained from our tdir method including viscous effects tdir fric from the cfd method cfd from the linear frequency domain method glr and from model test measurements efd for the containership it is seen that the additional viscous force component yields a better agreement between tdir and cfd predictions as well as measurement based efd predictions for the tanker differences were smaller furthermore in short waves our tdir method slightly overestimated wave added resistance compared to cfd predictions even without considering the viscous force contribution nevertheless including the viscous component improved our predictions compared to measurement based efd predictions wave length strongly influenced the viscous wave added resistance component especially in shorter waves furthermore ship motions were mitigated in shorter waves from that perspective it seemed reasonable to relate viscous wave added resistance to relative ship motions heave and pitch instead of wave length if wave added resistance were to be calculated for the fixed ship a significant viscous components should result also in long waves and perhaps explain why our tdir predictions of wave added resistance for the freely moving ship in long waves agreed so favorably to the cfd predictions but differenced for the fixed ship to clarify whether viscous wave added resistance is relevant also in long waves when the ship is fixed additional cfd computations would be necessary 4 conclusions we presented a partially nonlinear time domain numerical method to predict the wave added resistance of ships advancing at constant forward speed in regular head waves following the approach of cummins our method relied on frequency domain coefficients to calculate radiation forces in the time domain on integration of pressures over the instantaneous wetted surface of the ships to yield nonlinear froude krylov and restoring forces and on an additional force component to account for the effect of the changing wetted surface caused by radiation and diffraction of the undisturbed incident waves for a modern container ship and very large tanker we computed time histories of wave induced longitudinal forces and quadratic transfer functions of wave added resistance coefficients and compared our predictions to results from a ranse based cfd method from a linear frequency domain technique and model test based measurements we considered the fixed ships and the ships free to move in heave and pitch generally our computed time histories agreed favorably to those from the cfd method only for the fixed tanker in wave lengths close to the ship s length did first harmonic amplitudes of longitudinal forces differ by a relatively small amount for the freely moving ships time average wave added resistances were closer to those from the cfd method and from model test based measurements for the fixed ships our method underestimated wave added resistance also in long waves in shorter waves the differences between our method and the cfd results decreased especially for the tanker agreement in short waves was favorable compared to the frequency domain approach our method yielded more accurate predictions in waves of almost every wave length especially for the fixed containership in short waves the frequency domain method strongly underestimated wave added resistance for the freely moving ships our results agreed favorably to those based on model test measurements over the whole range of wave lengths especially for the containership in short waves and the tanker in mid to long waves our method obtained more accurate predictions compared to the frequency domain method to consider the viscous component of wave added resistance we introduced an empirical formula for the containership in short waves its inclusion led to a reduction of the differences between prediction from our method and those from the cfd method and from model test based wave added resistance for the tanker the viscous wave added resistance played a minor role and the use of the empirical function did not change the results significantly however for the tanker in short waves our tdir results and cfd results were almost identical acknowledgments the research was supported by the german research
