14335,two potential p cresol degrading bacterial strains were isolated from petroleum refinery wastewater and identified as stenotrophomonas sp mf004205 strain dbk3 and bacillus sp mf004206 strain dbk4 based on 16s rdna gene sequencing while dbk4 was able to utilize p cresol up to 500 mg l 1 in about 2 days isolated dbk3 restricted its growth till 600 mg l 1 initial p cresol concentration further studies were carried out using strain dbk3 which utilized p cresol as the sole source of carbon growth kinetic studies were conducted to determine optimal environmental conditions for growth and biodegradation of p cresol degradation of p cresol at various preliminary concentrations were also studied at their optimum physiological conditions 100 mg l 1 p cresol was found to be the optimal pollutant concentration for growth whereas the ideal temperature and ph for growth and degradation were found to be 37 c and 7 0 respectively microbial growth was monitored spectrophotometrically while residual p cresol was measured via high performance liquid chromatography hplc various growth kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data to several established substrate inhibition kinetic models by non linear regression analysis via matlab r2017b the best fit was achieved using haldane s kinetic model maximum growth rate μ max 0 1160 h 1 and inhibition constant ki 387 mg l 1 the experimental growth kinetic data also fitted reasonably well with aiba yano and webb model keywords p cresol degradation optimization stenotrophomonas substrate inhibition inhibition models 1 introduction rapid industrialization and development of nations around the world have increased the demand for exploring energy resources fossil fuels mainly petroleum and petroleum products remain one of the major energy resources being utilized across the world pollution of terrestrial aquatic and marine environment surrounding the crude oil drilling sites and refineries is an ever growing matter of concern in various countries crude oil contamination affects soil and water quality rendering them incompetent for harboring plants and aquatic life moreover microorganisms residing in soil and water experience extreme changes in genetic level in the incidence of long term crude oil exposure phenolic compounds are amongst the most noxious derivatives of crude oil p cresol or 4 methylphenol is a derivative of phenol p cresol along with other phenolic compounds is often the most frequently encountered pollutant in industrial wastewater cresols are highly soluble in water and found in wastewater from hydrocarbon refining coal gasification units paper and pulp industries textile mills herbicides fungicides and coal conversion processes 1 2 coal conversion and coke oven effluents may contain up to 30 cresols 3 the european union sets a permissible limit of 0 3 mg l 1 for phenolic compounds in potable water however the recommended limit set by world health organization who is 0 001 mg l 1 4 cresols are xenobiotic compounds and they tend to persist in nature without self degradation 5 phenolic compounds are toxic to a wide range of microbes flora and fauna and are carcinogenic teratogenic and mutagenic 3 6 p cresol is classified as a group c pollutant possible human carcinogen by the usepa 7 thus p cresol and other phenolic compounds must be removed from wastewater before released into the environment there are several physical and chemical methods reported for degradation of phenols and cresols some of these include chlorination ozonation membrane process flocculation coagulation solvent extraction adsorption chemical oxidation incineration etc 7 9 however the problem with such methods are that they are not cost effective and energy efficient and most of the times they produce secondary pollutants 8 10 11 on the contrary biodegradation is a method that is eco friendly cost effective and ensures complete degradation of a pollutant without producing any hazardous byproducts 8 10 12 p cresol and other phenolic compounds are toxic to microbes and they stop microbial growth by inhibiting their metabolism 13 thus several approaches like adding easily degradable co substrates immobilization and adaptation to high concentrations of the pollutant have been suggested 14 adaptation to high concentrations of a pollutant could enhance the degradation rates 15 degradation of p cresol have been studied using pure cultures of fungus and bacteria as well as mixed bacterial cultures 2 7 10 13 16 17 the most frequently reported bacterial strain for p cresol degradation was pseudomonas sp 18 21 there are also reports of p cresol remediation using the fungal strain gliomastix indicus 2 9 13 in the present study two p cresol degrading bacterial strains were isolated from petroleum refinery wastewater of assam india one of the isolates stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 was capable of degrading up to 600 mg l 1 of p cresol effect of initial p cresol concentration and environmental factors such as ph and temperature were studied to obtain optimal growth and degradation conditions data obtained from experimental trials were fitted against different substrate inhibition models to obtain values of several bio kinetic parameters using matlab r2017b 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and enrichment in

himedia 2 2 isolation and identification of culturable bacterial strains the enrichment culture was serially diluted and subjected to repeated sub culturing on msm agar plates amended with yeast extract 3 0 g l 1 as carbon source for isolation of culturable bacterial strains 1 8 agar was used as the gelling agent genomic dna was isolated for identification of the bacterial strains a column

followed by dehydration using acetone gradation the sample was dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight finally the bacterial morphology was studied in a zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope model sigma at 25 kx magnification after coating the sample with gold 2 4 optimization of bacterial growth parameters initial substrate concentration ph and temperature 2 4 1 initial substrate concentration studies experiments for optimization of initial substrate concentration were conducted in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks with 100 ml of msm augmented with various increasing concentrations p cresol 75 600 mg l 1 as sole carbon source samples were withdrawn at regular intervals for measurement of cell growth and residual p cresol concentrations all experiments were conducted in triplicates in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm a temperature of 37 c and ph of 7 0 was maintained throughout the study an actively growing inoculum load of 1 v v was used for all experiments an independent experiment was conducted to acquire a calibration curve of optical density od against dry cell weight dcw where 1 0 od 0 54 g dcw l 1 r2 0 998 data not shown 2 4 2 ph optimization studies optimum ph for degradation of p cresol and bacterial growth was determined by conducting experiments at various initial ph values 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 of the growth media the experiments were conducted at 37 c and an optimum p cresol concentration of 100 mg l 1 bacterial growth and p cresol consumption was monitored at regular intervals all studies were done in triplicates in an incubator shaker at 120 rpm 2 4 3 temperature optimization studies effect of different incubation temperatures on bacterial growth and degradation of p cresol was studied by conducting experiments at 25 c 30 c 37 c and 45 c these experiments were conducted at an optimum preset p cresol concentration of 100 mg l 1 and ph 7 0 at 120 rpm in an incubator shaker the experimental specific growth rate μ h 1 was calculated from the microbial growth data obtained from the experiments conducted above which helped determine the optimum substrate concentration ph and temperature 2 5 measurement of bacterial growth and residual p cresol microbial growth was analyzed by monitoring optical density od using a uv vis spectrophotometer cary 100 agilent usa at a wavelength of 600 nm glass cuvettes of volume 1000 μl and dimensions 45 12 5 12 5 mm with a path length of 10 mm were used for the study residual concentrations of p cresol were quantified by hplc high performance liquid chromatography 1220 infinity agilent usa equipped with a vwd variable wavelength detector and a c18 column oyster bds premium c18 particle size 5 μm 150 mm x 4 mm at a wavelength of 280 nm acetonitrile 40 water 60 at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 was used as mobile phase for hplc analyses 2 6 growth kinetic studies specific growth rate μ h 1 is considered as a crucial parameter for determination of optimal growth conditions of organisms 22 it was assumed that microbial growth follows first order kinetics 1 d x d t μ x or 2 μ 1 x d x d t integration of eq 2 with condition t 0 to t gives 3 ln x t ln x o μ t μ t o or 4 μ ln x t l n x o t t o where xt cell concentration at time t xo cell concentration at time t 0 specific growth rate μ is defined by eq 4 and it is determined at the exponential phase of growth 23 the value of μ was ascertained from the slope of the linear plot of time t vs ln x xo at the exponential phase here bacterial cell concentration x can be expressed in dry cell weight basis g l 1 or in units of absorbance at 600 nm it was presumed that oxygen was not a limiting factor for growth and that growth was primarily inhibited due to toxicity of the substrate p cresol 25 phenolic compounds are toxic and well known for their inhibitory effects on microbial growth and p cresol is no exception hence in the current study several established kinetic models such as haldane yano aiba edward and webb models were used to describe the growth kinetics of the strain dbk3 in p cresol table 2 a plot of experimental specific growth rate μ vs initial p cresol concentration so was constructed and the substrate inhibition models were fitted to the same values of several bio kinetic parameters like μ max maximum specific growth rate h 1 ks substrate affinity constant mg l 1 ki substrate inhibition constant mg l 1 and k the constant in yano and webb model were obtained using regression analysis in matlab r2017b mathworks natick ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment of wastewater samples isolation and identification of bacterial strains the collected wastewater samples were initially enriched in sterilized msm amended with yeast extract later the enrichment procedure was carried out in msm without yeast extract with p cresol as a sole carbon source gradually the p cresol concentration was escalated to 700 mg l 1 in increments of 100 mg l 1 for enrichment of the culture the cultures were regularly monitored for growth the enrichment culture exhibited growth up to a concentration of 600 mg l 1 of p cresol thereafter on isolation of bacterial cultures from the enrichment culture using msm agar plates with yeast extract two morphologically distinct bacterial colonies were obtained these two bacterial isolates were then purified by repeated sub culture and further enriched in p cresol the bacterial isolates could grow in p cresol concentrations of up to 500 mg l 1 and 600 mg l 1 and were designated as strain dbk4 and dbk3 respectively owing to its capability to grow in 600 mg l 1 p cresol the strain dbk3 was used for further degradation and optimization studies the 16s rdna sequence analysis via online blast tool indicated the similarity of strain dbk3 to stenotrophomonas sp and dbk4 to bacillus sp respectively thereafter the sequences were submitted to ncbi genbank with accession no mf004205 and mf004206 for dbk3 and dbk4 respectively a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree was constructed for the two isolates using mega7 tool fig s1 electronic supplementary data the phylogenetic tree clearly depicts the similarity of the isolated strains with sequences in the genbank nucleotide database field emission scanning electron microscopic studies were carried out for observing the cell morphology stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 was observed as rod shaped cells fig 1 3 2 effect of initial p cresol concentration on microbial growth the effect of initial substrate concentration on growth of bacteria and simultaneous degradation of the pollutant was studied experiments were conducted in triplicates by varying the initial pollutant load from 75 mg l 1 to 600 mg l 1 75 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 fig 2 a illustrates the degradation profiles of the above mentioned p cresol concentrations data for 75 mg l 1 not shown it can be observed that the strain dbk3 could achieve complete degradation of 400 mg l 1 of p cresol in 189 h however dbk3 also exhibited remarkable tolerance towards 500 mg l 1 and 600 mg l 1 of p cresol degrading nearly 83 and 74 of the stated concentrations the strain dbk3 took much longer to degrade higher concentrations of p cresol 189 h for 400 mg l 1 when compared to lower concentrations 32 h for 100 mg l 1 higher concentrations of p cresol also exhibited higher biomass growth data not shown this could be attributed to the fact that larger amount of substrate was available for utilization and bacterial growth 22 the time taken for degradation of p cresol was comparable to previously reported microbial degraders table 1 the optimum substrate concentration was ascertained by calculating the specific growth rate at various increasing p cresol concentration in the exponential phase of growth fig 2b a maximum experimental specific growth rate of 0 07143 h 1 was observed for 100 mg l 1 of p cresol hence 100 mg l 1 was considered as an optimal initial substrate concentration 3 3 effect of initial ph on microbial growth and p cresol degradation ph plays a significant role during the degradation or utilization of xenobiotic compounds or any kind of substrate by microorganisms optimum ph triggers the production of enzymes in microorganisms which in turn help utilize nutrients however these enzymes can be rather vulnerable to even minor ph changes extreme ph could result in loss of catalytic activity and denaturation of enzymes 23 subsequently the organismal metabolism cease to function causing a rapid microbial obliteration therefore it is imperative that an optimum initial ph is maintained for efficient utilization of p cresol or any nutrient source a wide range of ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were considered for this study studies were carried out at a predetermined optimum initial pollutant concentration of 100 mg l 1 a temperature of 37 c was maintained fig 3 b illustrates the experimental specific growth rates at various initial ph values considered in this study it was observed that the maximum value for specific growth rate was achieved at a ph value of 7 0 however at ph 5 0 a severe inhibition of growth can be observed the inhibitory effect at ph 6 0 and 8 0 are also evident from the graph however the strain dbk3 was able to achieve about 98 degradation at ph 8 0 and 53 degradation in ph 6 0 fig 3a this suggests that the strain is a neutrophilic bacterium that might be capable of utilizing p cresol in a ph range of 6 0 8 0 the bacterial culture at ph 5 0 witnessed almost negligible p cresol utilization suggesting loss or death of biomass 7 0 was considered the optimal ph for p cresol degradation as it was at this ph that highest growth rate and fastest degradation was achieved 3 4 effect of incubation temperature on microbial growth and p cresol degradation fig 4 illustrates the specific growth rate profiles of stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 at various incubation temperatures 25 c 30 c 37 c and 45 c and an initial optimum ph of 7 0 an optimal p cresol concentration of 100 mg l 1 was maintained for the study it was observed that growth rate improved with rise in temperature attaining a maximum value at 37 c the growth rate was extremely low at 25 c where almost no visible growth was observed this suggested that the cresol degrading enzymes might not have activated resulting in a rapid death of the bacterium 23 interestingly the growth rate at 30 c and 45 c was reasonably higher suggesting that the strain was mesophilic in nature a similar outcome has been reported in our previous work involving degradation of phenol 22 the maximum experimental specific growth rate was observed at ph 7 0 which witnessed the complete degradation of p cresol degradation data not shown 3 5 growth kinetic studies for stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 as phenolic compounds inhibit growth of microorganisms several established substrate inhibition kinetic models table 2 have been considered in this study experiments were conducted at several initial concentrations of p cresol specific growth rate for each substrate concentration was calculated from the slope of a linear plot of time t vs ln x xo at the exponential phase of growth as described in section 2 6 fig 5 shows the variations in specific growth rates μ h 1 with varying p cresol concentrations it also portrays the fitting of the experimental data against the model simulated ones the experimental data was fitted to five different substrate inhibition describing kinetic models and values of bio kinetic parameters were calculated table 2 presents the values of these bio kinetic parameters along with the values of corresponding coefficients of correlation r2 the curve fitting was executed by solving the models by non linear regression analysis via matlab r2017b except edward s kinetic model all other models fits the experimental data reasonably well however haldane s model gave the best fit achieving a correlation coefficient r2 value of 0 9712 the values of other kinetic parameters also are also in agreement with the experimental outcomes the inhibitory effect of p cresol is quite evident after the pollutant level exceeds 400 mg l 1 this deterioration of specific growth rate could be attributed to the fact that higher concentrations of p cresol damaged bacterial cells leading to reduced metabolic activity it can also be assumed that toxic concentrations of the pollutant led to cell death resulting in further inhibition 26 27 this is also reflected in the values of the bio kinetic parameters calculated from the haldane s model the value of inhibition constant ki was 387 mg l 1 which is at par with our experimental results beyond p cresol concentration of 400 mg l 1 the specific growth rate value declined which points to the fact that p cresol was an inhibitory substrate 13 this growth kinetic study indicated that the isolated strain dbk3 was efficient in degrading p cresol completely up to a concentration of 400 mg l 1 this can be accredited to the fact that the strain was subjected to a long term exposure to lethal concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons 22 4 conclusions two p cresol degrading bacterial strains were isolated from petroleum refinery wastewater one of them was identified as stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 genbank accession no mf004205 dbk3 could although not completely degrade during the experimental duration endure a p cresol concentration of 600 mg l 1 it could degrade 400 mg l 1 of p cresol completely in 189 h whereas 600 mg l 1 of the pollutant was degraded up to about 74 environmental parameters such as ph temperature and substrate concentration were optimized several growth kinetic models were used to determine the values of bio kinetic parameters out of these models the haldane s model accomplished the best fit with a correlation coefficient value of 0 9712 the values of other kinetic parameters derived from the haldane s model were μ max 0 1160 ks 43 53 mg l 1 and ki 387 mg l 1 although the growth rate at 500 mg l 1 and 600 mg l 1 of p cresol was quite low indicating substrate inhibition the pollutant was degraded up to more than 70 for both concentrations all the predicted values from the simulated growth rate curves were in agreement with our experimental data the experimental data of this study can be used

models such as haldane yano aiba edward and webb models were used to describe the growth kinetics of the strain dbk3 in p cresol table 2 a plot of experimental specific growth rate μ vs initial p cresol concentration so was constructed and the substrate inhibition models were fitted to the same values of several bio kinetic parameters like μ max maximum specific growth rate h 1 ks substrate affinity constant mg l 1 ki substrate inhibition constant mg l 1 and k the constant in yano and webb model were obtained using regression analysis in matlab r2017b mathworks natick ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 enrichment of wastewater samples isolation and identification of bacterial strains the collected wastewater samples were initially enriched in sterilized msm amended with yeast extract later the enrichment procedure was carried out in msm without yeast extract with p cresol as a sole carbon source gradually the p cresol concentration was escalated to 700 mg l 1 in increments of 100 mg l 1 for enrichment of the culture the cultures were regularly monitored for growth the enrichment culture exhibited growth up to a concentration of 600 mg l 1 of p cresol thereafter on isolation of bacterial cultures from the enrichment culture using msm agar plates with yeast extract two morphologically distinct bacterial colonies were obtained these two bacterial isolates were then purified by repeated sub culture and further enriched in p cresol the bacterial isolates could grow in p cresol concentrations of up to 500 mg l 1 and 600 mg l 1 and were designated as strain dbk4 and dbk3 respectively owing to its capability to grow in 600 mg l 1 p cresol the strain dbk3 was used for further degradation and optimization studies the 16s rdna sequence analysis via online blast tool indicated the similarity of strain dbk3 to stenotrophomonas sp and dbk4 to bacillus sp respectively thereafter the sequences were submitted to ncbi genbank with accession no mf004205 and mf004206 for dbk3 and dbk4 respectively a neighbor joining phylogenetic tree was constructed for the two isolates using mega7 tool fig s1 electronic supplementary data the phylogenetic tree clearly depicts the similarity of the isolated strains with sequences in the genbank nucleotide database field emission scanning electron microscopic studies were carried out for observing the cell morphology stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 was observed as rod shaped cells fig 1 3 2 effect of initial p cresol concentration on microbial growth the effect of initial substrate concentration on growth of bacteria and simultaneous degradation of the pollutant was studied experiments were conducted in triplicates by varying the initial pollutant load from 75 mg l 1 to 600 mg l 1 75 100 200 300 400 500 and 600 mg l 1 fig 2 a illustrates the degradation profiles of the above mentioned p cresol concentrations data for 75 mg l 1 not shown it can be observed that the strain dbk3 could achieve complete degradation of 400 mg l 1 of p cresol in 189 h however dbk3 also exhibited remarkable tolerance towards 500 mg l 1 and 600 mg l 1 of p cresol degrading nearly 83 and 74 of the stated concentrations the strain dbk3 took much longer to degrade higher concentrations of p cresol 189 h for 400 mg l 1 when compared to lower concentrations 32 h for 100 mg l 1 higher concentrations of p cresol also exhibited higher biomass growth data not shown this could be attributed to the fact that larger amount of substrate was available for utilization and bacterial growth 22 the time taken for degradation of p cresol was comparable to previously reported microbial degraders table 1 the optimum substrate concentration was ascertained by calculating the specific growth rate at various increasing p cresol concentration in the exponential phase of growth fig 2b a maximum experimental specific growth rate of 0 07143 h 1 was observed for 100 mg l 1 of p cresol hence 100 mg l 1 was considered as an optimal initial substrate concentration 3 3 effect of initial ph on microbial growth and p cresol degradation ph plays a significant role during the degradation or utilization of xenobiotic compounds or any kind of substrate by microorganisms optimum ph triggers the production of enzymes in microorganisms which in turn help utilize nutrients however these enzymes can be rather vulnerable to even minor ph changes extreme ph could result in loss of catalytic activity and denaturation of enzymes 23 subsequently the organismal metabolism cease to function causing a rapid microbial obliteration therefore it is imperative that an optimum initial ph is maintained for efficient utilization of p cresol or any nutrient source a wide range of ph 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were considered for this study studies were carried out at a predetermined optimum initial pollutant concentration of 100 mg l 1 a temperature of 37 c was maintained fig 3 b illustrates the experimental specific growth rates at various initial ph values considered in this study it was observed that the maximum value for specific growth rate was achieved at a ph value of 7 0 however at ph 5 0 a severe inhibition of growth can be observed the inhibitory effect at ph 6 0 and 8 0 are also evident from the graph however the strain dbk3 was able to achieve about 98 degradation at ph 8 0 and 53 degradation in ph 6 0 fig 3a this suggests that the strain is a neutrophilic bacterium that might be capable of utilizing p cresol in a ph range of 6 0 8 0 the bacterial culture at ph 5 0 witnessed almost negligible p cresol utilization suggesting loss or death of biomass 7 0 was considered the optimal ph for p cresol degradation as it was at this ph that highest growth rate and fastest degradation was achieved 3 4 effect of incubation temperature on microbial growth and p cresol degradation fig 4 illustrates the specific growth rate profiles of stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 at various incubation temperatures 25 c 30 c 37 c and 45 c and an initial optimum ph of 7 0 an optimal p cresol concentration of 100 mg l 1 was maintained for the study it was observed that growth rate improved with rise in temperature attaining a maximum value at 37 c the growth rate was extremely low at 25 c where almost no visible growth was observed this suggested that the cresol degrading enzymes might not have activated resulting in a rapid death of the bacterium 23 interestingly the growth rate at 30 c and 45 c was reasonably higher suggesting that the strain was mesophilic in nature a similar outcome has been reported in our previous work involving degradation of phenol 22 the maximum experimental specific growth rate was observed at ph 7 0 which witnessed the complete degradation of p cresol degradation data not shown 3 5 growth kinetic studies for stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 as phenolic compounds inhibit growth of microorganisms several established substrate inhibition kinetic models table 2 have been considered in this study experiments were conducted at several initial concentrations of p cresol specific growth rate for each substrate concentration was calculated from the slope of a linear plot of time t vs ln x xo at the exponential phase of growth as described in section 2 6 fig 5 shows the variations in specific growth rates μ h 1 with varying p cresol concentrations it also portrays the fitting of the experimental data against the model simulated ones the experimental data was fitted to five different substrate inhibition describing kinetic models and values of bio kinetic parameters were calculated table 2 presents the values of these bio kinetic parameters along with the values of corresponding coefficients of correlation r2 the curve fitting was executed by solving the models by non linear regression analysis via matlab r2017b except edward s kinetic model all other models fits the experimental data reasonably well however haldane s model gave the best fit achieving a correlation coefficient r2 value of 0 9712 the values of other kinetic parameters also are also in agreement with the experimental outcomes the inhibitory effect of p cresol is quite evident after the pollutant level exceeds 400 mg l 1 this deterioration of specific growth rate could be attributed to the fact that higher concentrations of p cresol damaged bacterial cells leading to reduced metabolic activity it can also be assumed that toxic concentrations of the pollutant led to cell death resulting in further inhibition 26 27 this is also reflected in the values of the bio kinetic parameters calculated from the haldane s model the value of inhibition constant ki was 387 mg l 1 which is at par with our experimental results beyond p cresol concentration of 400 mg l 1 the specific growth rate value declined which points to the fact that p cresol was an inhibitory substrate 13 this growth kinetic study indicated that the isolated strain dbk3 was efficient in degrading p cresol completely up to a concentration of 400 mg l 1 this can be accredited to the fact that the strain was subjected to a long term exposure to lethal concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons 22 4 conclusions two p cresol degrading bacterial strains were isolated from petroleum refinery wastewater one of them was identified as stenotrophomonas sp strain dbk3 genbank accession no mf004205 dbk3 could although not completely degrade during the experimental duration endure a p cresol concentration of 600 mg l 1 it could degrade 400 mg l 1 of p cresol completely in 189 h whereas 600 mg l 1 of the pollutant was degraded up to about 74 environmental parameters such as ph temperature and substrate concentration were optimized several growth kinetic models were used to determine the values of bio kinetic parameters out of these models the haldane s model accomplished the best fit with a correlation coefficient value of 0 9712 the values of other kinetic parameters derived from the haldane s model were μ max 0 1160 ks 43 53 mg l 1 and ki 387 mg l 1 although the growth rate at 500 mg l 1 and 600 mg l 1 of p cresol was quite low indicating substrate inhibition the pollutant was degraded up to more than 70 for both concentrations all the predicted values from the simulated growth rate curves were in agreement with our experimental data the experimental data of this study can be used for simulation and design of reactors for treatment of p cresol contaminated wastewater acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the central instrumentation facility iit guwahati for

to life is drying up around the world water scarcity is one of the alarming challenges that the modern world face today water shortages deterioration of water quality and environmental constraints have led to an augmented interest in recovering and recycling water in many parts of the world this shortage of water drives people to recycle the effluents from different fields such as agricultural effluents plantation effluents industrial and farming effluents 1 plantation effluents include effluents from palm oil mills rubber plantations coconut mills etc palm oil is one of the world s most rapidly expanding crops and is derived from the fleshy mesocarp of the fruit of oil palm elaeis gunineensis one hectare of oil palm produces about 10 35 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches ffb per year 2 while the palm oil industry has been known for development it has also contributed to environmental pollution due to the production of huge quantities of byproducts from the oil extraction process 3 the byproducts include oil palm trunks opt oil palm fronds opf empty fruit bunches efb palm pressed fibres ppf and liquid discharge palm oil mill effluent pome 2 4 5 according to yacob et al about 30 million tonnes of palm oil mill effluent pome was produced in malaysia in the year 2004 6 pome consists of 95 96 water 0 6 0 7 oil and 4 5 solids 1 it has high turbidity and color resulting from high organic matter content suspended solids and a trace amount of minerals and heavy metals 7 this organic content makes pome unfit for drinking if not treated therefore a proper treatment method to

experiments were carried out in a cross flow flat frame membrane module model pleiade rayflows orelis environment sas france with a filtration area of 100 cm2 at a temperature of 26 c and a controller to set the pressure at a transmembrane pressure of 200 kpa the cross flow ultrafiltration module is shown in fig 1 the experiments were conducted in a continuous mode where the permeate was continuously collected and measured in a measuring cylinder the retentate coming out of the membrane module was recycled back to the feed tank the permeate flux as well as the water flux was calculated by the equation given below eq 2 2 j w q a δ t where jw l m2h is the membrane flux a m2 is the effective area of the membrane surface q l is the volume collected and δt is the time interval

the membranes it is calculated by the formula given below eq 4 4 j k p r m 3 results and discussions 3 1 confirmation silver nanoparticle different analysis techniques were used to confirm the presence and characterize the prepared silver nanoparticles these confirmation analyses were performed before coating the hydroxyapatite nanotubes they are described in detail as follows 3 1 1 uv vis spectroscopy uv visible spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for structural characterization of silver nanoparticles it is quite sensitive to the presence of silver colloids because these nanoparticles exhibit an absorption peak due to the surface plasmon excitation the absorption band in the 350 nm 450 nm region is typical for the silver nanoparticles 18 the absorption spectra of the colloidal solution of silver are shown in fig 3 the spectra exhibit a plasmon absorption band at 400 nm which is the characteristic of silver nanoparticles such plasmon bands are unique physical properties of the nanoparticles themselves thus using uv spectroscopy the presence of silver nanoparticles was confirmed the identification of silver nanoparticles was based on surface plasmon resonance phenomenon the penetration depth was found to be directly proportional to the exciting wavelength i e 325 nm because of decreased absorbance which is in accordance with li et al 19 nanoparticles with absorbance in the range of 350 nm 450 nm were used for coating hydroxyapatite nanotubes 3 1 2 x ray diffraction xrd xrd was used as a secondary confirmation for the silver particles peaks were obtained according to reported data 18 these findings once again confirm the presence of nanoparticles the interplanar distance d spaces were measured using bragg s law and are illustrated in fig 4 their values ranged between 1 3 å the pattern clearly shows the main peaks at 2θ 38 44 64 and 77 corresponding to the 111 200 220 and 311 planes respectively by comparing jcods file no 89 3722 the typical pattern of chemical synthesized silver nanoparticles was found to possess an fcc structure 19 3 1 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir further confirmation was carried out by ftir the ftir spectra obtained was compared with the standard ir frequencies table 20 the spectra of silver exhibited a high intensity broad band at 1720 oh due to the stretching of the hydrogen and oxygen bond and at 1230 no fig 5 due to nitrogen oxygen stretch bond the functional groups obtained were in good agreement with what has been observed from reported data 18 by this analysis the particles that were prepared were confirmed to be silver nanoparticles 3 2 confirmation of silver coated hydroxyapatite after confirming the presence of silver nanoparticles it was used as a coating for hydroxyapatite nanotubes the presence of coated hydroxyapatite particles was confirmed and their structure was studied based on the following studies 3 2 1 x ray diffraction xrd xrd was used as a secondary confirmation for the silver particles peaks were obtained according to reported data 20 this peak gave us further confirmation on the presence of nanoparticles the interplanar distance d spaces were measured using bragg s law and are illustrated in fig 6 their values are ranged between 1 5 3 5 å the pattern clearly shows the main peaks at 2θ 26 33 49 and 54 corresponding to the 110 202 223 and 313 planes respectively these reported data clearly proved the presence of silver coated hydroxyapatite nanotubes 3 2 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir was used for added confirmation of the coated nanotubes and is shown in fig 7 the obtained spectra were compared with the standard ir frequencies table 20 it showed peaks at 1735 o h and 1020 n o and by comparing with reported data the particles that were prepared were confirmed to be silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite nanotubes 21 3 2 3 particle size analysis of nanotubes in order to find out the size distribution of the coated nano tubes prepared particle size analysis was carried out fig 8 shows the size distribution of nanoparticles and they were having a median and mean size of 20 7 nm 33 16 nm respectively mode size and standard deviations were 12 378 μm and 32 5125 μm respectively about 60 of particles were under the size of 20 μm 3 3 effect of filler concentration on hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane contact angle analysis was performed to study the influence of filler concentration on the hydrophilicity of the membrane table 2 shows the contact angle of each membrane and how the filler concentration changes the angle data the contact angle was decreased by almost 35 with an increase in filler composition indicating the increase in the hydrophilic nature of the membrane fig 9 hydrophilicity helps to decrease the membrane fouling caused by the organic matter present in the effluent hence the effect of filler on the hydrophilicity of the composite membrane was tested to study the influence of nano material in the membrane from table 2 it is clear that as filler content was increased the hydrophilic nature of the composite membranes was also improved which in turn results in a rise in the amount of water absorbed this can be explained by the presence of hydroxyapatite group in the membrane which alters the membrane surface properties the porosity of the membranes was calculated by the eq 1 the results of the test are tabulated in table 3 the porosity kept on increasing with increase in filler content because the presence of fillers makes the membrane more porous by opening up its pores from this test we can confirm that the membranes prepared were hydrophilic in nature and as the concentration of the inorganic fillers goes on increasing the membrane water absorption capacity and porosity also increases wettability of filler may aﬀ ect the adsorbed fouling agent in pome and enhance the material interactions results indicate that the silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite ppsu membranes have hydrophilic surfaces with contact angles less than 82 and pm 6 have the lowest contact angle and highest filler content 3 4 effect of filler concentration on the mechanical strength of the membrane the effect of filler concentration on the mechanical stability of the membrane is tabulated in table 4 the material strength of the membranes prepared was studied by performing stress strain tests the samples of the membranes were cut into dimensions of length 30 mm and width 10 mm the initial gauge length was set at 20 mm the data was recorded for respective samples and tabulated in table 4 it was observed that as the concentration of fillers in the membranes increased the ultimate force the membranes could withstand first kept on increasing and then started to decrease the membrane with a filler concentration of 1 5 was observed to be the most mechanically stable membrane initially the presence of fillers made the membrane more mechanically stable however when the filler content went beyond 1 5 the membrane became more porous compromising the structural stability of the membrane 3 5 confirmation of presence of nanomaterial in membrane different analysis techniques were used to confirm the presence of nanomaterial in the membrane functional groups that were present in the silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite are shown in fig 5 the spectra of silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite ppsu membranes are shown in fig 10 at 1735 oh oxygen hydrogen stretch bond is present which confirms the presence of silver coated hydroxyapatite nanotubes whereas the band at 1230 no nitrogen oxygen double bond confirms the presence of silver nanoparticles all the membranes except the virgin membrane exhibited these peaks 3 5 1 sem edax of the composite membrane fig 11 a shows the top surface of pm 4 and fig 11 b shows the different elements present in that membrane the sem image shows a defect free smooth surface of the membrane out of all the elements present in the membrane as observed in the result calcium and phosphor are highest in content these elements are present in the hydroxyapatite compound with this analysis we can conclude that the membrane is having the prepared fillers and they were not leached out of the membrane before they were used for separation 3 6 morphological characteristics of the membrane the top surface and cross sectional sem images are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively it shows a smooth and defects free surface without any deformation compared to the composite membrane virgin membrane is less porous and the membrane formed is found to be very dense and the same can be inferred from table 3 where the porosity of the membranes are tabulated virgin membrane i e pm 01 was found to be having a porosity of 0 768 and pm 06 was having a porosity of 0 921 this less porosity is the main factor that reduces the rejection percentage of the virgin membrane during pome treatment cross sectional images show the honey comb like structure of composite membranes fig 4 11 the thickness of pm 04 was found to be 250 μm the varying porosity which we had found earlier is picturized here from figs 12 and 13 we can observe how the porosity is varying from a less porous virgin membrane to a composite membrane which is rich in pores this porosity helps to achieve a higher flux and permeability during separation processes 3 7 treatment of palm oil mill effluent characteristics of the collected pome are tabulated in table 4 4 the effluent was collected from parison s palm oil kerala india and was filtered using filter paper to remove the suspended solids all the parameters were estimated after filtration table 5 3 7 1 ultrafiltration of pome in dead end filtration module the transmembrane pressure was set at 8 bar and the temperature at 26 c the diameter of the membrane was 5 cm permeate was collected every 10 min water flux was found before separating effluent water flux is given in fig 14 water flux was determined to find out intrinsic membrane resistance of all the membranes water flux of the membranes was observed to keep on increasing with increase in filler content and for pm 06 it reached up to 57 l hm2 this is due to the increase in porosity of the membrane as filler content makes the membrane more porous the intrinsic resistance of the membranes was calculated and tabulated below table 6 intrinsic resistance kept on decreasing from 19 178 kpahm2 l to 13 011 kpahm2 l with an increase in filler content due to higher porosity diffusion through pores require less activation energy and that makes the membrane less resistant and pm 6 was found to be having minimum intrinsic resistance and maximum porosity 0 921 after finding out the water flux using pome as the feed the permeate flux of the membrane was found and is shown in fig 15 with time the permeate flux kept decreasing and after some time it became constant this is due to the clogging of pores due to fouling the organic material deposited on the membrane reduces the pome flux over the passing of time absorbance spectra of the feed as well as the permeate were taken to find out the wavelength at which the organic matter was present in pome and they were found to be 230 and 270 nm the absorbance of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was noted at these two wavelengths this can indirectly give us an insight into how much organic matter has been removed from the pome by membrane filtration the absorbance of permeate at different times is shown in fig 16 a and b the absorbance of all the membranes kept on decreasing till pm 5 for pm 6 performance was reduced as the high porosity causes the selectivity to decrease at both wavelengths pm 5 and pm 4 were observed to be showing excellent separation properties to study the separating performance of the membranes rejection percentage of the membrane was found from table 7 it is noticed that as the filler concentration was increased from 0 to 2 5 the percentage rejection kept on increasing till pm 5 this suggests that the adsorption capacity of the membranmaximum rejection percentage is obtained for membrane corresponding to a filler percentage of 2 for pm 6 although the permeate flux is high rejection was decreased due to larger pore size thus the optimum filler percentage has to be fixed for better performances more filler content can cause more openings in the membrane and less rejection percentage fig 17 shows the feed and permeates samples 3 7 2 cod removal cod of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown below in fig 18 according to disposal standards cod limit should be less than 100 mg l 1 for three membranes it was possible to achieve this range water reclamation for drinking is possible from pome if drinking water standards are achieved for the permeate collected after membrane treatment if membrane modules are connected in series cod can be brought down to zero as the separation progressed membranes got clogged and very less organic material permeated through the membrane causing a decrease in cod over time 3 7 3 bod removal bod of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown below in fig 19 according to disposal standards bod limit should be less than 25 mg l 1 for three membranes it was possible to achieve this range due to the clogging of pores less biological content was permeated over time and thus bod decreased with time biological contents are the main reason for the pollution of water if these agents are removed using membrane technology water recovery from membrane treatment is a highly promising technology 3 7 4 turbidity measurement the turbidity of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown in fig 20 the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 ntu and should ideally be below 1 ntu 22 results of pm 4 and pm 5 shows that drinking standards can be achieved by optimizing the filler content on the membrane 3 7 5 total solids content the total solid content of permeate articulates the amount of organic content in the effluent fig 21 shows how the total solid content is changing with different membranes total solid content consists of suspended solids and dissolved solids this is the polluting agent in pome removal of total solids alone can make the permeate meets drinking water standards for pm 6 the solids content was reduced to 450 mg l which is the lowest we achieved the total solid content of permeate had decreased with time as the organic content permeated through the membrane reduced with clogging of pores 3 7 6 conductivity of permeate the conductivity of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown in fig 22 the conductivity of drinking water should not be more than 50 μs 21 the conductivity of the permeate is the indirect measure of pollutants in the permeate conductivity value can infer to the amount of ions in the permeate from fig 22 it can be observed that the conductivity of the permeate kept on decreasing with increase in filler content till pm 5 for pm 6 there is an exception due to the enlargement of pores for pm 5 conductivity was reduced to less than 50 μs 3 7 7 fouling of membrane fouling was one of the main problems encountered during pome treatment after the separation a fouling layer was developed on the membrane surface membranes were analyzed using ftir for the changes in functional groups presented on the surface of the membrane before and after effluent separation fig 23 shows ftir of pm 3 before and after treatment the changes in peaks were noted down to analyze the functional groups present in the cake deposited on the membrane surface for the fouled membrane at 1753 co bond is observed which indicates the presence of fatty acid from palm oil fig 24 shows the images of the membrane before and after separation visual examination can convey to us how much organic matter is deposited on the membrane during separation the decline in flux was due to the development of this fouling layer 3 7 7 1 cross flow filtration method separation has been conducted in the cross flow mode to compare the performance of membrane in both the modes permeate was collected every 10 min water flux was found before separating effluent water flux is given in fig 25 water flux was evaluated to find out intrinsic membrane resistance of all the membranes water flux of the membranes was observed to keep on increasing with increase in filler content this is due to the increase in porosity of the membrane as filler content makes the membrane more porous however more porosity can lead to a decrease in selectivity compared to dead end filtration in cross flow filtration the water flux was more this is due to the increase in effective area the intrinsic resistance of the membranes was calculated and tabulated below table 8 intrinsic resistance kept on decreasing with increase in filler content due to higher porosity diffusion through pores require less activation energy and that makes the membrane less resistant compared to dead end filtration resistance was decreased as the flux is higher for cross flow method all the membranes were observed to be having less resistance in the case of cross flow in comparison with dead end resistances after finding out the water flux using pome as the feed the permeate flux of the membrane was found and is shown in fig 26 with time the permeate flux kept decreasing and after some time it became constant this is due to the clogging of pores due to fouling the organic material deposited on the membrane reduced the flux however the reduction in flux due to clogging of pores was much less than that of what has been observed from dead end filtration with the same membranes absorbance spectra of the feed as well as permeate was taken to find out the wavelength at which the organic matter is present in pome and they were found to be 230 and 270 nm the absorbance of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was noted at these two wavelengths this can indirectly give us an insight into how much organic matter has been removed from the pome by membrane filtration the absorbance of permeate at different time period is shown in figs 27 and 28 the absorbance of all membranes kept on decreasing till pm 5 for pm 6 performance was reduced as the high porosity causes the selectivity to decrease as the separation progressed pores got clogged due to the presence of organic matter this resulted in a highly selective permeation and the collected permeate thus had a low organic content corresponding to a lower absorbance at both wavelengths pm 5 and pm 4 were observed to be showing excellent separation properties to study the separating performance of the membranes rejection percentage of the membrane was found it is tabulated below table 9 maximum rejection percentage was obtained for the membrane corresponding to a filler percentage of 2 for pm 6 although the permeate flux is high rejection is reduced this can be as a result of high porosity thus the optimum filler percentage has to be fixed for better performances more filler content can cause more openings in the membrane and less rejection percentage 4 conclusions advanced nanocomposite fillers from silver nanoparticles and hydroxyapatite nanotubes were developed by coating hydroxyapatite nanotubes with silver nanoparticles silver nanoparticles were chemically synthesized and were coated on commercially obtained hydroxyapatite nano tubes for pome treatment composite membranes fabricated from polyphenylsulfone and the prepared fillers were found to be exhibiting homogenous structures with satisfactory structural and morphological properties indicating that membranes fit the prerequisites for further developments toward industrial applications treatment of pome as an approach to achieve high percentage reduction was accomplished by 91 3 of total solids and 89 3 of bod by the prepared membranes the filler percentage and filtration mode had a direct effect on the permeate fluxes of membranes the development of a fouling layer was observed from the decline in flux with filtration time for all composite membranes a 50 60 flux reduction was obtained this phenomenon might be due to the existence of a fouling layer that acted as another resistance layer the steady state of the permeate flux was reached after the fouling layer was fully established increasing filler concentration led to an increase in steady state fluxes for the percentage rejection study mode of filtration and filler content had an influence on suspended solids rejection however in removing dissolved organic matter analyzed through cod and bod the composite membrane illustrated a significant effect of filler content on the percentage rejection of cod and bod ranged from 10 to 90 high filler content resulted in a higher porosity of the membrane and membrane with a filler composition of 2 exhibited better results compared to the rest of the membranes fillers were the key factors that altered the membrane characteristics enhancing the separation efficiency of the membrane they were in good agreement with what has been reported in the past composite membranes effectively removed all the organic matter present in the pome and the separation efficiency of the membrane was so high that it showed potential for industrial applications 
14336,nano composite ultra filtration membranes were developed for the treatment of palm oil mill effluent pome silver nano particle was synthesized and was used to coat hydroxyapatite nanotubes this coated nano filler was used as filler for the polyphenylsulfone ppsu membrane the filler composition in the membrane was varied from 0 to 2 5 wt to investigate the effect of fillers on the separation properties of the membrane both dead end and cross flow techniques were used for the separation characterization techniques such as contact angle analysis particle size analyzer xrd sem were used to analyze both nanoparticles as well as the nano composite membranes parameters like cod bod turbidity suspended solids ph conductivity and tds of the permeate were studied change in intrinsic membrane resistance with respect to filler composition was also studied based on the results the membrane having a filler composition of 2 was found to be exhibiting excellent properties compared to other membranes in terms of separation performances the rejection percentage of ppsu membrane with a filler content of 2 was 89 74 the composite membrane had shown promising results by removing all the organic matter present in the pome and can be further developed into a pilot plant keywords polyphenylsulfone palm oil mill effluent hydroxyapatite silver nano particle 1 introduction water essential to life is drying up around the world water scarcity is one of the alarming challenges that the modern world face today water shortages deterioration of water quality and environmental constraints have led to an augmented interest in recovering and recycling water in many parts of the world this shortage of water drives people to recycle the effluents from different fields such as agricultural effluents plantation effluents industrial and farming effluents 1 plantation effluents include effluents from palm oil mills rubber plantations coconut mills etc palm oil is one of the world s most rapidly expanding crops and is derived from the fleshy mesocarp of the fruit of oil palm elaeis gunineensis one hectare of oil palm produces about 10 35 tonnes of fresh fruit bunches ffb per year 2 while the palm oil industry has been known for development it has also contributed to environmental pollution due to the production of huge quantities of byproducts from the oil extraction process 3 the byproducts include oil palm trunks opt oil palm fronds opf empty fruit bunches efb palm pressed fibres ppf and liquid discharge palm oil mill effluent pome 2 4 5 according to yacob et al about 30 million tonnes of palm oil mill effluent pome was produced in malaysia in the year 2004 6 pome consists of 95 96 water 0 6 0 7 oil and 4 5 solids 1 it has high turbidity and color resulting from high organic matter content suspended solids and a trace amount of minerals and heavy metals 7 this organic content makes pome unfit for drinking if not treated therefore a proper treatment method to remove the organic matter minerals and heavy metals is required in the recycling of drinking water from pome currently novel technologies such as microfiltration ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration and reverse osmosis ro are showing high performance in the treatment of water compared to conventional treatments the main advantages of membranes technology are energy efficiency compact module quality

immersed into a coagulation bath where the exchange of solvent and non solvent took place and the membrane was formed the silver hydroxyapatite incorporated ppsu solution was poured on a smooth glass plate and spread with the help of a metal rod to produce a thin film membrane of 250 μm thickness after casting the membrane on the glass plate it was immersed into a gelation bath the gelation bath was prepared prior to the casting of the membrane it consists of 4 wt sls solution and during casting the bath temperature was brought down to 5 c once they were immersed in gelation bath the

experiments were carried out in a cross flow flat frame membrane module model pleiade rayflows orelis environment sas france with a filtration area of 100 cm2 at a temperature of 26 c and a controller to set the pressure at a transmembrane pressure of 200 kpa the cross flow ultrafiltration module is shown in fig 1 the experiments were conducted in a continuous mode where the permeate was continuously collected and measured in a measuring cylinder the retentate coming out of the membrane module was recycled back to the feed tank the permeate flux as well as the water flux was calculated by the equation given below eq 2 2 j w q a δ t where jw l m2h is the membrane flux a m2 is the effective area of the membrane surface q l is the volume collected and δt is the time interval

the membranes it is calculated by the formula given below eq 4 4 j k p r m 3 results and discussions 3 1 confirmation silver nanoparticle different analysis techniques were used to confirm the presence and characterize the prepared silver nanoparticles these confirmation analyses were performed before coating the hydroxyapatite nanotubes they are described in detail as follows 3 1 1 uv vis spectroscopy uv visible spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for structural characterization of silver nanoparticles it is quite sensitive to the presence of silver colloids because these nanoparticles exhibit an absorption peak due to the surface plasmon excitation the absorption band in the 350 nm 450 nm region is typical for the silver nanoparticles 18 the absorption spectra of the colloidal solution of silver are shown in fig 3 the spectra exhibit a plasmon absorption band at 400 nm which is the characteristic of silver nanoparticles such plasmon bands are unique physical properties of the nanoparticles themselves thus using uv spectroscopy the presence of silver nanoparticles was confirmed the identification of silver nanoparticles was based on surface plasmon resonance phenomenon the penetration depth was found to be directly proportional to the exciting wavelength i e 325 nm because of decreased absorbance which is in accordance with li et al 19 nanoparticles with absorbance in the range of 350 nm 450 nm were used for coating hydroxyapatite nanotubes 3 1 2 x ray diffraction xrd xrd was used as a secondary confirmation for the silver particles peaks were obtained according to reported data 18 these findings once again confirm the presence of nanoparticles the interplanar distance d spaces were measured using bragg s law and are illustrated in fig 4 their values ranged between 1 3 å the pattern clearly shows the main peaks at 2θ 38 44 64 and 77 corresponding to the 111 200 220 and 311 planes respectively by comparing jcods file no 89 3722 the typical pattern of chemical synthesized silver nanoparticles was found to possess an fcc structure 19 3 1 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir further confirmation was carried out by ftir the ftir spectra obtained was compared with the standard ir frequencies table 20 the spectra of silver exhibited a high intensity broad band at 1720 oh due to the stretching of the hydrogen and oxygen bond and at 1230 no fig 5 due to nitrogen oxygen stretch bond the functional groups obtained were in good agreement with what has been observed from reported data 18 by this analysis the particles that were prepared were confirmed to be silver nanoparticles 3 2 confirmation of silver coated hydroxyapatite after confirming the presence of silver nanoparticles it was used as a coating for hydroxyapatite nanotubes the presence of coated hydroxyapatite particles was confirmed and their structure was studied based on the following studies 3 2 1 x ray diffraction xrd xrd was used as a secondary confirmation for the silver particles peaks were obtained according to reported data 20 this peak gave us further confirmation on the presence of nanoparticles the interplanar distance d spaces were measured using bragg s law and are illustrated in fig 6 their values are ranged between 1 5 3 5 å the pattern clearly shows the main peaks at 2θ 26 33 49 and 54 corresponding to the 110 202 223 and 313 planes respectively these reported data clearly proved the presence of silver coated hydroxyapatite nanotubes 3 2 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir ftir was used for added confirmation of the coated nanotubes and is shown in fig 7 the obtained spectra were compared with the standard ir frequencies table 20 it showed peaks at 1735 o h and 1020 n o and by comparing with reported data the particles that were prepared were confirmed to be silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite nanotubes 21 3 2 3 particle size analysis of nanotubes in order to find out the size distribution of the coated nano tubes prepared particle size analysis was carried out fig 8 shows the size distribution of nanoparticles and they were having a median and mean size of 20 7 nm 33 16 nm respectively mode size and standard deviations were 12 378 μm and 32 5125 μm respectively about 60 of particles were under the size of 20 μm 3 3 effect of filler concentration on hydrophilicity and porosity of the membrane contact angle analysis was performed to study the influence of filler concentration on the hydrophilicity of the membrane table 2 shows the contact angle of each membrane and how the filler concentration changes the angle data the contact angle was decreased by almost 35 with an increase in filler composition indicating the increase in the hydrophilic nature of the membrane fig 9 hydrophilicity helps to decrease the membrane fouling caused by the organic matter present in the effluent hence the effect of filler on the hydrophilicity of the composite membrane was tested to study the influence of nano material in the membrane from table 2 it is clear that as filler content was increased the hydrophilic nature of the composite membranes was also improved which in turn results in a rise in the amount of water absorbed this can be explained by the presence of hydroxyapatite group in the membrane which alters the membrane surface properties the porosity of the membranes was calculated by the eq 1 the results of the test are tabulated in table 3 the porosity kept on increasing with increase in filler content because the presence of fillers makes the membrane more porous by opening up its pores from this test we can confirm that the membranes prepared were hydrophilic in nature and as the concentration of the inorganic fillers goes on increasing the membrane water absorption capacity and porosity also increases wettability of filler may aﬀ ect the adsorbed fouling agent in pome and enhance the material interactions results indicate that the silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite ppsu membranes have hydrophilic surfaces with contact angles less than 82 and pm 6 have the lowest contact angle and highest filler content 3 4 effect of filler concentration on the mechanical strength of the membrane the effect of filler concentration on the mechanical stability of the membrane is tabulated in table 4 the material strength of the membranes prepared was studied by performing stress strain tests the samples of the membranes were cut into dimensions of length 30 mm and width 10 mm the initial gauge length was set at 20 mm the data was recorded for respective samples and tabulated in table 4 it was observed that as the concentration of fillers in the membranes increased the ultimate force the membranes could withstand first kept on increasing and then started to decrease the membrane with a filler concentration of 1 5 was observed to be the most mechanically stable membrane initially the presence of fillers made the membrane more mechanically stable however when the filler content went beyond 1 5 the membrane became more porous compromising the structural stability of the membrane 3 5 confirmation of presence of nanomaterial in membrane different analysis techniques were used to confirm the presence of nanomaterial in the membrane functional groups that were present in the silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite are shown in fig 5 the spectra of silver nanoparticle coated hydroxyapatite ppsu membranes are shown in fig 10 at 1735 oh oxygen hydrogen stretch bond is present which confirms the presence of silver coated hydroxyapatite nanotubes whereas the band at 1230 no nitrogen oxygen double bond confirms the presence of silver nanoparticles all the membranes except the virgin membrane exhibited these peaks 3 5 1 sem edax of the composite membrane fig 11 a shows the top surface of pm 4 and fig 11 b shows the different elements present in that membrane the sem image shows a defect free smooth surface of the membrane out of all the elements present in the membrane as observed in the result calcium and phosphor are highest in content these elements are present in the hydroxyapatite compound with this analysis we can conclude that the membrane is having the prepared fillers and they were not leached out of the membrane before they were used for separation 3 6 morphological characteristics of the membrane the top surface and cross sectional sem images are shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively it shows a smooth and defects free surface without any deformation compared to the composite membrane virgin membrane is less porous and the membrane formed is found to be very dense and the same can be inferred from table 3 where the porosity of the membranes are tabulated virgin membrane i e pm 01 was found to be having a porosity of 0 768 and pm 06 was having a porosity of 0 921 this less porosity is the main factor that reduces the rejection percentage of the virgin membrane during pome treatment cross sectional images show the honey comb like structure of composite membranes fig 4 11 the thickness of pm 04 was found to be 250 μm the varying porosity which we had found earlier is picturized here from figs 12 and 13 we can observe how the porosity is varying from a less porous virgin membrane to a composite membrane which is rich in pores this porosity helps to achieve a higher flux and permeability during separation processes 3 7 treatment of palm oil mill effluent characteristics of the collected pome are tabulated in table 4 4 the effluent was collected from parison s palm oil kerala india and was filtered using filter paper to remove the suspended solids all the parameters were estimated after filtration table 5 3 7 1 ultrafiltration of pome in dead end filtration module the transmembrane pressure was set at 8 bar and the temperature at 26 c the diameter of the membrane was 5 cm permeate was collected every 10 min water flux was found before separating effluent water flux is given in fig 14 water flux was determined to find out intrinsic membrane resistance of all the membranes water flux of the membranes was observed to keep on increasing with increase in filler content and for pm 06 it reached up to 57 l hm2 this is due to the increase in porosity of the membrane as filler content makes the membrane more porous the intrinsic resistance of the membranes was calculated and tabulated below table 6 intrinsic resistance kept on decreasing from 19 178 kpahm2 l to 13 011 kpahm2 l with an increase in filler content due to higher porosity diffusion through pores require less activation energy and that makes the membrane less resistant and pm 6 was found to be having minimum intrinsic resistance and maximum porosity 0 921 after finding out the water flux using pome as the feed the permeate flux of the membrane was found and is shown in fig 15 with time the permeate flux kept decreasing and after some time it became constant this is due to the clogging of pores due to fouling the organic material deposited on the membrane reduces the pome flux over the passing of time absorbance spectra of the feed as well as the permeate were taken to find out the wavelength at which the organic matter was present in pome and they were found to be 230 and 270 nm the absorbance of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was noted at these two wavelengths this can indirectly give us an insight into how much organic matter has been removed from the pome by membrane filtration the absorbance of permeate at different times is shown in fig 16 a and b the absorbance of all the membranes kept on decreasing till pm 5 for pm 6 performance was reduced as the high porosity causes the selectivity to decrease at both wavelengths pm 5 and pm 4 were observed to be showing excellent separation properties to study the separating performance of the membranes rejection percentage of the membrane was found from table 7 it is noticed that as the filler concentration was increased from 0 to 2 5 the percentage rejection kept on increasing till pm 5 this suggests that the adsorption capacity of the membranmaximum rejection percentage is obtained for membrane corresponding to a filler percentage of 2 for pm 6 although the permeate flux is high rejection was decreased due to larger pore size thus the optimum filler percentage has to be fixed for better performances more filler content can cause more openings in the membrane and less rejection percentage fig 17 shows the feed and permeates samples 3 7 2 cod removal cod of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown below in fig 18 according to disposal standards cod limit should be less than 100 mg l 1 for three membranes it was possible to achieve this range water reclamation for drinking is possible from pome if drinking water standards are achieved for the permeate collected after membrane treatment if membrane modules are connected in series cod can be brought down to zero as the separation progressed membranes got clogged and very less organic material permeated through the membrane causing a decrease in cod over time 3 7 3 bod removal bod of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown below in fig 19 according to disposal standards bod limit should be less than 25 mg l 1 for three membranes it was possible to achieve this range due to the clogging of pores less biological content was permeated over time and thus bod decreased with time biological contents are the main reason for the pollution of water if these agents are removed using membrane technology water recovery from membrane treatment is a highly promising technology 3 7 4 turbidity measurement the turbidity of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown in fig 20 the turbidity of drinking water should not be more than 5 ntu and should ideally be below 1 ntu 22 results of pm 4 and pm 5 shows that drinking standards can be achieved by optimizing the filler content on the membrane 3 7 5 total solids content the total solid content of permeate articulates the amount of organic content in the effluent fig 21 shows how the total solid content is changing with different membranes total solid content consists of suspended solids and dissolved solids this is the polluting agent in pome removal of total solids alone can make the permeate meets drinking water standards for pm 6 the solids content was reduced to 450 mg l which is the lowest we achieved the total solid content of permeate had decreased with time as the organic content permeated through the membrane reduced with clogging of pores 3 7 6 conductivity of permeate the conductivity of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was plotted and shown in fig 22 the conductivity of drinking water should not be more than 50 μs 21 the conductivity of the permeate is the indirect measure of pollutants in the permeate conductivity value can infer to the amount of ions in the permeate from fig 22 it can be observed that the conductivity of the permeate kept on decreasing with increase in filler content till pm 5 for pm 6 there is an exception due to the enlargement of pores for pm 5 conductivity was reduced to less than 50 μs 3 7 7 fouling of membrane fouling was one of the main problems encountered during pome treatment after the separation a fouling layer was developed on the membrane surface membranes were analyzed using ftir for the changes in functional groups presented on the surface of the membrane before and after effluent separation fig 23 shows ftir of pm 3 before and after treatment the changes in peaks were noted down to analyze the functional groups present in the cake deposited on the membrane surface for the fouled membrane at 1753 co bond is observed which indicates the presence of fatty acid from palm oil fig 24 shows the images of the membrane before and after separation visual examination can convey to us how much organic matter is deposited on the membrane during separation the decline in flux was due to the development of this fouling layer 3 7 7 1 cross flow filtration method separation has been conducted in the cross flow mode to compare the performance of membrane in both the modes permeate was collected every 10 min water flux was found before separating effluent water flux is given in fig 25 water flux was evaluated to find out intrinsic membrane resistance of all the membranes water flux of the membranes was observed to keep on increasing with increase in filler content this is due to the increase in porosity of the membrane as filler content makes the membrane more porous however more porosity can lead to a decrease in selectivity compared to dead end filtration in cross flow filtration the water flux was more this is due to the increase in effective area the intrinsic resistance of the membranes was calculated and tabulated below table 8 intrinsic resistance kept on decreasing with increase in filler content due to higher porosity diffusion through pores require less activation energy and that makes the membrane less resistant compared to dead end filtration resistance was decreased as the flux is higher for cross flow method all the membranes were observed to be having less resistance in the case of cross flow in comparison with dead end resistances after finding out the water flux using pome as the feed the permeate flux of the membrane was found and is shown in fig 26 with time the permeate flux kept decreasing and after some time it became constant this is due to the clogging of pores due to fouling the organic material deposited on the membrane reduced the flux however the reduction in flux due to clogging of pores was much less than that of what has been observed from dead end filtration with the same membranes absorbance spectra of the feed as well as permeate was taken to find out the wavelength at which the organic matter is present in pome and they were found to be 230 and 270 nm the absorbance of permeate collected at different time intervals for each membrane was noted at these two wavelengths this can indirectly give us an insight into how much organic matter has been removed from the pome by membrane filtration the absorbance of permeate at different time period is shown in figs 27 and 28 the absorbance of all membranes kept on decreasing till pm 5 for pm 6 performance was reduced as the high porosity causes the selectivity to decrease as the separation progressed pores got clogged due to the presence of organic matter this resulted in a highly selective permeation and the collected permeate thus had a low organic content corresponding to a lower absorbance at both wavelengths pm 5 and pm 4 were observed to be showing excellent separation properties to study the separating performance of the membranes rejection percentage of the membrane was found it is tabulated below table 9 maximum rejection percentage was obtained for the membrane corresponding to a filler percentage of 2 for pm 6 although the permeate flux is high rejection is reduced this can be as a result of high porosity thus the optimum filler percentage has to be fixed for better performances more filler content can cause more openings in the membrane and less rejection percentage 4 conclusions advanced nanocomposite fillers from silver nanoparticles and hydroxyapatite nanotubes were developed by coating hydroxyapatite nanotubes with silver nanoparticles silver nanoparticles were chemically synthesized and were coated on commercially obtained hydroxyapatite nano tubes for pome treatment composite membranes fabricated from polyphenylsulfone and the prepared fillers were found to be exhibiting homogenous structures with satisfactory structural and morphological properties indicating that membranes fit the prerequisites for further developments toward industrial applications treatment of pome as an approach to achieve high percentage reduction was accomplished by 91 3 of total solids and 89 3 of bod by the prepared membranes the filler percentage and filtration mode had a direct effect on the permeate fluxes of membranes the development of a fouling layer was observed from the decline in flux with filtration time for all composite membranes a 50 60 flux reduction was obtained this phenomenon might be due to the existence of a fouling layer that acted as another resistance layer the steady state of the permeate flux was reached after the fouling layer was fully established increasing filler concentration led to an increase in steady state fluxes for the percentage rejection study mode of filtration and filler content had an influence on suspended solids rejection however in removing dissolved organic matter analyzed through cod and bod the composite membrane illustrated a significant effect of filler content on the percentage rejection of cod and bod ranged from 10 to 90 high filler content resulted in a higher porosity of the membrane and membrane with a filler composition of 2 exhibited better results compared to the rest of the membranes fillers were the key factors that altered the membrane characteristics enhancing the separation efficiency of the membrane they were in good agreement with what has been reported in the past composite membranes effectively removed all the organic matter present in the pome and the separation efficiency of the membrane was so high that it showed potential for industrial applications

effects on human and environment however advancement in newly budding and fangled nanotechnology offers better treatment techniques development of novel and cost effective 0d 1d 2d and 3d nanomaterials for environmental remediation pollution detection and other applications has attracted considerable attention zero valent iron and iron oxide nanoparticles are found to be the best candidates for heavy metal adsorption and removal various mechanical optical and electrical properties of nanoparticles play important role in nanoparticle formation and interaction forms of iron oxide such as hematite α fe2o3 and magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles of varied morphology and size 10 nm 20 nm 50 nm etc were synthesized by various methods like sol gel precipitation hydrothermal processes and magnetic nano composites with different iron precursors iron acetate iron nitrate ferric chloride ferrous sulphate etc iron oxide nanoparticles in a variety of chemical and structural

removal keywords nanotechnology nanoparticles iron oxide heavy metal and adsorption 1 introduction heavy metals are the metallic elements which have a relatively high density heavy metals are capable of inducing toxicity even at lower levels on exposure due to the heavy metal contamination in the environment there has been a progressive concern about ecology and public health in the last few decades there is an emerging progress in agricultural industrial and urban activities leading to the increased pollution up to many folds burning of fossil fuels municipal wastes fertilizers mining and smelting of metallic ferrous ores pesticides and sewage sludge are the primary sources of pollution 1 2 the environmental protection agency epa has set maximum contaminant level mcls as a standard for drinking water quality pollutants present above these levels have adverse health effects 3 cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu lead pb nickel ni and zinc zn are among most common heavy metal contaminants of industrial pollution heavy metals are a class of persistent toxic substances ptss have acute toxicity and accumulation effects on living beings 4 5 fig 1 heavy metals have deleterious effects on the human health and environment by entering into the food chain although heavy metals occur naturally in the earth crust but the anthropogenic activities have increased the heavy metal content and results in the environmental contamination however these anthropogenic sources are battery production phosphate fertilizer alloy production textiles sewage irrigation atmospheric deposition mining biosolids improper stacking of industrial solid waste coating explosive manufacturing leather tanning pesticides printing pigments smelting steel and electroplating industries photographic materials dyes and wood preservation 6 7 heavy metals such as cobalt co copper cu chromium cr iron fe magnesium mg zinc zn selenium se manganese mn nickel ni and molybdenum mo are considered to be the essential trace elements for the biochemical and physiological functioning other than these metals all are considered as non essential metals but if these metals are present beyond their tolerance value they can have deleterious effects on the environment and human health it was found that large quantity of lead present in potable water can cause cancer renal kidney disease anemia nervous disorders etc metals such as arsenic 8 10 cadmium 11 chromium 12 13 lead 14 15 and mercury 16 17 are categorized under the prime concern metals which are important to public health hence due to their high grade toxicity they can induce multiple organ damage on exposure to even low concentrations according to the united states environmental protection agency u s epa and the international agency for research on cancer iarc the metals like mercury chromium cadmium arsenic and lead are categorized as either known or probable human carcinogens on the basis of their epidemiological and experimental studies so there have been many technologies to cope up with increasing heavy metal pollution by adopting remediation technologies there are many conventional methods adopted for the heavy metal removal in waste water 18 some of the techniques for waste removal includes biosorption 19 rubber tire activated carbon rtac 20 activated carbon adsorption 21 but these methods have some of the limitations however in recent years nanotechnology has fangled its roots in environmental remediation size dependent properties of nanoparticles nps put forward countless opportunities towards miscellaneous applications in the technical era this field with particle size from micro to nanoscale has received considerable global attention with an increasing demand towards nanomaterials 22 a series of heavy metals have been scavenging by nanomaterials due to their large surface area and high reactivity moreover trending nano metal oxides such as nanosized ferric oxides aluminum oxides manganese oxides magnesium oxides titanium oxides and cerium oxides endow with high surface area and unambiguous affinity for absorbing heavy metal from aqueous systems 23 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been effectively used for treating water and wastewater polluted with chlorinated organic compounds 24 heavy metals including chromium 25 cadmium 25 copper 26 silver 26 zinc 26 27 dyes 28 and phenol 29 this review comes up with the view point of researchers working on nanotechnology to deal with water and waste water problems it also focuses on magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and their efficiency in heavy metal elimination 2 concept of nanotechnology nanotechnology is the art and science of manipulating matter at the nanoscale fig 2 down to 1 100 000 the width of a human hair to create new and unique materials and products the history of modern nanotechnology begins with richard feynman s lecture in 1959 there s plenty of room at the bottom in the conference of american physical society 30 nanotechnology has almost revolutionized the concept of scientific and technological implications in environmental safety the proficient and perceptive implementation of nanotechnology in environment is for water remediation and treatment modern nanotechnology provides nanomaterial application for decontamination of water through various mechanisms such as elimination of heavy metals and related pollutants eradication and dormancy of pathogens and conversion of highly toxic substances to least toxic for the development of new adsorbent with unique characteristics nanotechnology played a crucial role and has opened a new area in order to remediate toxic and harmful substances engineering offers new opportunities by adapting more advanced nanotechnological tools as compared to conventional processes by developing highly sophisticated methods for wastewater treatment 31 2 1 nanomaterials building blocks of nanotechnology in recent times a range of engineered nanomaterials e g nanoparticles quantum dots nanomembranes nanowires nanosheets nanotubes etc have been delineated which has been used in miscellaneous disciplines 32 39 the first classification idea of nsms nanoscale materials was given by gleiter in 1995 40 and further was explained by skorokhod in 2000 41 but gleiter and skorokhod system of classification was not well thought out as 0d 1d 2d and 3d structures such as fullerenes nanotubes and nanoflowers were not explained properly hence pokropivny and skorokhod 42 formulated an advanced classification system for nsms in which 0d 1d 2d and 3d nsms are included according to them zero dimensional 0 d nanomaterials are not confined to the nanoscale range 100 nm they can be one dimensional 1 d two dimensional 2 d fig 3 c and three dimensional 3 d the most general representation of zero dimensional fig 3a nanomaterials is nanoparticles these materials have every dimension within the nanoscale no dimensions or 0 d below 100 nm a one dimension fig 3b nanomaterial ranges out of nanoscale they consist of needle like nanostructures for instance nanotubes nanorods and nanowires however in two dimensional nanomaterials two of the dimensions are not confined to the nanoscale which includes nanofilms nanolayers and nanocoating s three dimensional nanomaterials or bulk nanomaterials are not restricted to the nanoscale in any of the dimension thus specified by their three erratic dimensions higher than 100 nm nanocrystalline structure or bulk nanomaterials can comprise of a numerous position of nanosized crystals usually in diverse orientations 43 surfaces and interfaces are of great significance to new nanomaterials as the particle size decreases fraction of surface atoms multiplies in comparison with inside volume 44 in addition to size shape also affects the various properties as it changes the exposed crystal facets by altering the atomic arrangement in each facet which ultimately exerts tremendous impact on their properties 45 most of the micro structured materials have interrelated properties to the corresponding bulk materials while the nanomaterials have significantly different properties from those of atoms and bulk materials the basis behind such behavior is the nonorange of materials which provides them with high number of surface atoms spatial confinement high surface energy and reduced imperfections which is not found in the corresponding bulk materials nanomaterials with a sequence of distinctive properties i e small size effect surface effect and quantum size effect have fascinated the consideration of researchers 46 48 due to the small size effect of nanomaterials they demonstrate exceptional fundamental functions like low temperature sensing excellent catalytic activities and high sensitivity 46 38 due to their surface effect they possess high reaction efficiency and strong adsorption capability 47 49 quantum size effect can endure nanomaterials with exceptional optical and electronic properties 50 engineered nanomaterials as the supporter catalysts comprehend the segregation of the products and the catalysts from the reaction mixture and they play significant role in the field of catalysis 51 52 the magnetic nanoparticles the catalyst supporter in organic synthesis can be reused by recovering the catalysts with an external magnet without losing their activity 53 55 furthermore other methods such as filtration and centrifugation can also be accepted for the recovery of catalysts 55 56 51 metals in nano range as an imperative area of engineered nanomaterials demonstrate possible applications 57 60 for example metallic nanoparticles can be used as efficient catalysts nanoparticles based chemical sensors and nanowires have enhanced the sensitivity and sensor selectivity it is believed that nanomaterials with their internal structure at nanoscale dimensions are hardly something new to science perhaps the particle size is not the only feature of a nanomaterial nanocrystal or nanoparticle however the vital and precise property of various nanomaterials is the bulk of atoms localized on the surface of a particle in addition to commonplace materials where atoms are dispersed around majority of a particle alternatively the process of formation and aggregation of nanomaterials is mainly depending upon the various magnetic electrical optical and mechanical properties fig 4 at the nanoscale extremely attractive properties are created due to quantum effects dominance of interfacial phenomena and size confinement these novel and exceptional properties of nanostructured materials nanoparticles and other related nanotechnologies results in improved catalysts increased strength tunable photoactivity and many other interesting characteristics 61 62 2 2 nanoparticles particles can be segregated on the basis of their size in requisites of diameter fine particles are in between 100 and 2500 nm conversely ultrafine particles have size between 1 and 100 nm similarly particles within the range of 1 100 nanometers are categorized as nanoparticles they are unique as their physical behavior shifts from classical physics to quantum physics with declining particle size nanoparticles can exist in solid liquid or gaseous state a nanoparticle when assumed like a ball in shape which has a radius of 2 5 nm density of 5 g cm3 and surface area 240 m2 g it means that about 20 of the particle atoms are localized on the surface however the surface of a nanoparticle is never naked due to high energetic adhesive forces close to the surface the particles are either aggregated to their neighbors glued to the next available surface or work like an activated charcoal filter towards other small molecules 44 nanoparticles could show size related properties that vary considerably from those of fine particles or bulk materials 63 worldwide metal nanoparticles have also fascinated the interest of the researchers due to their unique electronic optical and catalytic and several other structural features at nanoscale materials shows elevated catalytic properties high surface area and greater active sites to intermingle with metallic species 64 65 various methods are used for the synthesis of nanoparticles such as physical chemical and biological methods top down and bottom up approaches also the methods of nanoparticle synthesis fig 5 previously top down approach was used widely which employed the use of physical and chemical means to reduce the bulk material into nanosized 66 but such methodologies are associated with large amount of materials and energy consumption hence are not preferred now days bottom up approach has become more popular and is used at laboratory scales the top down approach fundamentally deals with bulk material then reduced to nanoscale by specialized ablations e g sputtering thermal decomposition mechanical milling laser ablation etching and lithography 67 contrarily second one is the bottom up approach most preferably considered for nanoparticles synthesis which involves a homogeneous system where catalysts e g reducing agent and enzymes produce nanostructures that are restricted by catalyst properties reaction media and conditions e g solvents stabilizers and temperature the above mentioned two methods differs in a matter that top down method usually leads to crystalline samples for instance small single crystals or polycrystalline material formed from previous thermodynamically starting material in a crystalline solid a thermodynamically formed product usually complies with the ideal crystal structure of the specific compound e g nacl cscl rutile and corundum structures alternatively bottom up route outcomes with the formation of minute particles from crystalline areas that do not correspond to the ideal lattice defect structure these structures are difficult to illustrate and are typical kinetic products i e products that don t have sufficient time for an ideal crystal growth 68 therefore a kinetic product leads to a defect structure which is also referred to as a real structure in literature such defect or real structures are classified according to different defect classes 0 dimensional defects non stoichiometry 1 dimensional defects dislocations 2 dimensional defects grain boundaries and 3 dimensional defects pores 69 there are various techniques which are used to characterize nanomaterials synthesis of nps is confirmed by employing uv vis spectro photometry which is then followed by centrifugation of mixture and drying the pellet in a hot air oven to get the crystal nps 70 synthesized nanoparticles are further characterized using x ray diffractometer xrd energy dispersion

diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs and dynamic light scattering dls 70 71 nanoparticles are composed of assemblies of atoms and molecules in nanometer scale and are more advantageous than their bulk counterparts because of their high surface to volume ratio so their application in varied sectors can play a counter role to improve the current situation of health and environment 2 3 iron nanoparticles due to the high reduction and adsorption capacity of nanoscale zero valent metals nzvms it represents the cutting edge of technologies which is thought to be the potential materials for environmental remediation and antimicrobial effect since 1980s nanoscale zero valent metals have fascinated science as a category of efficient reducers for removing contaminants in water iron has a standard redox potential of 0 44 v e0 0 44 v it is thus an effective reductant when reacting with oxidized pollutants in water 72 its core shell structures fig 6 are advantageous for heavy metal elimination and transformation the metallic core acts as an electron source and acts as the reducing character whereas the oxide shell can absorb the pollutants via electrostatic interactions as well as surface complexation and the proficient electron can transfer from the metallic core to the surface 73 the core mainly consists of zero valent iron and provides the reducing power for reactions with environmental contaminants the shell is comprising of iron oxides hydroxides as result of oxidation of zero valent iron the shell forms the platform for chemical complex formation e g chemisorption 74 the thickness of outer iron oxide and inner core of fe0 was observed to be 10 and 20 nm respectively 75 the shell mainly consists of magnetite fe3o4 and often with maghemite γ fe2o3 or lepidocrocite γ feooh 76 78 nano iron is highly reactive when comes in contact with air 79 due to which its surface reactivity becomes low iron nps show dual characteristics of zerovalent iron reduction and iron hydroxides complex formation the synthesis mechanism of iron nanoparticles involves the reduction of fe ii or fe iii salt with sodium borohydride in an aqueous medium fe h2o 6 3 3bh4 3h2o fe0 3b oh 3 10 5h2 2 4 iron oxide nanoparticles among eight known iron oxides 80 hematite α fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 fig 7 are found to be proficient and most accepted candidates as they show polymorphism that involves temperature induced phase transition however these iron oxides have unique biochemical magnetic catalytic and other properties which make them popular candidates for technical and biomedical applications hematite α fe2o3 hematite is the most stable form of iron oxide it is eco friendly nontoxic biocompatible and it is economical and highly resistant to corrosion hematite fe2o3 is crystallized in the rhombohedral system space group r 3c with n type semiconducting properties 2 1 ev band gap in bulk hematite the neel temperature is at tn 960 k whereas the morin transition takes place at tm 263 k exceeding tm the material is weakly ferromagnetic while lower than tm the material is anti ferromagnetic the morin temperature declines with reduction in particle size and disappear for particles which are 10 nm in size or smaller sizes 81 82 facile chemical route was used to coat and synthesize hematite nanoparticles with octyl ether and oleic acid it was observed that presence and absence of morin transition is affected by the alteration in magnetic characteristics due to small particle size i e 7 25 nm 83 magnetite fe3o4 fe3o4 differs from most of other iron oxides as it contains both of divalent and trivalent iron fe3o4 consists of cubic inverse spinal configuration which has cubic close packed arrangement of oxide ions wherein fe2 ions reside in half of the octahedral sites and the fe3 are divided uniformly across the left over octahedral sites and the tetrahedral sites fe3o4 nps of size 10 15 nm were synthesized and used for ultra sonic assisted adsorption 84 85 maghemite γ fe2o3 maghemite has cubic structure which consists of 32 o2 ions 21⅓ fe3 ions and 2⅓ vacancies oxygen anions form cubic close packed arrangement while ferric ions are scattered on tetrahedral sites eight fe ions per unit cell and octahedral sites the remaining fe ions and vacancies therefore the maghemite can be well thought out of fully oxidized magnetite with n type semiconductor characteristics and band gap of 2 0 ev 86 in nanotechnology an iron oxide nanoparticle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit in terms of its transport and properties various studies on magnetic nanoparticles of different iron and iron oxides have been carried out the bare iron or iron oxide nps are chemically vigorous and can be oxidized easily with air especially magnetite due to this their dispersibility and magnetism vanishes therefore it is necessary to maintain their stability by budding some efficient protection tactics and to coat their surface or grafting with nonmetal elementary substances polymers biomolecules or inorganic layer such as silica metal metal sulfide surfactants metal oxide or organic molecules 87 3 synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles magnetic nanoparticles nps of diverse morphologies and structures have been currently used in countless fields such as biomedical applications agricultural and environmental applications 88 the significance of magnetic nanoparticles nps is primarily due to their chemical stability biological compatibility but above all their trouble free production and recyclable process for a range of applications 89 there are various methods which are used for the fabrication of nanoparticles table 1 a brief description of the methods most widely used for preparing materials with applications in metal removals is given below 3 1 sol gel deposition ultrafine particles nano thickness films and nano porous membranes are all synthesized by sol gel processing the initial point is a solution of precursors in a suitable solvent the precursors are generally inorganic metal salts or metal organic compounds such as alkoxides metal ions with an organic ligand such as ti oc4h9 4 the ultrasound induces cavitation and the cavity collapse causes the reagents to react nano porous membranes nanostructured layers as well as coatings all can be synthesized by sol gel processing the primary process involves a polymerization reaction that forms a colloidal suspension or sol of separated finely dispersed particles kept in suspension by adding a surfactant for further processing i e casting or spin coating onto a substrate the suspension can be treated to extract the particles there it is converted to a gel by chemical treatment to disable the surfactant to create an extended network of linked particles all through the solution building a kind of super polymer one gigantic molecule in the form of an open three dimensional 3d or on a surface a 2d complex the gel evaporation of the solvent leads to the dense or nano porous film sol gel thin film process provides various advantages i e low temperature processing effortlessness fabrication and accurate microstructural and chemical control 90 sol gel methods are the foundation for a broad range of materials like cells cosmetics ceramics detergents etc 91 92 this technique is based on hydroxylation and condensation of molecular precursors in solution obtained sol from nanometric particles is then dried or gelled either by solvent removal or by chemical reaction to obtain three dimensional metal oxide network the solvent used is water but the precursors can be hydrolyzed using an acid or a base basic catalysis yields a colloidal gel whereas acid catalysis formulates a polymeric gel 93 3 2 co precipitation this process is most likely the effortless and most proficient chemical pathway to synthesize magnetic nanoparticles magnetite is normally synthesized by an aging stoichiometric mixture of ferrous and ferric salts in aqueous medium the precipitation of fe3o4 is expected at a ph between 8 and 14 the size and shape of the nanoparticles can be restricted by adjusting ph ionic strength temperature and nature of the salts 94 95 co precipitation reaction involves the concurrent events of nucleation growth coarsening and or agglomeration processes 91 precipitated from aqueous solution continue to be a thoroughly investigated subject the precipitation of the metals from aqueous or non aqueous solution typically requires the chemical reduction of metal cations reducing agents takes many forms the most common of which are gaseous h2 solvated abh4 a alkali metal hydrazine hydrate n2h4h2o and hydrazine dihydrochloride n2h42hcl type of metals which are precipitating from the solution includes not only first row of transition metals ions such as fe2 fe3 co2 ni2 and cu2 but also many second and third row transition metals as well as most post transition elements and a few nonmetals 3 3 hydrothermal and solvo thermal synthesis in a well packed vessel bumb autoclave etc let the solvents to heat up in order to attain a temperature above their boiling point under such conditions of temperature and pressure when a chemical reaction takes place then it is referred as solvo thermal processing while it is hydrothermal when water is used as solvent water above critical temperature and pressure is referred as supercritical and as a fluid it demonstrates characteristics of both liquid and gas the interfaces of solids and supercritical fluid lack surface tension hence it shows exceptionally less solubilities under ambient conditions 91 the hydrothermal reactions are performed in a reactor or autoclave in an aqueous media where the pressure of 2000 psi and temperature of 200 c are maintained the dehydration of metal salts and low solubility of oxides in aqueous phase supersaturate the medium 96 moreover the hydrothermal and solvothermal route is a facile and conventional method for obtaining hollow ionps in a typical procedure using fe3 as the iron resource acetate urea and sodium citrate are mixed in ethylene glycol under stirring and then the resultant homogeneous dispersion is transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and sealed to heat at about 200 c for 8 24 h 57 97 99 in solvo thermal process an organic solvent is used as a reaction medium instead of water normally a facile hydrothermal method for synthesizing fe3o4 includes adding fecl2 fecl3 and naoh with a molar ratio of 1 2 8 into an autoclave and a heat treatment at elevated temperature 100 3 4 magnetic nanocomposites inorganic materials like silver silica or gold can be used to coat fe3o4 nanoparticles 101 103 these coatings on the nanoparticle surface provide sites for covalent binding with a particular ligand and also improves the stability of nanoparticles these magnetic nanocomposites have structure such that it has outer shell of inorganic material while inside core is composed of iron oxide for instance variation of electrolytes and ph is conquered by silica coating and hence it offers a high stability to nanoparticle dispersion against this change 104 fig 8 4 potential application of nanoparticles for heavy metal removal the rapid growth in nanotechnology has a great deal of attention in the environmental applications of nanomaterials mitigating water and air pollutants is a big challenge to the society and nanomaterials were found to be efficient for environmental remediation by many researchers the highly complicated task is the selection of appropriate methods and materials for wastewater treatment where number of factors is under consideration such as efficiency quality standards to be met as well as the cost 105 106 therefore following are the conditions which must be considered while deciding wastewater treatment technologies 1 treatment flexibility and final efficiency 2 reuse of treatment agents 3 environmental security and friendliness and 4 low cost 106 107 recently engineered nanomaterials are found to have increased environmental applicability s 108 110 nanomaterials have potential reaction and adsorption properties which have been used in the environmental remediation primarily in treating hazardous waste air and water purification this development drifts to a substantial increment in the pace of environmental remediation through nanomaterials hence adsorption surfaces show unique and advanced characteristics 111 112 according to current scenario nanoscale iron has been considered as the apt option for scavenging various sectors of pollutants like nitrate tetracycline methyl orange and heavy metals including cr6 113 as5 114 cd2 115 and pb2 116 from aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 116 synthesized kaolinite supported zerovalent iron nps which eliminate pb ii efficiently by reducing pb ii to pb 0 nano metal oxides were also applied to water and wastewater for eliminating heavy metals 117 for example magnetic iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles were observed not only as efficient adsorbing materials but also used in biotechnological processes 118 as well as medical 119 applications laboratory findings showed that iron oxide nms can eliminate a series of heavy metals such as pb2 hg2 cd2 cu2 etc in an experiment conducted by nassar 120 it was observed that fe3o4 nanoparticles shows maximum adsorption for pb ii ions at 36 0 mg g 1 as compared to the low cost adsorbents he found that small sized fe3o4 nanosorbents was efficient for the diffusion of metal ions from solution onto the active sites of the adsorbents surface however for the recovery of heavy metal ions from waste water effluents fe3o4 nanosorbents were recommended as economically viable mayo et al 121 studied the potential of nanoscale iron oxides for the arsenic adsorption focusing on magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles they studied the influence of fe3o4 particle size on the adsorption and desorption behavior of as iii and as v they evaluated that as the particle size decline from 300 to 12 nm the adsorption capacities incline to about 200 times for both as iii and as v convincingly this increase is higher than expected surface area they also suggested arsenic adsorption differs in both nanoscale iron oxide and bulk systems teng et al 122 synthesized nzvi stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate sdsnzvi which were found to efficient in cr removal 4 5 studied adsorption capacity of chi stabilized nzvi cnzvi composites for cadmium ion cd2 they observed that the maximum adsorption capacity 99 9 of cd2 is 124 74 mg g with 0 08 mass ratio of chi to iron ions under the condition of ph 6 the adsorption isotherms followed langmuir model and the kinetic data was well fitted to pseudo second order kinetic model wu et al 87 synthesized fe3o4 which were used to disperse nano fe0 for cr vi mitigation fe0 nanoparticles can attach to the surface of fe3o4 by addition of large fe3o4 nps into the reaction solution during the preparation of fe0 nanoparticles when fe3o4 is introduced it prevents the agglomeration of fe0 nanoparticles and maintains the high efficiency of the nano composite for cr vi reduction the results showed that high amount of fe3o4 in the nano composites leads to the rise in cr vi reduction 40 1was found to be the optimal ratio of fe3o4 fe0 for cr vi reduction chowdhury and yanful 123 experimented for adsorption of arsenic and chromium by using mixed magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles from aqueous solution at optimal ph conditions 96 99 uptake of arsenic and chromium was observed under controlled ph conditions accordingly at ph 2 and initial concentration of 1 5 mg l for both arsenic species maximum arsenic adsorption was observed at the values 3 69 mg g for as iii and 3 71 mg g for as v whereas at the same ph and initial cr vi concentration of 1 mg l adsorption was found to be 2 4 mg g their results also showed the limitation of arsenic and chromium up take by the nano size magnetite maghemite mixture in the presence of a competing anion such as phosphate in an experiment by sahu et al 124 fe3o4 nanoparticles were prepared in aqueous solution by microemulsion process by utilizing extran biodegradable surfactant to enhance the removal efficiency of as iii the maximum adsorption of as iii at optimized condition was obtained at adsorbent dose of 0 70 mg g solution ph of 7 7 and initial as iii concentration of 33 32 mg l in another study borohydride reduction method was used to synthesize zvins in the presence of paa as a stabilizer for the removal of lead the optimization variables of pb ii removal were initial solution ph zvins concentration g l and initial concentration of pb ii mg l it was showed that a significant correlation between predicted values obtained from second order polynomial model and experimental values r2 93 19 and adj r2 87 07 with maximum removal of pb ii 125 sol gel method was used for the preparation of magnetite nanoparticles of around 10 nm for cr vi removal the characterization techniques used were tem and xrd 198m2 g was the analyzed surface area physico chemical adsorption governs the cr vi uptake the adsorption process varies with ph and temperature preliminary result indicates that cr uptake was governed by physio chemical adsorption and freundlich isotherm fits well in the data 126 modified fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps of size 15 20 nm with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and 80 copolymers of acrylic acid and crotonic acid in the removal of cd2 zn2 pb2 cu2 from metal contaminated water it was experimented that magnetic nanoparticles can be used to eliminate metal ions efficiently the maximum adsorption capacity of removal was found at ph 5 5 it is used as a recyclable adsorbent with suitable conditions 127 a list of functionalized iron oxide nms with their adsorption capacities is summarized in table 2 due to the colloidal nature of super paramagnetic nanoparticles their synthesis is complex process for metal scavenging applications an apt nanoparticle surface alteration is an important behavior towards aqueous stability as well as selectivity of these materials to the ending note it is important to mention that synthesis methods of organic and inorganic functionalized fe3o4 nanoparticles has been developed and modified in the last decade meanwhile it is emphasized that reduction in size of iron to nanoscale has been proved to enhance the rate of reaction and reduce the byproduct formation efficiently 5 conclusion in the above sections the current progress of nanotechnology with a view on synthesis characterization and applications of iron oxide nanoparticle has been reviewed nanomaterials have great potential for removal of contaminants due to their unique physical and chemical properties in this review nanomaterials prioritization and its further application prospects takes the nanomaterials development a level ahead unbeaten rational design of nanomaterials can be harnessed by considering the elementary atomic and molecular properties of the material at the nanoscale consequently it is also important to find solutions for improving the stability and accessibility of functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles in the severe environmental circumstances and the large scale industrial production moreover iron oxide nanoparticles are found to be the efficient nanosorbents and their implication in heavy metal adsorption is one of the most proficient and flourishing applications although various applications of nanomaterials were successful due to their unique physical and chemical properties inspite of this the application of nms in wastewater treatment are still limited in the early stage as exemplified in this review a series of nano iron oxide based technologies have been anticipated for the waste water treatment and heavy metal removal probable hurdles may be confronted in application of studies related to in situ studies of iron oxide nanomaterials in the concluding lines it is summarized that there is much recent interest in the utilization of nano iron oxide which is relatively a non invasive tool in varied applications including waste water treatment but it is emphasized that qualms over the health impacts and environmental fate of these nanomaterials need to be addressed before their widespread application increasingly study of their fate and impact in the environment is becoming important due to the discharges already occurring to the environment 
14337,with increasing trend in industrialization heavy metals possess a great threat to the environment due to their discharge in water and wastewater above permissible limits heavy metals have toxic effects on human and environment however advancement in newly budding and fangled nanotechnology offers better treatment techniques development of novel and cost effective 0d 1d 2d and 3d nanomaterials for environmental remediation pollution detection and other applications has attracted considerable attention zero valent iron and iron oxide nanoparticles are found to be the best candidates for heavy metal adsorption and removal various mechanical optical and electrical properties of nanoparticles play important role in nanoparticle formation and interaction forms of iron oxide such as hematite α fe2o3 and magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles of varied morphology and size 10 nm 20 nm 50 nm etc were synthesized by various methods like sol gel precipitation hydrothermal processes and magnetic nano composites with different iron precursors iron acetate iron nitrate ferric chloride ferrous sulphate etc iron oxide nanoparticles in a variety of chemical and structural forms have already exhibited its diversity and potential in many frontiers of environmental area present review is focused on the application of iron and iron oxide nanoparticles towards heavy metal removal keywords nanotechnology nanoparticles iron oxide heavy metal and adsorption 1 introduction heavy metals are the metallic elements which have a relatively high density heavy metals are capable of inducing toxicity even at lower levels on exposure due to the heavy metal contamination in the environment there has been a progressive concern about ecology and public health in the last few decades there is an emerging progress in agricultural industrial and urban activities leading to the increased pollution up to many folds burning of fossil fuels municipal wastes fertilizers mining and smelting of metallic ferrous ores pesticides and sewage sludge are the primary sources of pollution 1 2 the environmental protection agency epa has set maximum contaminant level mcls as a standard for drinking water quality pollutants present above these levels have adverse health effects 3 cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu lead pb nickel ni and zinc zn are among most common heavy metal contaminants of industrial pollution heavy metals are a class of persistent toxic substances ptss have acute toxicity and accumulation effects on living beings 4 5 fig 1 heavy metals have deleterious effects on the human health and environment by entering into the food chain although heavy metals occur naturally in the earth crust but the anthropogenic activities have increased the heavy metal content and results in the environmental contamination however these anthropogenic sources are battery production phosphate fertilizer alloy production textiles sewage irrigation atmospheric deposition mining biosolids improper stacking of industrial solid waste coating explosive manufacturing leather tanning pesticides printing pigments smelting steel and electroplating industries photographic materials dyes and wood preservation 6 7 heavy metals such as cobalt co copper cu chromium cr iron fe magnesium mg zinc zn selenium se manganese mn nickel ni and molybdenum mo are considered to be the essential trace elements for the biochemical and physiological functioning other than these metals all are considered as non essential metals but if these metals are present beyond their tolerance value they can have deleterious effects on the environment and human health it was found that large quantity of lead present in potable water can cause cancer renal kidney disease anemia nervous disorders etc metals such as arsenic 8 10 cadmium 11 chromium 12 13 lead 14 15 and mercury 16 17 are categorized under the prime concern metals which are important to public health hence due to their high grade toxicity they can induce multiple organ damage on exposure to even low concentrations according to the united states environmental protection agency u s epa and the international agency for research on cancer iarc the metals like mercury chromium cadmium arsenic and lead are categorized as either known or probable human carcinogens on the basis of their epidemiological and experimental studies so there have been many technologies to cope up with increasing heavy metal pollution by adopting remediation technologies there are many conventional methods adopted for the heavy metal removal in waste water 18 some of the techniques for waste removal includes biosorption 19 rubber tire activated carbon rtac 20 activated carbon adsorption 21 but these methods have some of the limitations however in recent years nanotechnology has fangled its roots in environmental remediation size dependent properties of nanoparticles nps put forward countless opportunities towards miscellaneous applications in the technical era this field with particle size from micro to nanoscale has received considerable global attention with an increasing demand towards nanomaterials 22 a series of heavy metals have been scavenging by nanomaterials due to their large surface area and high reactivity moreover trending nano metal oxides such as nanosized ferric oxides aluminum oxides manganese oxides magnesium oxides titanium oxides and cerium oxides endow with high surface area and unambiguous affinity for absorbing heavy metal from aqueous systems 23 nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been effectively used for treating water and wastewater polluted with chlorinated organic compounds 24 heavy metals including chromium 25 cadmium 25 copper 26 silver 26 zinc 26 27 dyes 28 and phenol 29 this review comes up with the view point of researchers working on nanotechnology to deal with water and waste water problems it also focuses on magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and their efficiency in heavy metal elimination 2 concept of nanotechnology nanotechnology is the art and science of manipulating matter at the nanoscale fig 2 down to 1 100 000 the width of a human hair to create new and unique materials and products the history of modern nanotechnology begins with richard feynman s lecture in 1959 there s plenty of room at the bottom in the conference of american physical society 30 nanotechnology has almost revolutionized the concept of scientific and technological implications in environmental safety the proficient and perceptive implementation of nanotechnology in environment is for water remediation and treatment modern nanotechnology provides nanomaterial application for decontamination of water through various mechanisms such as elimination of heavy metals and related pollutants eradication and dormancy of pathogens and conversion of highly toxic substances to least toxic for the development of new adsorbent with unique characteristics nanotechnology played a crucial role and has opened a new area in order to remediate toxic and harmful substances engineering offers new opportunities by adapting more advanced nanotechnological tools as compared to conventional processes by developing highly sophisticated methods for wastewater treatment 31 2 1 nanomaterials building blocks of nanotechnology in recent times a range of engineered nanomaterials e g nanoparticles quantum dots nanomembranes nanowires nanosheets nanotubes etc have been delineated which has been used in miscellaneous disciplines 32 39 the first classification idea of nsms nanoscale materials was given by gleiter in 1995 40 and further was explained by skorokhod in 2000 41 but gleiter and skorokhod system of classification was not well thought out as 0d 1d 2d and 3d structures such as fullerenes nanotubes and nanoflowers were not explained properly hence pokropivny and skorokhod 42 formulated an advanced classification system for nsms in which 0d 1d 2d and 3d nsms are included according to them zero dimensional 0 d nanomaterials are not confined to the nanoscale range 100 nm they can be one dimensional 1 d two dimensional 2 d fig 3 c and three dimensional 3 d the most general representation of zero dimensional fig 3a nanomaterials is nanoparticles these materials have every dimension within the nanoscale no dimensions or 0 d below 100 nm a one dimension fig 3b nanomaterial ranges out of nanoscale they consist of needle like nanostructures for instance nanotubes nanorods and nanowires however in two dimensional nanomaterials two of the dimensions are not confined to the nanoscale which includes nanofilms nanolayers and nanocoating s three dimensional nanomaterials or bulk nanomaterials are not restricted to the nanoscale in any of the dimension thus specified by their three erratic dimensions higher than 100 nm nanocrystalline structure or bulk nanomaterials can comprise of a numerous position of nanosized crystals usually in diverse orientations 43 surfaces and interfaces are of great significance to new nanomaterials as the particle size decreases fraction of surface atoms multiplies in comparison with inside volume 44 in addition to size shape also affects the various properties as it changes the exposed crystal facets by altering the atomic arrangement in each facet which ultimately exerts tremendous impact on their properties 45 most of the micro structured materials have interrelated properties to the corresponding bulk materials while the nanomaterials have significantly different properties from those of atoms and bulk materials the basis behind such behavior is the nonorange of materials which provides them with high number of surface atoms spatial confinement high surface energy and reduced imperfections which is not found in the corresponding bulk materials nanomaterials with a sequence of distinctive properties i e small size effect surface effect and quantum size effect have fascinated the consideration of researchers 46 48 due to the small size effect of nanomaterials they demonstrate exceptional fundamental functions like low temperature sensing excellent catalytic activities and high sensitivity 46 38 due to their surface effect they possess high reaction efficiency and strong adsorption capability 47 49 quantum size effect can endure nanomaterials with exceptional optical and electronic properties 50 engineered nanomaterials as the supporter catalysts comprehend the segregation of the products and the catalysts from the reaction mixture and they play significant role in the field of catalysis 51 52 the magnetic nanoparticles the catalyst supporter in organic synthesis can be reused by recovering the catalysts with an external magnet without losing their activity 53 55 furthermore other methods such as filtration and centrifugation can also be accepted for the recovery of catalysts 55 56 51 metals in nano range as an imperative area of engineered nanomaterials demonstrate possible applications 57 60 for example metallic nanoparticles can be used as efficient catalysts nanoparticles based chemical sensors and nanowires have enhanced the sensitivity and sensor selectivity it is believed that nanomaterials with their internal structure at nanoscale dimensions are hardly something new to science perhaps the particle size is not the only feature of a nanomaterial nanocrystal or nanoparticle however the vital and precise property of various nanomaterials is the bulk of atoms localized on the surface of a particle in addition to commonplace materials where atoms are dispersed around majority of a particle alternatively the process of formation and aggregation of nanomaterials is mainly depending upon the various magnetic electrical optical and mechanical properties fig 4 at the nanoscale extremely attractive properties are created due to quantum effects dominance of interfacial phenomena and size confinement these novel and exceptional properties of nanostructured materials nanoparticles and other related nanotechnologies results in improved catalysts increased strength tunable photoactivity and many other interesting characteristics 61 62 2 2 nanoparticles particles can be segregated on the basis of their size in requisites of diameter fine particles are in between 100 and 2500 nm conversely ultrafine particles have size between 1 and 100 nm similarly particles within the range of 1 100 nanometers are categorized as nanoparticles they are unique as their physical behavior shifts from classical physics to quantum physics with declining particle size nanoparticles can exist in solid liquid or gaseous state a nanoparticle when assumed like a ball in shape which has a radius of 2 5 nm density of 5 g cm3 and surface area 240 m2 g it means that about 20 of the particle atoms are localized on the surface however the surface of a nanoparticle is never naked due to high energetic adhesive forces close to the surface the particles are either aggregated to their neighbors glued to the next available surface or work like an activated charcoal filter towards other small molecules 44 nanoparticles could show size related properties that vary considerably from those of fine particles or bulk materials 63 worldwide metal nanoparticles have also fascinated the interest of the researchers due to their unique electronic optical and catalytic and several other structural features at nanoscale materials shows elevated catalytic properties high surface area and greater active sites to intermingle with metallic species 64 65 various methods are used for the synthesis of nanoparticles such as physical chemical and biological methods top down and bottom up approaches also the methods of nanoparticle synthesis fig 5 previously top down approach was used widely which employed the use of physical and chemical means to reduce the bulk material into nanosized 66 but such methodologies are associated with large amount of materials and energy consumption hence are not preferred now days bottom up approach has become more popular and is used at laboratory scales the top down approach fundamentally deals with bulk material then reduced to nanoscale by specialized ablations e g sputtering thermal decomposition mechanical milling laser ablation etching and lithography 67 contrarily second one is the bottom up approach most preferably considered for nanoparticles synthesis which involves a homogeneous system where catalysts e g reducing agent and enzymes produce nanostructures that are restricted by catalyst properties reaction media and conditions e g solvents stabilizers and temperature the above mentioned two methods differs in a matter that top down method usually leads to crystalline samples for instance small single crystals or polycrystalline material formed from previous thermodynamically starting material in a crystalline solid a thermodynamically formed product usually complies with the ideal crystal structure of the specific compound e g nacl cscl rutile and corundum structures alternatively bottom up route outcomes with the formation of minute particles from crystalline areas that do not correspond to the ideal lattice defect structure these structures are difficult to illustrate and are typical kinetic products i e products that don t have sufficient time for an ideal crystal growth 68 therefore a kinetic product leads to a defect structure which is also referred to as a real structure in literature such defect or real structures are classified according to different defect classes 0 dimensional defects non stoichiometry 1 dimensional defects dislocations 2 dimensional defects grain boundaries and 3 dimensional defects pores 69 there are various techniques which are used to characterize nanomaterials synthesis of nps is confirmed by employing uv vis spectro photometry which is then followed by centrifugation of mixture and drying the pellet in a hot air oven to get the crystal nps 70 synthesized nanoparticles are further characterized using x ray diffractometer xrd energy dispersion

diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs and dynamic light scattering dls 70 71 nanoparticles are composed of assemblies of atoms and molecules in nanometer scale and are more advantageous than their bulk counterparts because of their high surface to volume ratio so their application in varied sectors can play a counter role to improve the current situation of health and environment 2 3 iron nanoparticles due to the high reduction and adsorption capacity of nanoscale zero valent metals nzvms it represents the cutting edge of technologies which is thought to be the potential materials for environmental remediation and antimicrobial effect since 1980s nanoscale zero valent metals have fascinated science as a category of efficient reducers for removing contaminants in water iron has a standard redox potential of 0 44 v e0 0 44 v it is thus an effective reductant when reacting with oxidized pollutants in water 72 its core shell structures fig 6 are advantageous for heavy metal elimination and transformation the metallic core acts as an electron source and acts as the reducing character whereas the oxide shell can absorb the pollutants via electrostatic interactions as well as surface complexation and the proficient electron can transfer from the metallic core to the surface 73 the core mainly consists of zero valent iron and provides the reducing power for reactions with environmental contaminants the shell is comprising of iron oxides hydroxides as result of oxidation of zero valent iron the shell forms the platform for chemical complex formation e g chemisorption 74 the thickness of outer iron oxide and inner core of fe0 was observed to be 10 and 20 nm respectively 75 the shell mainly consists of magnetite fe3o4 and often with maghemite γ fe2o3 or lepidocrocite γ feooh 76 78 nano iron is highly reactive when comes in contact with air 79 due to which its surface reactivity becomes low iron nps show dual characteristics of zerovalent iron reduction and iron hydroxides complex formation the synthesis mechanism of iron nanoparticles involves the reduction of fe ii or fe iii salt with sodium borohydride in an aqueous medium fe h2o 6 3 3bh4 3h2o fe0 3b oh 3 10 5h2 2 4 iron oxide nanoparticles among eight known iron oxides 80 hematite α fe2o3 magnetite fe3o4 and maghemite γ fe2o3 fig 7 are found to be proficient and most accepted candidates as they show polymorphism that involves temperature induced phase transition however these iron oxides have unique biochemical magnetic catalytic and other properties which make them popular candidates for technical and biomedical applications hematite α fe2o3 hematite is the most stable form of iron oxide it is eco friendly nontoxic biocompatible and it is economical and highly resistant to corrosion hematite fe2o3 is crystallized in the rhombohedral system space group r 3c with n type semiconducting properties 2 1 ev band gap in bulk hematite the neel temperature is at tn 960 k whereas the morin transition takes place at tm 263 k exceeding tm the material is weakly ferromagnetic while lower than tm the material is anti ferromagnetic the morin temperature declines with reduction in particle size and disappear for particles which are 10 nm in size or smaller sizes 81 82 facile chemical route was used to coat and synthesize hematite nanoparticles with octyl ether and oleic acid it was observed that presence and absence of morin transition is affected by the alteration in magnetic characteristics due to small particle size i e 7 25 nm 83 magnetite fe3o4 fe3o4 differs from most of other iron oxides as it contains both of divalent and trivalent iron fe3o4 consists of cubic inverse spinal configuration which has cubic close packed arrangement of oxide ions wherein fe2 ions reside in half of the octahedral sites and the fe3 are divided uniformly across the left over octahedral sites and the tetrahedral sites fe3o4 nps of size 10 15 nm were synthesized and used for ultra sonic assisted adsorption 84 85 maghemite γ fe2o3 maghemite has cubic structure which consists of 32 o2 ions 21⅓ fe3 ions and 2⅓ vacancies oxygen anions form cubic close packed arrangement while ferric ions are scattered on tetrahedral sites eight fe ions per unit cell and octahedral sites the remaining fe ions and vacancies therefore the maghemite can be well thought out of fully oxidized magnetite with n type semiconductor characteristics and band gap of 2 0 ev 86 in nanotechnology an iron oxide nanoparticle is defined as a small object that behaves as a whole unit in terms of its transport and properties various studies on magnetic nanoparticles of different iron and iron oxides have been carried out the bare iron or iron oxide nps are chemically vigorous and can be oxidized easily with air especially magnetite due to this their dispersibility and magnetism vanishes therefore it is necessary to maintain their stability by budding some efficient protection tactics and to coat their surface or grafting with nonmetal elementary substances polymers biomolecules or inorganic layer such as silica metal metal sulfide surfactants metal oxide or organic molecules 87 3 synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles magnetic nanoparticles nps of diverse morphologies and structures have been currently used in countless fields such as biomedical applications agricultural and environmental applications 88 the significance of magnetic nanoparticles nps is primarily due to their chemical stability biological compatibility but above all their trouble free production and recyclable process for a range of applications 89 there are various methods which are used for the fabrication of nanoparticles table 1 a brief description of the methods most widely used for preparing materials with applications in metal removals is given below 3 1 sol gel deposition ultrafine particles nano thickness films and nano porous membranes are all synthesized by sol gel processing the initial point is a solution of precursors in a suitable solvent the precursors are generally inorganic metal salts or metal organic compounds such as alkoxides metal ions with an organic ligand such as ti oc4h9 4 the ultrasound induces cavitation and the cavity collapse causes the reagents to react nano porous membranes nanostructured layers as well as coatings all can be synthesized by sol gel processing the primary process involves a polymerization reaction that forms a colloidal suspension or sol of separated finely dispersed particles kept in suspension by adding a surfactant for further processing i e casting or spin coating onto a substrate the suspension can be treated to extract the particles there it is converted to a gel by chemical treatment to disable the surfactant to create an extended network of linked particles all through the solution building a kind of super polymer one gigantic molecule in the form of an open three dimensional 3d or on a surface a 2d complex the gel evaporation of the solvent leads to the dense or nano porous film sol gel thin film process provides various advantages i e low temperature processing effortlessness fabrication and accurate microstructural and chemical control 90 sol gel methods are the foundation for a broad range of materials like cells cosmetics ceramics detergents etc 91 92 this technique is based on hydroxylation and condensation of molecular precursors in solution obtained sol from nanometric particles is then dried or gelled either by solvent removal or by chemical reaction to obtain three dimensional metal oxide network the solvent used is water but the precursors can be hydrolyzed using an acid or a base basic catalysis yields a colloidal gel whereas acid catalysis formulates a polymeric gel 93 3 2 co precipitation this process is most likely the effortless and most proficient chemical pathway to synthesize magnetic nanoparticles magnetite is normally synthesized by an aging stoichiometric mixture of ferrous and ferric salts in aqueous medium the precipitation of fe3o4 is expected at a ph between 8 and 14 the size and shape of the nanoparticles can be restricted by adjusting ph ionic strength temperature and nature of the salts 94 95 co precipitation reaction involves the concurrent events of nucleation growth coarsening and or agglomeration processes 91 precipitated from aqueous solution continue to be a thoroughly investigated subject the precipitation of the metals from aqueous or non aqueous solution typically requires the chemical reduction of metal cations reducing agents takes many forms the most common of which are gaseous h2 solvated abh4 a alkali metal hydrazine hydrate n2h4h2o and hydrazine dihydrochloride n2h42hcl type of metals which are precipitating from the solution includes not only first row of transition metals ions such as fe2 fe3 co2 ni2 and cu2 but also many second and third row transition metals as well as most post transition elements and a few nonmetals 3 3 hydrothermal and solvo thermal synthesis in a well packed vessel bumb autoclave etc let the solvents to heat up in order to attain a temperature above their boiling point under such conditions of temperature and pressure when a chemical reaction takes place then it is referred as solvo thermal processing while it is hydrothermal when water is used as solvent water above critical temperature and pressure is referred as supercritical and as a fluid it demonstrates characteristics of both liquid and gas the interfaces of solids and supercritical fluid lack surface tension hence it shows exceptionally less solubilities under ambient conditions 91 the hydrothermal reactions are performed in a reactor or autoclave in an aqueous media where the pressure of 2000 psi and temperature of 200 c are maintained the dehydration of metal salts and low solubility of oxides in aqueous phase supersaturate the medium 96 moreover the hydrothermal and solvothermal route is a facile and conventional method for obtaining hollow ionps in a typical procedure using fe3 as the iron resource acetate urea and sodium citrate are mixed in ethylene glycol under stirring and then the resultant homogeneous dispersion is transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and sealed to heat at about 200 c for 8 24 h 57 97 99 in solvo thermal process an organic solvent is used as a reaction medium instead of water normally a facile hydrothermal method for synthesizing fe3o4 includes adding fecl2 fecl3 and naoh with a molar ratio of 1 2 8 into an autoclave and a heat treatment at elevated temperature 100 3 4 magnetic nanocomposites inorganic materials like silver silica or gold can be used to coat fe3o4 nanoparticles 101 103 these coatings on the nanoparticle surface provide sites for covalent binding with a particular ligand and also improves the stability of nanoparticles these magnetic nanocomposites have structure such that it has outer shell of inorganic material while inside core is composed of iron oxide for instance variation of electrolytes and ph is conquered by silica coating and hence it offers a high stability to nanoparticle dispersion against this change 104 fig 8 4 potential application of nanoparticles for heavy metal removal the rapid growth in nanotechnology has a great deal of attention in the environmental applications of nanomaterials mitigating water and air pollutants is a big challenge to the society and nanomaterials were found to be efficient for environmental remediation by many researchers the highly complicated task is the selection of appropriate methods and materials for wastewater treatment where number of factors is under consideration such as efficiency quality standards to be met as well as the cost 105 106 therefore following are the conditions which must be considered while deciding wastewater treatment technologies 1 treatment flexibility and final efficiency 2 reuse of treatment agents 3 environmental security and friendliness and 4 low cost 106 107 recently engineered nanomaterials are found to have increased environmental applicability s 108 110 nanomaterials have potential reaction and adsorption properties which have been used in the environmental remediation primarily in treating hazardous waste air and water purification this development drifts to a substantial increment in the pace of environmental remediation through nanomaterials hence adsorption surfaces show unique and advanced characteristics 111 112 according to current scenario nanoscale iron has been considered as the apt option for scavenging various sectors of pollutants like nitrate tetracycline methyl orange and heavy metals including cr6 113 as5 114 cd2 115 and pb2 116 from aquatic ecosystems zhang et al 116 synthesized kaolinite supported zerovalent iron nps which eliminate pb ii efficiently by reducing pb ii to pb 0 nano metal oxides were also applied to water and wastewater for eliminating heavy metals 117 for example magnetic iron oxide fe3o4 nanoparticles were observed not only as efficient adsorbing materials but also used in biotechnological processes 118 as well as medical 119 applications laboratory findings showed that iron oxide nms can eliminate a series of heavy metals such as pb2 hg2 cd2 cu2 etc in an experiment conducted by nassar 120 it was observed that fe3o4 nanoparticles shows maximum adsorption for pb ii ions at 36 0 mg g 1 as compared to the low cost adsorbents he found that small sized fe3o4 nanosorbents was efficient for the diffusion of metal ions from solution onto the active sites of the adsorbents surface however for the recovery of heavy metal ions from waste water effluents fe3o4 nanosorbents were recommended as economically viable mayo et al 121 studied the potential of nanoscale iron oxides for the arsenic adsorption focusing on magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles they studied the influence of fe3o4 particle size on the adsorption and desorption behavior of as iii and as v they evaluated that as the particle size decline from 300 to 12 nm the adsorption capacities incline to about 200 times for both as iii and as v convincingly this increase is higher than expected surface area they also suggested arsenic adsorption differs in both nanoscale iron oxide and bulk systems teng et al 122 synthesized nzvi stabilized by sodium dodecyl sulfate sdsnzvi which were found to efficient in cr removal 4 5 studied adsorption capacity of chi stabilized nzvi cnzvi composites for cadmium ion cd2 they observed that the maximum adsorption capacity 99 9 of cd2 is 124 74 mg g with 0 08 mass ratio of chi to iron ions under the condition of ph 6 the adsorption isotherms followed langmuir model and the kinetic data was well fitted to pseudo second order kinetic model wu et al 87 synthesized fe3o4 which were used to disperse nano fe0 for cr vi mitigation fe0 nanoparticles can attach to the surface of fe3o4 by addition of large fe3o4 nps into the reaction solution during the preparation of fe0 nanoparticles when fe3o4 is introduced it prevents the agglomeration of fe0 nanoparticles and maintains the high efficiency of the nano composite for cr vi reduction the results showed that high amount of fe3o4 in the nano composites leads to the rise in cr vi reduction 40 1was found to be the optimal ratio of fe3o4 fe0 for cr vi reduction chowdhury and yanful 123 experimented for adsorption of arsenic and chromium by using mixed magnetite and maghemite nanoparticles from aqueous solution at optimal ph conditions 96 99 uptake of arsenic and chromium was observed under controlled ph conditions accordingly at ph 2 and initial concentration of 1 5 mg l for both arsenic species maximum arsenic adsorption was observed at the values 3 69 mg g for as iii and 3 71 mg g for as v whereas at the same ph and initial cr vi concentration of 1 mg l adsorption was found to be 2 4 mg g their results also showed the limitation of arsenic and chromium up take by the nano size magnetite maghemite mixture in the presence of a competing anion such as phosphate in an experiment by sahu et al 124 fe3o4 nanoparticles were prepared in aqueous solution by microemulsion process by utilizing extran biodegradable surfactant to enhance the removal efficiency of as iii the maximum adsorption of as iii at optimized condition was obtained at adsorbent dose of 0 70 mg g solution ph of 7 7 and initial as iii concentration of 33 32 mg l in another study borohydride reduction method was used to synthesize zvins in the presence of paa as a stabilizer for the removal of lead the optimization variables of pb ii removal were initial solution ph zvins concentration g l and initial concentration of pb ii mg l it was showed that a significant correlation between predicted values obtained from second order polynomial model and experimental values r2 93 19 and adj r2 87 07 with maximum removal of pb ii 125 sol gel method was used for the preparation of magnetite nanoparticles of around 10 nm for cr vi removal the characterization techniques used were tem and xrd 198m2 g was the analyzed surface area physico chemical adsorption governs the cr vi uptake the adsorption process varies with ph and temperature preliminary result indicates that cr uptake was governed by physio chemical adsorption and freundlich isotherm fits well in the data 126 modified fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles mnps of size 15 20 nm with 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane and 80 copolymers of acrylic acid and crotonic acid in the removal of cd2 zn2 pb2 cu2 from metal contaminated water it was experimented that magnetic nanoparticles can be used to eliminate metal ions efficiently the maximum adsorption capacity of removal was found at ph 5 5 it is used as a recyclable adsorbent with suitable conditions 127 a list of functionalized iron oxide nms with their adsorption capacities is summarized in table 2 due to the colloidal nature of super paramagnetic nanoparticles their synthesis is complex process for metal scavenging applications an apt nanoparticle surface alteration is an important behavior towards aqueous stability as well as selectivity of these materials to the ending note it is important to mention that synthesis methods of organic and inorganic functionalized fe3o4 nanoparticles has been developed and modified in the last decade meanwhile it is emphasized that reduction in size of iron to nanoscale has been proved to enhance the rate of reaction and reduce the byproduct formation efficiently 5 conclusion in the above sections the current progress of nanotechnology with a view on synthesis characterization and applications of iron oxide nanoparticle has been reviewed nanomaterials have great potential for removal of contaminants due to their unique physical and chemical properties in this review nanomaterials prioritization and its further application prospects takes the nanomaterials development a level ahead unbeaten rational design of nanomaterials can be harnessed by considering the elementary atomic and molecular properties of the material at the nanoscale consequently it is also important to find solutions for improving the stability and accessibility of functionalized iron oxide nanoparticles in the severe environmental circumstances and the large scale industrial production moreover iron oxide nanoparticles are found to be the efficient nanosorbents and their implication in heavy metal adsorption is one of the most proficient and flourishing applications although various applications of nanomaterials were successful due to their unique physical and chemical properties inspite of this the application of nms in wastewater treatment are still limited in the early stage as exemplified in this review a series of nano iron oxide based technologies have been anticipated for the waste water treatment and heavy metal removal probable hurdles may be confronted in application of studies related to in situ studies of iron oxide nanomaterials in the concluding lines it is summarized that there is much recent interest in the utilization of nano iron oxide which is relatively a non invasive tool in varied applications including waste water treatment but it is emphasized that qualms over the health impacts and environmental fate of these nanomaterials need to be addressed before their widespread application increasingly study of their fate and impact in the environment is becoming important due to the discharges already occurring to the environment 
14338,cape town south africa has been experiencing its worse drought in decades as a result the city of cape town introduced water restrictions and encouraged residents to save water one solution was to reduce toilet flushing and allow urine to stagnate in toilet bowls another solution focused on using greywater specifically shower water to flush toilets this exploratory work focused on the impact of such solutions in terms of the precipitation potential of urine precipitation processes such as urea hydrolysis are governed by ph and since greywater and cleaning products can increase the ph of a solution these could also result in precipitation occurring we found that flushing with greywater results in ph values of 9 2 being reached within 2 days and significant precipitation occurring the solid build up of precipitates would add an estimated 893 tons of extra solids to the sewer network in cape town if everyone flushed their toilets with shower greywater only this is unlikely to negatively affect the sewer network but the excessive build up of solids could affect the immediate toilet and piping infrastructure causing blockages in addition adding bleach to stagnated urine should be avoided because of the harmful by products that could form as a result of these findings we developed a guideline for toilet flushing with greywater that aims to reduce the precipitation potential of urine greywater can be used to flush toilets but bleach or another disinfectant should be added immediately after the flush to limit excessive bacterial growth and ph fluctuations keywords cape town drought greywater scaling water saving 1 introduction cape town south africa has been experiencing its worse drought in decades it came close to day zero the day the taps were expected to run dry as a result of this drought the city of cape town implemented severe water restrictions based on levels of water consumption the most severe was level 6b which meant that capetonians were restricted to only using 50 litres per person per day 1 this resulted in significant water savings and a more than half reduction in water usage when compared to pre drought conditions the water demand for the city dropped from 1200 ml day in february 2015 to 500 ml day in february 2018 1 an incredible feat for a city of 4 1 million people many citizens implemented various water saving initiatives such as greywater recycling limited showers reduced flow adaptors for taps and greywater flushing for toilets in addition the saying if it s yellow let mellow became socially accepted this saying refers to people allowing urine to stagnate in toilet bowls while these initiatives did substantially reduce a household s water consumption 1 they might have had unforeseen consequences on the piping infrastructure connected to each toilet for example reduced toilet flushing resulted in an increased frequency of pipe blockages 2 also stagnating urine will allow the urea present in the urine to degrade increasing the ph of the solution and ultimately resulting in precipitation of solids 3 the precipitation of solids in urine has been researched before 3 however this research predominantly dealt with no mix toilets and waterless urinals the typical precipitates that have been found to form from the hydrolysis of urea in urine are struvite mgnh4po4 6h20 hydroxyapatite hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 and calcite caco3 4 the hydrolysis of urea refers to the breakdown of urea into carbonate ions and ammonium ions and is performed by urease producing bacteria which are commonly found in toilet systems 5 due to the degradation of urea the ph of the solution will increase to approximately 9 2 if the urine is allowed to stagnate 4 this increase in ph promotes the formation of solids such as hydroxyapatite struvite and calcite due to the increasing relative supersaturation 6 the precipitation amount has been estimated by simulation models developed by udert and co workers 7 the models developed and experiments performed were aimed at addressing the blockage issues and scaling in no mix toilets and waterless urinals since precipitation is governed by ph a high ph results in solid formation and considering that new toilet flushing solutions such as greywater can have different ph values and compositions when compared to conventional flushing solution it stands to reason then that the precipitation potential of urine could be affected also because urea hydrolysis is predominately influenced by urease producing bacteria 3 and since greywaters have higher concentrations of bacteria 8 this could also increase the rate of urea hydrolysis and hence precipitation other than flushing with greywater capetonians have also been adding vinegar and bleach to mask the smells emitted from stagnating urine the implications of using such products on the toilet system is also not well understood during drought conditions the purpose of this study was therefore to conduct an exploratory investigation into the precipitation potential when toilets are flushed with greywater and cleaned with products such as vinegar or bleach in addition the aim was to formulate preliminary guidelines for toilet flushing and cleaning routines during periods of drought that would limit precipitation in toilet and piping infrastructure 2 material and methods 2 1 urine collection and sampling urine was collected in portable waterless urinals as described by flanagan and randall 9 however the urine collected for these experiments was not treated with calcium hydroxide and was used within 24 h of collection the urine was analysed for magnesium calcium and phosphate total nitrogen and ammonia as well as ph the magnesium calcium and phosphate concentrations were tested using a thermo scientific gallery tsg gallery thermo fisher scientific inc massachusetts usa total nitrogen and ammonia was tested by performing a total kjeldahl nitogen test and free and saline ammonia test while the ph was measured using an accsen instrumental ph probe accsen instrumental barcelona spain 2 2 composition of flushing and cleaning fluids the synthetic flushing and cleaning fluids used in this study were greywater from hand washing soap and tap water greywater from showering soap shampoo and tap water vinegar bleach this investigation included typical products used in south african households for cleaning to provide a realistic product representation for the synthetic greywater the products were purchased at a national retailer and included soap shampoo vinegar and bleach the samples were tested for the presence of calcium magnesium and phosphate using a tsg by testing the solutions before flushing and after the most significant composition changes were recorded and used for the analysis of the effects of different flushing fluids this data allowed for a theoretical mass balance to be performed over the system which was used to determine if precipitation had occurred or not in order to simulate a flush with greywater a synthetic greywater recipe was created based on the guidelines described by 10 the recipe was altered to be more aligned with the drought conditions in cape town for example the same amount of soap and shampoo were used however the concentrations used were higher due to the lower amount of water used during the drought the handwashing soap bottle used in this work had a pump action dispenser it was assumed that for handwashing one pump of soap would be used and for showering two pumps would be suitable the average mass found for one single pump was 1 2 g using this value and the city of cape town s guideline 1 of 300 ml of water for handwashing a concentration of 4 g l was determined for the handwashing soap one litre of the handwashing greywater was mixed at a time by measuring and pouring 500 ml of municipal tap water into two beakers using a mass balance 4 g of soap was measured and added to one 500 ml beaker which was then placed onto a magnetic stirrer and stirred on a low setting for one minute the soap water solution was then poured into the remaining beaker which was further mixed for an additional one minute the contents of the synthetic shower greywater were assumed to include soap and shampoo products due to a larger amount of water the concentration of soap and shampoo were different to that used for the handwashing greywater the concentration of handwashing soap used was 0 05 g l while the concentration of shampoo was 0 072 g l the greywaters were used immediately after mixing and new batches were made between experiments the greywaters used in this work did not contain typical human bacteria that would be present in household greywater this prevented variations in compositions and thus allowed for more controlled testing 2 3 experimental method to investigate the effects of allowing urine to stagnate in a toilet bowl a number of experiments were conducted on a scaled down representation of a typical household toilet this was done in a controlled environment whereby a toilet bowl was simulated by means of 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks the flasks were cleaned and inoculated with settled sewage for 12 h and then flushed with de ionised water this was done to introduce bacteria into the flask as would be found in a household toilet the volumes from a standard toilet were found to have a bowl volume of 1 38 l and a flush volume of 5 97 l these volumes were then scaled down by a factor of 45 in order to fit into 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks as shown in table 1 this was conducted in order to increase the number of experiments that could be simultaneously run since it was not practical to have the same number of toilets set up in the laboratory an initial experiment was performed using five erlenmeyer flasks consisting of a control handwashing greywater flush shower greywater flush vinegar and tap water flush and lastly bleach and tap water flush after the flasks were inoculated and flushed the bowl water volume was added in the form of measured tap water the collected fresh urine was added at 07 00 each day whereby the required volume of urine was added into the flasks followed by a mixing step in which the flasks were swirled five times this was done in order to simulate a perfectly mixed toilet bowl system the runout simulating the fluid leaving the toilet was then performed by removing the required volume and collecting it for testing of the calcium magnesium and phosphate concentrations as well as ph this was conducted at 09 00 and 10 30 as shown in table 2 at 10 30 the vinegar and bleach were added to the respective flasks after the urine addition the final urine addition was performed at 20 00 and the flush water was then added this was based on the assumption that people would flush the toilet when leaving their homes in the morning the solution was then left for 11 h to simulate the condition of the toilet not being used during typical working hours at 07 00 the following day the solution composition was measured and the ph recorded the solution was then left for a week in the flask to observe the changes if any that took place after 7 days a total settleable solids tss test was performed on the solution by filtering using filter paper with a 1 2 μm pore size and drying the measured mass of solids in an oven at 95 c term o mat oven labotec johannesburg south africa this test was repeated four times in order to conduct an experimental error analysis standard deviation 2 4 5 day shower water test a second round of experiments were performed based on the results of the initial experiments the focus for these experiments was on using synthetic shower greywater for flushing because this type of flushing fluid resulted in the highest ph after one week in the flask experiments a similar method was used with the exceptions of the 07 00 addition of urine as well as the urine addition and removal process which continued for five days instead of one day after five days a tss test was performed using both 1 2 μm and 0 45 μm pore sized filter papers of known masses the solid mass was then converted to an equivalent mass that would be found in a toilet by scaling the results up by a factor of 45 the test was performed using one control and three samples representing the synthetic shower greywater 3 results and discussion 3 1 flushing cleaning fluid compositions fig 1 shows the ph and concentration measurements for the synthetic greywaters and additives before being added to the experimental flasks the results indicate that the handwashing fluid had the highest average values of calcium while vinegar contained the highest concentrations of magnesium and phosphate by factors of 4 5 and 30 respectively all of the fluids had some variability in the results but they were within experimental error similar results were obtained for the 5 day experiment the shower greywater used for the 5 day experiment had average ph values of 8 20 and concentrations of 12 92 mg l 1 68 mg l and 0 48 mg l for calcium magnesium and phosphate respectively 3 2 urine composition urine samples were collected daily in order to perform the necessary tests to perform the mass balances and to validate whether precipitation had occurred the composition and ph of the urine was measured the same urine samples were used throughout a single test and the urine was refrigerated between the 10 30 and 20 00 urine additions to prevented unwanted urea hydrolysis the urine samples had low concentrations of magnesium when compared the concentrations given in the work by rose and coworkers 11 the other components that were measured fell within the ranges given by rose and co workers 11 the composition of urine will always vary since it is based on diet water intake and environmental conditions and hence these variations were considered acceptable 3 3 results of flushing with different fluids and chemicals it was found that within 24 h the ph of the handwashing greywater and shower greywater solutions had increased from the initial ph to values around 7 while the ph of the vinegar solution had decreased significantly to below 5 lastly the ph of the bleach solution was lower than the initial ph this was unexpected due to the high initial ph 13 57 of the bleach this was likely as a result of the chemical breakdown of the sodium hypochlorite naocl in the bleach once it came in contact with the water and urine solution in the flask as shown in eqs 1 and 2 1 n a o c l h 2 o n a h o c l o h 2 h o c l h o c l when sodium hypochlorite decomposes it forms hypochlorous acid hocl hypochlorous acid then decomposes further to form a hypochlorite ion and an excess proton this excess proton is the likely reason why the ph of the solution decreases the ph values measured over the first 24 h indicated that no significant amount of urea hydrolysis had taken place and hence no significant precipitation would occur the ph was then measured after one week these results show that time had a significant impact on the ph and urea hydrolysis fig 2 shows the average ph values for the different fluid types after one week fig 2 shows that the ph of the shower greywater solution had the highest value the high ph values of both the handwashing greywater and shower greywater solutions after one week indicates that theoretically the urea present in the urine had hydrolysed and that precipitation had occurred during the experiment the ph of the vinegar solution decreased over the seven days while the ph of the bleach solution had a value of approximately 7 this was likely due to the disinfecting properties of the bleach which would kill the bacteria required to hydrolyse the urine the changing ph was used as an indicator for determining if precipitation had occurred fig 3 shows the results of the tss tests performed after one week it can be seen that the shower greywater handwashing greywater and vinegar resulted in similar amounts of solids forming the vinegar solution had formed a biological film layer on the surface in addition precipitates had formed at the bottom of the vinegar flask the significant error for the tss values shown in fig 3 could be attributed to the variation in urine used as well as variation in the tap water composition and degree of bacterial growth in each sample growth in the handwashing greywater formed as early as 36 h after the test began the shower greywater also resulted in a cloudy solution at this time the vinegar and bleach were still transparent while the bleach solution had a more yellow colour when compared to the vinegar solution after 60 h 2 5 days the handwashing greywater solution and shower greywater solution were cloudy and growths had formed on the surface of the solution the vinegar solution formed small spherical growths which remained suspended in the solution the bleach solution remained clear and smelled of chlorine the flask containing the vinegar solution had an orange precipitate on day 1 and on day 3 a biofilm growth could be seen the growth spread quickly and by day 4 it covered the surface of the solution obscuring the view into the solution it should be noted that all of the flasks except the control developed unpleasant smells over the seven days with the vinegar having the most pungent smell the biofilm that formed in the vinegar solution was likely candida albicans a microorganism which exists in humans 12 the film described by gulati and nobile 13 of a cloudy structure which forms on surfaces within 24 h as well as the structure of the organism when seen under a microscope matched what was observed in the vinegar flask experiment however further testing would be required to accurately identify this organism the bleach solution remained clear throughout the 7 days but it produced an unpleasant smell through further investigation it was established that the combination of sodium hypochlorite the principal ingredient in domestic bleach and ammonia can result in the release of toxic gases such as trichloramine 14 the following reactions can take place when bleach is added to a solution containing ammonia such as urine 3 2 n h 3 2 h o c l 2 n h 2 c l 2 h 2 o 4 2 n h 2 c l 2 h o c l 2 n h c l 2 2 h 2 o 5 2 n h c l 2 2 h o c l 2 n c l 3 2 h 2 o eq 2 shows the breakdown of sodium hypochlorite to hypochlorous acid which then reacts to form monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 in eqs 3 5 chloramines are toxic vapours which are strong irritants and can cause respiratory issues in people who perform cleaning tasks 14 another concerning by product of the addition of bleach to ammonia or urine is hydrazine yagil and anbar 15 explain that the hydrazine forms from the following reaction sequences 6 o h n h 2 c l n h c l h 2 o 7 n h c l n h c l 8 n h n h 3 n 2 h 2 9 n h c l n h 3 n 2 h 2 the chloramide nhcl forms from monochloramine eq 6 then either decomposes eq 7 and subsequently reacts with ammonia eq 8 or it reacts with the ammonia directly eq 9 hydrazine is a toxic liquid which forms if a significant amount of ammonia such as concentrated or stored urine is mixed with bleach 16 as a precaution the addition of bleach to urine stagnating in a toilet bowl should be discouraged special care should also be provided to cleaning staff in commercial buildings because they are associated with the highest risk during toilet cleaning and maintenance 14 fig 4 shows the filter papers after filtration they are arranged in the following order where the columns are for the control handwash water shower water vinegar and bleach and the rows are for the four repeats fig 4 c and d show two rows of filter papers this was due to the sample being unable to pass through one filter paper and thus a second filter paper was used it appears that there was no consistency in the type of solid that formed over the week this could be due to different concentrations of bacteria that had grown in each solution and warrants more detailed investigations fig 4 shows that the bleach solution other than the control remained the clearest during the week when filtering the solution it was found that the handwashing greywater and shower greywater solutions left behind a crystal like precipitate on the sides of the flasks that required chemical removal the bleach flask repeat d had a biofilm form on the surface of the solution from these experiments and the likely reactions that took place in the flasks it was found that the components present in the synthetic greywater aided in the precipitation of solids while vinegar and bleach were both solutions which initially reduced the precipitation potential of the urine these experiments should be repeated using real toilets for extended periods of operation in order to further validate these findings though in addition not only did the shower greywater have the highest ph after one week it also produced the second highest average concentration of solids with the smallest error range this along with the visual observations of the filter paper resulted in the 5 day experiment being performed using the shower greywater as the flushing fluid 3 3 1 5 day shower greywater experiment similar parameters were measured for the 5 day experiment such as ph change and concentration changes fig 5 shows that the ph of the solution increased to an average value of 9 22 for these experiments based on findings by udert and co workers 5 it was assumed that the urea had completely hydrolysed after five days using shower greywater as a flushing media with no additional chemicals would thus result in the precipitation of solids within a toilet bowl in less than two days fig 5 shows the calculated theoretical concentrations of the precipitates which was calculated assuming no precipitation hence the difference between the measured values and the calculated values were attributed to precipitates forming assuming that any concentration changes were due precipitation it can be seen that precipitation began after one day of operation using the ph levels and calcium and magnesium concentrations as indicators this occurred when the ph was above 7 which aligns with the work by udert and co workers 3 as well as ronteltop and co workers 6 who found that the precipitation of struvite occurred at a ph of 7 2 and a maximum precipitation potential occurred at a ph above 9 the average starting ph was 6 22 and after the first 24 h the ph was found to be 7 45 upon the addition of the urine for day 2 the ph decreased however the difference in the ph decrease when the new day started reduced over the 5 days from 0 55 for days 1 2 to 0 12 for days 4 5 the average urine ph was 6 53 for the 5 days and varied due to different urine compositions based upon the theoretical concentration calculations which assumed no precipitation was occurring fig 5 b shows that no calcium was used to form precipitates during the first day after 1 5 days the difference in the theoretical and measured calcium concentration was 12 3 mg l and the largest difference was found to be 53 0 mg l after 4 5 days this indicates that a calcium based precipitate had likely formed during the experiment udert and co workers 7 found that the limiting components for precipitation to occur in urine were calcium and magnesium ions the magnesium concentration comparison also showed that precipitation began after one day and at 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 days the measured concentration was found to be 89 40 9 8 and 31 of the theoretical concentration respectively this was the most significant difference of the three components tested this aligns with the findings of udert and co workers 7 and hence it was assumed that precipitation was limited by the presence of magnesium ions in the solution the differences in the measured and theoretical values was lowest for the phosphate ion concentration the average measured concentration was 88 of the theoretical value calculated this suggests that phosphate was not completely utilised during precipitation calcite caco3 was found to precipitate at high dilutions such as in conventional toilets while struvite mgnh4po4 6h20 precipitates at lower dilutions and hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 at a range of dilutions and in the presence of ions by udert and co workers 7 the conditions for these precipitates to form were met in this study however the precipitates were not identified in this study because of cost and equipment limitations it is thus recommended that further research be conducted that identifies the precipitates that form in real toilet systems when using greywater for toilet flushing the average amount of solids produced in the 5 day experiment was found to be 0 2148 g or 1 318 g l when scaling up the flask experiment to that of a toilet it was found that the mass of precipitates produced over five days was approximately 59 g l this equates to 706 g per year from one toilet for an assumed family of three people when considering the number of toilets which exist in cape town assuming one flushing toilet per 1 265 000 households of three people flushing with only shower greywater would add a solid load of 893 tons to the sewer network and wastewater treatment plants this calculation was performed assuming that the rate of precipitation would remain constant over time a preliminary calculation was then performed to provide a rough estimate of the intrusion of inorganic settleable solids iss into the sewer and wastewater systems using a moderate concentration of iss provided by 17 of 80 mg l and a return flow of 150 l person day the total iss in the network was calculated per day for the assumed cape town population as follows 50 150 1 265 000 3 28 5 t o n s i s s d a y this means that all the wastewater treatment plants in cape town deal with approximately 10 400 tons year of iss hence the 893 tons of precipitates added to the system as a result of shower greywater flushing would likely not be significant however what may be of significance is the immediate infrastructure of a toilet such as the trap siphon and piping connection to the sewer network which could become clogged with solids if precipitation is allowed to occur during reduced flushing periods such as a drought in addition some precipitates that had formed during these experiments could not be removed from the flasks by rinsing with water and had to be cleaned using a weak acid solution this suggests that precipitates could be growing inside household toilets and pipes without user s knowledge these precipitates could then serve as nuclei on which new precipitates grow this would then lead to solid build up in the pipes thus reducing their capacity and life span further research into this is imperative as this could become costly if the piping infrastructure must be constantly replaced 3 3 2 suggested guidelines for greywater toilet flushing and stagnating urine reduced toilet flushing and flushing with alternative fluids such as greywater has the potential to significantly reduce a household s water consumption 1 however allowing urine to stagnate in a toilet bowl and limited dilution because of reduced flushing will result in precipitates forming in the toilet bowl we suggest the following protocol based on this exploratory study to limit this 1 flush toilet contents with greywater but add bleach to the toilet bowl after the manual flush this will kill any urease producing bacteria in the toilet bowl reduce urea hydrolysis and thus limit precipitation adding bleach after a greywater flush also means that the bleach is not being added to a concentrated ammonium solution such as stagnated urine and hence the formation of harmful by products would be avoided 2 do not allow greywater to stagnate for more than 2 days because this can promote bacterial growth and malodours 3 do not flush with greywater for a period longer than two days without also disinfecting the toilet bowl with bleach 4 do not add bleach to stagnated urine because of the potential harmful by products that can form instead follow step 1 5 adding vinegar to a toilet bowl will reduce the ph of the solution and hence prevent precipitation but the acetate in the vinegar will promote bacterial growth we therefore recommend that vinegar not be added unless step 4 is followed in conjunction with this step alternatively waterless urinals that also recover nutrients could be used to save water 9 18 in households this would limit issues associated with stagnating urine in toilet bowls during periods of reduced toilet flushing while also recovering valuable resources the social acceptance and technical feasibility at a household level would have to also be assessed though for this method to be adopted 4 conclusions the results from this exploratory study have shown that using greywater for toilet flushing will result in precipitation occurring during periods of reduced flushing the consequences of this would likely be insignificant for wastewater treatment plants but the successive build up of solids in the toilet bowl and immediate pipe infrastructure is concerning and warrants further investigation in addition the choice of cleaning material and sequence of use is important for example adding bleach to stagnating urine in a toilet bowl should be avoided because harmful by products could form bleach should be added immediately after a greywater flush to prevent excessive bacterial growth the guidelines we have established in this work should be further developed in line with current water management practices the implications of this research are not only applicable to cape town but any place facing water scarcity where reuse of greywater for toilet flushing is implemented acknowledgements we wish to thank the university of cape town for their financial support the help from njabulo thela and hector mafungwa of the water quality lab is also greatly appreciated 
14338,cape town south africa has been experiencing its worse drought in decades as a result the city of cape town introduced water restrictions and encouraged residents to save water one solution was to reduce toilet flushing and allow urine to stagnate in toilet bowls another solution focused on using greywater specifically shower water to flush toilets this exploratory work focused on the impact of such solutions in terms of the precipitation potential of urine precipitation processes such as urea hydrolysis are governed by ph and since greywater and cleaning products can increase the ph of a solution these could also result in precipitation occurring we found that flushing with greywater results in ph values of 9 2 being reached within 2 days and significant precipitation occurring the solid build up of precipitates would add an estimated 893 tons of extra solids to the sewer network in cape town if everyone flushed their toilets with shower greywater only this is unlikely to negatively affect the sewer network but the excessive build up of solids could affect the immediate toilet and piping infrastructure causing blockages in addition adding bleach to stagnated urine should be avoided because of the harmful by products that could form as a result of these findings we developed a guideline for toilet flushing with greywater that aims to reduce the precipitation potential of urine greywater can be used to flush toilets but bleach or another disinfectant should be added immediately after the flush to limit excessive bacterial growth and ph fluctuations keywords cape town drought greywater scaling water saving 1 introduction cape town south africa has been experiencing its worse drought in decades it came close to day zero the day the taps were expected to run dry as a result of this drought the city of cape town implemented severe water restrictions based on levels of water consumption the most severe was level 6b which meant that capetonians were restricted to only using 50 litres per person per day 1 this resulted in significant water savings and a more than half reduction in water usage when compared to pre drought conditions the water demand for the city dropped from 1200 ml day in february 2015 to 500 ml day in february 2018 1 an incredible feat for a city of 4 1 million people many citizens implemented various water saving initiatives such as greywater recycling limited showers reduced flow adaptors for taps and greywater flushing for toilets in addition the saying if it s yellow let mellow became socially accepted this saying refers to people allowing urine to stagnate in toilet bowls while these initiatives did substantially reduce a household s water consumption 1 they might have had unforeseen consequences on the piping infrastructure connected to each toilet for example reduced toilet flushing resulted in an increased frequency of pipe blockages 2 also stagnating urine will allow the urea present in the urine to degrade increasing the ph of the solution and ultimately resulting in precipitation of solids 3 the precipitation of solids in urine has been researched before 3 however this research predominantly dealt with no mix toilets and waterless urinals the typical precipitates that have been found to form from the hydrolysis of urea in urine are struvite mgnh4po4 6h20 hydroxyapatite hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 and calcite caco3 4 the hydrolysis of urea refers to the breakdown of urea into carbonate ions and ammonium ions and is performed by urease producing bacteria which are commonly found in toilet systems 5 due to the degradation of urea the ph of the solution will increase to approximately 9 2 if the urine is allowed to stagnate 4 this increase in ph promotes the formation of solids such as hydroxyapatite struvite and calcite due to the increasing relative supersaturation 6 the precipitation amount has been estimated by simulation models developed by udert and co workers 7 the models developed and experiments performed were aimed at addressing the blockage issues and scaling in no mix toilets and waterless urinals since precipitation is governed by ph a high ph results in solid formation and considering that new toilet flushing solutions such as greywater can have different ph values and compositions when compared to conventional flushing solution it stands to reason then that the precipitation potential of urine could be affected also because urea hydrolysis is predominately influenced by urease producing bacteria 3 and since greywaters have higher concentrations of bacteria 8 this could also increase the rate of urea hydrolysis and hence precipitation other than flushing with greywater capetonians have also been adding vinegar and bleach to mask the smells emitted from stagnating urine the implications of using such products on the toilet system is also not well understood during drought conditions the purpose of this study was therefore to conduct an exploratory investigation into the precipitation potential when toilets are flushed with greywater and cleaned with products such as vinegar or bleach in addition the aim was to formulate preliminary guidelines for toilet flushing and cleaning routines during periods of drought that would limit precipitation in toilet and piping infrastructure 2 material and methods 2 1

precipitation would occur the ph was then measured after one week these results show that time had a significant impact on the ph and urea hydrolysis fig 2 shows the average ph values for the different fluid types after one week fig 2 shows that the ph of the shower greywater solution had the highest value the high ph values of both the handwashing greywater and shower greywater solutions after one week indicates that theoretically the urea present in the urine had hydrolysed and that precipitation had occurred during the experiment the ph of the vinegar solution decreased over the seven days while the ph of the bleach solution had a value of approximately 7 this was likely due to the disinfecting properties of the bleach which would kill the bacteria required to hydrolyse the urine the changing ph was used as an indicator for determining if precipitation had occurred fig 3 shows the results of the tss tests performed after one week it can be seen that the shower greywater handwashing greywater and vinegar resulted in similar amounts of solids forming the vinegar solution had formed a biological film layer on the surface in addition precipitates had formed at the bottom of the vinegar flask the significant error for the tss values shown in fig 3 could be attributed to the variation in urine used as well as variation in the tap water composition and degree of bacterial growth in each sample growth in the handwashing greywater formed as early as 36 h after the test began the shower greywater also resulted in a cloudy solution at this time the vinegar and bleach were still transparent while the bleach solution had a more yellow colour when compared to the vinegar solution after 60 h 2 5 days the handwashing greywater solution and shower greywater solution were cloudy and growths had formed on the surface of the solution the vinegar solution formed small spherical growths which remained suspended in the solution the bleach solution remained clear and smelled of chlorine the flask containing the vinegar solution had an orange precipitate on day 1 and on day 3 a biofilm growth could be seen the growth spread quickly and by day 4 it covered the surface of the solution obscuring the view into the solution it should be noted that all of the flasks except the control developed unpleasant smells over the seven days with the vinegar having the most pungent smell the biofilm that formed in the vinegar solution was likely candida albicans a microorganism which exists in humans 12 the film described by gulati and nobile 13 of a cloudy structure which forms on surfaces within 24 h as well as the structure of the organism when seen under a microscope matched what was observed in the vinegar flask experiment however further testing would be required to accurately identify this organism the bleach solution remained clear throughout the 7 days but it produced an unpleasant smell through further investigation it was established that the combination of sodium hypochlorite the principal ingredient in domestic bleach and ammonia can result in the release of toxic gases such as trichloramine 14 the following reactions can take place when bleach is added to a solution containing ammonia such as urine 3 2 n h 3 2 h o c l 2 n h 2 c l 2 h 2 o 4 2 n h 2 c l 2 h o c l 2 n h c l 2 2 h 2 o 5 2 n h c l 2 2 h o c l 2 n c l 3 2 h 2 o eq 2 shows the breakdown of sodium hypochlorite to hypochlorous acid which then reacts to form monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 in eqs 3 5 chloramines are toxic vapours which are strong irritants and can cause respiratory issues in people who perform cleaning tasks 14 another concerning by product of the addition of bleach to ammonia or urine is hydrazine yagil and anbar 15 explain that the hydrazine forms from the following reaction sequences 6 o h n h 2 c l n h c l h 2 o 7 n h c l n h c l 8 n h n h 3 n 2 h 2 9 n h c l n h 3 n 2 h 2 the chloramide nhcl forms from monochloramine eq 6 then either decomposes eq 7 and subsequently reacts with ammonia eq 8 or it reacts with the ammonia directly eq 9 hydrazine is a toxic liquid which forms if a significant amount of ammonia such as concentrated or stored urine is mixed with bleach 16 as a precaution the addition of bleach to urine stagnating in a toilet bowl should be discouraged special care should also be provided to cleaning staff in commercial buildings because they are associated with the highest risk during toilet cleaning and maintenance 14 fig 4 shows the filter papers after filtration they are arranged in the following order where the columns are for the control handwash water shower water vinegar and bleach and the rows are for the four repeats fig 4 c and d show two rows of filter papers this was due to the sample being unable to pass through one filter paper and thus a second filter paper was used it appears that there was no consistency in the type of solid that formed over the week this could be due to different concentrations of bacteria that had grown in each solution and warrants more detailed investigations fig 4 shows that the bleach solution other than the control remained the clearest during the week when filtering the solution it was found that the handwashing greywater and shower greywater solutions left behind a crystal like precipitate on the sides of the flasks that required chemical removal the bleach flask repeat d had a biofilm form on the surface of the solution from these experiments and the likely reactions that took place in the flasks it was found that the components present in the synthetic greywater aided in the precipitation of solids while vinegar and bleach were both solutions which initially reduced the precipitation potential of the urine these experiments should be repeated using real toilets for extended periods of operation in order to further validate these findings though in addition not only did the shower greywater have the highest ph after one week it also produced the second highest average concentration of solids with the smallest error range this along with the visual observations of the filter paper resulted in the 5 day experiment being performed using the shower greywater as the flushing fluid 3 3 1 5 day shower greywater experiment similar parameters were measured for the 5 day experiment such as ph change and concentration changes fig 5 shows that the ph of the solution increased to an average value of 9 22 for these experiments based on findings by udert and co workers 5 it was assumed that the urea had completely hydrolysed after five days using shower greywater as a flushing media with no additional chemicals would thus result in the precipitation of solids within a toilet bowl in less than two days fig 5 shows the calculated theoretical concentrations of the precipitates which was calculated assuming no precipitation hence the difference between the measured values and the calculated values were attributed to precipitates forming assuming that any concentration changes were due precipitation it can be seen that precipitation began after one day of operation using the ph levels and calcium and magnesium concentrations as indicators this occurred when the ph was above 7 which aligns with the work by udert and co workers 3 as well as ronteltop and co workers 6 who found that the precipitation of struvite occurred at a ph of 7 2 and a maximum precipitation potential occurred at a ph above 9 the average starting ph was 6 22 and after the first 24 h the ph was found to be 7 45 upon the addition of the urine for day 2 the ph decreased however the difference in the ph decrease when the new day started reduced over the 5 days from 0 55 for days 1 2 to 0 12 for days 4 5 the average urine ph was 6 53 for the 5 days and varied due to different urine compositions based upon the theoretical concentration calculations which assumed no precipitation was occurring fig 5 b shows that no calcium was used to form precipitates during the first day after 1 5 days the difference in the theoretical and measured calcium concentration was 12 3 mg l and the largest difference was found to be 53 0 mg l after 4 5 days this indicates that a calcium based precipitate had likely formed during the experiment udert and co workers 7 found that the limiting components for precipitation to occur in urine were calcium and magnesium ions the magnesium concentration comparison also showed that precipitation began after one day and at 1 5 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 days the measured concentration was found to be 89 40 9 8 and 31 of the theoretical concentration respectively this was the most significant difference of the three components tested this aligns with the findings of udert and co workers 7 and hence it was assumed that precipitation was limited by the presence of magnesium ions in the solution the differences in the measured and theoretical values was lowest for the phosphate ion concentration the average measured concentration was 88 of the theoretical value calculated this suggests that phosphate was not completely utilised during precipitation calcite caco3 was found to precipitate at high dilutions such as in conventional toilets while struvite mgnh4po4 6h20 precipitates at lower dilutions and hap ca10 po4 6 oh 2 at a range of dilutions and in the presence of ions by udert and co workers 7 the conditions for these precipitates to form were met in this study however the precipitates were not identified in this study because of cost and equipment limitations it is thus recommended that further research be conducted that identifies the precipitates that form in real toilet systems when using greywater for toilet flushing the average amount of solids produced in the 5 day experiment was found to be 0 2148 g or 1 318 g l when scaling up the flask experiment to that of a toilet it was found that the mass of precipitates produced over five days was approximately 59 g l this equates to 706 g per year from one toilet for an assumed family of three people when considering the number of toilets which exist in cape town assuming one flushing toilet per 1 265 000 households of three people flushing with only shower greywater would add a solid load of 893 tons to the sewer network and wastewater treatment plants this calculation was performed assuming that the rate of precipitation would remain constant over time a preliminary calculation was then performed to provide a rough estimate of the intrusion of inorganic settleable solids iss into the sewer and wastewater systems using a moderate concentration of iss provided by 17 of 80 mg l and a return flow of 150 l person day the total iss in the network was calculated per day for the assumed cape town population as follows 50 150 1 265 000 3 28 5 t o n s i s s d a y this means that all the wastewater treatment plants in cape town deal with approximately 10 400 tons year of iss hence the 893 tons of precipitates added to the system as a result of shower greywater flushing would likely not be significant however what may be of significance is the immediate infrastructure of a toilet such as the trap siphon and piping connection to the sewer network which could become clogged with solids if precipitation is allowed to occur during reduced flushing periods such as a drought in addition some precipitates that had formed during these experiments could not be removed from the flasks by rinsing with water and had to be cleaned using a weak acid solution this suggests that precipitates could be growing inside household toilets and pipes without user s knowledge these precipitates could then serve as nuclei on which new precipitates grow this would then lead to solid build up in the pipes thus reducing their capacity and life span further research into this is imperative as this could become costly if the piping infrastructure must be constantly replaced 3 3 2 suggested guidelines for greywater toilet flushing and stagnating urine reduced toilet flushing and flushing with alternative fluids such as greywater has the potential to significantly reduce a household s water consumption 1 however allowing urine to stagnate in a toilet bowl and limited dilution because of reduced flushing will result in precipitates forming in the toilet bowl we suggest the following protocol based on this exploratory study to limit this 1 flush toilet contents with greywater but add bleach to the toilet bowl after the manual flush this will kill any urease producing bacteria in the toilet bowl reduce urea hydrolysis and thus limit precipitation adding bleach after a greywater flush also means that the bleach is not being added to a concentrated ammonium solution such as stagnated urine and hence the formation of harmful by products would be avoided 2 do not allow greywater to stagnate for more than 2 days because this can promote bacterial growth and malodours 3 do not flush with greywater for a period longer than two days without also disinfecting the toilet bowl with bleach 4 do not add bleach to stagnated urine because of the potential harmful by products that can form instead follow step 1 5 adding vinegar to a toilet bowl will reduce the ph of the solution and hence prevent precipitation but the acetate in the vinegar will promote bacterial growth we therefore recommend that vinegar not be added unless step 4 is followed in conjunction with this step alternatively waterless urinals that also recover nutrients could be used to save water 9 18 in households this would limit issues associated with stagnating urine in toilet bowls during periods of reduced toilet flushing while also recovering valuable resources the social acceptance and technical feasibility at a household level would have to also be assessed though for this method to be adopted 4 conclusions the results from this exploratory study have shown that using greywater for toilet flushing will result in precipitation occurring during periods of reduced flushing the consequences of this would likely be insignificant for wastewater treatment plants but the successive build up of solids in the toilet bowl and immediate pipe infrastructure is concerning and warrants further investigation in addition the choice of cleaning material and sequence of use is important for example adding bleach to stagnating urine in a toilet bowl should be avoided because harmful by products could form bleach should be added immediately after a greywater flush to prevent excessive bacterial growth the guidelines we have established in this work should be further developed in line with current water management practices the implications of this research are not only applicable to cape town but any place facing water scarcity where reuse of greywater for toilet flushing is implemented acknowledgements we wish to thank the university of cape town for their financial support the help from njabulo thela and hector mafungwa of the water quality lab is also greatly appreciated 
14339,oil in saltwater emulsions produced to simulate contaminated bilge water were successfully treated by electrochemical oxidation of iron anodes electrocoagulation turbidity measurements of the as prepared emulsions before and after treatment show a reduction in turbidity of over 98 while application of a permanent magnet was found to be effective in reducing the settling time for the fe oxide containing sludge solution temperature was found to be the most critical parameter for influencing the efficiency of the electrocoagulation process while electrode separation and solution contents i e the presence of surfactants and oil had less of an influence especially for a solution temperature of 45 c characterization of the fe oxide precipitates by electron microscopy x ray diffraction and vibrating sample magnetometry confirmed that the products were nano sized crystallites assignable to either fe3o4 or γ fe2o3 all measurements indicated that a secondary phase was present which appeared as a varied particle morphology a weak diffraction peak in some samples and a reduced magnetic saturation these results indicate that further optimization of the electrocoagulation process may be possible which could further improve the magnetic response of the fe oxide containing sludge keywords electrocoagulation feox oil in water emulsions o w emulsions magnetic filtration wastewater treatment 1 introduction oil in water emulsions are a pervasive and challenging issue for the naval wastewater treatment community as the cost and efficacy of treatment systems must meet rigorous space and energy constraints oil removal from shipboard wastewater streams is typically achieved by mechanical filtration however membrane fouling increases the frequency and cost associated with maintenance electrocoagulation ec also referred to as electroflocculation is one of several alternative techniques for disrupting oil in water emulsions by in situ production of metal cations via electrochemical oxidation of a sacrificial metal anode typically fe or al 1 introduction of metal cations into the solution can destabilize the surface charge of colloidal particles allowing oil droplets to coalesce forming flocs while gas formation during the electrochemical process aids in floating these flocs to the surface of the wastewater solution for removal by simple skimming as an et al pointed out in their review of oily wastewater treatment by ec several parameters such as solution ph supporting electrolyte salts electrode choice and total oil content can influence the efficacy of the ec process 1 as a result ec processes are typically optimized for a given waste stream several groups have investigated ec as a treatment route for bilge water containing emulsified oils in various concentrations of seawater 2 4 asselin et al found that ec treatment of oily bilge water using fe and al electrodes was equally effective in reducing the concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons suspended solids and turbidity among other parameters while fe electrodes were found to be more cost effective when considering electrode consumption and energy required 2 their study also highlighted the need for sludge removal following the ec treatment process which they accomplished by means of a chemical flocculent to accelerate settling time meanwhile aswathy et al reported a significantly increased efficiency in reducing the soluble chemical oxygen demand when using al electrodes as compared to fe electrodes which they attributed to a greater current density for the al electrodes under a given applied potential and a greater sensitivity to fe oxidation products following chemical reactions 3 for both electrode metals the initially formed electrode product is typically cited as an fe or al cation which can subsequently form the corresponding metal hydroxide through a hydrolysis reaction depending on ph 1 2 4 6 in at least one study the product phases formed by dissolution of an al anode were analyzed by xrd and ftir revealing the formation of both hydroxides and oxides i e alo oh al oh 3 and al2o3 3 in a review by moussa et al they highlight a discrepancy in the literature regarding the predominant fe cation formed during electrochemical oxidation of fe in ec applications with some authors reporting fe2 and others fe3 with the higher oxidation state being reportedly more effective at coagulating wastewater components 5 by careful observation of total fe content by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and determination of fe2 concentrations by complexation with 1 10 phenanthroline and 510 nm wavelength light absorption sasson et al reported that over a wide range of ph 5 9 and current densities 0 05 0 4 a only fe2 cations were produced during electrocoagulation 7 elsewhere in the literature electrochemical oxidation of sacrificial iron anodes has another purpose namely the production of fe oxide nanoparticles while the precipitates formed by electrocoagulation are generally seen as a waste product in the ec community iron oxide nanoparticles have a variety of applications depending on the phase formed with the magnetic properties of certain crystalline phases being a particularly active area of investigation 8 in fact there is significant overlap in the experimental design and solution parameters of ec processes using fe anodes and the synthesis of fe oxide nanoparticles in both cases a sacrificial anode is typically subjected to either a dc voltage or current while solution ph temperature and additives i e supporting electrolyte salts or surfactants electrode spacing and current density are manipulated to achieve the desired result one important distinction between these fields of research is solutions used for synthesis of fe oxide nanoparticles typically have a much lower supporting electrolyte concentration than those used for ec especially in the case of bilge water studies in which seawater or dilutions of seawater are used as the supporting electrolyte 2 4 fajaroh et al demonstrated that fe3o4 nanoparticles could be produced by electrochemical oxidation of an iron anode in de ionized water without any supporting electrolyte 9 however the addition of naoh meant to mimic the formation of oh anions at the cathode or changes in the electrode separation 2 6 cm and current density 205 325 μa cm2 were found to strongly influence the observed product 9 in a similar investigation starowicz et al found that partially replacing the water content of a 0 1 m licl solution with ethanol could control nanoparticle size and size dependent magnetization however below a certain threshold the produced phase changed from magnetite fe3o4 to ferrihydrite fe2o3 h2o indicating that water molecules play a role in determining the final product of electrochemical and chemical reactions 10 for solutions containing 0 04 m of tetramethylammonium chloride me4ncl as a supporting electrolyte cabrera et al reported that even for current densities up to 200 ma cm2 homogenous fe3o4 nanoparticles could be produced provided the potential between the iron working electrode and larger iron counter electrode at 1 cm separation did not exceed 6 v 11 in this study we have evaluated electrocoagulation ec as one route for the pre treatment of oil in water emulsions using surrogate seawater concentrations 0 5 m nacl an oil simulant navy standard bilge mix 4 and a mixture of non ionic triton x 100 and ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactants commonly found in navy bilge water waste streams 12 the goal of this study was to determine whether typical conditions for synthesizing magnetic fe oxide nanoparticles could be applied directly to an oily bilge water simulant in an effort to simultaneously treat the wastewater stream by ec and to produce magnetic nanoparticles the produced nanoparticles would be leveraged in the sludge removal process via a secondary magnetic filtration stage 2 materials and methods oil in saltwater emulsions were prepared using a concentration of sodium chloride slightly below average seawater 0 5 m as compared to 0 6 m of average seawater because dilution in the bilge is expected along with 1000 ppm navy standard bilge mix 4 nsbm4 and 100 ppm of total surfactant using triton x 100 tx 100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in a 1 1

all solutions were prepared in 1 l batches using laboratory grade reagents from sigma aldrich and distilled water and emulsified using an immersion homogenizer omni tissue master 125 for a period of 30 s at 50 of the maximum speed approximately 20 000 rpm electrocoagulation experiments were conducted with coupons of 99 5 fe metal goodfellow with active dimensions of 1 cm x 1 cm x 0 2 mm as working electrodes a platinum wire counter electrode and a silver silver chloride ag agcl in saturated kcl reference electrode each electrocoagulation experiment utilized 250 ml of prepared solution which was emulsified immediately prior to use all experiments were conducted at a fixed anodic current density of 200 ma cm2 based on the initial area of the working electrode and test duration of 30 min using a potentiostat galvanostat gamry reference 600 solution temperature and distance between the working electrodes were varied at 25 c or 45 c and 1 cm or 3 cm respectively to evaluate the influence of electrochemical over potential on the anodization product phase and morphology solution temperature was maintained throughout the experiment using a temperature controlled water bath a schematic depiction of the experimental setup is shown in the supporting information figure s1 emulsions were characterized before and after electrocoagulation by measuring turbidity hach 2100q portable turbidimeter which was calibrated using standard solutions prior to use turbidity measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu is used in this study as an indirect measurement of oil content in the simulated wastewater solution and has been shown in previous studies to be correlated with other measurable parameters related to oil removal 2 4 following procedures described in eaton et al aliquots of as prepared and ec treated solutions were gently mixed by inverting a 20 ml vial which had been thoroughly cleaned and de greased using laboratory glassware soap rinsed in distilled water and dried with a lint free laboratory tissue 13 sealed vials were degassed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 s to minimize air bubbles and then wiped with a thin layer of silicone oil to minimize light scattering on the glass vial measurements were taken three times for each sample and averaged over multiple identical samples feox nanoparticles produced by the ec process can also influence turbidity and for this reason turbidity measurements were collected both immediately after gentle mixing and after a period of 24 h of natural settling to determine whether the feox particles introduced during the ec process could be readily manipulated by a magnetic field a 0 47 t permanent magnet was placed under a sample vial containing the treated solution after a period of 1 h the supernatant was collected remixed according to the above procedure and used for the turbidity measurements natural settling of solutions containing feox precipitates was also observed after 1 h and the turbidity of these solutions was collected as a comparison following the electrocoagulation experiment precipitates were extracted from the solution by vacuum filtration and 0 22 μm filter and rinsed several times

treatment with electrocoagulation with a neutral ph 7 as determined by a laboratory ph test strip figure s2 application of 200 ma cm2 of anodic current resulted in an immediate formation of gas bubbles at the pt counter electrode while an orange foam was formed at the fe working electrode which eventually became a brown precipitate working electrode potential was monitored against an ag agcl reference electrode and found to be sensitive to both the distance between the counter electrode and working electrode solution temperature and solution composition as shown in fig 1 at a temperature of 25 c the electrode separation and electrolyte solution has a large influence on the observed working electrode potential larger electrode distances raise the observed working electrode potential which is expected based on electrochemical kinetics the presence of oil and surfactant were both observed to increase the necessary potential for fe oxidation with the pure saltwater solution solution c having the lowest working electrode potential when evaluated at 25 c from our testing it is not immediately clear whether this is due to a passivation of the working electrode by adsorbed oil or surfactant molecules or a more complex mechanism pertaining to the formation of fe cations for the tests conducted at 45 c the working electrode potential is found to be relatively insensitive to electrode separation and electrolyte solution composition presumably due to enhanced electrolyte conductivity and improved kinetics at the working electrode for the dissolution of fe cations relative to the experiments conducted at 25 c in the experimental conditions used 25 c and 45 c with very low concentrations of fe species in the solution the primary reaction occurring at the working electrode is assumed to be the oxidation of fe metal to fe2 cations eq 1 1 f e s o l i d f e 2 2 e which has a standard electrode potential of 0 44 v vs the standard hydrogen electrode she 0 64 v vs ag agcl 14 however significant over potentials are observed as shown in fig 1 and working electrode potentials of 0 2 v vs ag agcl and above are observed for every combination of electrolyte solution temperature and electrode separation all experiments show an initial decrease in working electrode potential which is attributed to the removal of a passivation layer on the fe surface followed by a steady increase in potential for the duration of the experiment this steadily rising potential is likely due to the decreasing area of the fe electrode which increases the effective current density above the nominal 200 ma cm2 in one case solution a at 3 cm and 25 c the final working electrode potential is above the standard electrode potential for the formation of insoluble fe2o3 0 72 v vs ag agcl and involves a second electron transfer reaction with fe2 cations formed at lower potentials as shown in eq 2 2 2 f e 2 3 h 2 o f e 2 o 3 s o l i d 6 h 2 e at the conclusion of the electrocoagulation process a large amount of brown precipitates were observed in the solution due to the gas formation at the counter electrode these precipitates remained dispersed in solution for the duration of the experiment but eventually settled out of solution afterward when checked immediately following the anodization process the solution ph was found to be slightly basic ph 10 11 which is consistent with the assumed reaction occurring at the counter electrode shown in eq 3 3 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 g a s 2 o h however when measured again an hour after the experiment the ph of the solution returned to neutral ph 7 indicating ensuing chemical reactions consumed the hydroxyl groups several authors have suggested that the initially released fe2 cations eventually result in a product of fe3o4 magnetite following chemical or electrochemical reactions generally involving oh produced at the cathode eq 3 9 11 the formation of magnetite which requires some fe3 cations implies an additional oxidation step following the initial electrochemical formation of fe2 cabrera proposed a direct electrochemical oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at the anode followed by a precipitation of fe oh 3 which was in turn electrochemically reduced at the cathode to fe3o4 11 fajaroh proposed an alternate route in which fe oh 2 was the first formed precipitate and subsequently chemically oxidized to feo oh by oxygen gas dissolved in solution which also led to fe3o4 formation by a reaction between feo oh and fe oh 2 9 the initially observed orange particulate foam could be attributed to the formation of feo oh which is described as orange or reddish brown while the decrease in solution ph following the experiment seems consistent with the formation of fe3o4 described by fajaroh 8 9 however magnetite is typically described as a black precipitate which was never observed in our case 8 10 11 the iron working electrodes were found to be partially corroded away figure s3 after the electrocoagulation process and mass loss across all cases was found to be an average of 104 4 mg this is consistent with an assumed reaction of 2 e per mole of fe consumed to form fe2 cations which provides a theoretical mass loss of 104 1 mg as shown in faraday s law of electrolysis eq 4 4 m a s s l o s s g i t m w n f wherein the electrode mass loss in grams can be related to the total charge consumed by fe oxidation current i multiplied by time t 0 2 a 1800s 360 c n is the valence of the electrolysis product fe2 n 2 mw is the molecular weight of fe metal 55 845 g mol and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol the electrode mass loss and energy per unit mass of electrode lost is summarized in table s2 which shows that the electrochemical oxidation of fe is most efficient for a solution at 45 c and slightly more efficient for shorter electrode separations energy was calculated based on the working electrode potential and while counter electrode potential was not directly measured the over potential for h2 evolution using a platinum electrode is expected to be fairly constant 3 2 magnetic separation of treated solutions the precipitates formed during electrocoagulation were found to be highly responsive to a permanent magnet within a few seconds of placing a freshly treated sample of solution b onto a 0 47 t magnet the brown precipitate was rapidly drawn to the base of the sample vial figure s4 after a period of 60 min with no magnetic field some fraction of the electrochemically produced feox precipitates remain dispersed in solution however the magnetically separated solutions have noticeably improved clarity as shown in fig 2 after only 5 min of settling under the influence of a permanent magnet most of the visible suspended precipitates have been drawn out of solution conversely under natural settling a large amount of precipitates remain suspended in solution after an hour turbidity measurements were conducted on as prepared solution a solution b solution c and distilled water without ec treatment or separation to determine baseline turbidity of the solutions samples of solution b treated by the electrocoagulation process were analyzed with and without magnetic separation table 1 immediately after gentle mixing the untreated solution b shows a turbidity value above 200 ntu several orders of magnitude above distilled water or a solution a containing only surfactants and salt samples of ec treated solution b were found to have comparable turbidity values to solution a but still slightly higher than distilled water or solution c which implies that some amount of observed turbidity was due to the formation of air bubbles stabilized by surfactant molecules that were not removed by sonication in comparison to ec solutions subjected to a magnetic field solutions treated by ec and only allowed to settle for 60 min had significantly higher turbidity values fig 2 after an additional 24 h of natural settling all solutions were found to have a lower turbidity than the as prepared solution from the results shown in table 1 it can be concluded that electrocoagulation using the described method is highly effective for reducing solution turbidity of the emulsified oil surfactant solutions and that the application of a magnetic field can significantly decrease the settling time required to observe reduced turbidity 3 3 precipitate morphology composition and crystallinity sem analysis of powders extracted from the ec treated solutions showed consistent morphology regardless of solution temperature electrode distance or the presence of surfactant all samples contained predominately spherical particles with diameters in the range of 50 100 nm fig 3 with the smallest discernable particles having diameters closer to 20 30 nm however significant agglomeration was observed making determination of primary particle size by sem difficult previous reports describing electrochemical synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles also reported spherical particles on the order of 20 30 nm 9 11 average particle size for all experimental conditions derived from at least 20 particles for each sample is shown in figure s5 samples produced at 25 c and 1 cm electrode distance were found to be slightly smaller than at 3 cm electrode distance regardless of the electrolyte solution used while samples produced at 45 c show no clear dependence on electrode separation or electrolyte solution used resulting in overlapping error bars for all conditions evaluated in some regions non spherical crystallites are observed with needle or plate like morphologies no experimental conditions appeared to favor spherical over multi faceted particles and these features appeared for every experimental condition evaluated chemical analysis by eds showed that no insoluble na or cl containing compounds were formed during the ec experiment and in addition to fe and o only the ni substrate au conductive coating and minor c contamination possibly residual oil or surfactant is observed fig 4 furthermore the fe o atomic ratio as determined from the fe kα and o kα x ray peaks was between 0 58 and 0 72 for all experimental conditions averaged between three regions in each sample which indicates an average oxidation state of fe2 7 to fe3 4 fe o atomic ratios for all experimental conditions are shown in figure s6 as discussed earlier several authors have suggested that electrode distance can play a role in the observed product phase when forming feox nanoparticles by the electrochemical oxidation of fe working electrodes 9 samples produced with a shorter electrode separation 1 cm in the present case are expected to have the greatest local ph variation due to the production of oh at the counter electrode eq 3 samples produced at 1 cm separation distance in all solutions were further analyzed by xrd and vsm to determine the influence if any production conditions have on the phase of feox while the varying morphology shown in fig 3 indicates that more than one phase may exist in the as prepared precipitates all samples were found to contain one dominant crystalline component regardless of synthesis

14339,oil in saltwater emulsions produced to simulate contaminated bilge water were successfully treated by electrochemical oxidation of iron anodes electrocoagulation turbidity measurements of the as prepared emulsions before and after treatment show a reduction in turbidity of over 98 while application of a permanent magnet was found to be effective in reducing the settling time for the fe oxide containing sludge solution temperature was found to be the most critical parameter for influencing the efficiency of the electrocoagulation process while electrode separation and solution contents i e the presence of surfactants and oil had less of an influence especially for a solution temperature of 45 c characterization of the fe oxide precipitates by electron microscopy x ray diffraction and vibrating sample magnetometry confirmed that the products were nano sized crystallites assignable to either fe3o4 or γ fe2o3 all measurements indicated that a secondary phase was present which appeared as a varied particle morphology a weak diffraction peak in some samples and a reduced magnetic saturation these results indicate that further optimization of the electrocoagulation process may be possible which could further improve the magnetic response of the fe oxide containing sludge keywords electrocoagulation feox oil in water emulsions o w emulsions magnetic filtration wastewater treatment 1 introduction oil in water emulsions are a pervasive and challenging issue for the naval wastewater treatment community as the cost and efficacy of treatment systems must meet rigorous space and energy constraints oil removal from shipboard wastewater streams is typically achieved by mechanical filtration however membrane fouling increases the frequency and cost associated with maintenance electrocoagulation ec also referred to as electroflocculation is one of several alternative techniques for disrupting oil in water emulsions by in situ production of metal cations via electrochemical oxidation of a sacrificial metal anode typically fe or al 1 introduction of metal cations into the solution can destabilize the surface charge of colloidal particles allowing oil droplets to coalesce forming flocs while gas formation during the electrochemical process aids in floating these flocs to the surface of the wastewater solution for removal by simple skimming as an et al pointed out in their review of oily wastewater treatment by ec several parameters such as solution ph supporting electrolyte salts electrode choice and total oil content can influence the efficacy of the ec process 1 as a result ec processes are typically optimized for a given waste stream several groups have investigated ec as a treatment route for bilge water containing emulsified oils in various concentrations of seawater 2 4 asselin et al found that ec treatment of oily bilge water using fe and al electrodes was equally effective in reducing the concentration of petroleum hydrocarbons suspended solids and turbidity among other parameters while fe electrodes were found to be more cost effective when considering electrode consumption and energy required 2 their study also highlighted the need for sludge removal following the ec treatment process which they accomplished by means of a chemical flocculent to accelerate settling time meanwhile aswathy et al reported a significantly increased efficiency in reducing the soluble chemical oxygen demand when using al electrodes as compared to fe electrodes which they attributed to a greater current density for the al electrodes under a given applied potential and a greater sensitivity to fe oxidation products following chemical reactions 3 for both electrode metals the initially formed electrode product is typically cited as an fe or al cation which can subsequently form the corresponding metal hydroxide through a hydrolysis reaction depending on ph 1 2 4 6 in at least one study the product phases formed by dissolution of an al anode were analyzed by xrd and ftir revealing the formation of both hydroxides and oxides i e alo oh al oh 3 and al2o3 3 in a review by moussa et al they highlight a discrepancy in the literature regarding the predominant fe cation formed during electrochemical oxidation of fe in ec applications with some authors reporting fe2 and others fe3 with the higher oxidation state being reportedly more effective at coagulating wastewater components 5 by careful observation of total fe content by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy and determination of fe2 concentrations by complexation with 1 10 phenanthroline and 510 nm wavelength light absorption sasson et al reported that over a wide range of ph 5 9 and current densities 0 05 0 4 a only fe2 cations were produced during electrocoagulation 7 elsewhere in the literature electrochemical oxidation of sacrificial iron anodes has another purpose namely the production of fe oxide nanoparticles while the precipitates formed by electrocoagulation are generally seen as a waste product in the ec community iron oxide nanoparticles have a variety of applications depending on the phase formed with the magnetic properties of certain crystalline phases being a particularly active area of investigation 8 in fact there is significant overlap in the experimental design and solution parameters of ec processes using fe anodes and the synthesis of fe oxide nanoparticles in both cases a sacrificial anode is typically subjected to either a dc voltage or current while solution ph temperature and additives i e supporting electrolyte salts or surfactants electrode spacing and current density are manipulated to achieve the desired result one important distinction between these fields of research is solutions used for synthesis of fe oxide nanoparticles typically have a much lower supporting electrolyte concentration than those used for ec especially in the case of bilge water studies in which seawater or dilutions of seawater are used as the supporting electrolyte 2 4 fajaroh et al demonstrated that fe3o4 nanoparticles could be produced by electrochemical oxidation of an iron anode in de ionized water without any supporting electrolyte 9 however the addition of naoh meant to mimic the formation of oh anions at the cathode or changes in the electrode separation 2 6 cm and current density 205 325 μa cm2 were found to strongly influence the observed product 9 in a similar investigation starowicz et al found that partially replacing the water content of a 0 1 m licl solution with ethanol could control nanoparticle size and size dependent magnetization however below a certain threshold the produced phase changed from magnetite fe3o4 to ferrihydrite fe2o3 h2o indicating that water molecules play a role in determining the final product of electrochemical and chemical reactions 10 for solutions containing 0 04 m of tetramethylammonium chloride me4ncl as a supporting electrolyte cabrera et al reported that even for current densities up to 200 ma cm2 homogenous fe3o4 nanoparticles could be produced provided the potential between the iron working electrode and larger iron counter electrode at 1 cm separation did not exceed 6 v 11 in this study we have evaluated electrocoagulation ec as one route for the pre treatment of oil in water emulsions using surrogate seawater concentrations 0 5 m nacl an oil simulant navy standard bilge mix 4 and a mixture of non ionic triton x 100 and ionic sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactants commonly found in navy bilge water waste streams 12 the goal of this study was to determine whether typical conditions for synthesizing magnetic fe oxide nanoparticles could be applied directly to an oily bilge water simulant in an effort to simultaneously treat the wastewater stream by ec and to produce magnetic nanoparticles the produced nanoparticles would be leveraged in the sludge removal process via a secondary magnetic filtration stage 2 materials and methods oil in saltwater emulsions were prepared using a concentration of sodium chloride slightly below average seawater 0 5 m as compared to 0 6 m of average seawater because dilution in the bilge is expected along with 1000 ppm navy standard bilge mix 4 nsbm4 and 100 ppm of total surfactant using triton x 100 tx 100 and sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in a 1 1

all solutions were prepared in 1 l batches using laboratory grade reagents from sigma aldrich and distilled water and emulsified using an immersion homogenizer omni tissue master 125 for a period of 30 s at 50 of the maximum speed approximately 20 000 rpm electrocoagulation experiments were conducted with coupons of 99 5 fe metal goodfellow with active dimensions of 1 cm x 1 cm x 0 2 mm as working electrodes a platinum wire counter electrode and a silver silver chloride ag agcl in saturated kcl reference electrode each electrocoagulation experiment utilized 250 ml of prepared solution which was emulsified immediately prior to use all experiments were conducted at a fixed anodic current density of 200 ma cm2 based on the initial area of the working electrode and test duration of 30 min using a potentiostat galvanostat gamry reference 600 solution temperature and distance between the working electrodes were varied at 25 c or 45 c and 1 cm or 3 cm respectively to evaluate the influence of electrochemical over potential on the anodization product phase and morphology solution temperature was maintained throughout the experiment using a temperature controlled water bath a schematic depiction of the experimental setup is shown in the supporting information figure s1 emulsions were characterized before and after electrocoagulation by measuring turbidity hach 2100q portable turbidimeter which was calibrated using standard solutions prior to use turbidity measured in nephelometric turbidity units ntu is used in this study as an indirect measurement of oil content in the simulated wastewater solution and has been shown in previous studies to be correlated with other measurable parameters related to oil removal 2 4 following procedures described in eaton et al aliquots of as prepared and ec treated solutions were gently mixed by inverting a 20 ml vial which had been thoroughly cleaned and de greased using laboratory glassware soap rinsed in distilled water and dried with a lint free laboratory tissue 13 sealed vials were degassed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 s to minimize air bubbles and then wiped with a thin layer of silicone oil to minimize light scattering on the glass vial measurements were taken three times for each sample and averaged over multiple identical samples feox nanoparticles produced by the ec process can also influence turbidity and for this reason turbidity measurements were collected both immediately after gentle mixing and after a period of 24 h of natural settling to determine whether the feox particles introduced during the ec process could be readily manipulated by a magnetic field a 0 47 t permanent magnet was placed under a sample vial containing the treated solution after a period of 1 h the supernatant was collected remixed according to the above procedure and used for the turbidity measurements natural settling of solutions containing feox precipitates was also observed after 1 h and the turbidity of these solutions was collected as a comparison following the electrocoagulation experiment precipitates were extracted from the solution by vacuum filtration and 0 22 μm filter and rinsed several times with distilled water then dried at room temperature dried powders were collected and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds to determine morphology

container was subtracted from the measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrocoagulation and solution characteristics as prepared emulsions had a cloudy and translucent appearance prior to treatment with electrocoagulation with a neutral ph 7 as determined by a laboratory ph test strip figure s2 application of 200 ma cm2 of anodic current resulted in an immediate formation of gas bubbles at the pt counter electrode while an orange foam was formed at the fe working electrode which eventually became a brown precipitate working electrode potential was monitored against an ag agcl reference electrode and found to be sensitive to both the distance between the counter electrode and working electrode solution temperature and solution composition as shown in fig 1 at a temperature of 25 c the electrode separation and electrolyte solution has a large influence on the observed working electrode potential larger electrode distances raise the observed working electrode potential which is expected based on electrochemical kinetics the presence of oil and surfactant were both observed to increase the necessary potential for fe oxidation with the pure saltwater solution solution c having the lowest working electrode potential when evaluated at 25 c from our testing it is not immediately clear whether this is due to a passivation of the working electrode by adsorbed oil or surfactant molecules or a more complex mechanism pertaining to the formation of fe cations for the tests conducted at 45 c the working electrode potential is found to be relatively insensitive to electrode separation and electrolyte solution composition presumably due to enhanced electrolyte conductivity and improved kinetics at the working electrode for the dissolution of fe cations relative to the experiments conducted at 25 c in the experimental conditions used 25 c and 45 c with very low concentrations of fe species in the solution the primary reaction occurring at the working electrode is assumed to be the oxidation of fe metal to fe2 cations eq 1 1 f e s o l i d f e 2 2 e which has a standard electrode potential of 0 44 v vs the standard hydrogen electrode she 0 64 v vs ag agcl 14 however significant over potentials are observed as shown in fig 1 and working electrode potentials of 0 2 v vs ag agcl and above are observed for every combination of electrolyte solution temperature and electrode separation all experiments show an initial decrease in working electrode potential which is attributed to the removal of a passivation layer on the fe surface followed by a steady increase in potential for the duration of the experiment this steadily rising potential is likely due to the decreasing area of the fe electrode which increases the effective current density above the nominal 200 ma cm2 in one case solution a at 3 cm and 25 c the final working electrode potential is above the standard electrode potential for the formation of insoluble fe2o3 0 72 v vs ag agcl and involves a second electron transfer reaction with fe2 cations formed at lower potentials as shown in eq 2 2 2 f e 2 3 h 2 o f e 2 o 3 s o l i d 6 h 2 e at the conclusion of the electrocoagulation process a large amount of brown precipitates were observed in the solution due to the gas formation at the counter electrode these precipitates remained dispersed in solution for the duration of the experiment but eventually settled out of solution afterward when checked immediately following the anodization process the solution ph was found to be slightly basic ph 10 11 which is consistent with the assumed reaction occurring at the counter electrode shown in eq 3 3 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 g a s 2 o h however when measured again an hour after the experiment the ph of the solution returned to neutral ph 7 indicating ensuing chemical reactions consumed the hydroxyl groups several authors have suggested that the initially released fe2 cations eventually result in a product of fe3o4 magnetite following chemical or electrochemical reactions generally involving oh produced at the cathode eq 3 9 11 the formation of magnetite which requires some fe3 cations implies an additional oxidation step following the initial electrochemical formation of fe2 cabrera proposed a direct electrochemical oxidation of fe2 to fe3 at the anode followed by a precipitation of fe oh 3 which was in turn electrochemically reduced at the cathode to fe3o4 11 fajaroh proposed an alternate route in which fe oh 2 was the first formed precipitate and subsequently chemically oxidized to feo oh by oxygen gas dissolved in solution which also led to fe3o4 formation by a reaction between feo oh and fe oh 2 9 the initially observed orange particulate foam could be attributed to the formation of feo oh which is described as orange or reddish brown while the decrease in solution ph following the experiment seems consistent with the formation of fe3o4 described by fajaroh 8 9 however magnetite is typically described as a black precipitate which was never observed in our case 8 10 11 the iron working electrodes were found to be partially corroded away figure s3 after the electrocoagulation process and mass loss across all cases was found to be an average of 104 4 mg this is consistent with an assumed reaction of 2 e per mole of fe consumed to form fe2 cations which provides a theoretical mass loss of 104 1 mg as shown in faraday s law of electrolysis eq 4 4 m a s s l o s s g i t m w n f wherein the electrode mass loss in grams can be related to the total charge consumed by fe oxidation current i multiplied by time t 0 2 a 1800s 360 c n is the valence of the electrolysis product fe2 n 2 mw is the molecular weight of fe metal 55 845 g mol and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol the electrode mass loss and energy per unit mass of electrode lost is summarized in table s2 which shows that the electrochemical oxidation of fe is most efficient for a solution at 45 c and slightly more efficient for shorter electrode separations energy was calculated based on the working electrode potential and while counter electrode potential was not directly measured the over potential for h2 evolution using a platinum electrode is expected to be fairly constant 3 2 magnetic separation of treated solutions the precipitates formed during electrocoagulation were found to be highly responsive to a permanent magnet within a few seconds of placing a freshly treated sample of solution b onto a 0 47 t magnet the brown precipitate was rapidly drawn to the base of the sample vial figure s4 after a period of 60 min with no magnetic field some fraction of the electrochemically produced feox precipitates remain dispersed in solution however the magnetically separated solutions have noticeably improved clarity as shown in fig 2 after only 5 min of settling under the influence of a permanent magnet most of the visible suspended precipitates have been drawn out of solution conversely under natural settling a large amount of precipitates remain suspended in solution after an hour turbidity measurements were conducted on as prepared solution a solution b solution c and distilled water without ec treatment or separation to determine baseline turbidity of the solutions samples of solution b treated by the electrocoagulation process were analyzed with and without magnetic separation table 1 immediately after gentle mixing the untreated solution b shows a turbidity value above 200 ntu several orders of magnitude above distilled water or a solution a containing only surfactants and salt samples of ec treated solution b were found to have comparable turbidity values to solution a but still slightly higher than distilled water or solution c which implies that some amount of observed turbidity was due to the formation of air bubbles stabilized by surfactant molecules that were not removed by sonication in comparison to ec solutions subjected to a magnetic field solutions treated by ec and only allowed to settle for 60 min had significantly higher turbidity values fig 2 after an additional 24 h of natural settling all solutions were found to have a lower turbidity than the as prepared solution from the results shown in table 1 it can be concluded that electrocoagulation using the described method is highly effective for reducing solution turbidity of the emulsified oil surfactant solutions and that the application of a magnetic field can significantly decrease the settling time required to observe reduced turbidity 3 3 precipitate morphology composition and crystallinity sem analysis of powders extracted from the ec treated solutions showed consistent morphology regardless of solution temperature electrode distance or the presence of surfactant all samples contained predominately spherical particles with diameters in the range of 50 100 nm fig 3 with the smallest discernable particles having diameters closer to 20 30 nm however significant agglomeration was observed making determination of primary particle size by sem difficult previous reports describing electrochemical synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles also reported spherical particles on the order of 20 30 nm 9 11 average particle size for all experimental conditions derived from at least 20 particles for each sample is shown in figure s5 samples produced at 25 c and 1 cm electrode distance were found to be slightly smaller than at 3 cm electrode distance regardless of the electrolyte solution used while samples produced at 45 c show no clear dependence on electrode separation or electrolyte solution used resulting in overlapping error bars for all conditions evaluated in some regions non spherical crystallites are observed with needle or plate like morphologies no experimental conditions appeared to favor spherical over multi faceted particles and these features appeared for every experimental condition evaluated chemical analysis by eds showed that no insoluble na or cl containing compounds were formed during the ec experiment and in addition to fe and o only the ni substrate au conductive coating and minor c contamination possibly residual oil or surfactant is observed fig 4 furthermore the fe o atomic ratio as determined from the fe kα and o kα x ray peaks was between 0 58 and 0 72 for all experimental conditions averaged between three regions in each sample which indicates an average oxidation state of fe2 7 to fe3 4 fe o atomic ratios for all experimental conditions are shown in figure s6 as discussed earlier several authors have suggested that electrode distance can play a role in the observed product phase when forming feox nanoparticles by the electrochemical oxidation of fe working electrodes 9 samples produced with a shorter electrode separation 1 cm in the present case are expected to have the greatest local ph variation due to the production of oh at the counter electrode eq 3 samples produced at 1 cm separation distance in all solutions were further analyzed by xrd and vsm to determine the influence if any production conditions have on the phase of feox while the varying morphology shown in fig 3 indicates that more than one phase may exist in the as prepared precipitates all samples were found to contain one dominant crystalline component regardless of synthesis conditions which can be assigned to both fe3o4 magnetite with an inverse spinel crystal structure and γ fe2o3 maghemite with a crystal structure deviating from fe3o4 due to the presence of fe vacancies fig 5 15 crystallite size τ estimation was conducted using the scherrer equation 5 τ k λ β c o s θ where β the full width at half maximum values were measured for the most intense peak
