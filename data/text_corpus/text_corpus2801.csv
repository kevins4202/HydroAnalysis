complexes were investigated four iron chelates ca edta nta oa were used the results revealed an increase in performance with increased temperature both at acidic and neutral ph values studies on the stability of the iron chelates to ph show a reduced efficiency at higher ph with very poor performance of ca and oa at ph of 9 the effect of ph on attack of hydroxyl radicals on the chelate was also monitored using total iron reduction the results show that the complexes are more stable at acidic than at alkaline ph the suitability of the iron complexes for application at alkaline ph is in the order of edta nta oa ca the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were also computed judging from the values of coefficient of variation r 2 the contaminant decolorisation followed the pseudo first order kinetics at acidic ph but followed the pseudo second order kinetics with the chelate assisted degradation at neutral ph in each case the rate constant increased with increasing temperature the thermodynamic parameters show an endothermic and spontaneous degradation process which does not follow a complex mechanism keywords advanced oxidation processes chelates fenton reaction neutral ph wastewater treatment 1 introduction advanced oxidation processes aop are effective techniques employed to remove toxic and recalcitrant chemicals from wastewater aop is effective in degrading and mineralizing organic pollutants to carbon dioxide and oxygen or less toxic intermediates 1 2 aops involve the generation of different varieties of radicals through the combination of chemical agents such as ozone o3 metal oxide some transition metals and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 it may also involve auxiliary energy sources such as ultraviolet visible uv vis radiation electronic current g radiation and ultrasound 3 examples of aops include g radiolysis sonolysis o3 h2o2 o3 uv h2o2 uv o3 h2o2 uv fenton fe2 h2o2 photo and electro fenton uv fe2 h2o2 chelating agent assisted fenton photo fenton and heterogeneous photooxidation 3 hydroxyl radicals are the primary oxidant in aops however other oxidant species may also be involved such as hydroperoxyl radicals ho 2 triplet oxygen 3o2 superoxide radical anions o 2 and organic peroxyl radicals r o o among the aops the photo fenton pf process presents the following advantages over the other techniques pf involves the use of simple instrumentation fe is cheap and readily available h2o2 is nontoxic and its residual decomposes to environmentally safe products lastly the short time of reaction and mild operation conditions make it preferred over others aops 4 these advantages notwithstanding pf is limited by the precipitation of iron due to ph limitations ph around 3 0 high concentration of iron which is above eu requirement for discharge in the environment the generation of iron containing waste sludge equations published elsewhere which presents disposal problems 5 one of the techniques utilized to curb this problem is the use of iron chelates to solubilize iron in solution thereby allowing applicability at wide ph range 6 7 the discovery of the fenton process since in 1894 has undergone many improvements from application at acidic ph as a decontamination process 8 to the inactivation of bacteria 9 10 purification of water via the solar process 11 and application at circum neutral ph using iron chelates 7 12 13 these discoveries have elicited interest in fenton research thereby overcoming the initial challenges posed by the initial limitation of fenton process to a narrow ph range the photo fenton like process employing chelating agents has been successfully applied in the removal of recalcitrant compounds such as paints solvents in adhesives cosmetics inks munitions perfumes lubricating oil etc with much success recorded there are several ph studies for a photo fenton process that has established the optimum value to be between 2 5 and 3 0 in a review 14 the optimal ph value for photo fenton process was reported to be 2 8 this work has investigated the effect of ph for the chelated system using four iron chelates and obtained optimum performance efficiency values more so this work has investigated the temperature effect of the chelated systems a topic that has not been explored in literature another area of interest is the attack of the hydroxyl radical on the chelate thereby destroying it and hence reducing performance as a result of the precipitation of iron as iron hydroxide this research therefore aims at studying the effect of temperature and ph on the performance of photo fenton using the most common iron chelates and lastly investigating the effect of ho attack on the chelate thereby establishing which ph will the chelate perform better in this work fe3 chelates of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta nitrilotriacetic acid nta oxalic acid oa and citric acid ca were used while methylene blue mb was selected as model compound which represented a contaminant of interest in aqueous medium 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents the chemicals used in this study were methylene blue ecibra quimica brazil anhydrous iron iii chloride fecl3 30 wt hydrogen peroxide solution h2o2 30 w v hydrochloric acid hcl naoh h2so4 chelating agents ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta nitrilotriacetic acid nta oxalic acid oa and citric acid ca were all purchased from dinamica quimica brazil all reagents were of analytical grade and were used as supplied without further purification double distilled water was used for all solution preparation 2 2 sample preparation methylene blue mb solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg mb in ultra pure millipore milli q water iron chelates solution were prepared by dissolving 20 mg of hydrated ferric chloride in distilled water and directly adding the solution of the chelate at an appropriate ph the iron ligand chelation ratio for each complex was chosen based on previous works 7 oxalic and citric acids were added directly and ph adjusted to neutral while edta and nta were adjusted to a ph of 6 and 8 respectively and stirred magnetically for one hour for proper chelation 7 15 ph adjustment was done using either 4 m naoh or 3 mol h2so4 15 2 3 photodegradation experiment in order to maintain a steady supply and also quantify the amount of radiation the photodegradation experiments were performed using artificial irradiation the photo fenton reactor was a thermostatic pyrex jacketed 1 2 l vessel equipped with three high pressure mercury uva lamps philips blbf8t5 8 w the lamps emitted radiation of 4 05 10 5 einstein s s 1 at a wavelength of 365 nm the uv lamps were housed in borosilicate tubes which prevented them from having direct contact with the sample and also allow uniform irradiation the appropriate amount of iron chelate was added to the sample ph adjusted and solution transferred to the reactor 5 in order to prevent ph change during the photooxidation experiment the solution was buffered using a phosphate buffer prepared by adding 100 ml of k2hpo4 to 58 2 ml of naoh 16 the reaction vessel was covered with aluminum foil to prevent loss of radiation 17 and temperature was controlled by passing water through the reactor from a regulated water bath calculated amount of h2o2 was added at the same time the uv lamps were switched on while homogeneity was maintained using a magnetic stirrer 18 20 samples were withdrawn using a syringe at different time intervals for the analysis of mb concentration the concentration was quantified using uv vis spectrophotometer model dr 3900 hach usa at a Î»max 664 nm h2o2 was determined using the vanadate method 21 while the iso 6332 method was used for total iron fe2 and fe3 determination 22 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of reaction ph the reaction ph is one important factor that cannot be ignored in degradation of organic compounds in fenton and photo fenton process it functions in the generation of ho which acts in increasing the rate of degradation 23 it is well known that the fenton and photo fenton reactions are more effective at acidic ph 2 3 than at higher values it is reported that oxidation is slower at ph 4 because of hydroxylation of iron 23 followed by precipitation the important reactions common in photo fenton reaction represent the reactions in the various species which include h2o h2o2 ho o2 fe2 3 the interactions of these species is represented in the flowing equations 24 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 3 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 o 2 h r h h o r h 2 o 4 5 r f e 3 r f e 2 6 r h 2 o r o h h 7 f e 2 h o f e 3 o h 8 h 2 o 2 h o h 2 o h o o 9 h o o o 2 h 10 h o o f e 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 when the reaction is irradiated f e 3 undergoes continuous reduction to produces f e 2 11 f e 3 h 2 o h v f e 2 h o h the eq 1 above indicates that the amount of ho is dependent on solution ph the formation of the ho is most effective under acidic conditions the low degradation of compounds at higher ph values is attributed to the formation of iron precipitates fe oh 3 fe3 forms different complexes at different ph values in solution and the quantum of light that is absorbed by fe3 is dependent on the specie that causes the absorption table 1 below gives the fe3 species and ph values at which they absorb for comparison purposes the effect of ph in acidic range on the decolorization of methylene blue after 30 min of irradiation was recorded at ph of 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 7 0 fig 1 this was done to establish the optimum percentage decoloration and also obtain data for comparison of the chelated system photo fenton process at acidic ph and photo fenton like process at ph 7 the results show at ph of 3 5 the system loses efficiency while the loss of efficiency is more pronounced at neutral ph the loss of efficiency at high ph is a result of the formation of iron precipitates 14 a close observation of the efficiency values reveals a very similar efficiency between ph 2 5 and 3 0 there have been many conflicting reports on the optimal efficiency ph for fenton reaction in their publication hossein et al reported the optimal ph for the degradation of reactive blue dye 19 to be 3 0 23 in another publication saghafinia and coworkers degraded penicillin g synthetic effluent and obtained the optimal ph to be 3 5 25 in their review clarizia et al reported on the optimal ph value for photo fenton process to be 2 8 14 bautista et al in his studies in their work on cosmetic wastewater reported that the optimum ph of process was between 2 5 and 3 0 26 from these reports we can confirm that the optimal ph is between ph 2 5 and 3 0 it should be noted that at higher ph there is sedimentation of fe iii thereby resulting to a production of other products such as water and carbon iv oxide due to hydrolysation of hydrogen peroxide by the synthetic iron hydroxide generated resulting in a decreased amount of ho generated therefore reducing the efficiency of the process 23 for the chelated system the effect of ph was studied at ph 5 0 02 6 0 02 7 0 02 8 0 02 and 9 0 02 for edta nta oa and ca there is no clear mechanism for the chelate assisted photo fenton process but principally the ho radical is the main oxidant that brings about degradation of the contaminants 17 in this process it is believed that there is an imitation of the photo fenton process as illustrated in eqs 12 and 13 17 12 f e 3 l o h h v f e 2 l o h 13 f e 2 l o o h h v f e 2 l h o 2 the chelate forms strong complexes with fe iii thereby preventing fe iii precipitation as iron hydroxide it is important to note that for the chelate to function optimally the fe iii complexes formed must possess the ability to absorb uv light and also undergo photolytic decomposition photolytic decomposition causes the donation of an electron to the metal which results in the metal reduction while failure of photolytic decomposition to occur makes the system to be unreactive the result of the chelated system is represented in fig 2 the optimum ph for each system was determined as well as the best chelate for application at all circumneutral ph values in fig 1 the unchelated iron successfully decolorized mb on up to a ph value of 3 0 after which it loses efficiency at ph of 7 there was not noticeable removal of mb after 30 min of irradiation this implied that the iron in solution could no longer decompose the h2o2 to give oh the case was different for the chelated system the result reveals that in both systems there was decolorization of mb when the iron was chelated with each chelates giving an optimum result at ph of 5 fig 2 while the efficiency of mb removal using the chelated system reduces as the higher ph values it is was observed that the use of ca and oa acid system at ph values above 8 results to very poor performance as the removal of mb was very low with high production of precipitates it is a well known fact that iron is more soluble at acidic than at alkaline ph for photo fenton reaction to be effective iron needs to remain soluble in solution this accounts for the reason why the iron chelates were more effective in the removal of mb at acidic ph than at neutral and alkaline ph a study conducted by chen and coworkers on the production of ho using citrate system gave similar results where the amount of ho production decreased with increasing ph 27 the generation of precipitates at alkaline ph values implies that the ca and oa fe ligand coordination becomes weak at alkaline ph resulting to the breakage of the bonds thereby to precipitation of iron it should also be noted that in the alkaline region there is a reaction between the ligand chelate which is an acid and the oh from the base resulting to acid base neutralization the stability of the fe chelate to function both acidic and alkaline ph may be likely associated with the formation constants whereas all the chelates used are acids edta which has stronger stability constant log k 25 7 was more stable at all ph values the fe iii nta system which has higher stability constant next to fe iii edta showed relative stability at all ph levels although the effect of ph on degradation efficiency reduced at alkaline ph the essence of using iron chelates in complexing iron is to make it soluble for application to real effluents there are concerns about the fate of these chelates after treatment with effluents while our research group is trying to address this issue it should be noted that the oh is non selective in nature therefore it has the capacity to completely mineralize the chelate or degrade it to less harmful products leaving behind the iron in solution in the form of precipitates which can be then filtered off different industries generate different types of effluents which may have different ph depending on the raw materials knowledge of the stability of these iron chelates to ph can be a veritable tool for application of photo fenton in the treatment of real effluents without necessarily having to adjust the ph it should be noted however that from the iron chelates tested only nta and edta have the ability to function properly at alkaline ph while ca and oa can function well up to a ph of 7 at ph of 8 all the iron chelates start to lose efficiency but the effect was more pronounced in oa fig 3 gives the possibility of applying the tested chelates to real effluents the ph of real effluents wastewaters depends on their source it could be either from industrial municipal or hospital the ph of effluents is strictly dependent on the type of raw materials used by the manufacturing industry the product of interest or type of goods consumed in the municipality most of the real effluents studied in other environmental works have reported the effluents have ph between 4 0 to above 10 28 34 from this study it is advisable to try other chelates which may be stable at higher ph other than the ph values used in this study or if it is necessary to use any of these chelates for treatment of effluents with ph higher than 9 there will be need for addition of an acid to the effluent to bring down the ph to the suitable range which will permit use of these chelates 3 2 hydroxyl radical ho attack on the complex a topic that has not been extensively reported in photo fenton process is loss of iron from the complex due to hydroxyl radical attack it is well known that ho is highly reactive species that oxidizes any organic molecule that comes in contact with it in chelate assisted photo fenton process there are cases of lower efficiencies recorded as compared to the conventional photo fenton process 7 the reason for this reduced efficiency is not far fetched during this process there is an attack on the complex mostly by the hydroxyl radicals thereby degrading the ligand and causing a gradual release of iron from the complex the iron released may chelate with free chelators in solution 7 or may form iron hydroxides 35 if the latter occurs there is loss of catalyst therefore reduced efficiency recorded the attack of ho on the complex may result to change in color of the reaction solution and subsequent precipitation of iron 36 fig 4 table 2 gives the change in color exercised during the photocatalytic reaction between the fe complexes and the ho in order to investigate this the amount of total iron was monitored periodically during the reaction for fe iii edta fe iii nta fe iii ca fe iii oa the choice of fe3 over fe2 is due to the fact that the former forms a more stable compound with the chelates under study the experiments were carried out in distilled water in order to avoid interferences during the reaction samples were collected filtered through a 0 45 Î¼ m pore sized ptfe syringe driven filters and total iron determined using the 1 10 phenanthroline 22 a reduction in the amount of total iron indicates iron leaching from the complex and subsequent conversion to iron hydroxide which is filtered off fig 5 represents the ph effects of on ho attack on the complex the first chelate tested to determine its stability under ho attack was edta due to its high stability constant fe iii edta system recorded the lowest iron release from the complex at all ph values evaluated the strong fe3 edta stability constant logk 25 7 17 is the most plausible reason for the resistance of the ho attack the result of the iron citrate system reveals resistance of the attack more at acidic ph while the rate of iron release increased as the ph increase towards acidity the reason for the low attack of ho on the fe iii citrate system stability constant logk 11 85 can be as a result of the low reactivity between ho and citric acid 37 at alkaline ph the citric acid complex recorded high release of fe in solution while at ph of 9 there was noticeable formation of precipitates even before the addition of hydrogen peroxide expectedly most Î± keto acids and dicarboxylic acids rarely absorb significant amount of light at wavelengths which are longer than 295 nm 38 however a fast photochemical decomposition is expected in the atmospheric aqueous phase but such reactions are only feasible if these acids as chelates complexes with dissolved fe iii 38 just like in the photo fenton like process the fe iii oa system stability constant log k 9 4 systems also resisted ho attack more at acidic ph values also owing to the low value of the stability constant log k for fe iii oa the rate of iron release at alkaline ph was observed to be higher the fe iii nta system recorded high iron released across the ph values evaluated despite its high stability constant value log k 15 87 it should be noted that in the fe iii nta system there is protonation of the amino group 39 during photo fenton process which leads to higher degradation of the ligand hence high amount of iron released the result of ho attack on the chelates correlates with that of effect of ph on the chelates in section 3 1 where the degradation of mb was faster at acidic ph that basic ph confirming that iron is most effective in the degradation of organic compounds even when chelated to organic ligands generally two factors are responsible for the impact of ho attack on the complex these are the nature of the ligand and the value of the stability constant finally the dissociation of iron in solution is strictly dependent on the solution ph and the redox potential the ph of a solution is reported to affect the activity of iron in that solution by the formation of hydroxide complexes or by the formation of solid hydroxide precipitates at higher ph values the redox potential increases and the ability of the complex to withstand stress from the attack of the ho reduces thereby resulting to high release of iron and subsequent formation of hydroxide in solution 40 3 3 effect of temperature the degradation of mb at neutral ph was performed using the same conditions used in acidic ph the result for the degradation of methylene blue in neutral ph at different temperatures represented in fig 6 just like the acidic ph the degradation of mb followed two distinctive phase the first stage which was the fast process involved the decomposition of the organic dye by ho and the slow process due to consumption of the h2o2 as a result of the reaction between the ferrous ions with hydrogen peroxide in comparison the efficiency of the chelate enhanced photo fenton process was less than that performed at acidic ph fig 7 the removal efficiency followed the pattern oxalic acid nta citric acid edta the reason for the low performance of the chelated systems as compared to that in acidic medium without cheating agent is that ho is non selective therefore they attack the complex and destroy the metal ligand bond thereby releasing gradually iron in solution which then precipitates hence resulting to reduced efficiency more so the ho can attack the free chelator in solution thereby mineralizing it or changing it to other intermediates this reduces the number of free chelates available to complex the iron released from the attack on the chelate thereby resulting to reduced efficiency 7 it should be noted also that the molar ratio used in chelation of oxalic acid fe oa 1 20 as compared to other ligands is extremely high adding the addition of a chelate to a photo fenton system brings about an increased amount of total organic carbon toc therefore adding higher amount invariably will result to high toc values 7 worthy of note also is that temperature had effect on each chelate with removal increased with increase in temperature however the increase affected more edta than other chelates this is because edta has higher stability constant as compared to other chelates making it more stable 17 fig 7 gives the order of influence to be edta nta ca oa 3 4 kinetics and thermodynamics studies the kinetics of the photo fenton process is quite complicated it is a well known fact that photo fenton process involves two phases of reaction while some scholars have studied the photo fenton process as a single reaction 41 43 some other researchers prefer to study it in phases the reaction occurs slow and fast 44 45 the general kinetic equation for a target compound in our case mb is represented as 14 Î´ c m b Î´ t k h o k h o k m b k 0 x i c o x i c r h where oxi is any other oxidant present in the reaction apart from ho some oxidants such as ho or ferryl are considered the most important species in the reaction therefore eq 14 becomes 15 Î´ c m b Î´ t k h o k h o k m b if the reactive specie concentration is considered and assuming a stationary state is quickly approached in the process then we can safely assume that koh is constant and then the decolorisation rate law is therefore assumed to be first order with respect to consumption of the compound of interest the eq 15 becomes 16 Î´ c m b Î´ t k a p p c m b integrating eq 16 we have 17 l n c m b l n c m b o k a p p t c m b a n d c m b o are initial and final concentrations of mb to find the kinetic constant a plot of l n c m b c m b o against time t gives a slope k which corresponds to the apparent rate constant for mb degradation in this study the decolorisation of mb was monitored by the dye decolorisation at a wavelength of 664 nm the pseudo second order kinetics was determined using 18 1 c t 1 c o k a p p t c t c o k a p p and t are initial mb concentration final mb concentration the apparent kinetic rate constant and the time of reaction respectively temperature plays a major role in photo fenton degradation reaction in this experiment the temperature was varied from 298 to 313 k at 298 k an increase in removal efficiency was observed from 66 9 to 81 0 in the first 10 min for at a ph of 2 0 the same trend was observed at ph of 2 8 were in the first 10 min the removal efficiency increased from 83 6 at a temperature of 298 94 4 at a temperature of 313 k for the first ten minutes of the reaction when a ph of 3 was used a removal efficiency of 82 0 was recorded for 298 k and 96 2 at 313 k temperature also impacted positively on the chelated systems and no optimum temperature value was recorded within the operational temperature as opposed to other studies 46 in all cases at acidic ph and chelated system at neutral ph the temperature of the reaction impacted positively on the removal efficiency similar results were documented 45 to show an increase in removal efficiency as the reaction temperature was increased the degradation kinetics of mb was studied using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics table 3 judging from the r 2 values the degradation of mb followed the pseudo first law kinetics at acidic ph with r 2 values close to unity the chelated system however followed the pseudo second law kinetics judging from r 2 values the rate constants for both acidic and chelated systems increased with increase in temperature the time required for the decolorization was also much shorter as at higher temperatures implying that there is higher decomposition of h2o2 with rising temperature which increased the rate of generation of ho and therefore bringing about decolorization of the dye to better understand the temperature effects on the decomposition of mb the thermodynamic parameters thermodynamic studies were carried out the apparent rate constant kapp obtained in table 3 were used to determine the activation energy from the arrhenius equation 47 49 19 k a p p a e e a r t the kapp in eq 17 is the apparent rate constant r is the gas constant t the absolute tempearature while the pre exponential factor is represented by a values of activation energy were determined from the slope of the plots of kapp against 1 t the enthalpy Î´ h and entropy of activation Î´ s were determined from the activated complex theory using the erying equation 50 20 l n k a p p t ln k b h Î´ s r Î´ h r t the kapp is the apparent rate constant r is the gas constant while kb and h are boltzmann and planck constants respectively the values of enthalpy Î´ h and entropy of activation Î´ s obtained from eq 18 were inserted in eq 19 to compute the free energy of activation Î´ s 21 Î´ g Î´ h t Î´ s table 4 represents the various thermodynamic parameters for the degradation of methylene blue using iron at acidic ph and iron chelates at neutral ph from the thermodynamic parameters it is clear from activation energy values that the treatment at ph of 3 0 was more favorable to the dye degradation as less energy is required for bond breaking fe iii edta had the highest activation energy values implying more energy is required to break the bond of mb the negative values indicate that mb degradation is spontaneous the activation energy ea is a measure of the energy barrier which must be overcome by the species participating in the reaction for degradation to occur this energy is related to the bond strength which must be broken or formed to form the transition state from the reactant 51 the values of ea were all positive an indication that the degradation rate of mb increases with a corresponding increase in temperature and the rate constant of the overall formation which is defined by the arrhenius behavior the values of free energy of activation Î´ g j mol which accounts for the difference between the reactants and the activated state 52 this is also a sign that the rate of degradation of the compound does not follow a complex mechanism 53 the values of enthalpy of activation Î´ h in this system Î´ h were all positive the positive Î´h value indicates endothermic process 54 values of entropy of activation were all negative the negative entropy values indicates that the transition state formed in the degradation process has lower structural freedom as compared to the reactants this also confirms that the process is irreversible 52 4 conclusion studies on the stability of iron chelates to ph hydroxyl radical attack and temperature were carried out using four iron chelates methylene blue was used as a model compound to investigate the photo fenton process the optimum ph was discovered to be between 2 5 and 3 0 in the un chelated system in the chelated systems the efficiency was found to decrease with higher ph and a loss of efficiency was experienced at alkaline ph the solubility of iron at acidic ph was advanced to be responsible for this ca and oa performed very poor at alkaline ph a consequence of iron precipitation studies on ho attack on the chelates indicates that the complexes were more stable at acidic ph than at alkaline ph temperature played important role in the degradation process there was increasing dye degradation with increasing rate constant while an increase in efficiency was noticed with increasing temperature in the four chelating agents used edta was most affected by temperature variation despite its high stability constants and ph resistance therefore it may not be effective in treatment of effluents in countries with low temperatures mb oxidation process followed the pseudo first order at acidic ph and pseudo second order model using iron chelates at neutral ph negative Î´g values and positive values of Î´h value obtained in the study indicate the oxidation of mb dye using fenton reaction processes is spontaneous and endothermic

05 10 5 einstein s s 1 at a wavelength of 365 nm the uv lamps were housed in borosilicate tubes which prevented them from having direct contact with the sample and also allow uniform irradiation the appropriate amount of iron chelate was added to the sample ph adjusted and solution transferred to the reactor 5 in order to prevent ph change during the photooxidation experiment the solution was buffered using a phosphate buffer prepared by adding 100 ml of k2hpo4 to 58 2 ml of naoh 16 the reaction vessel was covered with aluminum foil to prevent loss of radiation 17 and temperature was controlled by passing water through the reactor from a regulated water bath calculated amount of h2o2 was added at the same time the uv lamps were switched on while homogeneity was maintained using a magnetic stirrer 18 20 samples were withdrawn using a syringe at different time intervals for the analysis of mb concentration the concentration was quantified using uv vis spectrophotometer model dr 3900 hach usa at a Î»max 664 nm h2o2 was determined using the vanadate method 21 while the iso 6332 method was used for total iron fe2 and fe3 determination 22 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of reaction ph the reaction ph is one important factor that cannot be ignored in degradation of organic compounds in fenton and photo fenton process it functions in the generation of ho which acts in increasing the rate of degradation 23 it is well known that the fenton and photo fenton reactions are more effective at acidic ph 2 3 than at higher values it is reported that oxidation is slower at ph 4 because of hydroxylation of iron 23 followed by precipitation the important reactions common in photo fenton reaction represent the reactions in the various species which include h2o h2o2 ho o2 fe2 3 the interactions of these species is represented in the flowing equations 24 1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o o h 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 3 f e 3 h o 2 f e 2 o 2 h r h h o r h 2 o 4 5 r f e 3 r f e 2 6 r h 2 o r o h h 7 f e 2 h o f e 3 o h 8 h 2 o 2 h o h 2 o h o o 9 h o o o 2 h 10 h o o f e 2 h f e 3 h 2 o 2 when the reaction is irradiated f e 3 undergoes continuous reduction to produces f e 2 11 f e 3 h 2 o h v f e 2 h o h the eq 1 above indicates that the amount of ho is dependent on solution ph the formation of the ho is most effective under acidic conditions the low degradation of compounds at higher ph values is attributed to the formation of iron precipitates fe oh 3 fe3 forms different complexes at different ph values in solution and the quantum of light that is absorbed by fe3 is dependent on the specie that causes the absorption table 1 below gives the fe3 species and ph values at which they absorb for comparison purposes the effect of ph in acidic range on the decolorization of methylene blue after 30 min of irradiation was recorded at ph of 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 7 0 fig 1 this was done to establish the optimum percentage decoloration and also obtain data for comparison of the chelated system photo fenton process at acidic ph and photo fenton like process at ph 7 the results show at ph of 3 5 the system loses efficiency while the loss of efficiency is more pronounced at neutral ph the loss of efficiency at high ph is a result of the formation of iron precipitates 14 a close observation of the efficiency values reveals a very similar efficiency between ph 2 5 and 3 0 there have been many conflicting reports on the optimal efficiency ph for fenton reaction in their publication hossein et al reported the optimal ph for the degradation of reactive blue dye 19 to be 3 0 23 in another publication saghafinia and coworkers degraded penicillin g synthetic effluent and obtained the optimal ph to be 3 5 25 in their review clarizia et al reported on the optimal ph value for photo fenton process to be 2 8 14 bautista et al in his studies in their work on cosmetic wastewater reported that the optimum ph of process was between 2 5 and 3 0 26 from these reports we can confirm that the optimal ph is between ph 2 5 and 3 0 it should be noted that at higher ph there is sedimentation of fe iii thereby resulting to a production of other products such as water and carbon iv oxide due to hydrolysation of hydrogen peroxide by the synthetic iron hydroxide generated resulting in a decreased amount of ho generated therefore reducing the efficiency of the process 23 for the chelated system the effect of ph was studied at ph 5 0 02 6 0 02 7 0 02 8 0 02 and 9 0 02 for edta nta oa and ca there is no clear mechanism for the chelate assisted photo fenton process but principally the ho radical is the main oxidant that brings about degradation of the contaminants 17 in this process it is believed that there is an imitation of the photo fenton process as illustrated in eqs 12 and 13 17 12 f e 3 l o h h v f e 2 l o h 13 f e 2 l o o h h v f e 2 l h o 2 the chelate forms strong complexes with fe iii thereby preventing fe iii precipitation as iron hydroxide it is important to note that for the chelate to function optimally the fe iii complexes formed must possess the ability to absorb uv light and also undergo photolytic decomposition photolytic decomposition causes the donation of an electron to the metal which results in the metal reduction while failure of photolytic decomposition to occur makes the system to be unreactive the result of the chelated system is represented in fig 2 the optimum ph for each system was determined as well as the best chelate for application at all circumneutral ph values in fig 1 the unchelated iron successfully decolorized mb on up to a ph value of 3 0 after which it loses efficiency at ph of 7 there was not noticeable removal of mb after 30 min of irradiation this implied that the iron in solution could no longer decompose the h2o2 to give oh the case was different for the chelated system the result reveals that in both systems there was decolorization of mb when the iron was chelated with each chelates giving an optimum result at ph of 5 fig 2 while the efficiency of mb removal using the chelated system reduces as the higher ph values it is was observed that the use of ca and oa acid system at ph values above 8 results to very poor performance as the removal of mb was very low with high production of precipitates it is a well known fact that iron is more soluble at acidic than at alkaline ph for photo fenton reaction to be effective iron needs to remain soluble in solution this accounts for the reason why the iron chelates were more effective in the removal of mb at acidic ph than at neutral and alkaline ph a study conducted by chen and coworkers on the production of ho using citrate system gave similar results where the amount of ho production decreased with increasing ph 27 the generation of precipitates at alkaline ph values implies that the ca and oa fe ligand coordination becomes weak at alkaline ph resulting to the breakage of the bonds thereby to precipitation of iron it should also be noted that in the alkaline region there is a reaction between the ligand chelate which is an acid and the oh from the base resulting to acid base neutralization the stability of the fe chelate to function both acidic and alkaline ph may be likely associated with the formation constants whereas all the chelates used are acids edta which has stronger stability constant log k 25 7 was more stable at all ph values the fe iii nta system which has higher stability constant next to fe iii edta showed relative stability at all ph levels although the effect of ph on degradation efficiency reduced at alkaline ph the essence of using iron chelates in complexing iron is to make it soluble for application to real effluents there are concerns about the fate of these chelates after treatment with effluents while our research group is trying to address this issue it should be noted that the oh is non selective in nature therefore it has the capacity to completely mineralize the chelate or degrade it to less harmful products leaving behind the iron in solution in the form of precipitates which can be then filtered off different industries generate different types of effluents which may have different ph depending on the raw materials knowledge of the stability of these iron chelates to ph can be a veritable tool for application of photo fenton in the treatment of real effluents without necessarily having to adjust the ph it should be noted however that from the iron chelates tested only nta and edta have the ability to function properly at alkaline ph while ca and oa can function well up to a ph of 7 at ph of 8 all the iron chelates start to lose efficiency but the effect was more pronounced in oa fig 3 gives the possibility of applying the tested chelates to real effluents the ph of real effluents wastewaters depends on their source it could be either from industrial municipal or hospital the ph of effluents is strictly dependent on the type of raw materials used by the manufacturing industry the product of interest or type of goods consumed in the municipality most of the real effluents studied in other environmental works have reported the effluents have ph between 4 0 to above 10 28 34 from this study it is advisable to try other chelates which may be stable at higher ph other than the ph values used in this study or if it is necessary to use any of these chelates for treatment of effluents with ph higher than 9 there will be need for addition of an acid to the effluent to bring down the ph to the suitable range which will permit use of these chelates 3 2 hydroxyl radical ho attack on the complex a topic that has not been extensively reported in photo fenton process is loss of iron from the complex due to hydroxyl radical attack it is well known that ho is highly reactive species that oxidizes any organic molecule that comes in contact with it in chelate assisted photo fenton process there are cases of lower efficiencies recorded as compared to the conventional photo fenton process 7 the reason for this reduced efficiency is not far fetched during this process there is an attack on the complex mostly by the hydroxyl radicals thereby degrading the ligand and causing a gradual release of iron from the complex the iron released may chelate with free chelators in solution 7 or may form iron hydroxides 35 if the latter occurs there is loss of catalyst therefore reduced efficiency recorded the attack of ho on the complex may result to change in color of the reaction solution and subsequent precipitation of iron 36 fig 4 table 2 gives the change in color exercised during the photocatalytic reaction between the fe complexes and the ho in order to investigate this the amount of total iron was monitored periodically during the reaction for fe iii edta fe iii nta fe iii ca fe iii oa the choice of fe3 over fe2 is due to the fact that the former forms a more stable compound with the chelates under study the experiments were carried out in distilled water in order to avoid interferences during the reaction samples were collected filtered through a 0 45 Î¼ m pore sized ptfe syringe driven filters and total iron determined using the 1 10 phenanthroline 22 a reduction in the amount of total iron indicates iron leaching from the complex and subsequent conversion to iron hydroxide which is filtered off fig 5 represents the ph effects of on ho attack on the complex the first chelate tested to determine its stability under ho attack was edta due to its high stability constant fe iii edta system recorded the lowest iron release from the complex at all ph values evaluated the strong fe3 edta stability constant logk 25 7 17 is the most plausible reason for the resistance of the ho attack the result of the iron citrate system reveals resistance of the attack more at acidic ph while the rate of iron release increased as the ph increase towards acidity the reason for the low attack of ho on the fe iii citrate system stability constant logk 11 85 can be as a result of the low reactivity between ho and citric acid 37 at alkaline ph the citric acid complex recorded high release of fe in solution while at ph of 9 there was noticeable formation of precipitates even before the addition of hydrogen peroxide expectedly most Î± keto acids and dicarboxylic acids rarely absorb significant amount of light at wavelengths which are longer than 295 nm 38 however a fast photochemical decomposition is expected in the atmospheric aqueous phase but such reactions are only feasible if these acids as chelates complexes with dissolved fe iii 38 just like in the photo fenton like process the fe iii oa system stability constant log k 9 4 systems also resisted ho attack more at acidic ph values also owing to the low value of the stability constant log k for fe iii oa the rate of iron release at alkaline ph was observed to be higher the fe iii nta system recorded high iron released across the ph values evaluated despite its high stability constant value log k 15 87 it should be noted that in the fe iii nta system there is protonation of the amino group 39 during photo fenton process which leads to higher degradation of the ligand hence high amount of iron released the result of ho attack on the chelates correlates with that of effect of ph on the chelates in section 3 1 where the degradation of mb was faster at acidic ph that basic ph confirming that iron is most effective in the degradation of organic compounds even when chelated to organic ligands generally two factors are responsible for the impact of ho attack on the complex these are the nature of the ligand and the value of the stability constant finally the dissociation of iron in solution is strictly dependent on the solution ph and the redox potential the ph of a solution is reported to affect the activity of iron in that solution by the formation of hydroxide complexes or by the formation of solid hydroxide precipitates at higher ph values the redox potential increases and the ability of the complex to withstand stress from the attack of the ho reduces thereby resulting to high release of iron and subsequent formation of hydroxide in solution 40 3 3 effect of temperature the degradation of mb at neutral ph was performed using the same conditions used in acidic ph the result for the degradation of methylene blue in neutral ph at different temperatures represented in fig 6 just like the acidic ph the degradation of mb followed two distinctive phase the first stage which was the fast process involved the decomposition of the organic dye by ho and the slow process due to consumption of the h2o2 as a result of the reaction between the ferrous ions with hydrogen peroxide in comparison the efficiency of the chelate enhanced photo fenton process was less than that performed at acidic ph fig 7 the removal efficiency followed the pattern oxalic acid nta citric acid edta the reason for the low performance of the chelated systems as compared to that in acidic medium without cheating agent is that ho is non selective therefore they attack the complex and destroy the metal ligand bond thereby releasing gradually iron in solution which then precipitates hence resulting to reduced efficiency more so the ho can attack the free chelator in solution thereby mineralizing it or changing it to other intermediates this reduces the number of free chelates available to complex the iron released from the attack on the chelate thereby resulting to reduced efficiency 7 it should be noted also that the molar ratio used in chelation of oxalic acid fe oa 1 20 as compared to other ligands is extremely high adding the addition of a chelate to a photo fenton system brings about an increased amount of total organic carbon toc therefore adding higher amount invariably will result to high toc values 7 worthy of note also is that temperature had effect on each chelate with removal increased with increase in temperature however the increase affected more edta than other chelates this is because edta has higher stability constant as compared to other chelates making it more stable 17 fig 7 gives the order of influence to be edta nta ca oa 3 4 kinetics and thermodynamics studies the kinetics of the photo fenton process is quite complicated it is a well known fact that photo fenton process involves two phases of reaction while some scholars have studied the photo fenton process as a single reaction 41 43 some other researchers prefer to study it in phases the reaction occurs slow and fast 44 45 the general kinetic equation for a target compound in our case mb is represented as 14 Î´ c m b Î´ t k h o k h o k m b k 0 x i c o x i c r h where oxi is any other oxidant present in the reaction apart from ho some oxidants such as ho or ferryl are considered the most important species in the reaction therefore eq 14 becomes 15 Î´ c m b Î´ t k h o k h o k m b if the reactive specie concentration is considered and assuming a stationary state is quickly approached in the process then we can safely assume that koh is constant and then the decolorisation rate law is therefore assumed to be first order with respect to consumption of the compound of interest the eq 15 becomes 16 Î´ c m b Î´ t k a p p c m b integrating eq 16 we have 17 l n c m b l n c m b o k a p p t c m b a n d c m b o are initial and final concentrations of mb to find the kinetic constant a plot of l n c m b c m b o against time t gives a slope k which corresponds to the apparent rate constant for mb degradation in this study the decolorisation of mb was monitored by the dye decolorisation at a wavelength of 664 nm the pseudo second order kinetics was determined using 18 1 c t 1 c o k a p p t c t c o k a p p and t are initial mb concentration final mb concentration the apparent kinetic rate constant and the time of reaction respectively temperature plays a major role in photo fenton degradation reaction in this experiment the temperature was varied from 298 to 313 k at 298 k an increase in removal efficiency was observed from 66 9 to 81 0 in the first 10 min for at a ph of 2 0 the same trend was observed at ph of 2 8 were in the first 10 min the removal efficiency increased from 83 6 at a temperature of 298 94 4 at a temperature of 313 k for the first ten minutes of the reaction when a ph of 3 was used a removal efficiency of 82 0 was recorded for 298 k and 96 2 at 313 k temperature also impacted positively on the chelated systems and no optimum temperature value was recorded within the operational temperature as opposed to other studies 46 in all cases at acidic ph and chelated system at neutral ph the temperature of the reaction impacted positively on the removal efficiency similar results were documented 45 to show an increase in removal efficiency as the reaction temperature was increased the degradation kinetics of mb was studied using pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetics table 3 judging from the r 2 values the degradation of mb followed the pseudo first law kinetics at acidic ph with r 2 values close to unity the chelated system however followed the pseudo second law kinetics judging from r 2 values the rate constants for both acidic and chelated systems increased with increase in temperature the time required for the decolorization was also much shorter as at higher temperatures implying that there is higher decomposition of h2o2 with rising temperature which increased the rate of generation of ho and therefore bringing about decolorization of the dye to better understand the temperature effects on the decomposition of mb the thermodynamic parameters thermodynamic studies were carried out the apparent rate constant kapp obtained in table 3 were used to determine the activation energy from the arrhenius equation 47 49 19 k a p p a e e a r t the kapp in eq 17 is the apparent rate constant r is the gas constant t the absolute tempearature while the pre exponential factor is represented by a values of activation energy were determined from the slope of the plots of kapp against 1 t the enthalpy Î´ h and entropy of activation Î´ s were determined from the activated complex theory using the erying equation 50 20 l n k a p p t ln k b h Î´ s r Î´ h r t the kapp is the apparent rate constant r is the gas constant while kb and h are boltzmann and planck constants respectively the values of enthalpy Î´ h and entropy of activation Î´ s obtained from eq 18 were inserted in eq 19 to compute the free energy of activation Î´ s 21 Î´ g Î´ h t Î´ s table 4 represents the various thermodynamic parameters for the degradation of methylene blue using iron at acidic ph and iron chelates at neutral ph from the thermodynamic parameters it is clear from activation energy values that the treatment at ph of 3 0 was more favorable to the dye degradation as less energy is required for bond breaking fe iii edta had the highest activation energy values implying more energy is required to break the bond of mb the negative values indicate that mb degradation is spontaneous the activation energy ea is a measure of the energy barrier which must be overcome by the species participating in the reaction for degradation to occur this energy is related to the bond strength which must be broken or formed to form the transition state from the reactant 51 the values of ea were all positive an indication that the degradation rate of mb increases with a corresponding increase in temperature and the rate constant of the overall formation which is defined by the arrhenius behavior the values of free energy of activation Î´ g j mol which accounts for the difference between the reactants and the activated state 52 this is also a sign that the rate of degradation of the compound does not follow a complex mechanism 53 the values of enthalpy of activation Î´ h in this system Î´ h were all positive the positive Î´h value indicates endothermic process 54 values of entropy of activation were all negative the negative entropy values indicates that the transition state formed in the degradation process has lower structural freedom as compared to the reactants this also confirms that the process is irreversible 52 4 conclusion studies on the stability of iron chelates to ph hydroxyl radical attack and temperature were carried out using four iron chelates methylene blue was used as a model compound to investigate the photo fenton process the optimum ph was discovered to be between 2 5 and 3 0 in the un chelated system in the chelated systems the efficiency was found to decrease with higher ph and a loss of efficiency was experienced at alkaline ph the solubility of iron at acidic ph was advanced to be responsible for this ca and oa performed very poor at alkaline ph a consequence of iron precipitation studies on ho attack on the chelates indicates that the complexes were more stable at acidic ph than at alkaline ph temperature played important role in the degradation process there was increasing dye degradation with increasing rate constant while an increase in efficiency was noticed with increasing temperature in the four chelating agents used edta was most affected by temperature variation despite its high stability constants and ph resistance therefore it may not be effective in treatment of effluents in countries with low temperatures mb oxidation process followed the pseudo first order at acidic ph and pseudo second order model using iron chelates at neutral ph negative Î´g values and positive values of Î´h value obtained in the study indicate the oxidation of mb dye using fenton reaction processes is spontaneous and endothermic

14006,an advanced oxidation nanofiltration integrated hybrid process is developed in this study for treatment of leather industry wastewater to reusable criteria the process uses a laboratory synthesized graphene oxide based nanocomposite in the final polishing step for ensuring high degree of purification all investigations are done on live tannery wastewater having high level of recalcitrant pollutants such as chromium 8 2 mg l 1 cod 10 500 mg l 1 tds 7420 mg l 1 chloride 4620 mg l 1 and sulfide 2560 mg l 1 performance of the developed membrane is also compared with commercially available counterpart detailed characterization ftir sem edx and bet and experimental evidences reveal high mechanical strength hydrophilic nature and high selectivity in removal of ionic contaminants the integrated process successfully removes chromium 99 5 cod 99 and tds 96 while retaining the essential ions ca2 mg2 substantially a sustained high flux hovering around 200 l m2 h at 16 bar pressure over a reasonably long period 150 h is an indicator of development of a potential new technology in effective treatment of leather industry wastewater keywords tannery wastewater go based membrane advanced oxidation nanofiltration hybrid process chromium rejection 1 introduction despite very significant contribution to world economy and trade tannery industries have always faced criticism because of environmental pollution through discharge of enormous quantity of hazardous wastewater every 150 kg of finished leather product is associated with release of around 700 kg of sludge and 30 35 m3 wastewater laden with 400 kg of suspended and dissolved solids characterized by high chemical oxygen demand cod chromium sulfide and other organic as well as inorganic contaminants 1 sources of such wastewater in tannery industry are the treatment units of raw hides and animal skins with different chemical compounds to make them more durable the residue chemicals mostly make their way into the dischargeable wastewater the entire tanning operation also requires a continuous supply of huge amount of fresh water while releasing about 90 of the used water as effluent 2 tannery effluent is characterized by high concentration of chlorides cl sulfates so4 2 sulfides s2 chromium in case of chrome tanning high alkalinity suspended solids oil and grease the pollutants may be broadly expressed in terms of lumped parameters viz chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod 3 world wide 6 million tons of solid waste and 600 million m3 per year of such amalgam effluent are released to the environment from various leather industries 4 the toxic effluent degrades the natural water bodies like the rivers as well as the whole ecosystem among the pollutants of tannery wastewater chromium cr is the heavy metal cr3 cr6 contaminant of major concern due to its adverse health effect such as kidney and liver damage hemolysis asthma chronic bronchitis and even carcinogenicity 5 who has set the maximum permissible limit mcl of cr6 in drinking water as 0 05 mg l 1 6 data show above 90 of the leather industries are based on chrome tanning and only 50 70 of the used chromium in the form of basic chrome sulfate in chrome tanning processes is fixed with the leather moiety while the rest is discharged with the effluent directly to the environment 7 in mitigating this serious pollution problem several studies on physico chemical and biological processes have been conducted some of these treatment methods are only considered as primary while the others are final and secondary treatments sedimentation and coagulation flocculation using coagulants like al2 so4 3 or fecl3 are some of the conventional primary methods to treat tannery wastewater 8 9 though these methods can moderately reduce the tss cod and chromium level failure to effectively combat bod pollution level coupled with ph sensitivity requirement of high dose of coagulants and generation of huge quantity of sludge remain as some of the major hurdles in their successful exploitation the secondary treatments are illustrated by biological processes and physico chemical processes like electrochemical oxidation ozonation uv irradiation adsorption and advanced oxidation process aop biological processes though known for relatively low cost in handling enormous quantity of such wastewater are very sensitive to operating conditions failure to closely monitor the operating conditions may turn the process ineffective despite involving long time and large land space adsorption technology being one of the most successful treatment processes for removal of dyes heavy metal ions and noms naturally occurring organic matter from water faces problems in treatment of very dirty wastewater in enormous quantity as that implies very frequent replacement of spent adsorbent material though adsorption based plants initially show high removal efficiency the quality of treatment gradually goes down due to exhaustion of the adsorption capacity of the bed material 10 11 this necessitates continuous monitoring of the permeate quality in addition adsorption process is associated with regeneration and replacement of the spent adsorbent and discharge of huge amount of sludge to the environment among other techniques advanced oxidation process aop involving fenton s reagent is found to be quite promising for oxidative degradation of organic matters present in tannery wastewater due to in situ generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals some studies have reported removal of chromium and cod from tannery wastewater by fenton s oxidation process 12 though overall removal remains at low level and does not permit treatment of tannery wastewater to the reusable criteria advanced oxidation aop can decompose many refractory chemical compounds to simple and less harmful compounds though aop alone cannot ensure treatment to reusable criteria however aop integrated with nanofiltration based membrane separation appears to succeed in treatment of wastewater to the reusable criteria 13 so long focus of industrial wastewater treatment was on adhering to the permissible effluent standards while discharging wastewater or treated water so that natural water bodies could be largely protected from pollution but the emerging strategies are now on recycling and reuse of the treated water embracing circular economy approach as this approach not only protects the natural water bodies from the onslaught of hazardous waste discharge but also saves on fresh water consumption and eliminates the need for continuous monitoring of waste discharge to the natural water bodies by the pollution control agencies considering this emerging circular economy strategy an advanced oxidation nanofiltration hybrid technology is developed in this study through experimental investigation on live wastewater from a kolkata based tannery industry a new go based membrane is synthesized for the desired nanofiltration stage and the performance of the membrane is compared with some commercial varieties such a membrane integrated hybrid treatment scheme in the context of leather industry wastewater has not been reported in the literature 2 theoretical background 2 1 aop process fenton s oxidation fenton s oxidation being the most common advanced oxidation processes aop has been used for the pre treatment of tannery wastewater prior to membrane filtration this process involves a mechanism involving highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh which degrades several organic pollutants dyes phenols nitro phenols organic acids dcm formaldehydes etc chlorinated compounds sulfides etc found in leather wastewater in a rapid and non selective way degradation of organic pollutants is generally expressed in terms of the decreased cod level after fenton s treatment of the wastewater 14 15 fenton s free radical pathway generally involves the reaction of an oxidizing reagent h2o2 in the presence of catalytic amount of iron fe2 such as ferrous sulfate in acidic medium as stated in reaction 1 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 È¯h oh the possibility of auto generation of fe2 occurs in this catalytic reaction as per the reaction 2 2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 È¯oh h so addition of h2o2 in a certain dose increases the availability of highly reactive È¯h which oxidize the organic compounds present in tannery wastewater and finally convert them into co2 and water 3 3 È¯h organic compound co2 h2o fenton s reagent also oxidizes inorganic sulfides present in the wastewater as follows 4 s2 s2o3 2 so3 2 so4 2 rate of the fenton s reaction depends on the solubilities of both fe2 and fe3 which is again a function of solution ph as in acidic ph fe2 is much more soluble in water than fe3 this reaction occurs in lower ph when the ph is raised above 10 the reaction slows down due to lower availability of fe3 because it precipitates out as fe oh 3 from the solution 16 17 2 2 membrane synthesis the surface of a freshly casted polyether sulfone pes membrane was modified using graphene oxide go nanomaterials in a layer by layer l b l assembly method 18 the pes support layer was casted on a polyester fabric via phase inversion then a thin polyamide coat was applied on the base material using meta phenylene diamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc via interfacial polymerization reaction the newly formed amide linkages provide sufficient active functional sites the polyamide coated membrane was treated with tmc followed by graphene oxide go solution for successful attachment of go layer tmc acts as a cross linking reagent which helps the go layer to adhere strongly onto the membrane surface through strong ester bonds fig 1 where facile functionalization enhances availability of go on the membrane surface reduces possibility of go to be washed away with water and increases the cost effectiveness of the synthesis step 2 3 membrane modules microfiltration mf and nanofiltration nf of wastewater was done using a flat sheet membrane module integrated with an advanced oxidation unit the flat sheet cross flow membrane module is chosen for its largely fouling free nature where sweeping action of the tangentially flowing fluid over the membrane surface keeps it resistant against fouling resulting in remarkably enhanced flux for long 19 the microfiltration separation is mainly based on steric exclusion mechanism that helps reduction of tds cod iron and other macromolecular contaminants in the aop treated water prior to nanofiltration separation purification by nanofiltration membrane is based on both steric size and electrical donnan model the nf membranes used in this separation process possesses negative surface which repels the negatively charged ions present in the solution 20 the synthesized go based nanocomposite membrane goncm contains a well defined negatively charged surface due to presence of a large amount of oxygenated functional groups carboxylate hydroxyl etc on its basal plane this negative surface makes it highly repulsive for the similarly charged ions and permeable for some useful positive ions ca2 mg2 present in the solution chromium being present in the form of negative ions hcro4 cr2o7 2 cr4o13 2 cro4 2 gets repelled by the negative membrane surface and is removed from the system according to donnan exclusion principle 5 moreover the highly hydrophilic nature and tendency of water channel formation of the go nanoparticles make the go based membranes more promising in terms of flux behavior than any other traditional polyamide membranes nf 1 available in market 3 materials and methods tannery wastewater was collected from leather complex kolkata india after chemical analysis of this collected wastewater table 1 it was stored in air tight pet containers for seven days at room temperature 30 c for primary sedimentation the wastewater was first pre treated with fenton s reagent to reduce its high s2 and cod level then it was passed through mf membranes for further reduction of total suspended solids thereafter the mf permeate was finally filtered through nf membranes to remove ionic pollutants especially chromium the overall design is compact and continuous following sedimentation the supernatant water was decanted and collected in high density polyethylene vessel hdpe for advanced oxidation aop with fenton s reagent the aop tank was integrated with flat sheet cross flow membrane module that could be equipped with mf or nf membranes the aop

the quality of the wastewater after fenton s based aop treatment in terms of some major parameters such as ph cod tds chloride ion cl and sulfide ion s2 raw tannery wastewater collected from leather industry belt was found to have a huge amount of corrosive sulfide ion 2560 mg l 1 high cod level 10 500 mg l 1 high tds value 7420 mg l 1 and large chloride ion concentration of 4620 mg l 1 as presented in table 1 after fenton s oxidation the concentration of s2 ion was found to be much reduced by almost 97 65 mg l 1 and the levels of cod tds and cl were also reduced by 43 6170 mg l 1 74 1925 mg l 1 and 57 1983 mg l 1 respectively which proves that the pre treatment step of wastewater with fenton s reagent helped to improve the water quality significantly before microfiltration stage 5 2 membrane morphology the surface chemistry of the goncm could be revealed further from ftir analysis as illustrated in fig 5 the peak intensities near 3500 3700 cm 1 are attributed to nh and oh stretching frequencies of amide and ester acid functional groups present on the structure 23 peaks near 2900 3000 cm 1 are due to aromatic c h bonds presence of an intense broad peak ranged between 1658 and 1750 cm 1 of carbonyl stretching can be of amide and ester functionalities proves the successful go linking over the membrane surface 18 25 the surface morphology of goncm is well explained by the fe sem of top surface of the synthesized membrane fig 6 a roughness of the membrane surface can be attributed to the successful incorporation of go layer the visible pores on the membrane surface were marked circular and the average radius of the pores were measured to be 0 86 nm from bet analysis of goncm the cross sectional fe sem images fig 6b d explains formation of nano channels through the membrane by go material which helps increase the hydrophilicity of go based membranes the higher pore size 0 86 nm of the synthesized goncm than that of commercial polyamide nf 1 membrane 0 53 nm is well in line with previous studies 25 introducing hydrophilic go nano particles in lower percentage 0 15 wt on polyamide layer increases the amorphous nature of the polymer matrix and also increases the overall porosity of the membrane 26 this explains comparatively higher flux of the synthesized graphene oxide based nanocomposite membrane goncm than nf 1 total pore volume 0 12 c3 g 1 and specific surface area 277 90 m2 g 1 of the synthesized go enabled membrane were calculated from the isotherm fitting data with bet isotherm equation 5 3 membrane performance 5 3 1 effect of transmembrane pressure on flux and chromium rejection fig 7 a explains the ion rejection behavior of both membranes nf 1 goncm in terms of chromium present in the wastewater for an operational pressure range between 6 bar and 16 bar nf 1 shows chromium rejection between 51 and 96 whereas goncm rejects the target species chromium from 55 to more than 99 flux data presented in fig 7b shows a linear increase in permeate flux with increasing operating pressure at a fixed cross flow rate 650 l h 1 both in case of the commercial membrane nf 1 as well as the synthesized nano filtration membrane while operating the novel nf module with microfiltered wastewater commercial nf 1 membrane yielded volumetric flux ranging from 48 lmh to 138 lmh under the operating pressure of 6 16 bar the synthesized graphene based membrane goncm in this context performs far better resulting in a high permeate flux from 90 lmh to more than 210 lmh for the same pressure range linear dependence of both flux and rejection on trans membrane pressure explains the uncoupled nature of solvent and solute flux in nf module 20 extremely hydrophilic nature and tendency of formation of 2d nano channels between graphene layers enable the go based membrane to pass water molecules selectively through it while rejecting other ions 24 27 highly negative surface of graphene oxide layer due to presence of several carboxylic cooh and hydroxyl oh moieties makes it repellent of the negative ions these exceptional properties helped the synthesized go based membrane goncm to be characterized with high flux and rejection of negatively charged pollutants chromate ions from the wastewater enhanced flux and better chromium rejection of goncm over commercial membrane makes it more promising in this particular field moreover in this study the separation phenomenon based on donnan steric model in nf module shows that the synthesized go based membrane does not act as an adsorption membrane for chromium removal as explained in previous reports which makes this membrane based smart technology more advantageous over the traditional ones 22 5 3 2 fouling behavior of the membranes in nf module fouling is considered a major hurdle in sustainable operation of membrane separation system building up of concentration polarization on membrane surface gradually reduces the availability of filtration surface area of any membrane this results in decline in flux to examine the fouling behavior of both the commercial and synthesized membranes in the flat sheet cross flow nf module the system was run for more than 150 h with the mf treated tannery effluent fig 8 represents the permeate flux as a function of operating time from the flux results it transpires that both the membranes performed well in the cross flow module with the live wastewater with a maximum 6 decline of flux the novel design of the membrane module ensures a sweeping action across the flat sheet membrane surface reducing the tendency to building up of concentration polarization which helps ensure high sustained flux again goncm shows a high volumetric flux of about 200 lmh even after 150 h with a reduced flux decline limited to only 3 5 against 6 of the commercial nf 1 membrane this suggests quite antifouling nature of the module equipped with graphene based membrane over the traditional polyamide ones even after long operation the fouling can be reversed by rinsing the membranes with 0 01 n naoh and hno3 solutions followed by washing with di water overall quality of the treated water in terms of ph cod tds and chromium through aop membrane hybrid technology as presented in fig 9 shows successful treatment of tannery wastewater for reuse 6 conclusion the study culminated in development of an advanced technology for treatment and recycle of tannery wastewater the technology involves a hybrid process that combines advanced oxidation with downstream membrane separation using a novel graphene oxide based nanocomposite membrane in a flat sheet cross flow module the advanced oxidation step could effectively decompose complex and hazardous molecules into harmless and simple molecules subsequent microfiltration followed by nanofiltration turned the water reusable the major hurdle of a membrane separation process is often membrane fouling and the same was largely overcome through appropriate selection of novel flat sheet cross flow module due to its tangential flow mechanism with good sweeping action unlike any dead end module and synthesis of a new hydrophilic membrane simultaneous achievement of high selectivity and flux is often a big challenge in membrane separation but this could largely been overcome as evident in the results the synthesized graphene oxide based membrane performed well as evident in sustained high flux and high degree of separation of the target contaminants at the polishing stage high rejection efficiency for cod 99 tds 96 and chromium 99 at a sustained reasonably high flux of 210 220 lmh under an operating pressure of 16 bar indicates that the advanced oxidation nanofiltration system equipped with the new go based membrane could be a potential as well as sustainable technology in effective treatment of wastewater from leather industry for recycle and reuse declaration of competing interest the authors

14006,an advanced oxidation nanofiltration integrated hybrid process is developed in this study for treatment of leather industry wastewater to reusable criteria the process uses a laboratory synthesized graphene oxide based nanocomposite in the final polishing step for ensuring high degree of purification all investigations are done on live tannery wastewater having high level of recalcitrant pollutants such as chromium 8 2 mg l 1 cod 10 500 mg l 1 tds 7420 mg l 1 chloride 4620 mg l 1 and sulfide 2560 mg l 1 performance of the developed membrane is also compared with commercially available counterpart detailed characterization ftir sem edx and bet and experimental evidences reveal high mechanical strength hydrophilic nature and high selectivity in removal of ionic contaminants the integrated process successfully removes chromium 99 5 cod 99 and tds 96 while retaining the essential ions ca2 mg2 substantially a sustained high flux hovering around 200 l m2 h at 16 bar pressure over a reasonably long period 150 h is an indicator of development of a potential new technology in effective treatment of leather industry wastewater keywords tannery wastewater go based membrane advanced oxidation nanofiltration hybrid process chromium rejection 1 introduction despite very significant contribution to world economy and trade tannery industries have always faced criticism because of environmental pollution through discharge of enormous quantity of hazardous wastewater every 150 kg of finished leather product is associated with release of around 700 kg of sludge and 30 35 m3 wastewater laden with 400 kg of suspended and dissolved solids characterized by high chemical oxygen demand cod chromium sulfide and other organic as well as inorganic contaminants 1 sources of such wastewater in tannery industry are the treatment units of raw hides and animal skins with different chemical compounds to make them more durable the residue chemicals mostly make their way into the dischargeable wastewater the entire tanning operation also requires a continuous supply of huge amount of fresh water while releasing about 90 of the used water as effluent 2 tannery effluent is characterized by high concentration of chlorides cl sulfates so4 2 sulfides s2 chromium in case of chrome tanning high alkalinity suspended solids oil and grease the pollutants may be broadly expressed in terms of lumped parameters viz chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod 3 world wide 6 million tons of solid waste and 600 million m3 per year of such amalgam effluent are released to the environment from various leather industries 4 the toxic effluent degrades the natural water bodies like the rivers as well as the whole ecosystem among the pollutants of tannery wastewater chromium cr is the heavy metal cr3 cr6 contaminant of major concern due to its adverse health effect such as kidney and liver damage hemolysis asthma chronic bronchitis and even carcinogenicity 5 who has set the maximum permissible limit mcl of cr6 in drinking water as 0 05 mg l 1 6 data show above 90 of the leather industries are based on chrome tanning and only 50 70 of the used chromium in the form of basic chrome sulfate in chrome tanning processes is fixed with the leather moiety while the rest is discharged with the effluent directly to the environment 7 in mitigating this serious pollution problem several studies on physico chemical and biological processes have been conducted some of these treatment methods are only considered as primary while the others are final and secondary treatments sedimentation and coagulation flocculation using coagulants like al2 so4 3 or fecl3 are some of the conventional primary methods to treat tannery wastewater 8 9 though these methods can moderately reduce the tss cod and chromium level failure to effectively combat bod pollution level coupled with ph sensitivity requirement of high dose of coagulants and generation of huge quantity of sludge remain as some of the major hurdles in their successful exploitation the secondary treatments are illustrated by biological processes and physico chemical processes like electrochemical oxidation ozonation uv irradiation adsorption and advanced oxidation process aop biological processes though known for relatively low cost in handling enormous quantity of such wastewater are very sensitive to operating conditions failure to closely monitor the operating conditions may turn the process ineffective despite involving long time and large land space adsorption technology being one of the most successful treatment processes for removal of dyes heavy metal ions and noms naturally occurring organic matter from water faces problems in treatment of very dirty wastewater in enormous quantity as that implies very frequent replacement of spent adsorbent material though adsorption based plants initially show high removal efficiency the quality of treatment gradually goes down due to exhaustion of the adsorption capacity of the bed material 10 11 this necessitates continuous monitoring of the permeate quality in addition adsorption process is associated with regeneration and replacement of the spent adsorbent and discharge of huge amount of sludge to the environment among other techniques advanced oxidation process aop involving fenton s reagent is found to be quite promising for oxidative degradation of organic matters present in tannery wastewater due to in situ generation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals some studies have reported removal of chromium and cod from tannery wastewater by fenton s oxidation process 12 though overall removal remains at low level and does not permit treatment of tannery wastewater to the reusable criteria advanced oxidation aop can decompose many refractory chemical compounds to simple and less harmful compounds though aop alone cannot ensure treatment to reusable criteria however aop integrated with nanofiltration based membrane separation appears to succeed in treatment of wastewater to the reusable criteria 13 so long focus of industrial wastewater treatment was on adhering to the permissible effluent standards while discharging wastewater or treated water so that natural water bodies could be largely protected from pollution but the emerging strategies are now on recycling and reuse of the treated water embracing circular economy approach as this approach not only protects the natural water bodies from the onslaught of hazardous waste discharge but also saves on fresh water consumption and eliminates the need for continuous monitoring of waste discharge to the natural water bodies by the pollution control agencies considering this emerging circular economy strategy an advanced oxidation nanofiltration hybrid technology is developed in this study through experimental investigation on live wastewater from a kolkata based tannery industry a new go based membrane is synthesized for the desired nanofiltration stage and the performance of the membrane is compared with some commercial varieties such a membrane integrated hybrid treatment scheme in the context of leather industry wastewater has not been reported in the literature 2 theoretical background 2 1 aop process fenton s oxidation fenton s oxidation being the most common advanced oxidation processes aop has been used for the pre treatment of tannery wastewater prior to membrane filtration this process involves a mechanism involving highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh which degrades several organic pollutants dyes phenols nitro phenols organic acids dcm formaldehydes etc chlorinated compounds sulfides etc found in leather wastewater in a rapid and non selective way degradation of organic pollutants is generally expressed in terms of the decreased cod level after fenton s treatment of the wastewater 14 15 fenton s free radical pathway generally involves the reaction of an oxidizing reagent h2o2 in the presence of catalytic amount of iron fe2 such as ferrous sulfate in acidic medium as stated in reaction 1 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 È¯h oh the possibility of auto generation of fe2 occurs in this catalytic reaction as per the reaction 2 2 fe3 h2o2 fe2 È¯oh h so addition of h2o2 in a certain dose increases the availability of highly reactive È¯h which oxidize the organic compounds present in tannery wastewater and finally convert them into co2 and water 3 3 È¯h organic compound co2 h2o fenton s reagent also oxidizes inorganic sulfides present in the wastewater as follows 4 s2 s2o3 2 so3 2 so4 2 rate of the fenton s reaction depends on the solubilities of both fe2 and fe3 which is again a function of solution ph as in acidic ph fe2 is much more soluble in water than fe3 this reaction occurs in lower ph when the ph is raised above 10 the reaction slows down due to lower availability of fe3 because it precipitates out as fe oh 3 from the solution 16 17 2 2 membrane synthesis the surface of a freshly casted polyether sulfone pes membrane was modified using graphene oxide go nanomaterials in a layer by layer l b l assembly method 18 the pes support layer was casted on a polyester fabric via phase inversion then a thin polyamide coat was applied on the base material using meta phenylene diamine mpd and trimesoyl chloride tmc via interfacial polymerization reaction the newly formed amide linkages provide sufficient active functional sites the polyamide coated membrane was treated with tmc followed by graphene oxide go solution for successful attachment of go layer tmc acts as a cross linking reagent which helps the go layer to adhere strongly onto the membrane surface through strong ester bonds fig 1 where facile functionalization enhances availability of go on the membrane surface reduces possibility of go to be washed away with water and increases the cost effectiveness of the synthesis step 2 3 membrane modules microfiltration mf and nanofiltration nf of wastewater was done using a flat sheet membrane module integrated with an advanced oxidation unit the flat sheet cross flow membrane module is chosen for its largely fouling free nature where sweeping action of the tangentially flowing fluid over the membrane surface keeps it resistant against fouling resulting in remarkably enhanced flux for long 19 the microfiltration separation is mainly based on steric exclusion mechanism that helps reduction of tds cod iron and other macromolecular contaminants in the aop treated water prior to nanofiltration separation purification by nanofiltration membrane is based on both steric size and electrical donnan model the nf membranes used in this separation process possesses negative surface which repels the negatively charged ions present in the solution 20 the synthesized go based nanocomposite membrane goncm contains a well defined negatively charged surface due to presence of a large amount of oxygenated functional groups carboxylate hydroxyl etc on its basal plane this negative surface makes it highly repulsive for the similarly charged ions and permeable for some useful positive ions ca2 mg2 present in the solution chromium being present in the form of negative ions hcro4 cr2o7 2 cr4o13 2 cro4 2 gets repelled by the negative membrane surface and is removed from the system according to donnan exclusion principle 5 moreover the highly hydrophilic nature and tendency of water channel formation of the go nanoparticles make the go based membranes more promising in terms of flux behavior than any other traditional polyamide membranes nf 1 available in market 3 materials and methods tannery wastewater was collected from leather complex kolkata india after chemical analysis of this collected wastewater table 1 it was stored in air tight pet containers for seven days at room temperature 30 c for primary sedimentation the wastewater was first pre treated with fenton s reagent to reduce its high s2 and cod level then it was passed through mf membranes for further reduction of total suspended solids thereafter the mf permeate was finally filtered through nf membranes to remove ionic pollutants especially chromium the overall design is compact and continuous following sedimentation the supernatant water was decanted and collected in high density polyethylene vessel hdpe for advanced oxidation aop with fenton s reagent the aop tank was integrated with flat sheet cross flow membrane module that could be equipped with mf or nf membranes the aop

solution for 10 15 min to attach the go layer on membrane surface iii the goncm membrane was then washed several times with methanol water to remove excess chemicals dried in 60 c and preserved the particular wt of go was selected on the basis of experimental evidences in terms of flux and ion rejection capacity as well as literature research 3 3 pre treatment of tannery wastewater 3 3 1 fenton

system was run for more than 150 h with the mf treated tannery effluent fig 8 represents the permeate flux as a function of operating time from the flux results it transpires that both the membranes performed well in the cross flow module with the live wastewater with a maximum 6 decline of flux the novel design of the membrane module ensures a sweeping action across the flat sheet membrane surface reducing the tendency to building up of concentration polarization which helps ensure high sustained flux again goncm shows a high volumetric flux of about 200 lmh even after 150 h with a reduced flux decline limited to only 3 5 against 6 of the commercial nf 1 membrane this suggests quite antifouling nature of the module equipped with graphene based membrane over the traditional polyamide ones even after long operation the fouling can be reversed by rinsing the membranes with 0 01 n naoh and hno3 solutions followed by washing with di water overall quality of the treated water in terms of ph cod tds and chromium through aop membrane hybrid technology as presented in fig 9 shows successful treatment of tannery wastewater for reuse 6 conclusion the study culminated in development of an advanced technology for treatment and recycle of tannery wastewater the technology involves a hybrid process that combines advanced oxidation with downstream membrane separation using a novel graphene oxide based nanocomposite membrane in a flat sheet cross flow module the advanced oxidation step could effectively decompose complex and hazardous molecules into harmless and simple molecules subsequent microfiltration followed by nanofiltration turned the water reusable the major hurdle of a membrane separation process is often membrane fouling and the same was largely overcome through appropriate selection of novel flat sheet cross flow module due to its tangential flow mechanism with good sweeping action unlike any dead end module and synthesis of a new hydrophilic membrane simultaneous achievement of high selectivity and flux is often a big challenge in membrane separation but this could largely been overcome as evident in the results the synthesized graphene oxide based membrane performed well as evident in sustained high flux and high degree of separation of the target contaminants at the polishing stage high rejection efficiency for cod 99 tds 96 and chromium 99 at a sustained reasonably high flux of 210 220 lmh under an operating pressure of 16 bar indicates that the advanced oxidation nanofiltration system equipped with the new go based membrane could be a potential as well as sustainable technology in effective treatment of wastewater from leather industry for recycle and reuse declaration of competing interest the authors

14007,in the present work a sequence of adsorption tests were implemented to assess the adsorption of phosphate po4 3 from synthetic wastewater and treated sewage effluents using carbide derived carbon cdc characterization outcomes of the cdc show a highly microporous material with a point zero of charge pzc of 9 9 the successful detection of po4 3 onto cdc was conducted by energy dispersive spectroscopy the influence of operational factors ph value temperature cdc dosage agitation speed and po4 3 feed concentration on the adsorption uptake were evaluated in batch mode the kinetic adsorption data could be represented by the pseudo second order model and it shows that the po4 3 is rapidly and efficiently removed by cdc throughout a wide range of ph mainly due to the high pzc adsorption isotherm data were in compliance with langmuir redlich peterson and sips models suggesting a monolayer coverage with some possible heterogeneity of cdc adsorption sites the determined thermodynamic parameters point out that po4 3 adsorption through cdc is endothermic feasible and spontaneous remarkably the cdc demonstrated an adsorption uptake of po4 3 of 16 14 mg g the adsorption uptake was not affected by the temperature however the rate of po4 3 removal was promoted by temperature it was shown that residual po4 3 was completely removed from local treated sewage effluent by using cdc however raising the ionic strength of the feed and the presence of coexisting anions was found to decrease the adsorption uptake of the sorbent furthermore the adsorbed po4 3 was efficiently desorbed by 0 01 mol l hcl solution keywords carbide derived carbon phosphate adsorption adsorption isotherms treated sewage effluent competitive anions 1 introduction phosphate is a core element for mankind however the continuous discharge of po4 3 into water bodies in municipal industrial and agricultural waste waters 1 2 leads to water eutrophication and as a consequence compromises the ecosystem 3 5 eutrophication is the depletion of the oxygen content in water bodies by the over production of algae and phytoplankton due to the increased level of nutrients mainly po4 3 causing the death of mollusks fish and other aquatic ecosystem inhabitants 6 8 it has been reported that po4 3 concentrations between 25 Î¼g l and 0 03 mg l results in unfavorable eutrophication in water bodies 1 9 12 thus the removal of and maintaining a low level of redundant po4 3 in water is extremely significant to mitigate and control water eutrophication the po4 3 removal from water has been examined by several processes including biological treatment chemical precipitation adsorption and electrochemical treatment 13 15 biological treatments and chemical precipitation have both proven their efficiency in po4 3 removal 16 19 conventional activated sludge is the most widely used of the biological treatments that can achieve a 75 100 removal of po4 3 13 20 21 however it is less efficient at trace amounts and this was attributed to the reduction in the metabolism of microorganisms at a low po4 3 content 13 in addition to a large land footprint requirement 22 the removal of po4 3 can be carried out by chemical precipitation but it is limited by the production and handling of large amounts of sludge that creates further pollution problems in addition neutralization of the effluent is required and there are waste disposal difficulties 13 23 24 the physical separation methods such as electrodialysis and reverse osmosis have been found to be expensive for po4 3 removal 3 25 26 among the aforementioned technologies adsorption was considered to be an effective way for po4 3 capturing due to the simplicity in operation removal efficiency and cost effectiveness 23 27 30 over the last decade different adsorbents were investigated for the removal of po4 3 from water such as modified bentonites 11 31 waste alum sludge 32 goethite and akaganeite 33 granular ferric hydroxide 34 halloysite 35 modified activated carbons ac and modified ac fiber 36 41 it should be noted that common ac is not highly efficient for po4 3 capturing therefore to improve the po4 3 adsorption capacity onto ac various modifications have been applied using different materials such as zirconium lanthanum and iron nanoparticles however these novel adsorbents still demonstrate relatively low adsorption capacity of 5 1 15 3 mg g 36 41 graphene graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes have also been tested for po4 3 adsorption meanwhile the preparation of graphene and graphene oxide is complex and carbon nanotubes demonstrate only modest adsorption capacity of about 10 9 mg g 1 42 43 although other adsorbents including iron nanoparticles 35 44 46 lanthanum oxide 47 48 zirconium oxide 49 50 silica 51 eggshell 52 chitosan 53 54 zeolite 55 56 and biochar 57 58 were suggested for po4 3 removal the search for novel sorbents with improved properties and high sorption capacities is still an ongoing field of research carbide derived carbon cdc is an innovative and promising generation of carbon based materials that reveals unique properties the reported cdc surface area was higher than ac and cnt for instance the maximum reported cdc surface area was 3116 m2 g 59 61 while it is between 857 and 2000 m2 g for ac 62 63 and 200 790 m2 g for cnt 64 65 cdc can be produced by the chlorine treatment of different types of precursors such as titanium carbide silicon carbide and ceramic materials made from polymers such as si o c and ti c at a wide range of chlorination temperatures 200 1200 61 66 67 cdc has attracted the attention of scientists for different applications due to its wide range of properties depending on the preparation conditions it has an amorphous to crystalline structure tunable pore size distribution high chemical stability and high specific surface area 68 69 however so far there is only a limited number of papers related to using cdc for the adsorption of different pollutants such as cytokines acetaldehyde and pharmaceuticals 67 70 71 the cdc was also investigated for carbon dioxide capture and ion adsorption processes 72 73 the adsorption results of cdc for the aforementioned pollutants has demonstrated that this material could provide an efficient reliable and promising solution for pollutants adsorption in wastewater purification processes to the author s best knowledge cdc has not been studied for the removal of po4 3 from water in this study cdc is used to scrutinize the removal of po4 3 from synthetic water and treated sewage effluents tse a full characterization of cdc synthesized at 800 has been determined prior to and once after po4 3 capturing the influence of adsorption factors initial solution ph temperature adsorption time initial po4 3 concentration agitation speed cdc dosage and effect of coexisting anions on the removal of po4 3 has also been studied adsorption kinetics thermodynamics isotherms and the influence of solution ionic strength were analyzed moreover decreasing the level of po4 3 from a tse product stream is extremely significant in order for it to be used for district cooling applications accordingly the adsorption of po4 3 from tse was explored 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the po4 3 solutions were prepared from a 1000 mg l po4 3 standard solution obtained from nist kh2po4 in h2o which was purchased from

deionized milli q water was used for the preparation of po4 3 solutions the local tse water was collected from doha north sewage treatment works qatar 2 2 adsorbent synthesis and characterization the cdc type nanopore u used in the current study was obtained from carbon ukraine u carbon ltd the cdc was synthesized according to a previously described procedure 74 basically the titanium carbide tic powder was used as a precursor for cdc synthesis the tic powder was first heated to 800 in a stream of flowing argon gas this step was followed with the treatment of the tic with chlorine and hydrogen gases at 800 for 6 5 h and at 600 for 2 h respectively the cdc microstructure and surface morphology were inspected by field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem quanta feg 650 thermo fisher

isopropyl alcohol for 5 min then 20 Î¼l of the homogenized solution was placed over a 300 mesh lacey copper carbon grid and dried at room temperature before imaging fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir type thermo fisher scientific nicolet is10 usa was utilized to analyze the developed chemical groups on the cdc surface the spectra range was varied between 600 and 4000 cm 1 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 norcross usa was utilized to determine the surface area of the cdc the barrett joyner and halenda bjh was utilized for the pore size distribution evaluation by the bet equipment the bet was degassed at a temperature of 250 for 4 h then n2 gas at 77 k was used as an adsorbate for the bet and bjh analysis the zeta potential measurements with cdc particles were conducted by the zetasizer type nano zs 90 malvern instruments ltd uk functioning with an internal laser of 4 0 mw zeta potential values were evaluated at room temperature 25 within a ph range of 3 10 2 3 phosphate adsorption desorption experiments the adsorption tests were performed in batch mode in all adsorption experiments the cdc was added to a volume of 100 ml of the po4 3 solution in 250 ml conical flasks and shaken under the required conditions in a grant ols aqua pro temperature controlled shaker model ols26 uk while adsorption was taking place samples for analysis were collected at predetermined time intervals filtered over a 0 22 Î¼m ptfe membrane filter and po4 3 content was analyzed by ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex thermo fisher scientific usa using a guard column type ag19 2 250 mm and separator column type as19 2 250 mm the po4 3 analytical standard was used for ic calibration and quantification a calibration curve was prepared by analyzing a standards of known po4 3 concentrations to ensure the accuracy of the measurements the uptake amount q mg of po4 3 g of cdc and removal efficiency of po4 3 re from water were estimated according to eqs 1 and 2 1 q c i c e v w 2 r e c i c e c i 100 where ci and c e is the initial and final po4 3 concentration mg l v is the volume of the po4 3 solution l and w is the mass of the cdc g each adsorption test was undertaken three times and the mean values of these trials were illustrated the effect of cdc dosage was examined using a cdc dose from 0 05 to 5 g l the initial ph of the po4 3 mixture was varied between 3 and 10 while the agitation speed was changed from 100 to 200 rpm adsorption thermodynamics and the temperature influence were investigated by varying the feed temperature from 298 to 328 k while kinetic data were collected by analyzing the po4 3 content of samples taken at pre set time intervals between 1 min and 9 h to study the saturation time and adsorption uptake of the sorbent moreover the efficiency of po4 3 removal from sodium chloride solutions of various ionic strengths mixed anion solutions and tse was studied in the desorption studies the cdc that was used in kinetic adsorption experiments was separated from the un adsorbed po4 3 solution by centrifugation for 10 min at an agitation speed of 10 000 rpm using sorvall lynx 6000 centrifuge thermo scientific usa the cdc loaded with po4 3 was dried at 45 in a binder oven germany for 12 h and weighed before desorption experiments then cdc was subjected to desorption experiments using the regeneration solutions of 0 001 m hcl to 0 1 m hcl the po4 3 concentration in regenerated solutions was measured by ic and accordingly the recovered amount of po4 3 was calculated 2 4 adsorption kinetics kinetics of po4 3 removal by cdc were evaluated to inspect the adsorption capacity and to determine the rate limiting step the experimental adsorption data were analyzed according to lagergren pseudo 1st order 75 the ho mckay 2nd order 76 elovich 77 and the intra particle diffusion 78 models to identify the steps involved throughout the adsorption process the description of the used models is presented in table s1 2 5 adsorption isotherms to evaluate the adsorption isotherms 50 mg of cdc were added to a volume of 50 ml of po4 3 solution with concentration ranging between 1 and 100 mg l at 25 agitation speed of 150 rpm and ph 6 for 6 h the adsorption isotherm data were subjected to optimization using langmuir 79 freundlich 80 redlich peterson 81 and sips models 82 the model expressions and related parameters are tabulated in table s2 the langmuir adsorption model assumptions include that the surface of the adsorbent will be covered with one layer of the pollutant in addition that the vacant adsorbent sites are energetically homogeneous and can adsorb only one molecule of the pollutant 83 the dimensionless constant of the langmuir model rl known as the equilibrium parameter can be expressed as follows 35 3 r l 1 1 h c 0 where c 0 is the initial po4 3 concentration the rl values provides an indication about the feasibility of the adsorption i e the adsorption is favorable if rl is between 0 and 1 linear if rl 1 unfavorable if it is more than 1 and irreversible if rl 0 84 the freundlich isotherm model is normally applicable to non ideal reversible and heterogeneous systems where 1 the adsorption is not limited to a monolayer coverage and 2 the adsorption capacity increases with increasing feed adsorbate concentration the redlich peterson and sips models are three parameter formulae and are effective in the range between the freundlich and langmuir isotherms the sips model provides an insight to heterogeneous systems while the redlich peterson model can describe both the heterogeneous and homogenous adsorption systems and it also covers a wide range of adsorbate concentrations 85 86 the equilibrium data were examined by these isotherms using the excel solver by minimizing the sum of the square of the errors sse that can be calculated according to the following formula 84 4 s s e i 1 n q i e x p q i c a l 2 where qi exp and qi cal are the adsorption capacities mg g obtained from the experimental set and the one estimated from the model respectively n is the number of data points furthermore the isotherm results were validated and compared according the residual standard deviation sd and the determination coefficient r2 the sd was calculated as follows 84 5 s d 1 n p i 1 n q i e x p q i c a l 2 where p is the number of factors of the used model 2 6 adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption of po4 3 by cdc was conducted over a temperature range of 25 55 to scrutinize the impact of temperature on the cdc adsorption uptake toward po4 3 molecules and to estimate the thermodynamic factors gibbs free energy Î´ g enthalpy Î´ h and entropy Î´ s changes the spontaneity and feasibility of the removal process can be pointed out by estimating the change in gibbs free energy and it can be determined from the classical van t hoff equation at any temperature 6 Î´ g r t l n k d where k d is the constant of thermodynamic equilibrium t is the temperature k and r is the gas constant 1 37 k d is calculated as follows 7 k d c a c e where c a is the extent of pollutant adsorbed on the cdc at saturation mg l the entropy change provides an explanation about the degrees of freedom degree in the system or the extent of order disorder of the molecules while the enthalpy change provides information regarding the adsorption process nature whether it is exothermic or endothermic according to thermodynamics entropy and enthalpy changes at constant temperature are linked to the gibbs free energy by the following equation 8 Î´ g Î´ h t Î´ s by combining this equation with the van t hoff equation enthalpy and entropy changes are obtained from the y axis intersection and the slope of the following formula by drawing ln kd versus 1 t 87 9 l n k d Î´ s r Î´ h r 1 t 3 results and discussion 3 1 cdc characterization the sem images were acquired in order to evaluate the size and shape of the cdc fig 1 illustrates the sem images of cdc particles at low and high magnifications it can be observed the cdc particles have irregular shapes with a wide range of sizes ranging between 200 nm and 2 Î¼m the cdc particles form aggregates of irregular shapes the tem images are presented in fig 2 the tem images illustrate that a highly porous carbon material has been developed the eds analysis of cdc has been conducted prior and after the adsorption process fig 3 a illustrates that carbon is the main constituent of the cdc besides oxygen aluminum and chloride in addition to these elements phosphorus has been detected in the cdc samples collected after the adsorption process as depicted in fig 3b a homogenous distribution of phosphorus onto the cdc was observed after adsorption as seen in fig 4 the corresponding functional groups onto the cdc were acquired by ftir in the ftir spectrum illustrated in fig s1 a broad band was detected in the region 3300 3500 cm 1 which belongs to the oh stretching vibration 88 indicating the presence of adsorbed water molecules two more peaks positioned between stretches 3000 and 2800 cm 1 belong to the stretching vibration of the c h bond while the peaks at 1241 and 1574 cm 1 are linked with coc and cc stretching bonds respectively 89 90 the pore size distribution for cdc particles was studied by the bjh method and the results are displayed in fig 5 a as seen the cdc contains mainly micropores with a significant peak at 2 nm it can also be realized that most of the pores are between 1 and 4 nm the mean pore size according to the bjh adsorption desorption results is in the range 2 8 3 1 nm the estimated bet surface area of the cdc was 1120 m2 g the n2 adsorption desorption curve of cdc is illustrated in fig 5b according to iupac classification n2 adsorption at cdc follows type ia sorption isotherm 91 suggesting a ultra highly microporous material similar curves were obtained for the cdc produced at 800 using tic as a precursor 92 3 2 effect of agitation speed cdc dose and adsorption time the po4 3 removal at different cdc dosages is illustrated in fig 6 it is shown that po4 3 removal increased with cdc dosage obviously due to an increase of available adsorption sites the po4 3 removal was 16 4 at a cdc dosage of 0 05 g l and increased to more than 90 at a cdc dosage of 3 g l after this value the po4 3 removal was only slightly increasing with the cdc dose most probably due to the aggregation of the cdc particles at higher dosages which prevented the full utilization of vacant sites it was observed that the adsorption uptake of po4 3 on cdc reduces from 67 7 to 4 0 mg g for cdc dosages of 0 05 and 5 g l respectively evidently at high cdc dosage the amount of po4 3 in the solution was not enough to saturate the cdc available adsorption sites throughout the adsorption process the influence of agitation speed and adsorption time on po4 3 uptake amount is clarified in fig 7 as shown the po4 3 uptake increases with the agitation speed obviously due to the fact that increasing the agitation speed will facilitate the transportation of po4 3 ions from the bulk solution towards the cdc surface also a low agitation speed of 100 rpm might be not efficient enough to prevent the agglomeration of cdc particles in the solution such agglomeration could reduce a number of available adsorption sites for example after 30 min contact time the adsorbed amount of po4 3 was 4 65 5 00 and 5 12 mg g at agitation speeds of 100 150 and 200 rpm respectively as illustrated in fig 7 the adsorbed amount increases with adsorption time and maximum adsorption was achieved after 6 h it should be noted that in the first 5 h the adsorption values at an agitation speed of 200 rpm were higher than ones at agitation speed of 150 rpm however at longer adsorption times practically no difference in adsorbed po4 3 values was found obviously at long adsorption time an increase of rpm value above 150 did not practically affect the ability of adsorbate species to reach the adsorptive cites at cdc surface from the above results the agitation speed of 150 rpm was selected to be the optimal for adsorption of po4 3 ions at cdc 3 3 adsorption isotherms fig 8 illustrates the po4 3 adsorption isotherm on cdc langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson adsorption models have been utilized for fitting the experimental data to have a better insight into the adsorption mechanism of po4 3 uptake by cdc the data fitting was analyzed in terms of r 2 sse and the residual standard deviation sd parameters which are displayed in table 1 it can be seen that the r2 sse and sd values were best fitted with the redlich peterson isotherm model it has the highest r2 and the least sse and sd values very similar parameters were also obtained with langmuir and sips models these results reveal the formation of the po4 3 monolayer on the sorbent with possibly some heterogeneity of the cdc adsorption sites the values of the langmuir separation factor rl are between 0 07 and 0 7 representing that the po4 3 adsorption by cdc is favorable the freundlich isotherm model shows a lower determination factor compared to the other models indicating that it is not well suited for po4 3 adsorption on cdc it should be highlighted that cdc demonstrates more favorable results in terms of adsorption uptake compared to other carbon materials as presented in table 2 the maximum adsorption uptake observed with cdc was 16 14 mg g 3 4 adsorption kinetics fig 9 illustrates the kinetics of po4 3 capturing by cdc at temperatures of 25 and 55 as depicted the adsorption of po4 3 using cdc is very fast a significant removal was noticed during the first minute of the adsorption time most probably due to easily accessible adsorption sites on the cdc surface the rate of adsorption became slower with time and the saturation was achieved in about 6 h of contact time at both temperatures the po4 3 removal after 1 min of adsorption was 52 and 68 at 25 at 55 respectively while at adsorption equilibrium the removal was 90 0 and 91 4 at 25 and 55 respectively the kinetic adsorption data were optimized utilizing the pseudo 1st and 2nd order models in addition to the elovich and intra particle diffusion models the key parameters and the determination coefficients for all models at various temperatures are presented in table 3 the coefficient of determination r2 of the pseudo 1st order model was lower than that for the pseudo 2nd order model furthermore it was apparent that the calculated measures of po4 3 adsorption qcal gained from the pseudo 1st order model did not comply with the qe values gained from the experiments this finding indicates that adsorption of po4 3 on cdc cannot be explained by the pseudo 1st order kinetics model for both temperatures the highest determination coefficient r2 was found for the pseudo 2nd order model in addition to that the estimated adsorption value qcal obtained from this model was approaching the experimental adsorption value qe these results show that po4 3 capturing by cdc can be described best by the pseudo 2nd order kinetics model similar findings have been concluded for po4 3 removal by modified activated carbons 36 38 39 93 and carbon nanotubes 1 the values of k2 enhanced from 0 024 to 0 032 g mg min by increasing the temperature from 25 to 55 indicating that the removal of po4 3 by cdc is an endothermic process the half life time t 1 2 of adsorption is the time needed to adsorb 50 of po4 3 amount that could be adsorbed at equilibrium 94 this parameter gives a measure of the adsorption rate and is calculated according to the following equation 10 t 1 2 1 k 2 q e the half life time was 4 95 min at 55 compared to 6 70 min at 25 confirming the faster adsorption kinetics at the higher temperature moreover the elovich model was also in good compliance with the kinetic experimental values the determination coefficient r2 0 991 and 0 923 at temperatures 25 and 55 respectively the elovich initial adsorption rate Î± was 202 918 mg g min at 55 while it is 1400 mg g min at 25 besides the intercept term of elovich model 1 Î² l n Î± Î² which yields the adsorption quantity at ln t zero i e at an adsorption time of 1 min 95 was 3 55 mg g at 25 and 4 35 at 55 for the adsorption capacity of 6 33 mg g at 55 it means that more than 67 of the po4 3 uptake was reached within 1 min of adsorption this very fast adsorption kinetic result is one of the most attractive characteristics of the cdc adsorbent the intra particle diffusion kinetic model was used to obtain better knowledge regarding the guiding mechanism of the po4 3 cdc adsorption process if the trend line of qt against square root of time parameter is in compliance with the experimental data satisfies the linear relationship and intercepts the origin then the only guiding mechanism of the adsorption is the intra particle diffusion if not this means that more than one rate step guides the adsorption process 96 as depicted in fig 10 the dependency of po4 3 uptake versus square root of time shows two straight lines indicating that more than one step controls the adsorption process the first linear part clarifies the external surface adsorption where po4 3 ions diffuse from the solution across the boundary layer surrounding the cdc particle to the surface of cdc this surface adsorption responsible for removal of about 85 of the total adsorbed po4 3 the second linear part refers to the slower rate of po4 3 adsorption into the pores of cdc and is responsible for 10 15 of the cdc total adsorption capacity this initial boundary layer effect is also confirmed by the agitation experiments the c value represents the thickness of the boundary layer the greater value of c means the higher impact of the boundary layer on the adsorption process 77 as seen in table 3 the c value improved with rising the temperature which implies that the adsorption process was improved with temperature due to the increased mobility of the ions lowering both of the solution density and the viscosity at the higher temperature 3 5 thermodynamics and the influence of temperature the amount of po4 3 adsorbed on cdc was investigated at different solution temperatures ranging between 25 and 55 and the results are illustrated in fig s2 as demonstrated the adsorption of po4 3 was improved with the higher solution temperature throughout the first 6 h of adsorption for instance the po4 3 adsorption amount on the cdc after 3 h of contact time was 5 84 5 94 6 05 and 6 13 mg g at temperature of 25 35 45 and 55 respectively these results demonstrate that the temperature has affected the adsorption rate but not the adsorption capacity showing that the po4 3 capturing by cdc is most likely due to physical rather than chemical adsorption 31 furthermore increasing the adsorption rate of po4 3 on cdc at the higher temperature proves that the adsorption is an endothermic process which is in compliance with the changes of the thermodynamic parameters 52 the enhancement in po4 3 removal with temperature might be credited to the increasing in mobility and mass transfer rate of po4 3 ions towards the adsorbent surface and internal pores the activation energy of po4 3 adsorption e a on cdc was evaluated according to the following formula 11 ln k 2 ln k 0 e a r t where e a is activation energy of po4 3 adsorption in kj mol k 2 is the pseudo second order kinetic model constant calculated from the kinetic data at each temperature and k 0 is the independent factor of temperature the adsorption process is physical if the activation energy ea is less than 40 kj mol while it is chemical if the ea is more than 40 kj mol 97 98 the value of activation energy was 6 95 kj mol indicating a physical adsorption process of po4 3 onto cdc the thermodynamic parameters of po4 3 adsorption by cdc entropy enthalpy and the gibbs free energy changes are illustrated in table 4 the Î´ s value of po4 3 adsorption on the cdc was positive and estimated to be 33 62 j mol k the positive Î´ s value indicates the disorder degree and the increase in particle randomness at the cdc liquid interface throughout the adsorption process 99 the value of Î´ s also indicates the po4 3 ions affinity toward the cdc 52 the calculated value of Î´ h is 4 53 kj mol suggesting that the adsorption process of po4 3 onto the cdc is an endothermic process 100 the change in the gibbs free energy was calculated to be 5 47 5 83 6 23 and 6 45 kj mol at 25 35 45 and 55 respectively this point out that adsorption process presented in this study is spontaneous and more favorable at higher temperatures which is in agreement with the above kinetic data 3 6 influence of co existing anions on the po4 3 adsorption by cdc wastewater and tse generally have different anions that might affect the adsorption capacity and compete with po4 3 for the vacant adsorption sites thus the impact of competing anions on the adsorption removal of po4 3 by cdc was investigated using a complex mixture of the fluoride bromide nitrate and sulphate anions with loadings of 2 10 10 and 10 mg l respectively in addition to 20 mg l of po4 3 fig 11 illustrates the adsorption capacity of the different anions after 6 h of adsorption it was found that the existence of the competing anions decreased the adsorption uptake of po4 3 from 6 25 mg g without anions to 4 82 mg g with the anions mixture under similar conditions the reduction in the adsorption uptake of po4 3 may possibly be explained by the competition between po4 3 and other anions on the vacant active adsorption sites the sulphate anions have a relatively higher impact on the po4 3 adsorption compared to fluoride bromide and nitrate ions this might be attributed to the ionic radius of sulphate which is closer to the po4 3 anion the ionic radius is 2 38 Ã¥ for po4 3 and 2 3 Ã¥ for sulphate compared to the monovalent anions hence there is a competition between sulphate and po4 3 ions for the same adsorption sites similar observations of the sulphate ions effect on po4 3 removal was stated by bozorgpour et al 101 kumar et al 102 and he et al 55 furthermore luo et al 103 found that the adsorption capacity of po4 3 anions decreased with the existence of so4 2 anions more compared to the monovalent anions they attributed that to the fact that the multivalent anions such as so4 2 form stronger bonds on both of the outer and inner sphere complexes while the monovalent anions such as cl and no3 form weaker bonds on the outer surface complexes with the vacant active sites this indicates that the anions with higher ionic potential are more favorable for the adsorbent 104 accordingly the various affinities of the co existing anions will differently affect the adsorption of po4 3 onto the cdc 3 7 effect of initial ph value on the adsorption capacity of cdc toward po4 3 the influence of initial solution ph on the po4 3 adsorption capacity by cdc was observed by adjusting the ph value from 2 to 10 and the results were discussed and illustrated in fig 12 it is known that the adsorption of po4 3 ions is extremely reliant on the ph as it determines the dissociation of po4 3 ions their speciation and their electrostatic attractions with the adsorbent as illustrated in fig 12 the cdc adsorption capacity was relatively lower at acidic and basic media ph 2 and 10 compared to the solutions in the range ph 4 8 these findings are mainly accredited to the dissociation of the po4 3 molecules in the solution the po4 3 anions exist in four different species at different solution ph values and dissociate as follows 81 12 h 3 p o 4 p k 1 h 2 p o 4 h p k 2 h p o 4 2 2 h p k 3 p o 4 3 3 h the p k 1 p k 2 p k 3 values are 2 13 7 20 and 12 33 respectively 93 the zeta potential measurements of the cdc are presented in fig s3 as seen in this figure the zeta potential values of cdc particles are positive over a wide ph range the pzc of cdc was obtained to be 9 9 which is consistent to the values stated in the literature 61 70 50 51 at ph 2 the po4 3 in solution exists as h 3 p o 4 which is neutral and weakly interacts with the positively charged adsorbent as the ph value increases to 4 8 the dominant po4 3 anions are h 2 p o 4 and h p o 4 2 and the adsorption capacity increased obviously because of the attractive coulombic interactions between the negative po4 3 anions and positively charged cdc surface at basic conditions ph 10 the cdc particles become negatively charged and the adsorption between similarly negatively charged po4 3 anions and cdc surface becomes less favorable and as a result the adsorption uptake is decreased nevertheless notable po4 3 adsorption at acidic and basic ph values indicate that electrostatic and other adsorption mechanisms possibly chelation can also contribute to po4 3 adsorption with cdc 105 106 note that the final ph values of the residual po4 3 solutions after adsorption were found to be either the same or smaller than the ph of the initial solutions before adsorption obviously due to deprotonation of some functional groups at cdc surface 3 8 adsorption uptake of po4 3 by cdc at different ionic strength of the solution the effect of ionic strength of the solution on the removal of po4 3 by cdc using 0 01 and 0 001 m nacl solutions is highlighted in fig 13 evidently the amount of the adsorbed po4 3 has reduced with the increase of ionic strength of the po4 3 mixture the adsorption capacity was 6 24 5 98 and 5 12 mg g when the adsorption occurs in pure water 0 001 m and 0 01 m nacl solutions respectively these findings can be clarified by the reduction in electrostatic interactions between the po4 3 ions and adsorption sites due to the shielding effect of the electrolyte a similar findings have been reported in previous studies 1 38 increasing the ionic strength of the aqueous solution will act as a shield on the charges of both of the adsorbent and the adsorbate the influence of the ionic strength will be different according the charge of the adsorbent and the adsorbate if the adsorbent and the adsorbate have opposite charges increasing the ionic strength will decrease the adsorption capacity because of the decrease in electrostatic interactions due to the shielding effect on the other hand if the adsorbent and the adsorbate have similar signs of charge increasing the ionic strength of the solution will increase the adsorption capacity as the shielding effect in this case will decrease the electrostatic repulsion between them 107 108 as seen in fig 13 the adsorption capacity of po4 3 onto cdc decreases with the ionic strength of the solution confirming the shielding effect of the electrolyte these findings are in agreement with the electrostatic mechanism of adsorption as for discussed above for ph data moreover it was previously reported that the adsorption of po4 3 onto zirconia will decrease with the ionic strength of the solution if the po4 3 formed an outer sphere complexation while it is either increased or unchanged with the ionic strength of the solution if the po4 3 formed an inner sphere surface complexation 109 as illustrated in our results the adsorption capacity decreases with the ionic strength of the solution at the studied ph value indicating that the adsorptive removal mechanism is based on the outer sphere complexation of po4 3 ions with adsorption sites at cdc surface 3 9 adsorption of po4 3 from tse the tse samples with conductivity of 2534 mÏ total dissolved solids of 1622 mg l chemical oxygen demand of 5 mg l biological chemical demand bod5 of 2 mg l po4 3 content of 1 3 mg l and total organic carbon content of 1 5 ppm were collected from doha north sewage treatment works for the use of tse in district cooling applications it is very essential to decrease the level of po4 3 to minimize biofouling of the system to maintain consistency with the previous adsorption experiments conducted in this study the tse was spiked with po4 3 to obtain a final po4 3 loading of 20 mg l fig 14 illustrates the po4 3 removal from di and tse under same operational conditions evidently the po4 3 removal values from tse were smaller than that ones from di the po4 3 removal after reaching adsorption equilibrium was 90 and 66 from di and tse respectively the adsorption uptake of po4 3 on cdc was also decreased from 6 24 mg g to 4 54 mg g using di and tse respectively the decrease in po4 3 removal from tse compared to di may be explained by the competition between inorganic organic species in tse and po4 3 ions on the vacant adsorption sites on cdc surface by possible blockage of the adsorbent surface and porous structure by some organic and bacterial components present in tse as well as possible interactions between tse organic matters and po4 3 ions 70 110 112 the impact of cdc dosage on the po4 3 removal from tse is shown in table 5 as seen in the table a cdc dose of 3 g l was sufficient to remove 66 2 of the total po4 3 from tse with increasing of cdc dose to 5 g l more than 90 of the total po4 3 was removed from tse it should be highlighted that for non spiked tse the cdc dosage of 0 2 g l was found to be effective to completely remove the po4 3 residues from waste water 3 10 desorption experiments in this study di water and different concentrations of hcl solutions were used to recover the po4 3 adsorbed onto the cdc and the results are illustrated in table 6 with the increase of solution acidity the amount of recovered po4 3 was increased the po4 3 recovery was more than 90 using 0 1 m hcl compared to 8 5 for di water the reason behind desorption of po4 3 is obviously the ion exchange between chlorine ions in the solution and po4 3 ions on the cdc surface these results suggesting that regeneration of the adsorbent with 0 1 m of hcl could be utilized to recover the cdc for further reusing for po4 3 removal 4 conclusions the study analyzed the adsorption of po4 3 from synthetic water and tse using cdc the effect of adsorption factors was investigated including the adsorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics which were investigated throughout a series of batch adsorption experiments the cdc surface and chemical characterization show an irregular shaped and highly microporous material with a pore size ranging between 1 and 4 nm the adsorption kinetics were investigated at several temperatures and were best correlated by the pseudo second order model r 2 0 999 for both 25 and 55 furthermore the intra particle diffusion model was utilized to describe the mechanism of po4 3 adsorption on cdc the equilibrium experimental data confirms that the po4 3 adsorption on cdc were effectively correlated by the langmuir sips and redlich peterson models r 2 0 996 0 997 0 998 respectively suggesting the single layer po4 3 adsorption on the cdc with the possibility of some site heterogeneity on the adsorbent surface involving surface complexation reactions the changes in the thermodynamic factors gibbs free energy entropy and enthalpy in addition to the activation energy of the adsorption process clarifies that the removal of po4 3 throughout the cdc is spontaneous feasible physical and endothermic in nature the adsorption amount increased from 4 65 to 5 12 mg g by raising the agitation speed from 100 to 200 rpm similarly the temperature investigations was also found to promote the adsorption process the adsorption of po4 3 onto cdc was highly reliant on the ph value the highest adsorption uptake was achieved in the ph range of 4 8 where the dominant po4 3 species are h 2 p o 4 and h p o 4 2 ions and the cdc surface has a positive zeta potential assuming the electrostatic nature of the adsorption driving force however non zero values of po4 3 adsorption from acidic and basic aqueous solutions indicate that other adsorption mechanisms possible chelation also contribute to po4 3 adsorption on cdc competing anions present in water were found to decrease the adsorption capacity of po4 3 on cdc and the sulphate ions possessed the most pronounced competitive action compared to other anions it was found that increasing the ionic strength of the solution reduced the adsorption uptake because of the reduction in attractive forces between the cdc and po4 3 molecules the performance of cdc for po4 3 capture was investigated with tse and although the adsorption capacity of cdc towards po4 3 ions decreased from 6 24 to 4 54 mg g for di water and tse respectively a cdc dosage of 0 2 g l was found sufficient to completely adsorb the po4 3 residues in the raw tse water desorption experiments show that 0 1 mg l was able to recover more than 90 of the po4 3 these findings reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of cdc for fast removal of po4 3 from tse for possible tse application in district cooling applications declaration of competing

14007,in the present work a sequence of adsorption tests were implemented to assess the adsorption of phosphate po4 3 from synthetic wastewater and treated sewage effluents using carbide derived carbon cdc characterization outcomes of the cdc show a highly microporous material with a point zero of charge pzc of 9 9 the successful detection of po4 3 onto cdc was conducted by energy dispersive spectroscopy the influence of operational factors ph value temperature cdc dosage agitation speed and po4 3 feed concentration on the adsorption uptake were evaluated in batch mode the kinetic adsorption data could be represented by the pseudo second order model and it shows that the po4 3 is rapidly and efficiently removed by cdc throughout a wide range of ph mainly due to the high pzc adsorption isotherm data were in compliance with langmuir redlich peterson and sips models suggesting a monolayer coverage with some possible heterogeneity of cdc adsorption sites the determined thermodynamic parameters point out that po4 3 adsorption through cdc is endothermic feasible and spontaneous remarkably the cdc demonstrated an adsorption uptake of po4 3 of 16 14 mg g the adsorption uptake was not affected by the temperature however the rate of po4 3 removal was promoted by temperature it was shown that residual po4 3 was completely removed from local treated sewage effluent by using cdc however raising the ionic strength of the feed and the presence of coexisting anions was found to decrease the adsorption uptake of the sorbent furthermore the adsorbed po4 3 was efficiently desorbed by 0 01 mol l hcl solution keywords carbide derived carbon phosphate adsorption adsorption isotherms treated sewage effluent competitive anions 1 introduction phosphate is a core element for mankind however the continuous discharge of po4 3 into water bodies in municipal industrial and agricultural waste waters 1 2 leads to water eutrophication and as a consequence compromises the ecosystem 3 5 eutrophication is the depletion of the oxygen content in water bodies by the over production of algae and phytoplankton due to the increased level of nutrients mainly po4 3 causing the death of mollusks fish and other aquatic ecosystem inhabitants 6 8 it has been reported that po4 3 concentrations between 25 Î¼g l and 0 03 mg l results in unfavorable eutrophication in water bodies 1 9 12 thus the removal of and maintaining a low level of redundant po4 3 in water is extremely significant to mitigate and control water eutrophication the po4 3 removal from water has been examined by several processes including biological treatment chemical precipitation adsorption and electrochemical treatment 13 15 biological treatments and chemical precipitation have both proven their efficiency in po4 3 removal 16 19 conventional activated sludge is the most widely used of the biological treatments that can achieve a 75 100 removal of po4 3 13 20 21 however it is less efficient at trace amounts and this was attributed to the reduction in the metabolism of microorganisms at a low po4 3 content 13 in addition to a large land footprint requirement 22 the removal of po4 3 can be carried out by chemical precipitation but it is limited by the production and handling of large amounts of sludge that creates further pollution problems in addition neutralization of the effluent is required and there are waste disposal difficulties 13 23 24 the physical separation methods such as electrodialysis and reverse osmosis have been found to be expensive for po4 3 removal 3 25 26 among the aforementioned technologies adsorption was considered to be an effective way for po4 3 capturing due to the simplicity in operation removal efficiency and cost effectiveness 23 27 30 over the last decade different adsorbents were investigated for the removal of po4 3 from water such as modified bentonites 11 31 waste alum sludge 32 goethite and akaganeite 33 granular ferric hydroxide 34 halloysite 35 modified activated carbons ac and modified ac fiber 36 41 it should be noted that common ac is not highly efficient for po4 3 capturing therefore to improve the po4 3 adsorption capacity onto ac various modifications have been applied using different materials such as zirconium lanthanum and iron nanoparticles however these novel adsorbents still demonstrate relatively low adsorption capacity of 5 1 15 3 mg g 36 41 graphene graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes have also been tested for po4 3 adsorption meanwhile the preparation of graphene and graphene oxide is complex and carbon nanotubes demonstrate only modest adsorption capacity of about 10 9 mg g 1 42 43 although other adsorbents including iron nanoparticles 35 44 46 lanthanum oxide 47 48 zirconium oxide 49 50 silica 51 eggshell 52 chitosan 53 54 zeolite 55 56 and biochar 57 58 were suggested for po4 3 removal the search for novel sorbents with improved properties and high sorption capacities is still an ongoing field of research carbide derived carbon cdc is an innovative and promising generation of carbon based materials that reveals unique properties the reported cdc surface area was higher than ac and cnt for instance the maximum reported cdc surface area was 3116 m2 g 59 61 while it is between 857 and 2000 m2 g for ac 62 63 and 200 790 m2 g for cnt 64 65 cdc can be produced by the chlorine treatment of different types of precursors such as titanium carbide silicon carbide and ceramic materials made from polymers such as si o c and ti c at a wide range of chlorination temperatures 200 1200 61 66 67 cdc has attracted the attention of scientists for different applications due to its wide range of properties depending on the preparation conditions it has an amorphous to crystalline structure tunable pore size distribution high chemical stability and high specific surface area 68 69 however so far there is only a limited number of papers related to using cdc for the adsorption of different pollutants such as cytokines acetaldehyde and pharmaceuticals 67 70 71 the cdc was also investigated for carbon dioxide capture and ion adsorption processes 72 73 the adsorption results of cdc for the aforementioned pollutants has demonstrated that this material could provide an efficient reliable and promising solution for pollutants adsorption in wastewater purification processes to the author s best knowledge cdc has not been studied for the removal of po4 3 from water in this study cdc is used to scrutinize the removal of po4 3 from synthetic water and treated sewage effluents tse a full characterization of cdc synthesized at 800 has been determined prior to and once after po4 3 capturing the influence of adsorption factors initial solution ph temperature adsorption time initial po4 3 concentration agitation speed cdc dosage and effect of coexisting anions on the removal of po4 3 has also been studied adsorption kinetics thermodynamics isotherms and the influence of solution ionic strength were analyzed moreover decreasing the level of po4 3 from a tse product stream is extremely significant in order for it to be used for district cooling applications accordingly the adsorption of po4 3 from tse was explored 2 material and methods 2 1 materials the po4 3 solutions were prepared from a 1000 mg l po4 3 standard solution obtained from nist kh2po4 in h2o which was purchased from merck darmstadt germany sodium chloride was obtained from honeywell fluka germany while the mixed anions solution po4 3 sulphate nitrate fluoride and bromide was purchased from thermo scientific california usa the initial ph value of the po4 3 solutions was controlled by the addition of naoh 0 10 m or hcl 0 10 m purchased from sigma aldrich india and honeywell fluka austria respectively deionized milli q water was used for the preparation of po4 3 solutions the local tse water was collected from doha north sewage treatment works qatar 2 2 adsorbent synthesis and characterization the cdc type nanopore u used in the current study was obtained from carbon ukraine u carbon ltd the cdc was synthesized according to a previously described procedure 74 basically the titanium carbide tic powder was used as a precursor for cdc synthesis the tic powder was first heated to 800 in a stream of flowing argon gas this step was followed with the treatment of the tic with chlorine and hydrogen gases at 800 for 6 5 h and at 600 for 2 h respectively the cdc microstructure and surface morphology were inspected by field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem quanta feg 650 thermo fisher scientific usa connected to an energy dispersive spectrometer eds bruker xflash 6l60 germany which was used for elemental analysis of cdc before and after po4 3 adsorption the tem pictures were

isopropyl alcohol for 5 min then 20 Î¼l of the homogenized solution was placed over a 300 mesh lacey copper carbon grid and dried at room temperature before imaging fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir type thermo fisher scientific nicolet is10 usa was utilized to analyze the developed chemical groups on the cdc surface the spectra range was varied between 600 and 4000 cm 1 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analyzer micromeritics asap 2020 norcross usa was utilized to determine the surface area of the cdc the barrett joyner and halenda bjh was utilized for the pore size distribution evaluation by the bet equipment the bet was degassed at a temperature of 250 for 4 h then n2 gas at 77 k was used as an adsorbate for the bet and bjh analysis the zeta potential measurements with cdc particles were conducted by the zetasizer type nano zs 90 malvern instruments ltd uk functioning with an internal laser of 4 0 mw zeta potential values were evaluated at room temperature 25 within a ph range of 3 10 2 3 phosphate adsorption desorption experiments the adsorption tests were performed in batch mode in all adsorption experiments the cdc was added to a volume of 100 ml of the po4 3 solution in 250 ml conical flasks and shaken under the required conditions in a grant ols aqua pro temperature controlled shaker model ols26 uk while adsorption was taking place samples for analysis were collected at predetermined time intervals filtered over a 0 22 Î¼m ptfe membrane filter and po4 3 content was analyzed by ion chromatography ics 5000 dionex thermo fisher scientific usa using a guard column type ag19 2 250 mm and separator column type as19 2 250 mm the po4 3 analytical standard was used for ic calibration and quantification a calibration curve was prepared by analyzing a standards of known po4 3 concentrations to ensure the accuracy of the measurements the uptake amount q mg of po4 3 g of cdc and removal efficiency of po4 3 re from water were estimated according to eqs 1 and 2 1 q c i c e v w 2 r e c i c e c i 100 where ci and c e is the initial and final po4 3 concentration mg l v is the volume of the po4 3 solution l and w is the mass of the cdc g each adsorption test was undertaken three times and the mean values of these trials were illustrated the effect of cdc dosage was examined using a cdc dose from 0 05 to 5 g l the initial ph of the po4 3 mixture was varied between 3 and 10 while the agitation speed was changed from 100 to 200 rpm adsorption thermodynamics and the temperature influence were investigated by varying the feed temperature from 298 to 328 k while kinetic data were collected by analyzing the po4 3 content of samples taken at pre set time intervals between 1 min and 9 h to study the saturation time and adsorption uptake of the sorbent moreover the efficiency of po4 3 removal from sodium chloride solutions of various ionic strengths mixed anion solutions and tse was studied in the desorption studies the cdc that was used in kinetic adsorption experiments was separated from the un adsorbed po4 3 solution by centrifugation for 10 min at an agitation speed of 10 000 rpm using sorvall lynx 6000 centrifuge thermo scientific usa the cdc loaded with po4 3 was dried at 45 in a binder oven germany for 12 h and weighed before desorption experiments then cdc was subjected to desorption experiments using the regeneration solutions of 0 001 m hcl to 0 1 m hcl the po4 3 concentration in regenerated solutions was measured by ic and accordingly the recovered amount of po4 3 was calculated 2 4 adsorption kinetics kinetics of po4 3 removal by cdc were evaluated to inspect the adsorption capacity and to determine the rate limiting step the experimental adsorption data were analyzed according to lagergren pseudo 1st order 75 the ho mckay 2nd order 76 elovich 77 and the intra particle diffusion 78 models to identify the steps involved throughout the adsorption process the description of the used models is presented in table s1 2 5 adsorption isotherms to evaluate the adsorption isotherms 50 mg of cdc were added to a volume of 50 ml of po4 3 solution with concentration ranging between 1 and 100 mg l at 25 agitation speed of 150 rpm and ph 6 for 6 h the adsorption isotherm data were subjected to optimization using langmuir 79 freundlich 80 redlich peterson 81 and sips models 82 the model expressions and related parameters are tabulated in table s2 the langmuir adsorption model assumptions include that the surface of the adsorbent will be covered with one layer of the pollutant in addition that the vacant adsorbent sites are energetically homogeneous and can adsorb only one molecule of the pollutant 83 the dimensionless constant of the langmuir model rl known as the equilibrium parameter can be expressed as follows 35 3 r l 1 1 h c 0 where c 0 is the initial po4 3 concentration the rl values provides an indication about the feasibility of the adsorption i e the adsorption is favorable if rl is between 0 and 1 linear if rl 1 unfavorable if it is more than 1 and irreversible if rl 0 84 the freundlich isotherm model is normally applicable to non ideal reversible and heterogeneous systems where 1 the adsorption is not limited to a monolayer coverage and 2 the adsorption capacity increases with increasing feed adsorbate concentration the redlich peterson and sips models are three parameter formulae and are effective in the range between the freundlich and langmuir isotherms the sips model provides an insight to heterogeneous systems while the redlich peterson model can describe both the heterogeneous and homogenous adsorption systems and it also covers a wide range of adsorbate concentrations 85 86 the equilibrium data were examined by these isotherms using the excel solver by minimizing the sum of the square of the errors sse that can be calculated according to the following formula 84 4 s s e i 1 n q i e x p q i c a l 2 where qi exp and qi cal are the adsorption capacities mg g obtained from the experimental set and the one estimated from the model respectively n is the number of data points furthermore the isotherm results were validated and compared according the residual standard deviation sd and the determination coefficient r2 the sd was calculated as follows 84 5 s d 1 n p i 1 n q i e x p q i c a l 2 where p is the number of factors of the used model 2 6 adsorption thermodynamics the adsorption of po4 3 by cdc was conducted over a temperature range of 25 55 to scrutinize the impact of temperature on the cdc adsorption uptake toward po4 3 molecules and to estimate the thermodynamic factors gibbs free energy Î´ g enthalpy Î´ h and entropy Î´ s changes the spontaneity and feasibility of the removal process can be pointed out by estimating the change in gibbs free energy and it can be determined from the classical van t hoff equation at any temperature 6 Î´ g r t l n k d where k d is the constant of thermodynamic equilibrium t is the temperature k and r is the gas constant 1 37 k d is calculated as follows 7 k d c a c e where c a is the extent of pollutant adsorbed on the cdc at saturation mg l the entropy change provides an explanation about the degrees of freedom degree in the system or the extent of order disorder of the molecules while the enthalpy change provides information regarding the adsorption process nature whether it is exothermic or endothermic according to thermodynamics entropy and enthalpy changes at constant temperature are linked to the gibbs free energy by the following equation 8 Î´ g Î´ h t Î´ s by combining this equation with the van t hoff equation enthalpy and entropy changes are obtained from the y axis intersection and the slope of the following formula by drawing ln kd versus 1 t 87 9 l n k d Î´ s r Î´ h r 1 t 3 results and discussion 3 1 cdc characterization the sem images were acquired in order to evaluate the size and shape of the cdc fig 1 illustrates the sem images of cdc particles at low and high magnifications it can be observed the cdc particles have irregular shapes with a wide range of sizes ranging between 200 nm and 2 Î¼m the cdc particles form aggregates of irregular shapes the tem images are presented in fig 2 the tem images illustrate that a highly porous carbon material has been developed the eds analysis of cdc has been conducted prior and after the adsorption process fig 3 a illustrates that carbon is the main constituent of the cdc besides oxygen aluminum and chloride in addition to these elements phosphorus has been detected in the cdc samples collected after the adsorption process as depicted in fig 3b a homogenous distribution of phosphorus onto the cdc was observed after adsorption as seen in fig 4 the corresponding functional groups onto the cdc were acquired by ftir in the ftir spectrum illustrated in fig s1 a broad band was detected in the region 3300 3500 cm 1 which belongs to the oh stretching vibration 88 indicating the presence of adsorbed water molecules two more peaks positioned between stretches 3000 and 2800 cm 1 belong to the stretching vibration of the c h bond while the peaks at 1241 and 1574 cm 1 are linked with coc and cc stretching bonds respectively 89 90 the pore size distribution for cdc particles was studied by the bjh method and the results are displayed in fig 5 a as seen the cdc contains mainly micropores with a significant peak at 2 nm it can also be realized that most of the pores are between 1 and 4 nm the mean pore size according to the bjh adsorption desorption results is in the range 2 8 3 1 nm the estimated bet surface area of the cdc was 1120 m2 g the n2 adsorption desorption curve of cdc is illustrated in fig 5b according to iupac classification n2 adsorption at cdc follows type ia sorption isotherm 91 suggesting a ultra highly microporous material similar curves were obtained for the cdc produced at 800 using tic as a precursor 92 3 2 effect of agitation speed cdc dose and adsorption time the po4 3 removal at different cdc dosages is illustrated in fig 6 it is shown that po4 3 removal increased with cdc dosage obviously due to an increase of available adsorption sites the po4 3 removal was 16 4 at a cdc dosage of 0 05 g l and increased to more than 90 at a cdc dosage of 3 g l after this value the po4 3 removal was only slightly increasing with the cdc dose most probably due to the aggregation of the cdc particles at higher dosages which prevented the full utilization of vacant sites it was observed that the adsorption uptake of po4 3 on cdc reduces from 67 7 to 4 0 mg g for cdc dosages of 0 05 and 5 g l respectively evidently at high cdc dosage the amount of po4 3 in the solution was not enough to saturate the cdc available adsorption sites throughout the adsorption process the influence of agitation speed and adsorption time on po4 3 uptake amount is clarified in fig 7 as shown the po4 3 uptake increases with the agitation speed obviously due to the fact that increasing the agitation speed will facilitate the transportation of po4 3 ions from the bulk solution towards the cdc surface also a low agitation speed of 100 rpm might be not efficient enough to prevent the agglomeration of cdc particles in the solution such agglomeration could reduce a number of available adsorption sites for example after 30 min contact time the adsorbed amount of po4 3 was 4 65 5 00 and 5 12 mg g at agitation speeds of 100 150 and 200 rpm respectively as illustrated in fig 7 the adsorbed amount increases with adsorption time and maximum adsorption was achieved after 6 h it should be noted that in the first 5 h the adsorption values at an agitation speed of 200 rpm were higher than ones at agitation speed of 150 rpm however at longer adsorption times practically no difference in adsorbed po4 3 values was found obviously at long adsorption time an increase of rpm value above 150 did not practically affect the ability of adsorbate species to reach the adsorptive cites at cdc surface from the above results the agitation speed of 150 rpm was selected to be the optimal for adsorption of po4 3 ions at cdc 3 3 adsorption isotherms fig 8 illustrates the po4 3 adsorption isotherm on cdc langmuir freundlich sips and redlich peterson adsorption models have been utilized for fitting the experimental data to have a better insight into the adsorption mechanism of po4 3 uptake by cdc the data fitting was analyzed in terms of r 2 sse and the residual standard deviation sd parameters which are displayed in table 1 it can be seen that the r2 sse and sd values were best fitted with the redlich peterson isotherm model it has the highest r2 and the least sse and sd values very similar parameters were also obtained with langmuir and sips models these results reveal the formation of the po4 3 monolayer on the sorbent with possibly some heterogeneity of the cdc adsorption sites the values of the langmuir separation factor rl are between 0 07 and 0 7 representing that the po4 3 adsorption by cdc is favorable the freundlich isotherm model shows a lower determination factor compared to the other models indicating that it is not well suited for po4 3 adsorption on cdc it should be highlighted that cdc demonstrates more favorable results in terms of adsorption uptake compared to other carbon materials as presented in table 2 the maximum adsorption uptake observed with cdc was 16 14 mg g 3 4 adsorption kinetics fig 9 illustrates the kinetics of po4 3 capturing by cdc at temperatures of 25 and 55 as depicted the adsorption of po4 3 using cdc is very fast a significant removal was noticed during the first minute of the adsorption time most probably due to easily accessible adsorption sites on the cdc surface the rate of adsorption became slower with time and the saturation was achieved in about 6 h of contact time at both temperatures the po4 3 removal after 1 min of adsorption was 52 and 68 at 25 at 55 respectively while at adsorption equilibrium the removal was 90 0 and 91 4 at 25 and 55 respectively the kinetic adsorption data were optimized utilizing the pseudo 1st and 2nd order models in addition to the elovich and intra particle diffusion models the key parameters and the determination coefficients for all models at various temperatures are presented in table 3 the coefficient of determination r2 of the pseudo 1st order model was lower than that for the pseudo 2nd order model furthermore it was apparent that the calculated measures of po4 3 adsorption qcal gained from the pseudo 1st order model did not comply with the qe values gained from the experiments this finding indicates that adsorption of po4 3 on cdc cannot be explained by the pseudo 1st order kinetics model for both temperatures the highest determination coefficient r2 was found for the pseudo 2nd order model in addition to that the estimated adsorption value qcal obtained from this model was approaching the experimental adsorption value qe these results show that po4 3 capturing by cdc can be described best by the pseudo 2nd order kinetics model similar findings have been concluded for po4 3 removal by modified activated carbons 36 38 39 93 and carbon nanotubes 1 the values of k2 enhanced from 0 024 to 0 032 g mg min by increasing the temperature from 25 to 55 indicating that the removal of po4 3 by cdc is an endothermic process the half life time t 1 2 of adsorption is the time needed to adsorb 50 of po4 3 amount that could be adsorbed at equilibrium 94 this parameter gives a measure of the adsorption rate and is calculated according to the following equation 10 t 1 2 1 k 2 q e the half life time was 4 95 min at 55 compared to 6 70 min at 25 confirming the faster adsorption kinetics at the higher temperature moreover the elovich model was also in good compliance with the kinetic experimental values the determination coefficient r2 0 991 and 0 923 at temperatures 25 and 55 respectively the elovich initial adsorption rate Î± was 202 918 mg g min at 55 while it is 1400 mg g min at 25 besides the intercept term of elovich model 1 Î² l n Î± Î² which yields the adsorption quantity at ln t zero i e at an adsorption time of 1 min 95 was 3 55 mg g at 25 and 4 35 at 55 for the adsorption capacity of 6 33 mg g at 55 it means that more than 67 of the po4 3 uptake was reached within 1 min of adsorption this very fast adsorption kinetic result is one of the most attractive characteristics of the cdc adsorbent the intra particle diffusion kinetic model was used to obtain better knowledge regarding the guiding mechanism of the po4 3 cdc adsorption process if the trend line of qt against square root of time parameter is in compliance with the experimental data satisfies the linear relationship and intercepts the origin then the only guiding mechanism of the adsorption is the intra particle diffusion if not this means that more than one rate step guides the adsorption process 96 as depicted in fig 10 the dependency of po4 3 uptake versus square root of time shows two straight lines indicating that more than one step controls the adsorption process the first linear part clarifies the external surface adsorption where po4 3 ions diffuse from the solution across the boundary layer surrounding the cdc particle to the surface of cdc this surface adsorption responsible for removal of about 85 of the total adsorbed po4 3 the second linear part refers to the slower rate of po4 3 adsorption into the pores of cdc and is responsible for 10 15 of the cdc total adsorption capacity this initial boundary layer effect is also confirmed by the agitation experiments the c value represents the thickness of the boundary layer the greater value of c means the higher impact of the boundary layer on the adsorption process 77 as seen in table 3 the c value improved with rising the temperature which implies that the adsorption process was improved with temperature due to the increased mobility of the ions lowering both of the solution density and the viscosity at the higher temperature 3 5 thermodynamics and the influence of temperature the amount of po4 3 adsorbed on cdc was investigated at different solution temperatures ranging between 25 and 55 and the results are illustrated in fig s2 as demonstrated the adsorption of po4 3 was improved with the higher solution temperature throughout the first 6 h of adsorption for instance the po4 3 adsorption amount on the cdc after 3 h of contact time was 5 84 5 94 6 05 and 6 13 mg g at temperature of 25 35 45 and 55 respectively these results demonstrate that the temperature has affected the adsorption rate but not the adsorption capacity showing that the po4 3 capturing by cdc is most likely due to physical rather than chemical adsorption 31 furthermore increasing the adsorption rate of po4 3 on cdc at the higher temperature proves that the adsorption is an endothermic process which is in compliance with the changes of the thermodynamic parameters 52 the enhancement in po4 3 removal with temperature might be credited to the increasing in mobility and mass transfer rate of po4 3 ions towards the adsorbent surface and internal pores the activation energy of po4 3 adsorption e a on cdc was evaluated according to the following formula 11 ln k 2 ln k 0 e a r t where e a is activation energy of po4 3 adsorption in kj mol k 2 is the pseudo second order kinetic model constant calculated from the kinetic data at each temperature and k 0 is the independent factor of temperature the adsorption process is physical if the activation energy ea is less than 40 kj mol while it is chemical if the ea is more than 40 kj mol 97 98 the value of activation energy was 6 95 kj mol indicating a physical adsorption process of po4 3 onto cdc the thermodynamic parameters of po4 3 adsorption by cdc entropy enthalpy and the gibbs free energy changes are illustrated in table 4 the Î´ s value of po4 3 adsorption on the cdc was positive and estimated to be 33 62 j mol k the positive Î´ s value indicates the disorder degree and the increase in particle randomness at the cdc liquid interface throughout the adsorption process 99 the value of Î´ s also indicates the po4 3 ions affinity toward the cdc 52 the calculated value of Î´ h is 4 53 kj mol suggesting that the adsorption process of po4 3 onto the cdc is an endothermic process 100 the change in the gibbs free energy was calculated to be 5 47 5 83 6 23 and 6 45 kj mol at 25 35 45 and 55 respectively this point out that adsorption process presented in this study is spontaneous and more favorable at higher temperatures which is in agreement with the above kinetic data 3 6 influence of co existing anions on the po4 3 adsorption by cdc wastewater and tse generally have different anions that might affect the adsorption capacity and compete with po4 3 for the vacant adsorption sites thus the impact of competing anions on the adsorption removal of po4 3 by cdc was investigated using a complex mixture of the fluoride bromide nitrate and sulphate anions with loadings of 2 10 10 and 10 mg l respectively in addition to 20 mg l of po4 3 fig 11 illustrates the adsorption capacity of the different anions after 6 h of adsorption it was found that the existence of the competing anions decreased the adsorption uptake of po4 3 from 6 25 mg g without anions to 4 82 mg g with the anions mixture under similar conditions the reduction in the adsorption uptake of po4 3 may possibly be explained by the competition between po4 3 and other anions on the vacant active adsorption sites the sulphate anions have a relatively higher impact on the po4 3 adsorption compared to fluoride bromide and nitrate ions this might be attributed to the ionic radius of sulphate which is closer to the po4 3 anion the ionic radius is 2 38 Ã¥ for po4 3 and 2 3 Ã¥ for sulphate compared to the monovalent anions hence there is a competition between sulphate and po4 3 ions for the same adsorption sites similar observations of the sulphate ions effect on po4 3 removal was stated by bozorgpour et al 101 kumar et al 102 and he et al 55 furthermore luo et al 103 found that the adsorption capacity of po4 3 anions decreased with the existence of so4 2 anions more compared to the monovalent anions they attributed that to the fact that the multivalent anions such as so4 2 form stronger bonds on both of the outer and inner sphere complexes while the monovalent anions such as cl and no3 form weaker bonds on the outer surface complexes with the vacant active sites this indicates that the anions with higher ionic potential are more favorable for the adsorbent 104 accordingly the various affinities of the co existing anions will differently affect the adsorption of po4 3 onto the cdc 3 7 effect of initial ph value on the adsorption capacity of cdc toward po4 3 the influence of initial solution ph on the po4 3 adsorption capacity by cdc was observed by adjusting the ph value from 2 to 10 and the results were discussed and illustrated in fig 12 it is known that the adsorption of po4 3 ions is extremely reliant on the ph as it determines the dissociation of po4 3 ions their speciation and their electrostatic attractions with the adsorbent as illustrated in fig 12 the cdc adsorption capacity was relatively lower at acidic and basic media ph 2 and 10 compared to the solutions in the range ph 4 8 these findings are mainly accredited to the dissociation of the po4 3 molecules in the solution the po4 3 anions exist in four different species at different solution ph values and dissociate as follows 81 12 h 3 p o 4 p k 1 h 2 p o 4 h p k 2 h p o 4 2 2 h p k 3 p o 4 3 3 h the p k 1 p k 2 p k 3 values are 2 13 7 20 and 12 33 respectively 93 the zeta potential measurements of the cdc are presented in fig s3 as seen in this figure the zeta potential values of cdc particles are positive over a wide ph range the pzc of cdc was obtained to be 9 9 which is consistent to the values stated in the literature 61 70 50 51 at ph 2 the po4 3 in solution exists as h 3 p o 4 which is neutral and weakly interacts with the positively charged adsorbent as the ph value increases to 4 8 the dominant po4 3 anions are h 2 p o 4 and h p o 4 2 and the adsorption capacity increased obviously because of the attractive coulombic interactions between the negative po4 3 anions and positively charged cdc surface at basic conditions ph 10 the cdc particles become negatively charged and the adsorption between similarly negatively charged po4 3 anions and cdc surface becomes less favorable and as a result the adsorption uptake is decreased nevertheless notable po4 3 adsorption at acidic and basic ph values indicate that electrostatic and other adsorption mechanisms possibly chelation can also contribute to po4 3 adsorption with cdc 105 106 note that the final ph values of the residual po4 3 solutions after adsorption were found to be either the same or smaller than the ph of the initial solutions before adsorption obviously due to deprotonation of some functional groups at cdc surface 3 8 adsorption uptake of po4 3 by cdc at different ionic strength of the solution the effect of ionic strength of the solution on the removal of po4 3 by cdc using 0 01 and 0 001 m nacl solutions is highlighted in fig 13 evidently the amount of the adsorbed po4 3 has reduced with the increase of ionic strength of the po4 3 mixture the adsorption capacity was 6 24 5 98 and 5 12 mg g when the adsorption occurs in pure water 0 001 m and 0 01 m nacl solutions respectively these findings can be clarified by the reduction in electrostatic interactions between the po4 3 ions and adsorption sites due to the shielding effect of the electrolyte a similar findings have been reported in previous studies 1 38 increasing the ionic strength of the aqueous solution will act as a shield on the charges of both of the adsorbent and the adsorbate the influence of the ionic strength will be different according the charge of the adsorbent and the adsorbate if the adsorbent and the adsorbate have opposite charges increasing the ionic strength will decrease the adsorption capacity because of the decrease in electrostatic interactions due to the shielding effect on the other hand if the adsorbent and the adsorbate have similar signs of charge increasing the ionic strength of the solution will increase the adsorption capacity as the shielding effect in this case will decrease the electrostatic repulsion between them 107 108 as seen in fig 13 the adsorption capacity of po4 3 onto cdc decreases with the ionic strength of the solution confirming the shielding effect of the electrolyte these findings are in agreement with the electrostatic mechanism of adsorption as for discussed above for ph data moreover it was previously reported that the adsorption of po4 3 onto zirconia will decrease with the ionic strength of the solution if the po4 3 formed an outer sphere complexation while it is either increased or unchanged with the ionic strength of the solution if the po4 3 formed an inner sphere surface complexation 109 as illustrated in our results the adsorption capacity decreases with the ionic strength of the solution at the studied ph value indicating that the adsorptive removal mechanism is based on the outer sphere complexation of po4 3 ions with adsorption sites at cdc surface 3 9 adsorption of po4 3 from tse the tse samples with conductivity of 2534 mÏ total dissolved solids of 1622 mg l chemical oxygen demand of 5 mg l biological chemical demand bod5 of 2 mg l po4 3 content of 1 3 mg l and total organic carbon content of 1 5 ppm were collected from doha north sewage treatment works for the use of tse in district cooling applications it is very essential to decrease the level of po4 3 to minimize biofouling of the system to maintain consistency with the previous adsorption experiments conducted in this study the tse was spiked with po4 3 to obtain a final po4 3 loading of 20 mg l fig 14 illustrates the po4 3 removal from di and tse under same operational conditions evidently the po4 3 removal values from tse were smaller than that ones from di the po4 3 removal after reaching adsorption equilibrium was 90 and 66 from di and tse respectively the adsorption uptake of po4 3 on cdc was also decreased from 6 24 mg g to 4 54 mg g using di and tse respectively the decrease in po4 3 removal from tse compared to di may be explained by the competition between inorganic organic species in tse and po4 3 ions on the vacant adsorption sites on cdc surface by possible blockage of the adsorbent surface and porous structure by some organic and bacterial components present in tse as well as possible interactions between tse organic matters and po4 3 ions 70 110 112 the impact of cdc dosage on the po4 3 removal from tse is shown in table 5 as seen in the table a cdc dose of 3 g l was sufficient to remove 66 2 of the total po4 3 from tse with increasing of cdc dose to 5 g l more than 90 of the total po4 3 was removed from tse it should be highlighted that for non spiked tse the cdc dosage of 0 2 g l was found to be effective to completely remove the po4 3 residues from waste water 3 10 desorption experiments in this study di water and different concentrations of hcl solutions were used to recover the po4 3 adsorbed onto the cdc and the results are illustrated in table 6 with the increase of solution acidity the amount of recovered po4 3 was increased the po4 3 recovery was more than 90 using 0 1 m hcl compared to 8 5 for di water the reason behind desorption of po4 3 is obviously the ion exchange between chlorine ions in the solution and po4 3 ions on the cdc surface these results suggesting that regeneration of the adsorbent with 0 1 m of hcl could be utilized to recover the cdc for further reusing for po4 3 removal 4 conclusions the study analyzed the adsorption of po4 3 from synthetic water and tse using cdc the effect of adsorption factors was investigated including the adsorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics which were investigated throughout a series of batch adsorption experiments the cdc surface and chemical characterization show an irregular shaped and highly microporous material with a pore size ranging between 1 and 4 nm the adsorption kinetics were investigated at several temperatures and were best correlated by the pseudo second order model r 2 0 999 for both 25 and 55 furthermore the intra particle diffusion model was utilized to describe the mechanism of po4 3 adsorption on cdc the equilibrium experimental data confirms that the po4 3 adsorption on cdc were effectively correlated by the langmuir sips and redlich peterson models r 2 0 996 0 997 0 998 respectively suggesting the single layer po4 3 adsorption on the cdc with the possibility of some site heterogeneity on the adsorbent surface involving surface complexation reactions the changes in the thermodynamic factors gibbs free energy entropy and enthalpy in addition to the activation energy of the adsorption process clarifies that the removal of po4 3 throughout the cdc is spontaneous feasible physical and endothermic in nature the adsorption amount increased from 4 65 to 5 12 mg g by raising the agitation speed from 100 to 200 rpm similarly the temperature investigations was also found to promote the adsorption process the adsorption of po4 3 onto cdc was highly reliant on the ph value the highest adsorption uptake was achieved in the ph range of 4 8 where the dominant po4 3 species are h 2 p o 4 and h p o 4 2 ions and the cdc surface has a positive zeta potential assuming the electrostatic nature of the adsorption driving force however non zero values of po4 3 adsorption from acidic and basic aqueous solutions indicate that other adsorption mechanisms possible chelation also contribute to po4 3 adsorption on cdc competing anions present in water were found to decrease the adsorption capacity of po4 3 on cdc and the sulphate ions possessed the most pronounced competitive action compared to other anions it was found that increasing the ionic strength of the solution reduced the adsorption uptake because of the reduction in attractive forces between the cdc and po4 3 molecules the performance of cdc for po4 3 capture was investigated with tse and although the adsorption capacity of cdc towards po4 3 ions decreased from 6 24 to 4 54 mg g for di water and tse respectively a cdc dosage of 0 2 g l was found sufficient to completely adsorb the po4 3 residues in the raw tse water desorption experiments show that 0 1 mg l was able to recover more than 90 of the po4 3 these findings reveal the efficiency and effectiveness of cdc for fast removal of po4 3 from tse for possible tse application in district cooling applications declaration of competing

14008,natural organic matter nom contributes to bacterial regrowth during potable water treatment and supply most conventional water treatment plants insufficiently remove the biodegradable dissolved organic bdoc nom fraction the presence of labile bdoc in water creates conducive conditions for bacterial regrowth to reduce nom and the bacterial regrowth potential brp in water the study aimed at establishing which of the nom polarity fractions are biodegradable and if the brp enumerated according to the heterotrophic plate count hpc method can be correlated to biodegradability specific ultraviolet absorbance suva was used to characterise source and treated water nom fractions i e hydrophilic hpi transphilic tpi and hydrophobic hpo obtained through the modified polarity rapid assessment method m pram the source and treated water suva values of the hpi and hpo were on average 3 88 l mg m and 2 04 l mg m respectively the hpi and tpi fractions on the source and treated were the most biodegradable fractions with mean bdoc values ranging between 29 22 and 35 75 the high bdoc of the tpi and hpi nom substantially contributed to brp by up to 121 4 103 197 4 103 cfu ml respectively the strong correlation r2 0 96 between brp and bdoc allows for the effective management of water treatment and supply processes particularly for microbial control keywords biodegradable dissolved organic carbon heterotrophic bacteria modified polarity rapid assessment method natural organic matter polarity specific ultraviolet absorbance 1 introduction in its natural state natural organic matter nom is less problematic to the environment however the presence of nom in water during or after water treatment processes can cause problems most south african water treatment plants wtps rely exclusively on surface waters and their treatment efficiency is often compromised due to high return flows and indirect reuse 1 bacterial regrowth in the distribution systems biofilm formation and ultimately bacteriologically unstable water challenges faced by most conventional wtps in south africa 2 dissolved organic carbon doc forms a significant component of nom and it can either be bdoc or non biodegradable dissolved organic carbon nbdoc the bdoc is that fraction of doc which can be mineralised by heterotrophic bacteria bdoc is an essential aspect in the maintenance of water quality in water supply systems wss as even the slightest decrease may be an indication of bacterial regrowth 3 the presence of nom in wss assures favourable conditions for bacterial regrowth which may potentially lead to the loss of disinfectant residuals thus exposing the system to water quality threats 3 this is a prevalent phenomenon as most wtps experience difficulty in effectively removing nom especially the bdoc fractions under alkaline conditions 4 the increasing trends in nom concentration and the influence of seasonal variations impose threats to surface waters and to the water treatment and supply industry 5 no conventional water treatment process is spared to the challenges imposed by nom pertaining operation optimisation and effective process management 1 the challenges are aggravated when the wtp supplies a vast distribution network or when temperatures are elevated particularly in summer where disinfectant residuals i e chlorine and chloramines are often lost leaving the distribution system vulnerable to bacterial regrowth there are still some prevailing questions regarding nom such as asserting with certainty as to which of the nom fractions are biodegradable and which of the fractions are responsible for bacterial regrowth 2 6 the identification of biodegradable nom fractions can allow for the targeted removal of the specific fractions responsible for bacterial re growth thereby protecting the biostability of water to adequately enhance and improve the conventional water treatment processes function in terms of nom removal and the proper management of the biostability of potable water the characterisation and quantification of nom at the various treatment and supply stages is critical this study was aimed at investigating the biodegradability of the individual nom fractions their removal during water treatment and the potential impacts on bacterial regrowth in water supply systems the specific aims of the study were i to apply comprehensive characterisation techniques on the source and treated water from the conventional wtp through a combination of conventional bulk ultraviolet absorbance uv doc and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva and advanced modified polarity rapid assessment method m pram biodegradable bdoc technique characterisation methods ii to systematically fractionate the nom on the source and treated water samples into hpi tpi and hpo fractions using the m pram and iii to assess the biodegradability of each nom polarity fraction by performing the enhanced bdoc method and assessing the influence of each fraction on the bacterial hpc regrowth when successfully conducted the information obtained from this study can be used to optimise wtps to increase nom removal specifically the removal of the biodegradable nom fraction and establishing how the existing wtps can be retrofitted for the removal of specific nom fractions 2 methodology 2 1 sampling and bulk nom characterisation source and treated water composite samples were collected from the conventional wtp fig 1 on a bi weekly basis between august 2018 and august 2019 the treated water was collected prior to the disinfection step before any interactions between nom and chlorine during transportation the samples were preserved in cooler boxes with ice at 4 c to remove particulates from the water the samples were first filtered using a 0 45 Î¼m s pak membrane filter paper merck german the water samples were then analysed for their uv absorbance measured at a wavelength Î» 254 nm uv254 and their organic matter content measured as doc mg l using a cary uv spectrometer agilent technologies and toc l analyser shimadzu respectively the suva was calculated using equation 1 the suva is strongly correlated to the percentage aromaticity of the dissolved fraction of organic matter in the water sample 1 s u v a l m g m 254 u v 254 c m 1 100 d o c m g â where uv254 is uv absorbance measured at 254 nm and doc is dissolved organic carbon mg l 2 2 the m pram procedure for the quantification of various nom fractions to obtain the polarity fractions i e the hpi tpi and hpo nom from the source and treated water samples the nom was fractionated using the m pram the method uses solid phase extraction spe cartridges to fractionate the nom in terms of polarity the c18 non polar cartridge returns the hpo fraction while the cn polar cartridge returns the hpi fraction and the tpi fraction is the fraction that passes through the nh2 weak anion exchange cartridges instead of the original six 6 pram fractions 2 the m pram gives three 3 basic polarity fractions excluding the acids and neutrals and is thus enough for the characterization of nom with respect to aromaticity and composition 7 the three 3 fractions were deemed adequate for addressing the aim and objectives of this research study the water was pumped through the spe cartridges at a flow of 1 2 ml min 5 inches hg 0 1 bar as a preparatory step prior to elution the cartridges were first conditioned using 5 methanol the spe cartridges were rinsed by flushing with deionised water at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min until a steady uv254 signal was obtained approximately 15 min to remove any uv absorbing organic residue on the spe sorbent the breakthrough was then measured by uv254 and doc in interactions pram cartridges are placed in series the sample is first injected into the c18 cartridge the effluent of which is then injected into the cn fraction the effluent was then injected into the nh2 cartridge a 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh is then used to elute the bound hpo and hpi from the respective cartridges fig 2 for every 6 ml of the sample a 10 ml 0 1 m sodium hydroxide solution was filtered through the c18 and cn cartridges to elute the hpo and hpi fractions respectively the filtrate from each spe cartridge was then analysed for uv254 and doc and these parameters were then used to determine the suva as previously described in each fraction 2 3 assessing the biodegradability of the nom fractions an inoculum of sand was sampled from an operational rapid sand filter unit at the wtp the normal filter run time is 48 72 hours otherwise backwashing can be initiated when there is a substantial loss in the head indicating a clogged filter this is biologically active sand bas which is then covered with source water and inoculated in a fish tank for seven 7 days to encourage the growth of heterotrophic bacteria sufficient amounts of inorganic nutrient solutions 0 1 of both monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 and ammonium chloride nh4cl were added on the bas to provide nutrients for the existing bacteria after the 7 day incubation the bas was rinsed ten times using a 0 1 m sodium thiosulphate solution inverting the sand until no more doc was released from the sand this constituted the initial doc in the sand sample thereafter 100 g of the rinsed sand was put in 500 ml schott bottles and 300 ml of each of the nom fractions was then added fig 3 approximately 50 ml of each nutrient solution i e 0 1 nh4cl and 0 1 kh2po4 were added to ensure carbon was the only limiting factor in the bdoc assessment sodium acetate châcoona solutions of 5 and 10 mg l which covers the doc range in the source water was used as a source of carbon in biodegradation and as the control to confirm the biological activity in the inoculum 8 the prepared samples were then aerated to maintain high oxygen transfer efficiency through a connected air compressor bubbling air inside the samples at two 2 bubbles per second the temperature was maintained at room temperature 20 c for both the inoculation of bas and throughout the biodegradability experiments the doc concentration of the samples was monitored daily for four 4 days and the bdoc was calculated as the difference between the initial doc and final doc equation 2 2 bdoc doc initial doc final after 4 days the bdoc technique is generally conducted between six 6 to seven 7 days 1 9 as a secondary objective this study also aimed at optimising the bdoc by reducing the period of the experimental technique however shortened periods may lead to the underestimation of bdoc unless the conditions e g microbial diversity and metabolic activity of the bacteria are adequately optimised the objective was to optimise the bdoc such that the highest possible bdoc was achieved within a shortened period 5 days but also eliminating the likelihood for bdoc underestimation on the enhanced method the general bdoc procedure as explained by mcdowell et al 2006 9 was followed except that during the bdoc optimization 0 1 of inorganic nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus n p were added to the samples to encourage the growth of bacterial cells and limit cell lysis due to nutrient deficiency secondly to increase the oxidation of doc by the heterotrophic bacteria beyond the air circulation as previously explained the temperature was fixed at room temperature 20 c this was to enhance the metabolism and growth rate of the bacteria which would ultimately increase the speed of the labile doc consumption as a result of these modifications the bdoc experimental period was reduced to 4 days where the minimum doc in all fractions was constantly observed between day three 3 and day four 4 of the experiment table 1 2 3 1 evaluating the influence of biodegradable nom on bacterial regrowth potential brp given the significant reported correlations between bdoc and biomass production the impact of bdoc on heterotrophic bacteria was investigated 10 bacterial regrowth was enumerated according to the heterotrophic plate count hpc method this was co currently done with the bdoc by monitoring the hpc on the first and last day of the experiment the brp specific to the individual fractions was calculated as the difference between the initial and the final concentration of hpc only a 1 103 increase in the bacterial counts was considered positive otherwise a change lower than that was deemed insignificant for the regrowth quantification hpc is a bacterial surrogate parameter commonly used for bacterial pathogen studies the hpc method can be used to estimate the number of live culturable heterotrophic bacteria in water and also measures the variation of conditions during water treatment and distribution 11 the solid plate count was re liquefied in boiling water and thermo regulated to temperatures between 44 c and 46 c aliquots of each sample 0 1 ml and 1 0 ml were transferred into the centre of a 100 x 15 mm sterile petri dish using pipettes about 12 ml of the thermo regulated liquid agar was also added and mixed by swirling the plate prior to being inverted and incubated at 35 0 5 c for 48 3 hours the plates were allowed to solidify for about 10 minutes all samples were run in duplicates after the 10 minutes the colonies that had formed in or on the plate count media were counted and the results were reported as cfu ml using equation 3 for diluted samples the dilution factor was multiplied with the counts to obtain the final cfu ml the doc and hpc were monitored as two complementary parameters in order to gain more insight into the relationship between the bacteria and their utilisation of nom or the various fractions of nom in water 3 c f u m l c o l o n i e s c o u n t e d a c

discussion 3 1 the character and removal of nom and its polarity fractions from the conventional wtp 3 1 1 the suva characterization and removal of bulk nom fig 4 presents the characterisation of the source and treated water through suva the mean doc and uv obtained for the source water were 4 22 mg l and 0 1611 cm 1 respectively resulting in a suva of 3 97 l mg m for the treated water a mean of 3 90 mg l and 7 53 m 1 were recorded for the doc and uv254 respectively with a calculated suva of 2 04 l mg m the relatively low suva indicates a reduction in the nom fraction following treatment particularly the hpo fraction according to edzwald and tobiason 12 a suva value between 2 and 4 l mg m is indicative of humic and non humic organic matter having a mixed molecular weight distribution mwd form low molecular weight lmw to high molecular weight hmw with a hpo and hpi character high suva values also indicate the ease with which water can be treated particularly by clarification and this is evident in the reduction in the treated water suva 2 04 l mg m presented in fig 4 below the high content of aromatic organic compounds translates to a greater tendency of the nom to react with disinfectants i e chlorine to create dbps 13 14 the high aromaticity of the source water indicates that the water can be effectively treated with preferential removal of the hpo humic organic matter fraction water samples with suva value 2 l mg m contain mainly non humic matter which is generally more hpi than the other nom fractions 12 15 the observed reduction in the treated water suva values fig 4 were as a result of a reduction of uv absorbing material and doc during water treatment 3 2 the uv254 distribution and removal of the polarity fractions of nom the most dominant fraction in the source water was the hpo fraction fig 5 the distribution of the nom fractions in the source water was as follows hpo hpi tpi fractions with uv254 values 17 74 m 1 15 65 m 1 and 5 26 m 1 respectively fig 5 in terms of uv254 measurements there were no major changes in the nom concentrations as the uv254 was constantly below 21 m 1 as compared to the 2017 18 period where the mean was 35 4 m 1 although the hpo fraction was slightly higher for the source waters the m pram fractionation showed an almost equal distribution of the hpo and hpi fractions in terms of uv254 comparable findings were reported in literature whereby the m pram fractionation resulted in an equal distribution of the aforementioned fractions on the same source water 2 16 the uv254 m 1 measurements in the treated water for the hpo hpi and tpi fractions were 7 39 m 1 6 46 m 1 and 4 58 m 1 respectively indicating a substantial removal 58 of aromatic nom within the source water fig 6 and table 2 the uv254 removal for each of the fractions i e the hpi tpi and hpo was calculated as the ratio of the uv254 on each fraction before and after treatment table 2 a 58 72 reduction was observed on the hpo fraction of nom while the tpi and hpi nom fractions were reduced by 13 06 and 58 33 respectively table 2 the highest removal efficiency was observed on the hpo fraction these results are similar to results reported

14008,natural organic matter nom contributes to bacterial regrowth during potable water treatment and supply most conventional water treatment plants insufficiently remove the biodegradable dissolved organic bdoc nom fraction the presence of labile bdoc in water creates conducive conditions for bacterial regrowth to reduce nom and the bacterial regrowth potential brp in water the study aimed at establishing which of the nom polarity fractions are biodegradable and if the brp enumerated according to the heterotrophic plate count hpc method can be correlated to biodegradability specific ultraviolet absorbance suva was used to characterise source and treated water nom fractions i e hydrophilic hpi transphilic tpi and hydrophobic hpo obtained through the modified polarity rapid assessment method m pram the source and treated water suva values of the hpi and hpo were on average 3 88 l mg m and 2 04 l mg m respectively the hpi and tpi fractions on the source and treated were the most biodegradable fractions with mean bdoc values ranging between 29 22 and 35 75 the high bdoc of the tpi and hpi nom substantially contributed to brp by up to 121 4 103 197 4 103 cfu ml respectively the strong correlation r2 0 96 between brp and bdoc allows for the effective management of water treatment and supply processes particularly for microbial control keywords biodegradable dissolved organic carbon heterotrophic bacteria modified polarity rapid assessment method natural organic matter polarity specific ultraviolet absorbance 1 introduction in its natural state natural organic matter nom is less problematic to the environment however the presence of nom in water during or after water treatment processes can cause problems most south african water treatment plants wtps rely exclusively on surface waters and their treatment efficiency is often compromised due to high return flows and indirect reuse 1 bacterial regrowth in the distribution systems biofilm formation and ultimately bacteriologically unstable water challenges faced by most conventional wtps in south africa 2 dissolved organic carbon doc forms a significant component of nom and it can either be bdoc or non biodegradable dissolved organic carbon nbdoc the bdoc is that fraction of doc which can be mineralised by heterotrophic bacteria bdoc is an essential aspect in the maintenance of water quality in water supply systems wss as even the slightest decrease may be an indication of bacterial regrowth 3 the presence of nom in wss assures favourable conditions for bacterial regrowth which may potentially lead to the loss of disinfectant residuals thus exposing the system to water quality threats 3 this is a prevalent phenomenon as most wtps experience difficulty in effectively removing nom especially the bdoc fractions under alkaline conditions 4 the increasing trends in nom concentration and the influence of seasonal variations impose threats to surface waters and to the water treatment and supply industry 5 no conventional water treatment process is spared to the challenges imposed by nom pertaining operation optimisation and effective process management 1 the challenges are aggravated when the wtp supplies a vast distribution network or when temperatures are elevated particularly in summer where disinfectant residuals i e chlorine and chloramines are often lost leaving the distribution system vulnerable to bacterial regrowth there are still some prevailing questions regarding nom such as asserting with certainty as to which of the nom fractions are biodegradable and which of the fractions are responsible for bacterial regrowth 2 6 the identification of biodegradable nom fractions can allow for the targeted removal of the specific fractions responsible for bacterial re growth thereby protecting the biostability of water to adequately enhance and improve the conventional water treatment processes function in terms of nom removal and the proper management of the biostability of potable water the characterisation and quantification of nom at the various treatment and supply stages is critical this study was aimed at investigating the biodegradability of the individual nom fractions their removal during water treatment and the potential impacts on bacterial regrowth in water supply systems the specific aims of the study were i to apply comprehensive characterisation techniques on the source and treated water from the conventional wtp through a combination of conventional bulk ultraviolet absorbance uv doc and specific ultraviolet absorbance suva and advanced modified polarity rapid assessment method m pram biodegradable bdoc technique characterisation methods ii to systematically fractionate the nom on the source and treated water samples into hpi tpi and hpo fractions using the m pram and iii to assess the biodegradability of each nom polarity fraction by performing the enhanced bdoc method and assessing the influence of each fraction on the bacterial hpc regrowth when successfully conducted the information obtained from this study can be used to optimise wtps to increase nom removal specifically the removal of the biodegradable nom fraction and establishing how the existing wtps can be retrofitted for the removal of specific nom fractions 2 methodology 2 1 sampling and bulk nom characterisation source and treated water composite samples were collected from the conventional wtp fig 1 on a bi weekly basis between august 2018 and august 2019 the treated water was collected prior to the disinfection step before any interactions between nom and chlorine during transportation the samples were preserved in cooler boxes with ice at 4 c to remove particulates from the water the samples were first filtered using a 0 45 Î¼m s pak membrane filter paper merck german the water samples were then analysed for their uv absorbance measured at a wavelength Î» 254 nm uv254 and their organic matter content measured as doc mg l using a cary uv spectrometer agilent technologies and toc l analyser shimadzu respectively the suva was calculated using equation 1 the suva is strongly correlated to the percentage aromaticity of the dissolved fraction of organic matter in the water sample 1 s u v a l m g m 254 u v 254 c m 1 100 d o c m g â where uv254 is uv absorbance measured at 254 nm and doc is dissolved organic carbon mg l 2 2 the m pram procedure for the quantification of various nom fractions to obtain the polarity fractions i e the hpi tpi and hpo nom from the source and treated water samples the nom was fractionated using the m pram the method uses solid phase extraction spe cartridges to fractionate the nom in terms of polarity the c18 non polar cartridge returns the hpo fraction while the cn polar cartridge returns the hpi fraction and the tpi fraction is the fraction that passes through the nh2 weak anion exchange cartridges instead of the original six 6 pram fractions 2 the m pram gives three 3 basic polarity fractions excluding the acids and neutrals and is thus enough for the characterization of nom with respect to aromaticity and composition 7 the three 3 fractions were deemed adequate for addressing the aim and objectives of this research study the water was pumped through the spe cartridges at a flow of 1 2 ml min 5 inches hg 0 1 bar as a preparatory step prior to elution the cartridges were first conditioned using 5 methanol the spe cartridges were rinsed by flushing with deionised water at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min until a steady uv254 signal was obtained approximately 15 min to remove any uv absorbing organic residue on the spe sorbent the breakthrough was then measured by uv254 and doc in interactions pram cartridges are placed in series the sample is first injected into the c18 cartridge the effluent of which is then injected into the cn fraction the effluent was then injected into the nh2 cartridge a 0 1 m sodium hydroxide naoh is then used to elute the bound hpo and hpi from the respective cartridges fig 2 for every 6 ml of the sample a 10 ml 0 1 m sodium hydroxide solution was filtered through the c18 and cn cartridges to elute the hpo and hpi fractions respectively the filtrate from each spe cartridge was then analysed for uv254 and doc and these parameters were then used to determine the suva as previously described in each fraction 2 3 assessing the biodegradability of the nom fractions an inoculum of sand was sampled from an operational rapid sand filter unit at the wtp the normal filter run time is 48 72 hours otherwise backwashing can be initiated when there is a substantial loss in the head indicating a clogged filter this is biologically active sand bas which is then covered with source water and inoculated in a fish tank for seven 7 days to encourage the growth of heterotrophic bacteria sufficient amounts of inorganic nutrient solutions 0 1 of both monopotassium phosphate kh2po4 and ammonium chloride nh4cl were added on the bas to provide nutrients for the existing bacteria after the 7 day incubation the bas was rinsed ten times using a 0 1 m sodium thiosulphate solution inverting the sand until no more doc was released from the sand this constituted the initial doc in the sand sample thereafter 100 g of the rinsed sand was put in 500 ml schott bottles and 300 ml of each of the nom fractions was then added fig 3 approximately 50 ml of each nutrient solution i e 0 1 nh4cl and 0 1 kh2po4 were added to ensure carbon was the only limiting factor in the bdoc assessment sodium acetate châcoona solutions of 5 and 10 mg l which covers the doc range in the source water was used as a source of carbon in biodegradation and as the control to confirm the biological activity in the inoculum 8 the prepared samples were then aerated to maintain high oxygen transfer efficiency through a connected air compressor bubbling air inside the samples at two 2 bubbles per second the temperature was maintained at room temperature 20 c for both the inoculation of bas and throughout the biodegradability experiments the doc concentration of the samples was monitored daily for four 4 days and the bdoc was calculated as the difference between the initial doc and final doc equation 2 2 bdoc doc initial doc final after 4 days the bdoc technique is generally conducted between six 6 to seven 7 days 1 9 as a secondary objective this study also aimed at optimising the bdoc by reducing the period of the experimental technique however shortened periods may lead to the underestimation of bdoc unless the conditions e g microbial diversity and metabolic activity of the bacteria are adequately optimised the objective was to optimise the bdoc such that the highest possible bdoc was achieved within a shortened period 5 days but also eliminating the likelihood for bdoc underestimation on the enhanced method the general bdoc procedure as explained by mcdowell et al 2006 9 was followed except that during the bdoc optimization 0 1 of inorganic nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus n p were added to the samples to encourage the growth of bacterial cells and limit cell lysis due to nutrient deficiency secondly to increase the oxidation of doc by the heterotrophic bacteria beyond the air circulation as previously explained the temperature was fixed at room temperature 20 c this was to enhance the metabolism and growth rate of the bacteria which would ultimately increase the speed of the labile doc consumption as a result of these modifications the bdoc experimental period was reduced to 4 days where the minimum doc in all fractions was constantly observed between day three 3 and day four 4 of the experiment table 1 2 3 1 evaluating the influence of biodegradable nom on bacterial regrowth potential brp given the significant reported correlations between bdoc and biomass production the impact of bdoc on heterotrophic bacteria was investigated 10 bacterial regrowth was enumerated according to the heterotrophic plate count hpc method this was co currently done with the bdoc by monitoring the hpc on the first and last day of the experiment the brp specific to the individual fractions was calculated as the difference between the initial and the final concentration of hpc only a 1 103 increase in the bacterial counts was considered positive otherwise a change lower than that was deemed insignificant for the regrowth quantification hpc is a bacterial surrogate parameter commonly used for bacterial pathogen studies the hpc method can be used to estimate the number of live culturable heterotrophic bacteria in water and also measures the variation of conditions during water treatment and distribution 11 the solid plate count was re liquefied in boiling water and thermo regulated to temperatures between 44 c and 46 c aliquots of each sample 0 1 ml and 1 0 ml were transferred into the centre of a 100 x 15 mm sterile petri dish using pipettes about 12 ml of the thermo regulated liquid agar was also added and mixed by swirling the plate prior to being inverted and incubated at 35 0 5 c for 48 3 hours the plates were allowed to solidify for about 10 minutes all samples were run in duplicates after the 10 minutes the colonies that had formed in or on the plate count media were counted and the results were reported as cfu ml using equation 3 for diluted samples the dilution factor was multiplied with the counts to obtain the final cfu ml the doc and hpc were monitored as two complementary parameters in order to gain more insight into the relationship between the bacteria and their utilisation of nom or the various fractions of nom in water 3 c f u m l c o l o n i e s c o u n t e d a c

discussion 3 1 the character and removal of nom and its polarity fractions from the conventional wtp 3 1 1 the suva characterization and removal of bulk nom fig 4 presents the characterisation of the source and treated water through suva the mean doc and uv obtained for the source water were 4 22 mg l and 0 1611 cm 1 respectively resulting in a suva of 3 97 l mg m for the treated water a mean of 3 90 mg l and 7 53 m 1 were recorded for the doc and uv254 respectively with a calculated suva of 2 04 l mg m the relatively low suva indicates a reduction in the nom fraction following treatment particularly the hpo fraction according to edzwald and tobiason 12 a suva value between 2 and 4 l mg m is indicative of humic and non humic organic matter having a mixed molecular weight distribution mwd form low molecular weight lmw to high molecular weight hmw with a hpo and hpi character high suva values also indicate the ease with which water can be treated particularly by clarification and this is evident in the reduction in the treated water suva 2 04 l mg m presented in fig 4 below the high content of aromatic organic compounds translates to a greater tendency of the nom to react with disinfectants i e chlorine to create dbps 13 14 the high aromaticity of the source water indicates that the water can be effectively treated with preferential removal of the hpo humic organic matter fraction water samples with suva value 2 l mg m contain mainly non humic matter which is generally more hpi than the other nom fractions 12 15 the observed reduction in the treated water suva values fig 4 were as a result of a reduction of uv absorbing material and doc during water treatment 3 2 the uv254 distribution and removal of the polarity fractions of nom the most dominant fraction in the source water was the hpo fraction fig 5 the distribution of the nom fractions in the source water was as follows hpo hpi tpi fractions with uv254 values 17 74 m 1 15 65 m 1 and 5 26 m 1 respectively fig 5 in terms of uv254 measurements there were no major changes in the nom concentrations as the uv254 was constantly below 21 m 1 as compared to the 2017 18 period where the mean was 35 4 m 1 although the hpo fraction was slightly higher for the source waters the m pram fractionation showed an almost equal distribution of the hpo and hpi fractions in terms of uv254 comparable findings were reported in literature whereby the m pram fractionation resulted in an equal distribution of the aforementioned fractions on the same source water 2 16 the uv254 m 1 measurements in the treated water for the hpo hpi and tpi fractions were 7 39 m 1 6 46 m 1 and 4 58 m 1 respectively indicating a substantial removal 58 of aromatic nom within the source water fig 6 and table 2 the uv254 removal for each of the fractions i e the hpi tpi and hpo was calculated as the ratio of the uv254 on each fraction before and after treatment table 2 a 58 72 reduction was observed on the hpo fraction of nom while the tpi and hpi nom fractions were reduced by 13 06 and 58 33 respectively table 2 the highest removal efficiency was observed on the hpo fraction these results are similar to results reported by matilainen et al 2010 17 where they observed that due to high insoluble content of humic and fulvic acids in the hpo fraction the fraction is easily removed by conventional clarification processes the concentration of nom was found to decrease by between 48 and 76 at the different conventional wtps where the nom was predominantly characterised of hmw nom 18 the higher content of acidic

species on organic matter to drive the hydrothermal decomposition has been proven as a versatile technology for the abatement of organic waste 2 5 wet oxidation wo is a hydrothermal treatment process in which organic and inorganic substances are oxidized in aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures and pressures by oxygen or air 6 7 biologically refractory compounds are decomposed to simple easily treated materials without the emission of harmful by products such as nox so2 hcl dioxins furans and fly ash 6 7 the challenge for wo lies in the necessity for high temperature and pressure operating conditions various catalysts have been developed to reduce the need for such extreme operating conditions thereby reducing the operating costs of the wo process 8 11 transition metal catalysts are more desirable than noble metals because of their lower cost and resistance to poisoning although their catalytic activity is lower than noble metals 10 among these catalysts copper cu is the most promising species to compete with noble metals 5 10 11 table 1 shows the transition metal catalysts used in the catalytic wet oxidation of wastewater also ceria ceo2 has been found to display good catalytic performance and is generally used as catalyst support in many catalyst formulations 10 12 however with the exception of ceria there is a gap in the knowledge on the use of rare earth oxides in catalyst formulation for catalytic wet oxidation cwo although they are also reported to exhibit catalytic behaviour 13 14 hence there is an opportunity to explore the use of rare earth oxides in cwo catalyst formulations the steps involved in catalytic wet oxidation cwo include i gas liquid diffusion ii adsorption of the reactants and cleavage of the required bonds iii the reactants held in proximity so that they can react iv desorption of the products from the surface and finally v diffusion of the products back into the surrounding phase 24 this mechanism involves the formation of free radicals of organic hydroperoxide rooh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the first step 25 these peroxide molecules rooh or h2o2 bonds with the active metals on the catalyst surface and produces hydroxyl oh free radicals reducing the severity of the reaction conditions a series of further free radical reactions yield alcohols roh which further gets oxidised to aldehydes rcho ketones rcor and carboxylic acids rcooh carboxylic acids rooh in the presence of oxygen further breaks down into short chain carboxylic acids r cooh carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o 26 the present study is designed to develop and characterise novel copper based heterogeneous catalysts supported on three different rare earth oxides ceo2 tb4o7 and dy2o3 and to study their catalytic behaviour in cwo of organic waste the treatment of organic waste and wastewater in a typical wastewater treatment system is complex due to the chemistry of the organic waste and thus in this study glucose was chosen as a model compound of carbohydrate to obtain insight into the general behaviour of organic waste in cwo conditions in this study the catalytic activity of each rare earth oxide and the effect of dopant concentration of cu metal on the catalysts were investigated catalyst characterization was performed before and after cwo experiments to evaluate the stability and reusability of the catalysts 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the catalysts were prepared from commercial grade powders of ceo2 dy2o3 and tb4o7 purchased from metall rare earth ltd china and cu no3 2 3h2o purchased from ajax finechem new zealand glucose anhydrous d c6h12o6 obtained from thermo fisher scientific australia was used as a model compound in cwo experiments oxygen 99 5 and nitrogen 99 7 gases were obtained from

merck new zealand valeric acid 99 merck new zealand 2 2 catalysts preparation the catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method 27 28 the three chosen rare earth oxides were used as catalyst supports for the active phase cu to prepare the catalysts 30 g each of ceo2 dy2o3 and tb4o7 powders were added to 100 ml of cu no3 2 precursor aqueous solutions of different concentrations giving dopant concentrations of cu no3 2 that varied from 0 1 m to 1 0 m the solutions were incubated for 24 h at 60 c with constant stirring the filtrates from the solution were dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c to eliminate the moisture in the catalysts once the filtrates had been dried they were calcined in a furnace for 3 h at 500 to decompose the volatiles i e nitrates following the calcination process the catalysts were ground into powder form using ball milling with stainless steel balls the as prepared catalysts were denoted as x cuo ceo2 x cuo dy2o3 x cuo tb4o7 x indicating the concentration of cu no3 2 solution used to dope the rare earth oxide powders where x 0 1 m 0 5 m or 1 0 m 2 3 catalyst characterization the amount of cu doped into the rare earth oxide powders was analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms analysis agilent 7700 icp ms usa calibration standards were prepared in a matrix matched solution from 1000 ppm single element standards peak performance cpi international an online internal standard 20 ppb sc was used to monitor and correct for instrument drift and matrix effects all results were back calculated to the original sample the specific surface area of the catalysts was measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet method using a micromeritics 3flex surface characterization analyser usa the bet method was performed using the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at its boiling temperature of 77 k the catalysts were degassed at a temperature of approximately 200 for around 12 h using a micromeritics vacprep 061 sample degas system usa prior to carrying out the bet method the crystalline structure of the catalysts was analysed by x ray diffraction xrd using a rigaku d max ra diffractometer japan with cu k Î± radiation in continuous scan mode from 10 to 80 of 2Î¸ using a sampling interval 0 02 and 1 s dwell time pdx2 software was used to analyse the xrd diffractograms and distinguish the different crystalline phases present in the catalysts the ground catalyst powder microstructure was examined using a scanning electron microscope sem images obtained from a philips xl30s feg scanning electron microscope netherlands energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis was carried out using a sili lithium drifted super ultra thin window eds detector to determine the bulk elemental composition of the catalysts this analysis was also used to estimate the elemental distribution of the different phases in the catalysts 2 4 catalytic wet oxidation the catalytic performance of the cu doped rare earth catalysts was determined through wet oxidation of glucose in a 1 l high pressure reactor amar equipment india the reactor was charged with 5 g of the individual catalysts and 480 ml of water before sealing and pressuring to 20 bar with pure o2 to obtain oxygen to glucose ratio of 1 3 1 the ratio was calculated based on the stoichiometric oxidation potential of glucose c6h12o6 the excess oxygen of 30 was used to ensure that oxygen mass transfer limitation has little influence on the oxidation rate in order to avoid the complexity of any potential reactions that may occur during the heat up process 120 ml of 10 glucose solution was introduced to the reactor by means of pressure difference using pure n2 when the temperature of the reactor reached 180 c the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 180 c for 60 min with a constant stirring speed of 600 rpm a slight drop in the reactor temperature approximately 1 c was observed when the substrate was injected into the reactor however the reactor temperature quickly returned back to the set temperature within 5 10 seconds samples 15 ml were withdrawn from the reactor using a manual sampling port at time intervals of 0 5 10 30 and 60 min following the injection of the glucose solution the independent process variables examined were catalyst type cuo ceo2 cuo dy2o3 cuo tb4o7 and dopant solution cu concentration 0 1 0 5 1 0 mol l catalyst dosage 5 g reaction temperature 180 c and oxygen partial pressure 20 bar were held constant for all the experiments the catalytic performance of each catalyst was compared against the control set i e blank non catalytic catalytic runs with raw ceo2 dy2o3 and tb4o7 and cu no3 2 solution 2 5 evaluation of catalyst performance the ph measurement of the liquid samples was performed using mettler toledo sevencompact ph ion meter s220 in order to verify the presence of refractory intermediates i e volatile fatty acids in the samples chemical oxygen demand cod of the liquid samples was tested using high range hr cod vials approved by the usepa the amount of reduced dichromate was determined calorimetrically using a dr 6000 benchtop spectrophotometer hach us volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations in the liquid samples were determined using a shimadzu model 2010 gas chromatograph with flame ionisation detection gc fid a db ffap nitroterephthalic acid modified polyethylene glycol capillary column with a column dimension of 30 m 530 Î¼m 0 5 Î¼m was used peak identification was accomplished by comparison of sample peak retention times with those of standard solutions as part of the post catalyst characterisation icp ms sem and xrd analyses were carried out to determine the changes that may have occurred to the catalysts during the wco experiments the catalysts from each run were filtered and dried in the oven for 24 h at 105 the recovered catalysts were then tested for cu content using icp ms analysis the difference in the cu concentration between the initial catalysts and final recovered catalysts were compared and analysed xrd analysis was used to determine any crystallographic phase changes during the wet oxidation and sem eds analysis was carried out to determine the bulk elemental composition of the catalysts post wet oxidation 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalysts characterization 3 1 1 copper loading three icp ms analyses were carried out for each sample in order to determine the variations in cu loading within the sample itself in general the variation in the percentage of cu loading in the catalysts was considerably low indicating a uniform concentration of cu in the heterogeneous catalysts table 2 shows that the icp ms results indicate the increase in cu loading with increasing concentration of cu no3 2 solution used to impregnate the rare earth oxides for all of the rare earth oxides the cu loading by weight was observed to increase with the dopant concentration with the highest loading achieved when 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution was used to dope the rare earth oxides since the trend for the cu loading has not levelled off it can be inferred that saturation has not been reached in all three rare earth oxides tb4o7 had the highest cu loading by weight 17 7 followed by dy2o3 14 6 while ceo2 had significantly lower cu loading 1 37 the dry mass of the filtrate after the incipient wetness impregnation method for tb4o7 and dy2o3 based catalysts increased especially when doped with the highest concentration of cu no3 2 solution 1 0 m while that of ceo2 remained unchanged this observation could be possibly due to the cu2 species substitutionally incorporated into the crystal lattice of the tb4o7 and dy2o3 while the cu2 species filled only the interstitial sites of ceo2 29 xrd analysis help would further validate these findings for tb4o7 its non stoichiometric nature and the coexistence of tb3 and tb4 ions in tb4o7 which gives rise to its complex behaviour 30 31 could be a possible explanation for its ability to accommodate more cu compared to dy2o3 and ceo2 respectively 32 33 3 1 2 specific surface area the pure rare earth oxide powders in general have specific surface areas ranging between 1 to 4 m2 g when the rare earth oxide powders were doped with different concentrations of cu no3 2 solution the specific surface area of the powders increased except for ceo2 which did not change significantly table 2 the ability of these materials to perform as catalysts will depend on the amount of cu initially loaded in to them the formation of the active phase cuo and its fine dispersion on the surface of the rare earth oxide support will increase the surface area of the catalysts 34 as described above the amount of cu loaded into the ceo2 support was low and this explains why the specific surface area of ceo2 based catalysts did not increase significantly after being doped with cu no3 2 solution on the contrary for the dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts which had relatively high cu loadings the specific surface area increased due to the creation of pores when the nitrogen oxide gases are liberated during the course of thermal decomposition of the cu no3 2 dopant 35 36 the specific surface area for the tb4o7 based catalysts began to decrease with higher concentrations especially when doped with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution at this concentration 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 showed the highest percentage of cu loading according to the results of icp ms analysis the decrease in the specific surface area could be potentially explained by the blocking of pores by the dopant cu cation at higher concentrations in addition there is the possibility of solid solid interactions between the cu and the rare earth oxide 35 another possible explanation could be due to incomplete decomposition of the volatile nitrates in the catalysts 37 since the time and temperature of the calcination stage were fixed at 3 h and 500 respectively it may be that insufficient decomposition of the nitrates occurred when the catalysts were doped with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution as there would be a higher concentration of nitrates to decompose in the catalysts however further analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis 3 1 3 crystalline phases xrd analysis was used to identify the crystalline phases in the catalysts doped with different concentrations of cu no3 2 solution fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of all three catalyst supports doped at different concentrations for the pure ceo2 and the cu doped ceo2 catalysts all samples show the same diffraction peaks attributed to ceo2 in the fluorite type cubic crystal structure there were no diffraction lines corresponding to cuo even when the highest dopant concentration was used this is most likely due to the small amount of cu in the samples 38 as shown by the icp ms results for the dy2o3 materials all samples show diffraction peaks corresponding to dy2o3 in the cubic crystal structure which is in good agreement with the literature 39 at the higher doping concentrations 0 5 and 1 0 m the patterns also showed two narrow diffraction peaks at 2Î¸ 35 7 and 38 9 which represents the highly crystalline structure of monoclinic cuo 35 40 these peaks were not seen for the 0 1 m cuo dy2o3 catalyst again indicating that the doping content 1 8 was too low to be detected the broadening of all the peaks with decreasing intensity was observed as the dopant concentration cu increases this could mean that the average crystalline size of cuo decreased hence doping with this rare earth oxide promotes the dispersion of the cu species 41 for the tb4o7 based materials all samples have major diffraction peaks corresponding to tb4o7 with the cubic crystal structure which is consistent with the findings in the literature 42 at higher dopant concentrations peaks corresponding to the crystalline monoclinic structure of cuo were also observed 24 29 it is to be noted that there were some additional diffraction peaks indicated by circles in fig 1 c c observed at 2Î¸ 16 5 33 3 42 2 55 8 and 66 5 in the 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 catalyst which belong to neither tb4o7 nor cuo these new peaks matched closely to the complex phase copper thulium oxide nitrate tmcu6o8 no3 there was no thulium th or thulium oxide th2o3 in the prepared catalysts however it is possible that the phase identified by the software could be analogous to a tb and nitrate related compound li et al showed that there could be some remnant nitrates from the dopant cu no3 2 solution which was not completely calcined 37 these peaks were only observed in the 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 catalyst which due to having the highest cu loading would also contain the highest amount of nitrate therefore the calcination step in the catalyst preparation plays a pivotal role in ensuring complete elimination of the volatiles i e nitrates in the prepared catalyst and this can be achieved by either increasing the calcination temperature or time another thing to note is that as the cu content was increased there was a progressive drop in the crystalline size seen from the broadening of the peaks for dy2o3 and tb4o7 doped with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution these results indicate that a two phase structure is formed comprising mainly of a tb cu o2 solid solution fluorite phase together with a small fraction of a cuo phase 29 3 1 4 elemental distribution fig 2 presents the sem images of the 1 0 m cu no3 2 doped catalyst samples for each of the three rare earth oxides energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis was carried out on areas of differential contrast highlighted in fig 2 it was found that there was more cu in the dark region compared to that of the bright region in all of the catalysts analysed as shown in table 3 fig 3 depicts the bulk elemental composition of the catalysts based on eds analysis it is apparent that the cu content in the catalysts post wet oxidation is less than the initially loaded amount this phenomenon is due to the effects of leaching of the cu cation from the catalysts into the reaction medium another aspect that can be observed in fig 3 is that the 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 catalyst had the highest cu content before undergoing reaction compared to the other catalysts this finding is consistent with the results of the icp ms whereby 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 had the highest percentage of cu loading 3 2 catalytic wet oxidation 3 2 1 glucose degradation the percentage cod reduction following 60 min of wo treatment for the control set and the experimental set is presented in fig 4 to establish the base case non catalytic wet oxidation of glucose was performed using the pure rare earth oxides and the experimental results showed that tb4o7 had the greatest cod reduction of 50 7 after 60 min one explanation for the high activity of tb4o7 is high lattice oxygen mobility due to the non stoichiometric nature of the crystal structure rosynek reported that non stoichiometric rare earth oxides such as praseodymium pr6o11 and tb4o7 exhibit high oxygen exchange capability because of the ease of ln3 ln4 interconversion 13 during the oxidation reaction both lattice oxygen vacancy formation and vacancy healing reactions will occur rapidly if a catalyst possesses high oxygen exchange capability this observation can be explained through the mechanism proposed by robert karl grasselli who postulated that the lattice oxygen in the metal oxide participates in the wet oxidation reaction through a redox cycle which involves lattice oxygen vacancy formation and vacancy healing 43 the lattice oxygen of a reducible metal oxide is a more selective and versatile oxidising agent than gaseous dioxygen or oxygen in the medium whereby the oxygen atom from the metal oxide is involved in the activation of a cc or ch bond in this reaction mechanism the oxygen atom o2 from the metal oxide is inserted into a cc or ch bond and the metal surface cation is reduced with two charges m2 44 the vacancy in the lattice left by the oxygen then gets filled up by the oxygen in the reaction medium hence regenerating the metal oxide 43 in this study tb4o7 has the greatest number of lattice oxygen in its molecule as compared to ceo2 and dy2o3 hence the catalytic activity of the rare earth oxides used in the study is in good agreement with the aforementioned theory as tb4o7 having the most lattice oxygen in its molecule is able to contribute a greater amount of lattice oxygen to the wet oxidation reaction for the rare earth oxides doped with different concentrations of cu no3 2 solution there was a trend whereby the rare earth oxides which were impregnated with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution generally gave the highest catalytic activity compared to those doped with 0 5 m and 0 1 m cu no3 2 solutions the catalysts impregnated with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution had the highest amount of cu loading as indicated by the icp ms results this indicates that more of the active phase cuo would have formed when the catalysts were calcined and this would subsequently increase the number of defects in the catalysts hence improving their catalytic properties 38 defects also help to improve the adsorption of the reactants on the catalyst i e glucose and o2 38 when comparing the effectiveness of the doped rare earth oxide powders as catalysts tb4o7 based catalysts generally exhibited higher catalytic activity compared to the other two rare earth oxide based catalysts it is worth noting that 1 0 m cuo ceo2 showed comparable cod reduction of 73 4 to both 1 0 m cuo dy2o3 and 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 i e 77 1 and 79 5 respectively despite having a much lower percentage of cu loading compared to dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts at that dopant concentration as a result the ratio of percentage cod reduction to the percentage of cu loading in the catalysts would prove to be more meaningful in further analysis of the improvement of the catalytic activity of the rare earth oxides after dopant impregnation which is represented in fig 4 based on this analysis it can be seen that although ceo2 based catalysts were less active in catalysing the decomposition of glucose in cwo than dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts the effect of dopant solution concentration was most significant in these catalysts from table 2 it can be observed that the cu content in cu ceo2 catalysts is relatively low when compared to cu dy2o3 and cu tb4o7 catalysts at the same dopant solution concentration however with only 0 65 wt cu and 1 37 wt cu supported on ceo2 at concentrations of 0 5 and 1 0 m the percentage cod reduction for these two catalysts after 60 min increased from 8 1 for raw ceo2 to 56 0 and 73 4 respectively this implies that the introduction of cu metal into the ceria lattice greatly enhances the catalytic activity of the catalyst this improvement is thought to be due to the ability of ceo2 to enhance the capacity of oxygen storage and the mobility of oxygen in the catalysts brought about by the formation of a synergistic interaction between cuo and ceo2 34 38 ceo2 based catalysts therefore prove to be effective as a catalyst for this reaction despite having a lower percentage of cu loading compared to the other two rare earth oxide based catalysts however it is inconclusive whether the improvement of the catalytic activity of ceo2 based catalysts particularly at higher dopant concentrations was due to changes in the ceo2 structure itself after being doped or was due to the fact that more cu leached into the reaction medium the effectiveness of a heterogeneous catalyst in a chemical reaction depends on its specific surface area with a higher surface area known to enhance the catalytic activity of heterogeneous catalysts as there is greater availability of active sites for catalytic activity and exposure to the reactants 45 based on fig 4 the catalytic performance of the catalysts improves as the concentration of cu no3 2 increases despite the fact that the specific surface area of ceo2 and tb4o7 based catalysts were decreasing with the concentration of cu no3 2 consequently the specific surface area of the catalysts in this case does not have a dominant influence on their catalytic activity due to the effects of cu leaching 3 2 2 reaction kinetics the extent of the glucose oxidation reaction can be described using a conversion time graph in this study the kinetic model developed by ploos van amstel for wo of glucose eq 1 was used to calculate the reaction constant during the rapid oxidation and slow oxidation phases 46 1 1 c c 0 0 5 k t where c is the cod concentration at time t c0 is the cod concentration at time 0 k is the reaction rate constant and t is time ploos van amstel in his study of wo of glucose at 177 200 c and 34 4 bar discovered that the oxidation rate has a square root dependence on glucose concentration he concluded that the glucose oxidation reaction is confined to a thin liquid layer next to the gas liquid interface i e is mass transfer limited given that the glucose oxidation reaction is approximately first order with respect to both glucose and dissolved oxygen the square root dependency of the oxidation rate on glucose concentration is in accordance with theory 47 glucose concentration time data plotted as 1 c c0 0 5 against time is shown in fig 5 the slope of the graph represents the reaction constant and is related to the rate of reaction the effectiveness of a catalyst in cwo is mainly determined by its ability to catalyse the conversion of substrate into simpler compounds in a short amount of time in regard to this the reaction constant allows a direct comparison of the catalyst performance the kinetic results in fig 5 a show that the use of unsupported tb4o7 as a catalyst resulted in faster and greater degradation of cod when compared to ceo2 and dy2o3 for the ceo2 based catalyst the rate of glucose degradation with respect to dopant solution concentration is in the order of 1 0 m 0 5 m 0 1 m which is consistent with the cod degradation profile presented in fig 4 on the contrary the order of the glucose degradation curves for dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts do not correlate to the order of the cod degradation profile for dy2o3 based catalysts the highest degradation rate is achieved with cuo dy2o3 at a dopant solution concentration of 0 5 m followed by 1 0 m and 0 1 m the degradation rate for tb4o7 based catalysts with respect to dopant solution concentration in increasing order is as follows 1 0 m 0 1 m and 0 5 m reaction rate constants for each catalyst are given in table 4 and it can be observed that the constant decreased when the reaction proceeded from the rapid oxidation period to the slow oxidation period the reaction rate constant of the experimental set is considerably higher than the non catalytic run these results provide evidence that the cu based heterogeneous catalysts supported on ceo2 dy2o3 tb4o7 promoted the generation of highly active radicals that were responsible for the decomposition of glucose into intermediate compounds during the chain oxidation reaction high reaction rate constant correlated to high reaction rate thus it can be concluded that the new catalysts can improve the rate of reaction in cwo of glucose 3 2 3 organic acid formation the presence of volatile fatty acids vfa is an indicator of the extent of reaction and thus correlates to the effectiveness of catalytic abatement of organic material acetic acid was the main vfa measured in this study followed by propionic butyric and valeric acids it is well known that wo and cwo processes will result in the production of low molecular weight oxygenated compounds mainly acetic acid that are resistant to further oxidation 4 7 8 10 48 50 acetic acid is a stable intermediate and complete oxidation of acetic acid is usually negligible at temperatures lower than 300 c 8 51 as such the acetic acid concentration is an excellent indicator of the extent of reaction fig 6 shows the concentration of acetic acid in samples taken from the reactor during the wet oxidation experiments only the acetic acid concentration profile is reported as it was found that the concentration of acetic acid in the samples collected is much higher than other vfas and there is no obvious trend for the concentration profile of propionic butyric and valeric acids for all experiments mishra et al demonstrated that the oxidation rate of vfas increases with increasing molecular weight or carbon number 51 since propionic butyric and valeric acids have higher molecular weight than acetic acid it was expected that these vfas would degrade more rapidly during the reaction hence resulted in low values for acid concentration based on fig 6 a it can be noted that the use of dy2o3 and tb4o7 as a catalyst has a noticeable effect on the acetic acid formation at 180 c the presence of dy2o3 catalyst resulted in an increase in acetic acid concentration from 353 ppm t 10 min to 962 ppm t 60 min whereas the acetic acid concentration for glucose oxidation reaction catalysed by tb4o7 increased from 218 ppm t 10 min to 568 ppm t 60 min oxidation of glucose to acetic acid is a typical example of an unstable intermediate selective reaction where the acetic acid can be further oxidised to oxides of carbon and water 52 the reaction scheme for unstable intermediate selective reaction selectivity is 2 a k 1 b k 2 c good selectivity for this type of reaction depends on the rate constant of the unstable intermediate formation k1 being much larger than the rate constant of end product formation k 2 52 for the glucose oxidation reaction the rate of acetic acid formation can be related to the rate constant k1 in eq 2 and a steeper gradient in the acetic acid concentration profile is correlated to a higher k 1 value on the basis of this it can be concluded that the selectivity of the rare earth oxides towards acetic acid formation is in the order of dy2o3 tb4o7 ceo2 in general the concentration of acetic acid increased over time in all experiments it is evident that glucose is degraded through acid intermediates and the conversion is increasing over time it was found that the selectivity of cuo dy2o3 and cuo tb4o7 based catalysts towards acetic acid formation is rather low when compared to unsupported dy2o3 and tb4o7 in contrast a considerable amount of acetic acid is formed during the cwo of glucose using cuo ceo2 based catalysts prepared at a dopant concentration of 1 0 m these results show evidence that both active metal and catalyst support has an influence towards the selectivity of acetic acid and hence affect the degradation of glucose 3 3 catalyst deactivation the heterogeneous catalysts can be deactivated through various ways such as fouling sintering and poisoning the formation of new inactive phases and leaching 53 in this case metal cation leaching is the dominant catalyst deactivation mechanism and leaching causes the loss of the active phase cuo which will affect the reusability of the heterogeneous catalysts visually following the wet oxidation experiments the filtrate of the reaction mixture for all of the experimental runs was greenish blue which might indicate the presence of cu cations leaching could possibly have occurred causing the cu which was doped into the rare earth oxide powders to be leached away into the reaction mixture to investigate the effect of the wet oxidation reaction on the catalysts icp ms analysis was carried out on the catalyst samples following wet oxidation of glucose and the cu concentrations compared with those determined by icp ms prior to the oxidation experiments the percentage of cu leached out from the catalyst after one run of cwo is presented in fig 7 it can be observed that a considerable amount of cu had been leached out from each catalyst during cwo of glucose according to kim and ihm the active metal ions leached from the solid catalyst might contribute to the total catalytic activity 5 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution which had equivalent moles to 17 7 wt of cu loading in the rare earth oxides was used in wet oxidation of glucose experimental run to simulate the homogeneous catalyst of the active phase cu scenario this particular weight percentage of cu loading was chosen as it represented the highest percentage cu loading in the rare earth oxides and the extent of its effectiveness was studied 58 7 of cod conversion was achieved with a homogeneous cu catalyst 17 7 wt cu which is lower than the catalyst which had 17 7 wt cu loaded in it however the homogeneous cu catalyst exhibited a higher percentage cod reduction compared to all the pure rare earth oxide powders this observation aids in explaining that homogeneous cu cations in the reaction medium are quite potent of themselves in acting as a catalyst in this reaction therefore improvement in the catalytic performance of rare earth oxide catalysts could be due to the coupled effect of the changes in the structure of rare earth oxides after doping and the leached cu in the reaction medium the increasing formation of acetic acid as a function of the reaction time depicted in fig 6 indicates that the reaction medium is becoming increasingly acidic over the course of the 1 h long experimental run the phenomenon is probably due to the intermediate acids produced in the reaction medium metal oxides that can form soluble salts in the presence of acids especially nitric sulfuric or hydrochloric acid may cause leaching due to chemical transformation 53 although the aforementioned acids were not produced in the wet oxidation reaction of glucose the active phase cuo still has a high likelihood of being susceptible to the other acids produced by the reaction hence succumbing to the effects of leaching and causing the heterogeneous catalysts to be deactivated the results from xrd analysis of the 1 0 m cuo ceo2 catalyst showed that the catalyst did not undergo any observable phase transformation after being used in the wet oxidation reaction of glucose no cu or cuo peaks were observed in this sample prior to wet oxidation due to the low amount as described previously so it is not possible to determine any changes due to leaching the fact that the ceria phase remained unchanged indicates that the ceo2 based catalysts were chemically stable xrd patterns of the 1 0 m cuo dy2o3 and 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 following wet oxidation are shown in fig 8 a c b c respectively which indicate that these catalysts have undergone a transformation during wet oxidation the dy2o3 and tb4o7 in the catalysts may have reacted with the intermediate acids produced in the wet oxidation reaction of glucose to become dy and tb based salts respectively this is apparent from the xrd results of the both these catalysts post wet oxidation as the peaks corresponding to dy2o3 and tb4o7 have disappeared and new peaks corresponding to the dy and tb based salts formation indicating that some degree of chemical transformation has occurred 4 conclusions among the three rare earth oxides investigated in this research ceo2 has shown the greatest potential in being catalyst support to cu in the wet oxidation of glucose process on a cod reduction per cu basis ceo2 showed the highest percentage of oxidizable organic matter degradation despite having the lowest amount of cu doped in it ceo2 based catalysts also remained chemically stable after being used in the chemical reaction while the other two rare earth oxides dy2o3 and tb4o7 reacted with the intermediate products and underwent a chemical transformation significant degradation of oxidizable organic matter was observed within 60 min of catalytic processing compared to that of non catalytic processing a maximum of 80 reduction in the oxidizable organic matter was obtained acetic acid was the dominant vfa produced at the end of the chemical reaction as acetic acid is a stable intermediate compound leaching was observed in all of the catalysts where most of the doped cu leached into the reaction solution indicating that incipient wetness impregnation is not the best method to prepare cu based heterogeneous catalysts using rare earth oxides as catalyst support declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest in the publication of this study 
14009,catalytic wet oxidation cwo is a promising technology for the treatment of wastewater and abatement of organic waste in which the unique characteristics of water at elevated temperatures and pressures are utilised in this study the catalytic wet oxidation reaction of glucose model compound of carbohydrate was evaluated using three different rare earth oxides ceo2 dy2o3 and tb4o7 as catalyst supports to the active phase cu the heterogeneous catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method the catalysts performance was evaluated by comparing the results from catalysts characterization and the chemical oxygen demand cod removal efficiency of each catalyst the highest cod conversion 80 was achieved with cu tb4o7 catalyst prepared at a dopant solution concentration of 1 0 m the cod results revealed that the introduction of cu metal into the catalyst supports greatly enhances the catalyst activity however leaching was detected in all catalysts suggesting that the stability and reusability of the catalysts were low keywords catalytic wet oxidation heterogeneous catalysts hydrothermal processing organic waste wastewater 1 introduction the world population is projected to grow at an increasing rate and the amount of organic waste generated worldwide would subsequently increase causing a rise in environmental problems this corresponds to large volumes of waste for the urban population and includes a significant organic fraction of approximately 50 70 of the total solid waste 1 at present landfilling is the most common global means for waste disposal but one of the major problems associated with landfill operations is the generation of landfill leachate that contains large quantities of toxic chemicals and heavy metals that may cause serious environmental problems this increases the need for alternative disposal and treatment processes of organic waste wet oxidation wo with the capability to exploit highly reactive oxygen species on organic matter to drive the hydrothermal decomposition has been proven as a versatile technology for the abatement of organic waste 2 5 wet oxidation wo is a hydrothermal treatment process in which organic and inorganic substances are oxidized in aqueous solutions at elevated temperatures and pressures by oxygen or air 6 7 biologically refractory compounds are decomposed to simple easily treated materials without the emission of harmful by products such as nox so2 hcl dioxins furans and fly ash 6 7 the challenge for wo lies in the necessity for high temperature and pressure operating conditions various catalysts have been developed to reduce the need for such extreme operating conditions thereby reducing the operating costs of the wo process 8 11 transition metal catalysts are more desirable than noble metals because of their lower cost and resistance to poisoning although their catalytic activity is lower than noble metals 10 among these catalysts copper cu is the most promising species to compete with noble metals 5 10 11 table 1 shows the transition metal catalysts used in the catalytic wet oxidation of wastewater also ceria ceo2 has been found to display good catalytic performance and is generally used as catalyst support in many catalyst formulations 10 12 however with the exception of ceria there is a gap in the knowledge on the use of rare earth oxides in catalyst formulation for catalytic wet oxidation cwo although they are also reported to exhibit catalytic behaviour 13 14 hence there is an opportunity to explore the use of rare earth oxides in cwo catalyst formulations the steps involved in catalytic wet oxidation cwo include i gas liquid diffusion ii adsorption of the reactants and cleavage of the required bonds iii the reactants held in proximity so that they can react iv desorption of the products from the surface and finally v diffusion of the products back into the surrounding phase 24 this mechanism involves the formation of free radicals of organic hydroperoxide rooh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in the first step 25 these peroxide molecules rooh or h2o2 bonds with the active metals on the catalyst surface and produces hydroxyl oh free radicals reducing the severity of the reaction conditions a series of further free radical reactions yield alcohols roh which further gets oxidised to aldehydes rcho ketones rcor and carboxylic acids rcooh carboxylic acids rooh in the presence of oxygen further breaks down into short chain carboxylic acids r cooh carbon dioxide co2 and water h2o 26 the present study is designed to develop and characterise novel copper based heterogeneous catalysts supported on three different rare earth oxides ceo2 tb4o7 and dy2o3 and to study their catalytic behaviour in cwo of organic waste the treatment of organic waste and wastewater in a typical wastewater treatment system is complex due to the chemistry of the organic waste and thus in this study glucose was chosen as a model compound of carbohydrate to obtain insight into the general behaviour of organic waste in cwo conditions in this study the catalytic activity of each rare earth oxide and the effect of dopant concentration of cu metal on the catalysts were investigated catalyst characterization was performed before and after cwo experiments to evaluate the stability and reusability of the catalysts 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the catalysts were prepared from commercial grade powders of ceo2 dy2o3 and tb4o7 purchased from metall rare earth ltd china and cu no3 2 3h2o purchased from ajax finechem new zealand glucose anhydrous d c6h12o6 obtained from thermo fisher scientific australia was used as a model compound in cwo experiments oxygen 99 5 and nitrogen 99 7 gases were obtained from

merck new zealand valeric acid 99 merck new zealand 2 2 catalysts preparation the catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method 27 28 the three chosen rare earth oxides were used as catalyst supports for the active phase cu to prepare the catalysts 30 g each of ceo2 dy2o3 and tb4o7 powders were added to 100 ml of cu no3 2 precursor aqueous solutions of different concentrations giving dopant concentrations of cu no3 2 that varied from 0 1 m to 1 0 m the solutions were incubated for 24 h at 60 c with constant stirring the filtrates from the solution were dried in an oven for 24 h at 105 c to eliminate the moisture in the catalysts once the filtrates had been dried they were calcined in a furnace for 3 h at 500 to decompose the volatiles i e nitrates following the calcination process the catalysts were ground into powder form using ball milling with stainless steel balls the as prepared catalysts were denoted as x cuo ceo2 x cuo dy2o3 x cuo tb4o7 x indicating the concentration of cu no3 2 solution used to dope the rare earth oxide powders where x 0 1 m 0 5 m or 1 0 m 2 3 catalyst characterization the amount of cu doped into the rare earth oxide powders was analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms analysis agilent 7700 icp ms usa calibration standards were prepared in a matrix matched solution from 1000 ppm single element standards peak performance cpi international an online internal standard 20 ppb sc was used to monitor and correct for instrument drift and matrix effects all results were back calculated to the original sample the specific surface area of the catalysts was measured using the brunauer emmett teller bet method using a micromeritics 3flex surface characterization analyser usa the bet method was performed using the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms at its boiling temperature of 77 k the catalysts were degassed at a temperature of approximately 200 for around 12 h using a micromeritics vacprep 061 sample degas system usa prior to carrying out the bet method the crystalline structure of the catalysts was analysed by x ray diffraction xrd using a rigaku d max ra diffractometer japan with cu k Î± radiation in continuous scan mode from 10 to 80 of 2Î¸ using a sampling interval 0 02 and 1 s dwell time pdx2 software was used to analyse the xrd diffractograms and distinguish the different crystalline phases present in the catalysts the ground catalyst powder microstructure was examined using a scanning electron microscope sem images obtained from a philips xl30s feg scanning electron microscope netherlands energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis was carried out using a sili lithium drifted super ultra thin window eds detector to determine the bulk elemental composition of the catalysts this analysis was also used to estimate the elemental distribution of the different phases in the catalysts 2 4 catalytic wet oxidation the catalytic performance of the cu doped rare earth catalysts was determined through wet oxidation of glucose in a 1 l high pressure reactor amar equipment india the reactor was charged with 5 g of the individual catalysts and 480 ml of water before sealing and pressuring to 20 bar with pure o2 to obtain oxygen to glucose ratio of 1 3 1 the ratio was calculated based on the stoichiometric oxidation potential of glucose c6h12o6 the excess oxygen of 30 was used to ensure that oxygen mass transfer limitation has little influence on the oxidation rate in order to avoid the complexity of any potential reactions that may occur during the heat up process 120 ml of 10 glucose solution was introduced to the reactor by means of pressure difference using pure n2 when the temperature of the reactor reached 180 c the temperature of the reactor was maintained at 180 c for 60 min with a constant stirring speed of 600 rpm a slight drop in the reactor temperature approximately 1 c was observed when the substrate was injected into the reactor however the reactor temperature quickly returned back to the set temperature within 5 10 seconds samples 15 ml were withdrawn from the reactor using a manual sampling port at time intervals of 0 5 10 30 and 60 min following the injection of the glucose solution the independent process variables examined were catalyst type cuo ceo2 cuo dy2o3 cuo tb4o7 and dopant solution cu concentration 0 1 0 5 1 0 mol l catalyst dosage 5 g reaction temperature 180 c and oxygen partial pressure 20 bar were held constant for all the experiments the catalytic performance of each catalyst was compared against the control set i e blank non catalytic catalytic runs with raw ceo2 dy2o3 and tb4o7 and cu no3 2 solution 2 5 evaluation of catalyst performance the ph measurement of the liquid samples was performed using mettler toledo sevencompact ph ion meter s220 in order to verify the presence of refractory intermediates i e volatile fatty acids in the samples chemical oxygen demand cod of the liquid samples was tested using high range hr cod vials approved by the usepa the amount of reduced dichromate was determined calorimetrically using a dr 6000 benchtop spectrophotometer hach us volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations in the liquid samples were determined using a shimadzu model 2010 gas chromatograph with flame ionisation detection gc fid a db ffap nitroterephthalic acid modified polyethylene glycol capillary column with a column dimension of 30 m 530 Î¼m 0 5 Î¼m was used peak identification was accomplished by comparison of sample peak retention times with those of standard solutions as part of the post catalyst characterisation icp ms sem and xrd analyses were carried out to determine the changes that may have occurred to the catalysts during the wco experiments the catalysts from each run were filtered and dried in the oven for 24 h at 105 the recovered catalysts were then tested for cu content using icp ms analysis the difference in the cu concentration between the initial catalysts and final recovered catalysts were compared and analysed xrd analysis was used to determine any crystallographic phase changes during the wet oxidation and sem eds analysis was carried out to determine the bulk elemental composition of the catalysts post wet oxidation 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalysts characterization 3 1 1 copper loading three icp ms analyses were carried out for each sample in order to determine the variations in cu loading within the sample itself in general the variation in the percentage of cu loading in the catalysts was considerably low indicating a uniform concentration of cu in the heterogeneous catalysts table 2 shows that the icp ms results indicate the increase in cu loading with increasing concentration of cu no3 2 solution used to impregnate the rare earth oxides for all of the rare earth oxides the cu loading by weight was observed to increase with the dopant concentration with the highest loading achieved when 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution was used to dope the rare earth oxides since the trend for the cu loading has not levelled off it can be inferred that saturation has not been reached in all three rare earth oxides tb4o7 had the highest cu loading by weight 17 7 followed by dy2o3 14 6 while ceo2 had significantly lower cu loading 1 37 the dry mass of the filtrate after the incipient wetness impregnation method for tb4o7 and dy2o3 based catalysts increased especially when doped with the highest concentration of cu no3 2 solution 1 0 m while that of ceo2 remained unchanged this observation could be possibly due to the cu2 species substitutionally incorporated into the crystal lattice of the tb4o7 and dy2o3 while the cu2 species filled only the interstitial sites of ceo2 29 xrd analysis help would further validate these findings for tb4o7 its non stoichiometric nature and the coexistence of tb3 and tb4 ions in tb4o7 which gives rise to its complex behaviour 30 31 could be a possible explanation for its ability to accommodate more cu compared to dy2o3 and ceo2 respectively 32 33 3 1 2 specific surface area the pure rare earth oxide powders in general have specific surface areas ranging between 1 to 4 m2 g when the rare earth oxide powders were doped with different concentrations of cu no3 2 solution the specific surface area of the powders increased except for ceo2 which did not change significantly table 2 the ability of these materials to perform as catalysts will depend on the amount of cu initially loaded in to them the formation of the active phase cuo and its fine dispersion on the surface of the rare earth oxide support will increase the surface area of the catalysts 34 as described above the amount of cu loaded into the ceo2 support was low and this explains why the specific surface area of ceo2 based catalysts did not increase significantly after being doped with cu no3 2 solution on the contrary for the dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts which had relatively high cu loadings the specific surface area increased due to the creation of pores when the nitrogen oxide gases are liberated during the course of thermal decomposition of the cu no3 2 dopant 35 36 the specific surface area for the tb4o7 based catalysts began to decrease with higher concentrations especially when doped with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution at this concentration 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 showed the highest percentage of cu loading according to the results of icp ms analysis the decrease in the specific surface area could be potentially explained by the blocking of pores by the dopant cu cation at higher concentrations in addition there is the possibility of solid solid interactions between the cu and the rare earth oxide 35 another possible explanation could be due to incomplete decomposition of the volatile nitrates in the catalysts 37 since the time and temperature of the calcination stage were fixed at 3 h and 500 respectively it may be that insufficient decomposition of the nitrates occurred when the catalysts were doped with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution as there would be a higher concentration of nitrates to decompose in the catalysts however further analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis 3 1 3 crystalline phases xrd analysis was used to identify the crystalline phases in the catalysts doped with different concentrations of cu no3 2 solution fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of all three catalyst supports doped at different concentrations for the pure ceo2 and the cu doped ceo2 catalysts all samples show the same diffraction peaks attributed to ceo2 in the fluorite type cubic crystal structure there were no diffraction lines corresponding to cuo even when the highest dopant concentration was used this is most likely due to the small amount of cu in the samples 38 as shown by the icp ms results for the dy2o3 materials all samples show diffraction peaks corresponding to dy2o3 in the cubic crystal structure which is in good agreement with the literature 39 at the higher doping concentrations 0 5 and 1 0 m the patterns also showed two narrow diffraction peaks at 2Î¸ 35 7 and 38 9 which represents the highly crystalline structure of monoclinic cuo 35 40 these peaks were not seen for the 0 1 m cuo dy2o3 catalyst again indicating that the doping content 1 8 was too low to be detected the broadening of all the peaks with decreasing intensity was observed as the dopant concentration cu increases this could mean that the average crystalline size of cuo decreased hence doping with this rare earth oxide promotes the dispersion of the cu species 41 for the tb4o7 based materials all samples have major diffraction peaks corresponding to tb4o7 with the cubic crystal structure which is consistent with the findings in the literature 42 at higher dopant concentrations peaks corresponding to the crystalline monoclinic structure of cuo were also observed 24 29 it is to be noted that there were some additional diffraction peaks indicated by circles in fig 1 c c observed at 2Î¸ 16 5 33 3 42 2 55 8 and 66 5 in the 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 catalyst which belong to neither tb4o7 nor cuo these new peaks matched closely to the complex phase copper thulium oxide nitrate tmcu6o8 no3 there was no thulium th or thulium oxide th2o3 in the prepared catalysts however it is possible that the phase identified by the software could be analogous to a tb and nitrate related compound li et al showed that there could be some remnant nitrates from the dopant cu no3 2 solution which was not completely calcined 37 these peaks were only observed in the 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 catalyst which due to having the highest cu loading would also contain the highest amount of nitrate therefore the calcination step in the catalyst preparation plays a pivotal role in ensuring complete elimination of the volatiles i e nitrates in the prepared catalyst and this can be achieved by either increasing the calcination temperature or time another thing to note is that as the cu content was increased there was a progressive drop in the crystalline size seen from the broadening of the peaks for dy2o3 and tb4o7 doped with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution these results indicate that a two phase structure is formed comprising mainly of a tb cu o2 solid solution fluorite phase together with a small fraction of a cuo phase 29 3 1 4 elemental distribution fig 2 presents the sem images of the 1 0 m cu no3 2 doped catalyst samples for each of the three rare earth oxides energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis was carried out on areas of differential contrast highlighted in fig 2 it was found that there was more cu in the dark region compared to that of the bright region in all of the catalysts analysed as shown in table 3 fig 3 depicts the bulk elemental composition of the catalysts based on eds analysis it is apparent that the cu content in the catalysts post wet oxidation is less than the initially loaded amount this phenomenon is due to the effects of leaching of the cu cation from the catalysts into the reaction medium another aspect that can be observed in fig 3 is that the 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 catalyst had the highest cu content before undergoing reaction compared to the other catalysts this finding is consistent with the results of the icp ms whereby 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 had the highest percentage of cu loading 3 2 catalytic wet oxidation 3 2 1 glucose degradation the percentage cod reduction following 60 min of wo treatment for the control set and the experimental set is presented in fig 4 to establish the base case non catalytic wet oxidation of glucose was performed using the pure rare earth oxides and the experimental results showed that tb4o7 had the greatest cod reduction of 50 7 after 60 min one explanation for the high activity of tb4o7 is high lattice oxygen mobility due to the non stoichiometric nature of the crystal structure rosynek reported that non stoichiometric rare earth oxides such as praseodymium pr6o11 and tb4o7 exhibit high oxygen exchange capability because of the ease of ln3 ln4 interconversion 13 during the oxidation reaction both lattice oxygen vacancy formation and vacancy healing reactions will occur rapidly if a catalyst possesses high oxygen exchange capability this observation can be explained through the mechanism proposed by robert karl grasselli who postulated that the lattice oxygen in the metal oxide participates in the wet oxidation reaction through a redox cycle which involves lattice oxygen vacancy formation and vacancy healing 43 the lattice oxygen of a reducible metal oxide is a more selective and versatile oxidising agent than gaseous dioxygen or oxygen in the medium whereby the oxygen atom from the metal oxide is involved in the activation of a cc or ch bond in this reaction mechanism the oxygen atom o2 from the metal oxide is inserted into a cc or ch bond and the metal surface cation is reduced with two charges m2 44 the vacancy in the lattice left by the oxygen then gets filled up by the oxygen in the reaction medium hence regenerating the metal oxide 43 in this study tb4o7 has the greatest number of lattice oxygen in its molecule as compared to ceo2 and dy2o3 hence the catalytic activity of the rare earth oxides used in the study is in good agreement with the aforementioned theory as tb4o7 having the most lattice oxygen in its molecule is able to contribute a greater amount of lattice oxygen to the wet oxidation reaction for the rare earth oxides doped with different concentrations of cu no3 2 solution there was a trend whereby the rare earth oxides which were impregnated with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution generally gave the highest catalytic activity compared to those doped with 0 5 m and 0 1 m cu no3 2 solutions the catalysts impregnated with 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution had the highest amount of cu loading as indicated by the icp ms results this indicates that more of the active phase cuo would have formed when the catalysts were calcined and this would subsequently increase the number of defects in the catalysts hence improving their catalytic properties 38 defects also help to improve the adsorption of the reactants on the catalyst i e glucose and o2 38 when comparing the effectiveness of the doped rare earth oxide powders as catalysts tb4o7 based catalysts generally exhibited higher catalytic activity compared to the other two rare earth oxide based catalysts it is worth noting that 1 0 m cuo ceo2 showed comparable cod reduction of 73 4 to both 1 0 m cuo dy2o3 and 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 i e 77 1 and 79 5 respectively despite having a much lower percentage of cu loading compared to dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts at that dopant concentration as a result the ratio of percentage cod reduction to the percentage of cu loading in the catalysts would prove to be more meaningful in further analysis of the improvement of the catalytic activity of the rare earth oxides after dopant impregnation which is represented in fig 4 based on this analysis it can be seen that although ceo2 based catalysts were less active in catalysing the decomposition of glucose in cwo than dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts the effect of dopant solution concentration was most significant in these catalysts from table 2 it can be observed that the cu content in cu ceo2 catalysts is relatively low when compared to cu dy2o3 and cu tb4o7 catalysts at the same dopant solution concentration however with only 0 65 wt cu and 1 37 wt cu supported on ceo2 at concentrations of 0 5 and 1 0 m the percentage cod reduction for these two catalysts after 60 min increased from 8 1 for raw ceo2 to 56 0 and 73 4 respectively this implies that the introduction of cu metal into the ceria lattice greatly enhances the catalytic activity of the catalyst this improvement is thought to be due to the ability of ceo2 to enhance the capacity of oxygen storage and the mobility of oxygen in the catalysts brought about by the formation of a synergistic interaction between cuo and ceo2 34 38 ceo2 based catalysts therefore prove to be effective as a catalyst for this reaction despite having a lower percentage of cu loading compared to the other two rare earth oxide based catalysts however it is inconclusive whether the improvement of the catalytic activity of ceo2 based catalysts particularly at higher dopant concentrations was due to changes in the ceo2 structure itself after being doped or was due to the fact that more cu leached into the reaction medium the effectiveness of a heterogeneous catalyst in a chemical reaction depends on its specific surface area with a higher surface area known to enhance the catalytic activity of heterogeneous catalysts as there is greater availability of active sites for catalytic activity and exposure to the reactants 45 based on fig 4 the catalytic performance of the catalysts improves as the concentration of cu no3 2 increases despite the fact that the specific surface area of ceo2 and tb4o7 based catalysts were decreasing with the concentration of cu no3 2 consequently the specific surface area of the catalysts in this case does not have a dominant influence on their catalytic activity due to the effects of cu leaching 3 2 2 reaction kinetics the extent of the glucose oxidation reaction can be described using a conversion time graph in this study the kinetic model developed by ploos van amstel for wo of glucose eq 1 was used to calculate the reaction constant during the rapid oxidation and slow oxidation phases 46 1 1 c c 0 0 5 k t where c is the cod concentration at time t c0 is the cod concentration at time 0 k is the reaction rate constant and t is time ploos van amstel in his study of wo of glucose at 177 200 c and 34 4 bar discovered that the oxidation rate has a square root dependence on glucose concentration he concluded that the glucose oxidation reaction is confined to a thin liquid layer next to the gas liquid interface i e is mass transfer limited given that the glucose oxidation reaction is approximately first order with respect to both glucose and dissolved oxygen the square root dependency of the oxidation rate on glucose concentration is in accordance with theory 47 glucose concentration time data plotted as 1 c c0 0 5 against time is shown in fig 5 the slope of the graph represents the reaction constant and is related to the rate of reaction the effectiveness of a catalyst in cwo is mainly determined by its ability to catalyse the conversion of substrate into simpler compounds in a short amount of time in regard to this the reaction constant allows a direct comparison of the catalyst performance the kinetic results in fig 5 a show that the use of unsupported tb4o7 as a catalyst resulted in faster and greater degradation of cod when compared to ceo2 and dy2o3 for the ceo2 based catalyst the rate of glucose degradation with respect to dopant solution concentration is in the order of 1 0 m 0 5 m 0 1 m which is consistent with the cod degradation profile presented in fig 4 on the contrary the order of the glucose degradation curves for dy2o3 and tb4o7 based catalysts do not correlate to the order of the cod degradation profile for dy2o3 based catalysts the highest degradation rate is achieved with cuo dy2o3 at a dopant solution concentration of 0 5 m followed by 1 0 m and 0 1 m the degradation rate for tb4o7 based catalysts with respect to dopant solution concentration in increasing order is as follows 1 0 m 0 1 m and 0 5 m reaction rate constants for each catalyst are given in table 4 and it can be observed that the constant decreased when the reaction proceeded from the rapid oxidation period to the slow oxidation period the reaction rate constant of the experimental set is considerably higher than the non catalytic run these results provide evidence that the cu based heterogeneous catalysts supported on ceo2 dy2o3 tb4o7 promoted the generation of highly active radicals that were responsible for the decomposition of glucose into intermediate compounds during the chain oxidation reaction high reaction rate constant correlated to high reaction rate thus it can be concluded that the new catalysts can improve the rate of reaction in cwo of glucose 3 2 3 organic acid formation the presence of volatile fatty acids vfa is an indicator of the extent of reaction and thus correlates to the effectiveness of catalytic abatement of organic material acetic acid was the main vfa measured in this study followed by propionic butyric and valeric acids it is well known that wo and cwo processes will result in the production of low molecular weight oxygenated compounds mainly acetic acid that are resistant to further oxidation 4 7 8 10 48 50 acetic acid is a stable intermediate and complete oxidation of acetic acid is usually negligible at temperatures lower than 300 c 8 51 as such the acetic acid concentration is an excellent indicator of the extent of reaction fig 6 shows the concentration of acetic acid in samples taken from the reactor during the wet oxidation experiments only the acetic acid concentration profile is reported as it was found that the concentration of acetic acid in the samples collected is much higher than other vfas and there is no obvious trend for the concentration profile of propionic butyric and valeric acids for all experiments mishra et al demonstrated that the oxidation rate of vfas increases with increasing molecular weight or carbon number 51 since propionic butyric and valeric acids have higher molecular weight than acetic acid it was expected that these vfas would degrade more rapidly during the reaction hence resulted in low values for acid concentration based on fig 6 a it can be noted that the use of dy2o3 and tb4o7 as a catalyst has a noticeable effect on the acetic acid formation at 180 c the presence of dy2o3 catalyst resulted in an increase in acetic acid concentration from 353 ppm t 10 min to 962 ppm t 60 min whereas the acetic acid concentration for glucose oxidation reaction catalysed by tb4o7 increased from 218 ppm t 10 min to 568 ppm t 60 min oxidation of glucose to acetic acid is a typical example of an unstable intermediate selective reaction where the acetic acid can be further oxidised to oxides of carbon and water 52 the reaction scheme for unstable intermediate selective reaction selectivity is 2 a k 1 b k 2 c good selectivity for this type of reaction depends on the rate constant of the unstable intermediate formation k1 being much larger than the rate constant of end product formation k 2 52 for the glucose oxidation reaction the rate of acetic acid formation can be related to the rate constant k1 in eq 2 and a steeper gradient in the acetic acid concentration profile is correlated to a higher k 1 value on the basis of this it can be concluded that the selectivity of the rare earth oxides towards acetic acid formation is in the order of dy2o3 tb4o7 ceo2 in general the concentration of acetic acid increased over time in all experiments it is evident that glucose is degraded through acid intermediates and the conversion is increasing over time it was found that the selectivity of cuo dy2o3 and cuo tb4o7 based catalysts towards acetic acid formation is rather low when compared to unsupported dy2o3 and tb4o7 in contrast a considerable amount of acetic acid is formed during the cwo of glucose using cuo ceo2 based catalysts prepared at a dopant concentration of 1 0 m these results show evidence that both active metal and catalyst support has an influence towards the selectivity of acetic acid and hence affect the degradation of glucose 3 3 catalyst deactivation the heterogeneous catalysts can be deactivated through various ways such as fouling sintering and poisoning the formation of new inactive phases and leaching 53 in this case metal cation leaching is the dominant catalyst deactivation mechanism and leaching causes the loss of the active phase cuo which will affect the reusability of the heterogeneous catalysts visually following the wet oxidation experiments the filtrate of the reaction mixture for all of the experimental runs was greenish blue which might indicate the presence of cu cations leaching could possibly have occurred causing the cu which was doped into the rare earth oxide powders to be leached away into the reaction mixture to investigate the effect of the wet oxidation reaction on the catalysts icp ms analysis was carried out on the catalyst samples following wet oxidation of glucose and the cu concentrations compared with those determined by icp ms prior to the oxidation experiments the percentage of cu leached out from the catalyst after one run of cwo is presented in fig 7 it can be observed that a considerable amount of cu had been leached out from each catalyst during cwo of glucose according to kim and ihm the active metal ions leached from the solid catalyst might contribute to the total catalytic activity 5 1 0 m cu no3 2 solution which had equivalent moles to 17 7 wt of cu loading in the rare earth oxides was used in wet oxidation of glucose experimental run to simulate the homogeneous catalyst of the active phase cu scenario this particular weight percentage of cu loading was chosen as it represented the highest percentage cu loading in the rare earth oxides and the extent of its effectiveness was studied 58 7 of cod conversion was achieved with a homogeneous cu catalyst 17 7 wt cu which is lower than the catalyst which had 17 7 wt cu loaded in it however the homogeneous cu catalyst exhibited a higher percentage cod reduction compared to all the pure rare earth oxide powders this observation aids in explaining that homogeneous cu cations in the reaction medium are quite potent of themselves in acting as a catalyst in this reaction therefore improvement in the catalytic performance of rare earth oxide catalysts could be due to the coupled effect of the changes in the structure of rare earth oxides after doping and the leached cu in the reaction medium the increasing formation of acetic acid as a function of the reaction time depicted in fig 6 indicates that the reaction medium is becoming increasingly acidic over the course of the 1 h long experimental run the phenomenon is probably due to the intermediate acids produced in the reaction medium metal oxides that can form soluble salts in the presence of acids especially nitric sulfuric or hydrochloric acid may cause leaching due to chemical transformation 53 although the aforementioned acids were not produced in the wet oxidation reaction of glucose the active phase cuo still has a high likelihood of being susceptible to the other acids produced by the reaction hence succumbing to the effects of leaching and causing the heterogeneous catalysts to be deactivated the results from xrd analysis of the 1 0 m cuo ceo2 catalyst showed that the catalyst did not undergo any observable phase transformation after being used in the wet oxidation reaction of glucose no cu or cuo peaks were observed in this sample prior to wet oxidation due to the low amount as described previously so it is not possible to determine any changes due to leaching the fact that the ceria phase remained unchanged indicates that the ceo2 based catalysts were chemically stable xrd patterns of the 1 0 m cuo dy2o3 and 1 0 m cuo tb4o7 following wet oxidation are shown in fig 8 a c b c respectively which indicate that these catalysts have undergone a transformation during wet oxidation the dy2o3 and tb4o7 in the catalysts may have reacted with the intermediate acids produced in the wet oxidation reaction of glucose to become dy and tb based salts respectively this is apparent from the xrd results of the both these catalysts post wet oxidation as the peaks corresponding to dy2o3 and tb4o7 have disappeared and new peaks corresponding to the dy and tb based salts formation indicating that some degree of chemical transformation has occurred 4 conclusions among the three rare earth oxides investigated in this research ceo2 has shown the greatest potential in being catalyst support to cu in the wet oxidation of glucose process on a cod reduction per cu basis ceo2 showed the highest percentage of oxidizable organic matter degradation despite having the lowest amount of cu doped in it ceo2 based catalysts also remained chemically stable after being used in the chemical reaction while the other two rare earth oxides dy2o3 and tb4o7 reacted with the intermediate products and underwent a chemical transformation significant degradation of oxidizable organic matter was observed within 60 min of catalytic processing compared to that of non catalytic processing a maximum of 80 reduction in the oxidizable organic matter was obtained acetic acid was the dominant vfa produced at the end of the chemical reaction as acetic acid is a stable intermediate compound leaching was observed in all of the catalysts where most of the doped cu leached into the reaction solution indicating that incipient wetness impregnation is not the best method to prepare cu based heterogeneous catalysts using rare earth oxides as catalyst support declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest in the publication of this study
