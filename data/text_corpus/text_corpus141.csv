705,snow dynamics in alpine systems play an important role in water resources management one of the main variables that characterises the snowpack is snow cover area in this paper we present a novel methodology to assess the impact of climate change scenarios on snow cover area in alpine systems the methodology calibrates and validates a distributed cellular automata ca model potential climate change scenarios can be generated to feed the ca model in order to assess the potential impact of climate change on snow cover area the methodology has been applied to the sierra nevada mountain range in southern spain an area with a mediterranean climate which is valuable in terms of both its ecology and the tourism industry snow falls on the mountains from october to may but this snow season may vary in the future due to climate change we analysed the influence of elevation on the potential impact of climate change on the area covered by snow the size of the potential changes associated with climate change increase with elevation in the case of temperature and decrease in the case of precipitation these potential changes will modify snow dynamics causing an important reduction in the area covered by snow mean 60 4 for the future horizon considered 2071 2100 keywords cellular automata climate change snow cover area spanish sierra nevada 1 introduction climate change will modify the

2007 from the point of view of water resources an assessment of the impact of future potential climate change scenarios on snow is essential for appropriate water resources management barnett et al 2005 arnell and lloyd hughes 2013 accordingly assessments of snow cover area sca and potential changes to it become key to assessing climate change in alpine systems sca is one of the main variables that characterises the snow dynamic which is important for assessing water resources and their management snow water equivalent swe quantifies the availability of water in the snow pack if we want to obtain the swe in a certain area we need to estimate snow depth and the snow density in the domain with snow which is defined by the snow cover area sca several studies have been done to estimate snow depth using snow stakes e g kucerova and jenicek 2014 collados lara et al 2017 and snow density e g lopez moreno et al 2013 bormann et al 2013 with regard to sca various agencies have developed products to estimate sca based on satellite data e g rutgers university global snow lab which uses noaa satellite data nasa distributed active archive centre which uses modis satellite data but sometimes we need information that covers a longer period or with higher spatiotemporal resolution to assess operational issues where such remote sensing data is available sca estimates can be directly used as input for hydrological models e g thirel et al 2013 mir et al 2015 elsewhere however sca data may be unavailable or have too crude a spatial resolution to assess the operational issues in question moreover satellite data may be useless during certain periods if cloud cover obscures the view or if there has been a sensor failure ackerman et al 1998 schmugge et al 2002 in such cases alternative tools or models are required to estimate sca to date sca has been analysed using various procedures including physically based models molotch et al 2004 warscher et al 2013 regression techniques richer et al 2013 mir et al 2015 artificial neural networks hou and huang 2014 mishra et al 2014 and cellular automata ca models leguizamón 2006 pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 cellular automata ca are infinite regular lattices of simple finite state machines that change their states synchronously according to a local update rule that specifies the new state of each cell based on the former states of its neighbours wolfram 1984 kari 2005 ca models were first described by wolfram 1983 to simulate complex dynamics using simple rules of interaction between cells that discretize the area of interest in this paper we apply ca models to the field of hydrology and in particular the role of sca in water resources availability since ca models are capable of capturing the dynamics of sca moreover there is great potential for using calibrated and validated ca models to estimate sca in periods where no sca data are available nevertheless to date few studies have addressed this issue leguizamón 2006 undertook a preliminary study though this involved significant limitations these limitations were pinpointed and overcome by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 in a study that extended the idea of using ca models to estimate sca they proposed a novel algorithm to estimate sca based on the state of the cell during the previous time step the states of a given configuration of neighbouring cells at the previous time step and a set of transition rules these transition rules involve unique precipitation p and temperature t indices driving variables for the entire mountain range classic ca models do not require driving variables but they are needed in order to simulate realistic snow dynamics pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 the climatic indices of the aforementioned ca models can be defined using potential future climatic scenarios of precipitation and temperature in order to assess potential future impacts on the target variable potential scenarios of precipitation and temperature can be obtained using statistical correction techniques applied to simulations performed using different regional climatic models rcm chen et al 2013 2014 these models have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometres and they are nested inside general circulation models gcm with spatial resolutions of hundreds of kilometres generally rcms cannot be applied directly to assess climate change because they show significant bias with respect to historical time series cook et al 2008 seager et al 2008 appropriate corrections are required to analyse the potential impacts of climate change in a particular system collados lara et al 2018 statistical corrections can be applied using one of two conceptual approaches bias correction or delta change depending on the series used to perform the transformation function räty et al 2014 sunyer et al 2015 bias correction approaches apply a correction to the control simulations of rcm in order to fit them to a historical series then they assume the same biases for the future period in question e g piani et al 2010 watanabe et al 2012 meanwhile delta change approaches assume that the difference between control and future simulations of rcm are valid and then use these differences deltas to correct the historical series in order to obtain potential future scenarios e g pulido velazquez et al 2011 2015 räisänen and räty 2012 in this paper we propose a systematic methodology to estimate sca dynamics in alpine systems that contains two new innovations 1 the development of a spatially distributed ca model for driving variables and parameters to estimate sca and 2 the use of the calibrated distributed ca model to assess the impacts of potential climate change scenarios on snowpack to achieve this we have extended the algorithm proposed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 to obtain a distributed approach with spatially distributed climatic indexes and spatially distributed parameters we test different approaches to search for the optimal parameters and use spatially distributed indices to calibrate the ca algorithm the calibrated ca models can then be fed with future potential precipitation and temperature scenarios in order to assess the expected changes in sca the proposed methodology is applied to a mediterranean alpine system where changes due to climate change are expected to be significant however the method is general and could be applied to any alpine system for different purposes the assessment of spatial and quantity changes in sca are crucial to water resources management and ecosystem impact assessments beniston 2003 edwards et al 2007 thus this tool has great potential to be used in operational environmental management due to its ability to estimate and predict the potential impacts of climate change on sca on the other hand this tool could be useful to meteorological forecasts in alpine systems since albedo is an important variable in numerical weather prediction models and is closely related to sca yucel 2006 moody et al 2008 2 methodology in this work we propose a method for performing a sensitivity analysis of the sca dynamic in potential future climate scenarios assuming steady land use land cover lulc in the historical and future scenarios it is based on the ca model developed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 which uses five parameters and two driving variables p and t to estimate sca this relatively simple approach can be used in cases where daily sca precipitation and temperature data are available for calibration but where only precipitation and temperature are available in the operational mode the model estimates sca as one of two possible binary states in each cell snow cover represented by 1 or no snow cover represented by 0 it uses a set of interaction rules that involve the parameters driving variables precipitation p temperature t and elevation h and approaches to the interaction between neighbouring cells the parameters to be calibrated in this ca model are p 0 is a precipitation threshold a and b are the intercept and the slope that define the straight line that represents the discretized snowline the altitude above which the terrain can have snow tc is a temperature threshold and nm is the threshold in the number of neighbour cells that produce a change in the cell state in this study we propose calibrating the parameters in a distributed fashion in accordance with some climatic zones they are areas in which we assume homogeneous climate conditions p and t and parameters of the ca model those climatic zones k are discretized in cells i j to perform simulations with the objective of determining the state of the cell 0 if it is free of snow and 1 if it is covered by snow following the below transition rules 1 if p k t p 0 k and h i j hs k t then s i j t 1 2 if p k t p 0 k a if t k t t k t 1 tc k 0 then s i j t s i j t 1 b if t k t t k t 1 tc k 0 then i if s i j t 1 0 then s i j t 0 ii if s i j t 1 1 then i if n i j t nm k then s i j t 0 ii if n i j t nm k then s i j t 1 where hs k t is the elevation of the snowline for climatic zone k and day t defined as hs k t a k b k t k t and n i j t is the number of neighbour cells with s i j t 1 1 considering a neighbourhood of 24 cells in which all the cells are close enough to have the same influence on cell state note that rules a and b could be replaced by more global rules in order to have a more physical explanation as follows a if t k t tc k 0 then s i j t s i j t 1 b if t k t tc k 0 then i if s i j t 1 0 then s i j t 0 ii if s i j t 1 1 then i if n i j t nm k then s i j t 0 ii if n i j t nm k then s i j t 1 the main rule that defines the accumulation of snow in the ca model depends on the precipitation threshold and the snowline the snowline is the altitude above which the terrain can have snow and it is approached by a straight line defined by parameters a and b and the temperature it varies with the time and the climatic zone if the elevation of a cell is above the snowline elevation and precipitation is sufficient the state of the cell will be 1 snow covered the other two parameters tc and nm are related to the snow melt processes when a pixel at state 1 changes to state 0 a higher temperature with respect to the previous day rules a and b or with respect to the global threshold rules a and b are related to snowmelt in the same way a lower number of neighbour cells with snow is also related to snowmelt that is a large number of neighbour cells with snow imply more inertia in the cell to continue with the same state i e with snow while a small number of neighbour cells with snow implies that the cell is close to the border of the snowpack and has less inertia to change to the non snow state in the model proposed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 the search for the parameters optimal values in the calibration phase is done by varying one parameter and leaving the remaining ones fixed in this study we have modified the algorithm to vary all parameters simultaneously an initial range of three values for each parameter is defined then the ranges of all parameters are moved simultaneously until the optimal value is located in the middle of the range the set of values yielding the minimum mean squared error mse between the experimental and simulated sca for the calibration period are chosen as the best parameters ca models are distributed if the driving variables and parameters are distributed spatially or lumped if unique indices and parameters are used for the entire mountain range in order to test distributed approaches the calibration of a previous lumped ca model is used as a first iteration to identify and select the best driving variables and define the set up or initial values of parameters for the distributed case the numerical experiment that uses lumped series and parameters allows several driving variables and parameters to be tested simultaneously and due to its low computational cost saves time compared to setting up the distributed case from zero the optimal parameters for the lumped case provide an idea of the interval ranges to be used in the distributed case for the distributed cases climatic indices p and t can be defined over a grid containing different climatic zones this grid can have a resolution that is the same or coarser than the sca grid a semi distributed case can be developed if we use distributed climatic indices and lumped parameters the computational cost of distributed approaches depends on the resolution of the grids if a fine calculation grid is chosen in which several climatic zones are defined the search for optimal parameters can be done in two phases in order to avoid excessive calculation times for the algorithm some parameters can be fixed in the first phase according the results of the lumped case then varied in the second phase different distributed variants can be tested with respect to the driving variables the climatic indices of each climatic zone can be used as driving variables for that climatic zone or for the whole mountain range and the domain of minimization parameters can be calibrated by minimising the mse for each climatic zone in the entire mountain range these different configurations need to be tested for each case study in order to find the best results in the calibration and validation phases with respect to the uncertainties of the ca model it should be noted that the architecture of the ca is not probabilistic and thus it is impossible to evaluate the intrinsic uncertainty of the model this uncertainty can be decreased by improving the approach provided in the initial ca model uncertainty in the parameters could be evaluated by considering the following assumptions 1 the calibration process where the mean square error is minimised can be seen as a least squares estimation procedure 2 the parameters are going to be considered as a set of joint gaussian variables 3 given 2 the estimation procedure in 1 is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation 4 an approximate variance covariance matrix c assuming a gaussian distribution of the parameters is estimated by standard nonlinear inversion theory menke 1984 1 c j t γ 1 j 1 where j is the jacobian or sensitivity matrix evaluated at the generalised least square estimates and γ is the identity matrix multiplied by the mse in the validation period on the other hand the uncertainty of the ca model outputs can be quantified by considering the mse of the calibration period to be the variance in the validation period this procedure allows for a representation of the uncertainty interval sca estimate σ sca estimate σ for the validation period and for a comparison of the number of days with experimental data within this interval to the theoretical value assuming a gaussian distribution 68 the ca model presented in this study only considers three driving variables elevation which can be considered constant for the temporal scale used in hydrological studies and precipitation and temperature which can be varied in accordance with climate change scenarios calibrated ca models allow the impact of potential climate change scenarios on sca to be assessed using the future series generated for the driving variables selected also if we consider distributed ca models the spatial variation of climate change can be incorporated into the study note that the ca model presented is only able to assess the potential impacts of climate change due to precipitation and temperature rcms have significant bias with respect to the historical series statistical correction techniques e g first moment correction second moment correction regression quantile mapping can be used to reduce this bias bias correction and delta change correction techniques can be applied to the rcm to obtain the future precipitation and temperature series in this study we apply both bias and delta change approaches the second moment correction technique is used in both cases this technique corrects both mean and standard deviation to define the transformation function we applied the transformation function proposed by pulido velazquez et al 2011 for the delta change method ensembles of the future series are proposed to obtain more representative potential future climate scenarios we used equi feasible solutions considering all rcm simulations for the bias correction and delta change methods the future precipitation and temperature series generated were used as input for the selected distributed ca model previously calibrated to assess the potential changes in sca 3 application to the case study and data employed 3 1 case study our case study is the sierra nevada mountain range in southern spain see fig 1 a it extends over 80 km is between 15 and 30 km wide and covers more than 2000 km2 it includes the highest point on the iberian peninsula mulhacén peak which is 3478 6 m a s l the sierra nevada enjoys a high mountain mediterranean climate with relatively dry summers and wetter winters during which the majority of precipitation falls as snow thus snowfall dynamics are essential to the availability of water in the sierra nevada catchments the study of these dynamics and future potential changes in sca is a key issue for the region from the point of view of the ski industry which is an important economic driver but also from a water resources standpoint this study proposes a new methodology than could provide useful knowledge about the future impacts of climate change on sensitive high altitude landscapes such as in this case of the alpine mountains of the spanish sierra nevada in our case study lulc changes in the historical period employed for the calibration are not very significant note that the area of interest in this study is an alpine area where forest canopy is scarce fig 1b assessing sca dynamics in forested areas is more difficult due to the interaction between snow and vegetation and therefore it would be necessary to assess the suitability of the proposed method in these cases see section 4 3 2 application to the case study the ca model considered requires an input of sca data which can be collected from satellite images in our case study the experimental sca data were taken from a modis satellite product we used the modis terra snow cover daily global 500 m grid data set id mod10a1 which has a spatial resolution of approximately 460 m for the latitude of the study area and a temporal resolution of 1 day the sca data were transformed to binary codes 1 covered by snow 0 snow free the grid used by this product was also used for the calculations there are around 4100 cells in a 460 m 460 m grid inside the area of interest fig 1 the ca model also requires climatic indices p and t as driving variables these were obtained from the spain02 project dataset herrera et al 2012 2016 the spain02 dataset contains daily temperature maximum mean and minimum and precipitation estimates from historical data around 2500 monitoring stations collected by the spanish meteorological agency over the period 1971 2010 we used version 4 v4 of the spain02 project dataset http www meteo unican es en datasets spain02 which includes daily field estimates with a spatial resolution of approximately 12 5 km using the euro cordex grid in the case study we have defined the climatic zones introduced in the previous section using the euro cordex grid see fig 1 the parameters and driving variables depend on the climatic zones in the distributed cases we applied the modified algorithm varying the parameters simultaneously to a three year timespan the calibration period was 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2003 whilst the validation period was 1 july 2003 to 30 june 2006 we have selected these periods due to the availability of data but a comparison between different periods could be useful in order to assess the impact of selecting adjacent years for the case study we have tested different numerical experiments approaches with respect to the spatial distribution of driving variables and parameters lumped or distributed the tested variables different variables and elevation thresholds the calibration procedure minimization of error and searching for optimal parameters and temperature threshold global or linked to the previous day all of these numerical experiments are summarised in the following lines as a first approach we tested lumped driving variables mean precipitation and maximum mean and minimum temperatures above 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 m a s l numerical experiment a1 fig 2 shows the mse for the various combinations of elevations and variables from numerical experiment a1 we selected precipitation and maximum temperature above 1000 m as the driving variables better approximations were obtained in the sense that a smaller mse was achieved than for numerical experiment aa performed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 mse of 259 750 cells² versus 264 896 cells² while the validation results were slightly worse mse of 457 804 cells² versus 451 212 cells² the optimal parameters obtained for numerical experiment a1 were p 0 6 8 a 1140 b 80 tc 0 nm 14 while for numerical experiment aa the results were p 0 6 8 a 1170 b 80 tc 0 nm 14 also this lumped ca approach numerical experiment a1 has been compared to a logistic regression alternative for this application we considered the same explanatory variables as in the ca approach the logistic regression provided worse results mse of 571 406 cells² in the calibration case and 1019 121 cells² in the validation case underestimating sca in winter and overestimating sca in summer note that techniques based on regression are performed using the mean of the dependent and independent variables therefore they are more sensitive to outliers and less able to capture spatiotemporal variability in addition the absence of snow in summer is not properly approached by the regression model therefore the ca methodology provides better approximations than standard regression approaches for these reasons the great interest in studying distributed numerical ca solutions is justified the variables selected for numerical experiment a1 were used as driving variables for all the distributed numerical experiments a2 d1 d2 d3 in these distributed numerical experiments the parameters nm and tc from numerical experiment a1 remained fixed while the remainder were varied due to the high computational cost of the distributed approaches nevertheless in a subsequent procedure these parameters were also calibrated for the numerical experiment that had the best results in the first stage numerical experiment d2 produced the best results so a second numerical experiment d2 1 was performed based on d2 now varying nm and tc and having all other variables remain fixed this numerical experiment yielded an improvement with respect to the lumped approach developed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 6 6 mse for the calibration period and 10 1 mse for the validation period like pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 in the current study we tested the possibility of using an absolute temperature threshold instead of a threshold that depends on the previous day rules a and b of the formulation because it seems to be more reasonable physically numerical experiments d4 and d4 1 but the approximations obtained were poorer than in pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 table 1 shows a summary of the ca model numerical experiments performed and their results in light of the results numerical experiment d2 1 was selected to perform the next analysis in this numerical experiment the ca parameters were calibrated by minimising the mse for each climatic zone where the driving variables are defined euro cordex grid for each climatic zone we calibrated the ca model using the climatological indices of the climatic zone as driving variables for the entire mountain range we repeated this procedure for all climatic zones in order to obtain distributed parameters the optimal value of the parameters in the various climatic zones was plotted against the mean elevation of each climatic zone in order to test for possible correlations fig 3 all parameters with the exception of tc show significant correlations to elevation parameters p 0 a and b increase with elevation while nm decreases when the ca model is applied using these parameters the best estimated dynamics of daily sca are obtained this configuration shows the lowest mse which implies the smallest differences between estimated and experimental sca in order to assess the performance of the ca model we calculated the sca for each day for the entire mountain range and the experimental and estimated datasets these results are shown in fig 4 in general extreme snowfall events are underestimated but general sca dynamics are captured we further calculated the number of cells where snow cover exceeded 5 15 25 and 35 of days in order to assess the spatial distribution of snowfall fig 5 shows that experimental and estimated sca have a very similar pattern thus we demonstrate that the ca model applied is able to reproduce the spatial dynamics of sca for the calibration period in the same way the validation results are shown in figs 6 and 7 again the temporal sca dynamics are captured but extreme snowfall events are underestimated we have also compared the estimates to experimental data cell by cell for the calibration and validation data obtaining the failure probability of the ca model in two situations errors when the cell is covered and when there is no snow see fig 8 note that the model is more likely to fail when the cell is covered by snow s i j t 1 at lower elevations where snow dynamics change more quickly from the point of view of water resources quantification these errors are not very important because at those elevations snow thickness is lower with respect to spatial distribution the probability of failure is similar for the two periods and the two cases snow covered or snow free furthermore we have evaluated the uncertainty of parameters using the procedure explained in section 2 eq 1 for the lumped ca model the standard deviations of the calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 the uncertainty of the ca model outputs has been quantified by considering the mse of the calibration period as explained in section 2 the experimental data and the uncertainty interval defined by estimates standard deviations of sca are shown in fig 9 for the case study on 69 1 of the days the experimental data are within the uncertainty interval this value is similar to the theoretical value assuming a gaussian distribution represented by 68 as noted in the methodology section the climate change information used to generate potential future scenarios can be taken from the rcm in our case study we used nine rcms from the cordex project 2013 we selected the most pessimistic emissions scenario of the project representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp8 5 table 3 shows the rcms used and the gcm in which they are nested we considered the historical period 1971 2000 and the future period 2071 2100 to perform the statistical transformations used to generate the potential future scenarios the method was systematically applied to all cells of the euro cordex grid inside the study area to obtain the future precipitation and maximum temperature series the driving variables selected for the ca model we considered two precipitation and temperature climate change scenarios depending on which approach was employed delta change e1 or bias correction e2 these two scenarios e1 and e2 are equi feasible solutions obtained from the nine rcms considered these two future scenarios are used as the driving variables for the calibrated ca model in order to obtain potential future scenarios of snow cover area due to climate change an example of the precipitation and temperature time series generated for a particular cell is presented in fig 10 there is a significant reduction in precipitation and a significant increase in temperature the means of the series generated for the two scenarios are similar in the case of precipitation and the same in the case of maximum temperature theoretically the means must be the same in the two scenarios even though the time series are different so that the two scenarios have different behaviour when they are fed into the ca model however in the case of precipitation the small differences are due to negative values generated in the statistical process that are corrected to zero in order to evaluate potential climate change spatially we calculated the relative changes in precipitation and maximum temperature for all cells plotting them with respect to elevation see fig 11 fig 11 shows that climate change leads to an increase in maximum temperature and a decrease in precipitation with elevation so in this alpine system the potential climate change will be greater in the case of temperature and smaller in the case of precipitation for higher elevations the ca model was fed with the series generated for the two scenarios this yielded significant reductions in sca 59 0 for e1 and 61 7 for e2 the size of the reduction depends on the month table 4 figs 12 and 13 shows the mean monthly and daily historical and future sca respectively graphically we verified that potential reductions in sca are highly significant fig 14 shows the cells with snow cover on more than 5 15 25 and 35 of days for the historical and future potential scenarios again the potential reductions are significant 4 limitations and future research it should be noted that when hydrological models especially those defined at a regional scale covering an extensive area with heterogeneous conditions as in our case are employed to simulate conditions and that are very different from those used to calibrate and validate the model uncertainty in the assessment increases for this reason all the models should be validated again when new information is available this occurs even with physical hydrological models e g groundwater flow models rainfall runoff models etc our model although it is not based on such physical models provides coherent solutions with the capability to predict very extreme conditions for example if snow is not present it does not show any values of sca nevertheless as explained above in all models uncertainty grows when they are used to simulate very different conditions the patterns and variability of future climate conditions may be considerably different from the historical current climate data used to calibrate and validate the model s parameters the model s rules in our approach ipcc 2007 2013 however despite the inevitable uncertainty in predicting the impact of climate change an uncertainty that also exists in many other aspects analysed by the scientific community both within physical and non physical processes and which is also inherent to the definition of potential climate change scenarios there is a clear need to provide a quantitative assessment of potential hydrological impacts this will allow scientists to rationally evaluate potential adaptation strategies for maintaining sustainable management of water resources systems which may be very vulnerable to climate change due to the importance to society of understanding the potential impacts of climate change although there may be uncertainties involved in this impact assessment scientific production on this issue is very relevant e g brown and mote 2009 vorosmarty et al 2000 in this work we assume a steady lulc in historical and future scenarios in order to perform a sensitivity analysis of the sca dynamics to potential future climate scenarios therefore representative sca results can be provided for long term future climate periods if we assume that lulc will remain quite similar to its historical data or that the changes do not have an important influence on the snow dynamic the ca model has been calibrated and validated with p and t time series from recent years and it only requires p and t time series in order to assess the impact on the future evolution of sca suppose we take the p and t time series projected for the year 2100 there will be on average less rainfall and higher temperatures suppose that these time series are taken to be the record from a recent abnormally dry and hot year we would think that the output of the model is valid for this recent year although we are using the projections for the year 2100 thus as long as we assume that the calibration is robust in accordance with the validation performed and make the hypothesis that the parameters rules in our approach will remain invariable in the future as they depend on p and t only because topographic parameters may be considered constant at a timescale of one hundred years the use of ca will be valid for addressing sca dynamics in the future the spatial change in the global circulation of the atmosphere has already been taken into account in the p and t time series projections for the future new research would be needed to use the same ca model to study a historical period with significant lulc changes or to simulate potential future impacts that also include future lulc changes most likely such models would need to include other spatial variables influenced by lulc in the rules additionally different parameter sets can lead to similar responses in the sca dynamics principle of equifinality the analysis of parameters in this deterministic model cannot be used to draw conclusions about the factors that influence snow dynamics as a future line of research a new approach would be required to perform a more complete analysis of the factors that influence sca combining stochastic and physical based models 5 conclusions a ca model to estimate sca has been calibrated and validated with good results for the sierra nevada mountain range southern spain we implemented several lumped and distributed numerical experiments varying the driving variables algorithm parameters minimisation procedure search for optimal parameters and temperature based on a lumped ca model developed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 the best implementation numerical experiment d2 1 reduced the mse by 6 6 and 10 1 in the calibration and validation periods respectively compared to the initial lumped ca model subsequently we used this best ca model numerical experiment to assess the impacts of climate change on snow cover dynamics using future precipitation and temperature scenarios as driving variables when the relative changes in the future precipitation and maximum temperature time series generated with respect to the historical series are plotted against mean elevation in each grid we conclude that in this alpine case study potential climate change at higher altitudes will result in higher temperatures and lower precipitation the future series generated was used as an input for the calibrated ca model leading to the worrying result that there will be a drastic reduction in snow cover area in the future using the future precipitation and temperature scenarios as driving variables for the period 2071 2100 we obtain a significant reduction in snow cover area using the calibrated ca model 59 0 for e1 and 61 7 for e2 thus the distributed ca developed is proved to be a useful tool for predicting the future evolution of snowpack this tool can be applied to various management tasks including water resources management operational river forecasts and landscape

705,snow dynamics in alpine systems play an important role in water resources management one of the main variables that characterises the snowpack is snow cover area in this paper we present a novel

vary in the future due to climate change we analysed the influence of elevation on the potential impact of climate change on the area covered by snow the size of the potential changes associated with climate change increase with elevation in the case of temperature and decrease in the case of precipitation these potential changes will modify snow dynamics causing an important reduction in the area

depth using snow stakes e g kucerova and jenicek 2014 collados lara et al 2017 and snow density e g lopez moreno et al 2013 bormann et al 2013 with regard to sca various agencies have developed products to estimate sca based on satellite data e g rutgers university global snow lab which uses noaa satellite data nasa distributed active archive centre which uses modis satellite data but sometimes we need information that covers a longer period or with higher spatiotemporal resolution to assess operational issues where such remote sensing data is available sca estimates can be directly used as input for hydrological models e g thirel et al 2013 mir et al 2015 elsewhere however sca data may be unavailable or have too crude a spatial resolution to assess the operational issues in question moreover satellite data may be useless during certain periods if cloud cover obscures the view or if there has been a sensor failure ackerman et al 1998 schmugge et al 2002 in such cases alternative tools or models are required to estimate sca to date sca has been analysed using various procedures including physically based models molotch et al 2004 warscher et al 2013 regression techniques richer et al 2013 mir et al 2015 artificial neural networks hou and huang 2014 mishra et al 2014 and cellular automata ca models leguizamón 2006 pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 cellular automata ca are infinite regular lattices of simple finite state machines that change their states synchronously according to a local update rule that specifies the new state of each cell based on the former states of its neighbours wolfram 1984 kari 2005 ca models were first described by wolfram 1983 to simulate complex dynamics using simple rules of interaction between cells that discretize the area of interest in this paper we apply ca models to the field of hydrology and in particular the role of sca in water resources availability since ca models are capable of capturing the dynamics of sca moreover there is great potential for using calibrated and validated ca models to estimate sca in periods where no sca data are available nevertheless to date few studies have addressed this issue leguizamón 2006 undertook a preliminary study though this involved significant limitations these limitations were pinpointed and overcome by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 in a study that extended the idea of using ca models to estimate sca they proposed a novel algorithm to estimate sca based on the state of the cell during the previous time step the states of a given configuration of neighbouring cells at the previous time step and a set of transition rules these transition rules involve unique precipitation p and temperature t indices driving variables for the entire mountain range classic ca models do not require driving variables but they are needed in order to simulate realistic snow dynamics pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 the climatic indices of the aforementioned ca models can be defined using potential future climatic scenarios of precipitation and temperature in order to assess potential future impacts on the target variable potential scenarios of precipitation and temperature can be obtained using statistical correction techniques applied to simulations performed using different regional climatic models rcm chen et al 2013 2014 these models have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometres and they are nested inside general circulation models gcm with spatial resolutions of hundreds of kilometres generally rcms cannot be applied directly to assess climate change because they show significant bias with respect to historical time series cook et al 2008 seager et al 2008 appropriate corrections are required to analyse the potential impacts of climate change in a particular system collados lara et al 2018 statistical corrections can be applied using one of two conceptual approaches bias correction or delta change depending on the series used to perform the transformation function räty et al 2014 sunyer et al 2015 bias correction approaches apply a correction to the control simulations of rcm in order to fit them to a historical series then they assume the same biases for the future period in question e g piani et al 2010 watanabe et al 2012 meanwhile delta change approaches assume that the difference between control and future simulations of rcm are valid and then use these differences deltas to correct the historical series in order to obtain potential future scenarios e g pulido velazquez et al 2011 2015 räisänen and räty 2012 in this paper we propose a systematic methodology to estimate sca dynamics in alpine systems that contains two new innovations 1 the development of a spatially distributed ca model for driving variables and parameters to estimate sca and 2 the use of the calibrated distributed ca model to assess the impacts of potential climate change scenarios on snowpack to achieve this we have extended the algorithm proposed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 to obtain a distributed approach with spatially distributed climatic indexes and spatially distributed parameters we test different approaches to search for the optimal parameters and use spatially distributed indices to calibrate the ca algorithm the calibrated ca models can then be fed with future potential precipitation and temperature scenarios in order to assess the expected changes in sca the proposed methodology is applied to a mediterranean alpine system where changes due to climate change are expected to be significant however the method is general and could be applied to any alpine system for different purposes the assessment of spatial and quantity changes in sca are crucial to water resources management and ecosystem impact assessments beniston 2003 edwards et al 2007 thus this tool has great potential to be used in operational environmental management due to its ability to estimate and predict the potential impacts of climate change on sca on the other hand this tool could be useful to meteorological forecasts in alpine systems since albedo is an important variable in numerical weather prediction models and is closely related to sca yucel 2006 moody et al 2008 2 methodology in this work we propose a method for performing a sensitivity analysis of the sca dynamic in potential future climate scenarios assuming steady land use land cover lulc in the historical and future scenarios it is based on the ca model developed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 which uses five parameters and two driving variables p and t to estimate sca this relatively simple approach can be used in cases where daily sca precipitation and temperature data are available for calibration but where only precipitation and temperature are available in the operational mode the model estimates sca as one of two possible binary states in each cell snow cover represented by 1 or no snow cover represented by 0 it uses a set of interaction rules that involve the parameters driving variables precipitation p temperature t and elevation h and approaches to the interaction between neighbouring cells the parameters to be calibrated in this ca model are p 0 is a precipitation threshold a and b are the intercept and the slope that define the straight line that represents the discretized snowline the altitude above which the terrain can have snow tc is a temperature threshold and nm is the threshold in the number of neighbour cells that produce a change in the cell state in this study we propose calibrating the parameters in a distributed fashion in accordance with some climatic zones they are areas in which we assume homogeneous climate conditions p and t and parameters of the ca model those climatic zones k are discretized in cells i j to perform simulations with the objective of determining the state of the cell 0 if it is free of snow and 1 if it is covered by snow following the below transition rules 1 if p k t p 0 k and h i j hs k t then s i j t 1 2 if p k t p 0 k a if t k t t k t 1 tc k 0 then s i j t s i j t 1 b if t k t t k t 1 tc k 0 then i if s i j t 1 0 then s i j t 0 ii if s i j t 1 1 then i if n i j t nm k then s i j t 0 ii if n i j t nm k then s i j t 1 where hs k t is the elevation of the snowline for climatic zone k and day t defined as hs k t a k b k t k t and n i j t is the number of neighbour cells with s i j t 1 1 considering a neighbourhood of 24 cells in which all the cells are close enough to have the same influence on cell state note that rules a and b could be replaced by more global rules in order to have a more physical explanation as follows a if t k t tc k 0 then s i j t s i j t 1 b if t k t tc k 0 then i if s i j t 1 0 then s i j t 0 ii if s i j t 1 1 then i if n i j t nm k then s i j t 0 ii if n i j t nm k then s i j t 1 the main rule that defines the accumulation of snow in the ca model depends on the precipitation threshold and the snowline the snowline is the altitude above which the terrain can have snow and it is approached by a straight line defined by parameters a and b and the temperature it varies with the time and the climatic zone if the elevation of a cell is above the snowline elevation and precipitation is sufficient the state of the cell will be 1 snow covered the other two parameters tc and nm are related to the snow melt processes when a pixel at state 1 changes to state 0 a higher temperature with respect to the previous day rules a and b or with respect to the global threshold rules a and b are related to snowmelt in the same way a lower number of neighbour cells with snow is also related to snowmelt that is a large number of neighbour cells with snow imply more inertia in the cell to continue with the same state i e with snow while a small number of neighbour cells with snow implies that the cell is close to the border of the snowpack and has less inertia to change to the non snow state in the model proposed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 the search for the parameters optimal values in the calibration phase is done by varying one parameter and leaving the remaining ones fixed in this study we have modified the algorithm to vary all parameters simultaneously an initial range of three values for each parameter is defined then the ranges of all parameters are moved simultaneously until the optimal value is located in the middle of the range the set of values yielding the minimum mean squared error mse between the experimental and simulated sca for the calibration period are chosen as the best parameters ca models are distributed if the driving variables and parameters are distributed spatially or lumped if unique indices and parameters are used for the entire mountain range in order to test distributed approaches the calibration of a previous lumped ca model is used as a first iteration to identify and select the best driving variables and define the set up or initial values of parameters for the distributed case the numerical experiment that uses lumped series and parameters allows several driving variables and parameters to be tested simultaneously and due to its low computational cost saves time compared to setting up the distributed case from zero the optimal parameters for the lumped case provide an idea of the interval ranges to be used in the distributed case for the distributed cases climatic indices p and t can be defined over a grid containing different climatic zones this grid can have a resolution that is the same or coarser than the sca grid a semi distributed case can be developed if we use distributed climatic indices and lumped parameters the computational cost of distributed approaches depends on the resolution of the grids if a fine calculation grid is chosen in which several climatic zones are defined the search for optimal parameters can be done in two phases in order to avoid excessive calculation times for the algorithm some parameters can be fixed in the first phase according the results of the lumped case then varied in the second phase different distributed variants can be tested with respect to the driving variables the climatic indices of each climatic zone can be used as driving variables for that climatic zone or for the whole mountain range and the domain of minimization parameters can be calibrated by minimising the mse for each climatic zone in the entire mountain range these different configurations need to be tested for each case study in order to find the best results in the calibration and validation phases with respect to the uncertainties of the ca model it should be noted that the architecture of the ca is not probabilistic and thus it is impossible to evaluate the intrinsic uncertainty of the model this uncertainty can be decreased by improving the approach provided in the initial ca model uncertainty in the parameters could be evaluated by considering the following assumptions 1 the calibration process where the mean square error is minimised can be seen as a least squares estimation procedure 2 the parameters are going to be considered as a set of joint gaussian variables 3 given 2 the estimation procedure in 1 is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimation 4 an approximate variance covariance matrix c assuming a gaussian distribution of the parameters is estimated by standard nonlinear inversion theory menke 1984 1 c j t γ 1 j 1 where j is the jacobian or sensitivity matrix evaluated at the generalised least square estimates and γ is the identity matrix multiplied by the mse in the validation period on the other hand the uncertainty of the ca model outputs can be quantified by considering the mse of the calibration period to be the variance in the validation period this procedure allows for a representation of the uncertainty interval sca estimate σ sca estimate σ for the validation period and for a comparison of the number of days with experimental data within this interval to the theoretical value assuming a gaussian distribution 68 the ca model presented in this study only considers three driving variables elevation which can be considered constant for the temporal scale used in hydrological studies and precipitation and temperature which can be varied in accordance with climate change scenarios calibrated ca models allow the impact of potential climate change scenarios on sca to be assessed using the future series generated for the driving variables selected also if we consider distributed ca models the spatial variation of climate change can be incorporated into the study note that the ca model presented is only able to assess the potential impacts of climate change due to precipitation and temperature rcms have significant bias with respect to the historical series statistical correction techniques e g first moment correction second moment correction regression quantile mapping can be used to reduce this bias bias correction and delta change correction techniques can be applied to the rcm to obtain the future precipitation and temperature series in this study we apply both bias and delta change approaches the second moment correction technique is used in both cases this technique corrects both mean and standard deviation to define the transformation function we applied the transformation function proposed by pulido velazquez et al 2011 for the delta change method ensembles of the future series are proposed to obtain more representative potential future climate scenarios we used equi feasible solutions considering all rcm simulations for the bias correction and delta change methods the future precipitation and temperature series generated were used as input for the selected distributed ca model previously calibrated to assess the potential changes in sca 3 application to the case study and data employed 3 1 case study our case study is the sierra nevada mountain range in southern spain see fig 1 a it extends over 80 km is between 15 and 30 km wide and covers more than 2000 km2 it includes the highest point on the iberian peninsula mulhacén peak which is 3478 6 m a s l the sierra nevada enjoys a high mountain mediterranean climate with relatively dry summers and wetter winters during which the majority of precipitation falls as snow thus snowfall dynamics are essential to the availability of water in the sierra nevada catchments the study of these dynamics and future potential changes in sca is a key issue for the region from the point of view of the ski industry which is an important economic driver but also from a water resources standpoint this study proposes a new methodology than could provide useful knowledge about the future impacts of climate change on sensitive high altitude landscapes such as in this case of the alpine mountains of the spanish sierra nevada in our case study lulc changes in the historical period employed for the calibration are not very significant note that the area of interest in this study is an alpine area where forest canopy is scarce fig 1b assessing sca dynamics in forested areas is more difficult due to the interaction between snow and vegetation and therefore it would be necessary to assess the suitability of the proposed method in these cases see section 4 3 2 application to the case study the ca model considered requires an input of sca data which can be collected from satellite images in our case study the experimental sca data were taken from a modis satellite product we used the modis terra snow cover daily global 500 m grid data set id mod10a1 which has a spatial resolution of approximately 460 m for the latitude of the study area and a temporal resolution of 1 day the sca data were transformed to binary codes 1 covered by snow 0 snow free the grid used by this product was also used for the calculations there are around 4100 cells in a 460 m 460 m grid inside the area of interest fig 1 the ca model also requires climatic indices p and t as driving variables these were obtained from the spain02 project dataset herrera et al 2012 2016 the spain02 dataset contains daily temperature maximum mean and minimum and precipitation estimates from historical data around 2500 monitoring stations collected by the spanish meteorological agency over the period 1971 2010 we used version 4 v4 of the spain02 project dataset http www meteo unican es en datasets spain02 which includes daily field estimates with a spatial resolution of approximately 12 5 km using the euro cordex grid in the case study we have defined the climatic zones introduced in the previous section using the euro cordex grid see fig 1 the parameters and driving variables depend on the climatic zones in the distributed cases we applied the modified algorithm varying the parameters simultaneously to a three year timespan the calibration period was 1 july 2000 to 30 june 2003 whilst the validation period was 1 july 2003 to 30 june 2006 we have selected these periods due to the availability of data but a comparison between different periods could be useful in order to assess the impact of selecting adjacent years for the case study we have tested different numerical experiments approaches with respect to the spatial distribution of driving variables and parameters lumped or distributed the tested variables different variables and elevation thresholds the calibration procedure minimization of error and searching for optimal parameters and temperature threshold global or linked to the previous day all of these numerical experiments are summarised in the following lines as a first approach we tested lumped driving variables mean precipitation and maximum mean and minimum temperatures above 1000 1500 2000 2500 and 3000 m a s l numerical experiment a1 fig 2 shows the mse for the various combinations of elevations and variables from numerical experiment a1 we selected precipitation and maximum temperature above 1000 m as the driving variables better approximations were obtained in the sense that a smaller mse was achieved than for numerical experiment aa performed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 mse of 259 750 cells² versus 264 896 cells² while the validation results were slightly worse mse of 457 804 cells² versus 451 212 cells² the optimal parameters obtained for numerical experiment a1 were p 0 6 8 a 1140 b 80 tc 0 nm 14 while for numerical experiment aa the results were p 0 6 8 a 1170 b 80 tc 0 nm 14 also this lumped ca approach numerical experiment a1 has been compared to a logistic regression alternative for this application we considered the same explanatory variables as in the ca approach the logistic regression provided worse results mse of 571 406 cells² in the calibration case and 1019 121 cells² in the validation case underestimating sca in winter and overestimating sca in summer note that techniques based on regression are performed using the mean of the dependent and independent variables therefore they are more sensitive to outliers and less able to capture spatiotemporal variability in addition the absence of snow in summer is not properly approached by the regression model therefore the ca methodology provides better approximations than standard regression approaches for these reasons the great interest in studying distributed numerical ca solutions is justified the variables selected for numerical experiment a1 were used as driving variables for all the distributed numerical experiments a2 d1 d2 d3 in these distributed numerical experiments the parameters nm and tc from numerical experiment a1 remained fixed while the remainder were varied due to the high computational cost of the distributed approaches nevertheless in a subsequent procedure these parameters were also calibrated for the numerical experiment that had the best results in the first stage numerical experiment d2 produced the best results so a second numerical experiment d2 1 was performed based on d2 now varying nm and tc and having all other variables remain fixed this numerical experiment yielded an improvement with respect to the lumped approach developed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 6 6 mse for the calibration period and 10 1 mse for the validation period like pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 in the current study we tested the possibility of using an absolute temperature threshold instead of a threshold that depends on the previous day rules a and b of the formulation because it seems to be more reasonable physically numerical experiments d4 and d4 1 but the approximations obtained were poorer than in pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 table 1 shows a summary of the ca model numerical experiments performed and their results in light of the results numerical experiment d2 1 was selected to perform the next analysis in this numerical experiment the ca parameters were calibrated by minimising the mse for each climatic zone where the driving variables are defined euro cordex grid for each climatic zone we calibrated the ca model using the climatological indices of the climatic zone as driving variables for the entire mountain range we repeated this procedure for all climatic zones in order to obtain distributed parameters the optimal value of the parameters in the various climatic zones was plotted against the mean elevation of each climatic zone in order to test for possible correlations fig 3 all parameters with the exception of tc show significant correlations to elevation parameters p 0 a and b increase with elevation while nm decreases when the ca model is applied using these parameters the best estimated dynamics of daily sca are obtained this configuration shows the lowest mse which implies the smallest differences between estimated and experimental sca in order to assess the performance of the ca model we calculated the sca for each day for the entire mountain range and the experimental and estimated datasets these results are shown in fig 4 in general extreme snowfall events are underestimated but general sca dynamics are captured we further calculated the number of cells where snow cover exceeded 5 15 25 and 35 of days in order to assess the spatial distribution of snowfall fig 5 shows that experimental and estimated sca have a very similar pattern thus we demonstrate that the ca model applied is able to reproduce the spatial dynamics of sca for the calibration period in the same way the validation results are shown in figs 6 and 7 again the temporal sca dynamics are captured but extreme snowfall events are underestimated we have also compared the estimates to experimental data cell by cell for the calibration and validation data obtaining the failure probability of the ca model in two situations errors when the cell is covered and when there is no snow see fig 8 note that the model is more likely to fail when the cell is covered by snow s i j t 1 at lower elevations where snow dynamics change more quickly from the point of view of water resources quantification these errors are not very important because at those elevations snow thickness is lower with respect to spatial distribution the probability of failure is similar for the two periods and the two cases snow covered or snow free furthermore we have evaluated the uncertainty of parameters using the procedure explained in section 2 eq 1 for the lumped ca model the standard deviations of the calibrated parameters are shown in table 2 the uncertainty of the ca model outputs has been quantified by considering the mse of the calibration period as explained in section 2 the experimental data and the uncertainty interval defined by estimates standard deviations of sca are shown in fig 9 for the case study on 69 1 of the days the experimental data are within the uncertainty interval this value is similar to the theoretical value assuming a gaussian distribution represented by 68 as noted in the methodology section the climate change information used to generate potential future scenarios can be taken from the rcm in our case study we used nine rcms from the cordex project 2013 we selected the most pessimistic emissions scenario of the project representative concentration pathways 8 5 rcp8 5 table 3 shows the rcms used and the gcm in which they are nested we considered the historical period 1971 2000 and the future period 2071 2100 to perform the statistical transformations used to generate the potential future scenarios the method was systematically applied to all cells of the euro cordex grid inside the study area to obtain the future precipitation and maximum temperature series the driving variables selected for the ca model we considered two precipitation and temperature climate change scenarios depending on which approach was employed delta change e1 or bias correction e2 these two scenarios e1 and e2 are equi feasible solutions obtained from the nine rcms considered these two future scenarios are used as the driving variables for the calibrated ca model in order to obtain potential future scenarios of snow cover area due to climate change an example of the precipitation and temperature time series generated for a particular cell is presented in fig 10 there is a significant reduction in precipitation and a significant increase in temperature the means of the series generated for the two scenarios are similar in the case of precipitation and the same in the case of maximum temperature theoretically the means must be the same in the two scenarios even though the time series are different so that the two scenarios have different behaviour when they are fed into the ca model however in the case of precipitation the small differences are due to negative values generated in the statistical process that are corrected to zero in order to evaluate potential climate change spatially we calculated the relative changes in precipitation and maximum temperature for all cells plotting them with respect to elevation see fig 11 fig 11 shows that climate change leads to an increase in maximum temperature and a decrease in precipitation with elevation so in this alpine system the potential climate change will be greater in the case of temperature and smaller in the case of precipitation for higher elevations the ca model was fed with the series generated for the two scenarios this yielded significant reductions in sca 59 0 for e1 and 61 7 for e2 the size of the reduction depends on the month table 4 figs 12 and 13 shows the mean monthly and daily historical and future sca respectively graphically we verified that potential reductions in sca are highly significant fig 14 shows the cells with snow cover on more than 5 15 25 and 35 of days for the historical and future potential scenarios again the potential reductions are significant 4 limitations and future research it should be noted that when hydrological models especially those defined at a regional scale covering an extensive area with heterogeneous conditions as in our case are employed to simulate conditions and that are very different from those used to calibrate and validate the model uncertainty in the assessment increases for this reason all the models should be validated again when new information is available this occurs even with physical hydrological models e g groundwater flow models rainfall runoff models etc our model although it is not based on such physical models provides coherent solutions with the capability to predict very extreme conditions for example if snow is not present it does not show any values of sca nevertheless as explained above in all models uncertainty grows when they are used to simulate very different conditions the patterns and variability of future climate conditions may be considerably different from the historical current climate data used to calibrate and validate the model s parameters the model s rules in our approach ipcc 2007 2013 however despite the inevitable uncertainty in predicting the impact of climate change an uncertainty that also exists in many other aspects analysed by the scientific community both within physical and non physical processes and which is also inherent to the definition of potential climate change scenarios there is a clear need to provide a quantitative assessment of potential hydrological impacts this will allow scientists to rationally evaluate potential adaptation strategies for maintaining sustainable management of water resources systems which may be very vulnerable to climate change due to the importance to society of understanding the potential impacts of climate change although there may be uncertainties involved in this impact assessment scientific production on this issue is very relevant e g brown and mote 2009 vorosmarty et al 2000 in this work we assume a steady lulc in historical and future scenarios in order to perform a sensitivity analysis of the sca dynamics to potential future climate scenarios therefore representative sca results can be provided for long term future climate periods if we assume that lulc will remain quite similar to its historical data or that the changes do not have an important influence on the snow dynamic the ca model has been calibrated and validated with p and t time series from recent years and it only requires p and t time series in order to assess the impact on the future evolution of sca suppose we take the p and t time series projected for the year 2100 there will be on average less rainfall and higher temperatures suppose that these time series are taken to be the record from a recent abnormally dry and hot year we would think that the output of the model is valid for this recent year although we are using the projections for the year 2100 thus as long as we assume that the calibration is robust in accordance with the validation performed and make the hypothesis that the parameters rules in our approach will remain invariable in the future as they depend on p and t only because topographic parameters may be considered constant at a timescale of one hundred years the use of ca will be valid for addressing sca dynamics in the future the spatial change in the global circulation of the atmosphere has already been taken into account in the p and t time series projections for the future new research would be needed to use the same ca model to study a historical period with significant lulc changes or to simulate potential future impacts that also include future lulc changes most likely such models would need to include other spatial variables influenced by lulc in the rules additionally different parameter sets can lead to similar responses in the sca dynamics principle of equifinality the analysis of parameters in this deterministic model cannot be used to draw conclusions about the factors that influence snow dynamics as a future line of research a new approach would be required to perform a more complete analysis of the factors that influence sca combining stochastic and physical based models 5 conclusions a ca model to estimate sca has been calibrated and validated with good results for the sierra nevada mountain range southern spain we implemented several lumped and distributed numerical experiments varying the driving variables algorithm parameters minimisation procedure search for optimal parameters and temperature based on a lumped ca model developed by pardo igúzquiza et al 2017 the best implementation numerical experiment d2 1 reduced the mse by 6 6 and 10 1 in the calibration and validation periods respectively compared to the initial lumped ca model subsequently we used this best ca model numerical experiment to assess the impacts of climate change on snow cover dynamics using future precipitation and temperature scenarios as driving variables when the relative changes in the future precipitation and maximum temperature time series generated with respect to the historical series are plotted against mean elevation in each grid we conclude that in this alpine case study potential climate change at higher altitudes will result in higher temperatures and lower precipitation the future series generated was used as an input for the calibrated ca model leading to the worrying result that there will be a drastic reduction in snow cover area in the future using the future precipitation and temperature scenarios as driving variables for the period 2071 2100 we obtain a significant reduction in snow cover area using the calibrated ca model 59 0 for e1 and 61 7 for e2 thus the distributed ca developed is proved to be a useful tool for predicting the future evolution of snowpack this tool can be applied to various management tasks including water resources management operational river forecasts and landscape

706,accurate awareness of how rainfall land use changes and soil types control water fluxes in agricultural floodplains remains a crucial challenge in water resource research this study examines soil moisture conditions soil texture and rainfall characteristics together with different artificial drainage network structures covering a time span of 100 years 1924 2010 as drivers for runoff production in an agricultural floodplain the research incorporates a multiple layer generalised green ampt approach to simulate water infiltration into the ground once the storage offered by the soil is saturated a portion of the surface storage provided by the drainage network satisfies the infiltration capacity thus delaying runoff the watershed response is defined by the unsi updated network saturated index sofia and tarolli 2017 that indicates the moment the available storage soil network is 100 saturated the results highlighted how interlocking relations between soil properties the geometry of the network and temporal variations of precipitation determine runoff generation timing for short return times intense rainfalls tend to produce a quicker response in areas with soils prone to saturation and with decreased network complexity however when the event magnitude increases this combination of soil and network structure produces the fastest response when rainfall is more regular intense events in zones with soils with higher permeability produce a quicker response the simpler the network is when soils are prone to runoff and the network efficiency increases runoff production is delayed in time when soils have elevated permeability and the network has a reduced efficiency and path heterogeneity increasing the network simplicity would result in similar outcomes moreover if the path heterogeneity and network efficiency increases for a given network sinuosity runoff generation would be delayed quantifying these effects is indeed crucial for many environmental

also be ascribed to climate effects blöschl et al 2017 dominated mostly by multidecadal variability rather than by long term trends hodgkins et al 2017 however the effects of various storm characteristics on rainfall runoff coupled with imperviousness at the scale of small urbanised systems have not been fully determined guan et al 2016 qin et al 2013 yao et al 2016 identifying the hydrological consequences of these drivers network properties and climate is complicated and requires detailed and accurate data fang et al 2012 van den elsen et al 2003 quantifying these effects is crucial for many environmental problems including the prediction of impacts of a changing climate and land use and the associated pressures but also in the transport of solutes and contaminants botter et al 2010 rinaldo et al 2011 the purpose of the study described in this paper is to use a simple physically based model to examine the hydrological consequences of various storm characteristics coupled with soil characteristics texture antecedent moisture condition and drainage network structures covering a time span of 100 years on runoff production the paper purposely focusses on soil and network properties without considering the influence of land use and land cover the research aims to disentangle inter storm variability landscape soil and human drivers in runoff production more specifically rather than discussing the importance of each driver as single predictor this research highlights their importance and interaction in the complex system of a floodplain agricultural area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the research area covers about 30 km2 and it belongs to two municipalities in the province of padua veneto north eastern italy megliadino san vitale and megliadino san fidenzio fig 1 the study site is bounded by administrative boundaries not by watershed divides in this floodplain landscape the definition of a topographic watershed is very complex and since most of the flows are mechanically controlled each pumping station defines an independent sub unit where flows are constrained the area is about 70 km south west of venice and 35 km south west of padua it is mostly flat avg slope is 2 9 and it is a typical example of the diffuse city environment besussi et al 1998 fabian 2012 it is part of the holocenic plain formed by the adige and agno guà frassine rivers the landscape is mostly agricultural with some spotted urbanised areas that have increased in the last ten years mostly following the road network shape the main agricultural activities include vineyards olive orchards and crop cultivations with more intensive crop and vines production near the urbanised areas the available topographic information is a lidar digital terrain model dtm surveyed in 2008 2010 horizontal accuracy of about 0 3 m and vertical accuracy of 0 15 m fig 1a together with historical maps from 1924 to estimate past drainage network courtesy of consorzio di bonifica adige euganeo fig 1b and 1d and a classification of soils for the whole location fig 1c the soils are characterized by a certain degree of heterogeneity ranging from fine silty inceptisols oxyaquic haplustepts to coarse texture entisols typic ustipsamments to soil rich in organic carbon fluventic hapludolls or with buried organic horizons table 1 arpav 2015 the available soil information stems from pedotransfer functions ptfs based on actual properties of the soil matrix including bulk density organic matter and soil texture arpav 2011 for soils with clay 0 49 and sand 0 50 local authorities applied the ungaro et al 2005 ptfs derived from benchmark soils in the pianura padano veneta northern italy outside the mentioned texture ranges the soil water retention is evaluated from ptfs defined by rawls et al 2003 calibrated on field surveyed values of percentage of clay sand and organic carbon the hydraulic conductivity derives from ptfs calibrated on clay sand and bulk density according to brakensiek et al 1984 2 2 network characterisation a correct characterisation of the drainage network is essential to predict the likely responses of flooding to the large scale changes in the complexity of the drainage system induced by changes in socio economic drivers the study site was divided into subareas of 250 m 250 m to capture the geometry of the network and permanent variations in soil sealing urban expansion three parameters characterise the irrigation network storage capacity drainage density and fractal dimension while storage capacity and drainage density are mostly related to irrigation needs we assumed the fractal dimension to be representative of changes in the network shapes due to changes in agricultural mechanisation and field properties thanks to the availability of a high resolution lidar dtm it has been possible to identify and characterise the current drainage network cazorzi et al 2013 automatically the approach is direct and straightforward and it is based on a detrending technique the topographic information is filtered using a low pass filter resulting in a smoothed surface to subtract from the original lidar dtm cazorzi et al 2013 as the height in the detrended data represents a height difference from a smoothed surface positive peak values highlight microtopographic elements in the landscape in this case the drainage network hence a statistic threshold can be applied to extract the features of interest for each extracted element it is possible to estimate a width and length and thus aggregate this information to estimate an average channel width and subsequently the water storage per areal units please refer to cazorzi et al 2013 sofia et al 2014 for a detailed description of the procedure for the past network we digitalised the drainage channels from historical maps from 1924 gazzin 2017 for each subarea we assumed an average channel cross section equal to the mean value estimated for the year 2010 sofia et al 2014 water storage volumes were then estimated starting from the network length and cross section area for each section to better describe the river networks in this paper the fractal dimension fd for each network is estimated by applying box counting approach backes and bruno 2012 coelho and costa 1996 to evaluate the fd square boxes with side length ɛ were generated and placed over the network the number of boxes n ɛ in which a part of the fractal falls is then counted n ɛ increases with the decrease of the size of the box the fractal dimension fd is then the slope of the relationship between log ε and log n ε according to eqution log n ɛ f d log ɛ c where c is a constant of proportionality which allows for the relationship between n and ɛ zhang et al 2015 for this study case we evaluated fd for each 250 m x 250 m subarea thus the size of the box varied from 1 to 250 m to reduce the high variability the changes in the network characteristics storage capacity δstorcap drainage density δdraind fractal dimension δfd between the two reference years 2010 1924 have been classified into four classes fig 2 g h i named low l medium low ml medium high mh and high h the classes were defined according to a natural breaks classification seeking to minimise each class s average deviation from its mean while maximising each class s deviation from the means of the other groups each class indicates the differences between each parameter in 2010 respect 1924 high means much lower value of the parameter in 2010 respect 1924 it is important to highlight that the low and part of the medium low class represent areas where the network properties increased in 2010 respect to the past for the δstorcap and δdraind the change is towards the end of the ml class while for δfd it is at the beginning of the ml class 2 3 rainfall runoff mechanism this paper considers the updated network saturation index unsi sofia and tarolli 2017 that indicates the time needed for a designed rainfall to saturate the available storage volume depending on the soil characteristics and antecedent moisture condition amc see sofia and tarolli 2017 for the details the basic steps applied for the evaluation of this index are i create depth duration frequency ddf curves see svensson and jones 2010 for a full review to simulate synthetic rainfalls ii simulate a reference rainfall with different hyetographs shapes iii evaluate the infiltration to simulate the effective rainfall and runoff to compute the unsi 2 3 1 storm and interstorm variability to evaluate the effect of storm variability on the watershed response regarding ponding time and the difference in unsi and to make a comparative analysis we followed sofia and tarolli 2017 and we considered the same hyetographs of the referenced work 17 hyetographs hyetographs include a dimensionless rainfall wilson et al 2006 hyetographs for rainfalls of 1 2 4 8 24 48 72 168 240 h florida department of transportation 2015 the scs nrcs hydrographs type i for a design storm of 24 and 48 h type ia for 24 h type ii for a design storm of 24 and 48 h and type iii for 24 h cronshey 1986 and two more hyetographs proposed for a rainfall of 72 and 96 h st johns river water management district 2010 storms could assume multiple forms and these hyetographs are mostly considered as reference example to provide the possibility of generalising the results we considered a qualitative characterisation of the interstorm variability sofia and tarolli 2017 mathematically characterised the rainfall bursts within the storm where a burst is an abrupt change in rainfall rate huff 1967 the authors defined four criteria specifically i the time in percentage of the total to the heaviest burst brloc ii the number of bursts brn iii the shape of the hyetograph trn as in the ratio between the hyetograph area and the area of a triangle having as base the hyetograph duration and as height the height of the main rainfall burst iv the asymmetry of the storm volumes asym defined as the ratio between the amount of rainfall fell before the maximum burst and that after the burst we qualitatively classified each rainfall parameter table 2 according to a natural breaks classification for this classifications asymmetry has been defined as negatively skewed ns right centred rc left centred lc and positively skewed ps trn has been defined as low l medium low ml medium high mh and high h brloc has been defined as beginning b first half fh second half sh and end e furthermore brn has been defined as single peak sp or multi peaks mp fig 3 shows a descriptive example of the different qualitative measures these criteria highlight some climatic characteristics changes in brloc can simulate changes in climate to heavy rainfalls beginning earlier abbs 1999 within a storm the contribute of intense rainfall events cortesi et al 2012 sofia et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 can be simulated according to different brn and trn as well trn and asymmetry can simulate the effect of rainfall non uniformity a critical element increasing flooding wasko 2014 wasko and sharma 2015 for simulation purposes it is necessary to define a rainfall duration sofia and tarolli 2017 considered the time needed for a rainfall to fill the available superficial storage capacity their work did not account for infiltrated water to define this timing in this study since we have different soil types we decided to focus on a duration able to produce an effective rainfall rainfall minus infiltration able to fill the 90th percentile of the storage volumes available in 1924 storage capacity volume is a distributed value one value per subarea of 250 m 250 m thus some local peaks might be related to outliers or locally extracted areas by considering the 90th percentile of these values we ensure the effective rainfall to have a realistic duration and amount to obtain the rainfall duration we simulated an average dry soil type defining a soil having as hydraulic parameters an area weighted average of the parameters of each available soil in the study area and an initial moisture content of 0 to define the rainfall duration we re created a variable rate pattern based on average characteristics of storms defined by the whole set of hyetographs and we selected the time producing an average rainfall intensity average considering all the possible hyetographs able to saturate the first layer of the abovementioned average dry soil type for this study the storm time t is 6 4 h and the rainfall cumulated amount refers to that derived for t 6 4 h and ddf curves for a return time of 2 5 10 30 50 100 200 years 2 3 2 generalized green ampt model previously sofia and tarolli 2017 the infiltration had been investigated considering a single layer of soil and a single soil type however in nature layered soils are the norm rather than the exception independently from the number of layers when a wetting front moves from one layer to the next the infiltration rate will be reduced due to i reduced hydraulic conductivity if a wetting front moves from a more porous to a less porous layer ii reduced wetting front suction in the opposite scenario furthermore if the soils in the lower layers are much coarser than the top ones the wetting front may become unstable and reduce the infiltration substantially downer and ogden 2003 for this reason this work applies a generalised version of green and ampt 1911 approach here the effect of layering is addressed averaging the soil properties based on the depths of the layers downer and ogden 2003 the same basic assumption of the green ampt model applies that is that of a sharp wetting front as the wetting front crosses the layers the model assumes an instantaneous change in the initial moisture content porosity and wetting front suction head for a cumulative infiltration at the t time step f t in a layered soil with a total depth of dtot composed of i layers each one having a specific hydraulic conductivity ki cm h depth di cm moisture deficit δθ i as in the difference between the saturated water content θ s and the initial water content θ i the effective hydraulic conductivity at the time step t is evaluated as 1 k t d 1 f t d 1 δ θ 1 δ θ 2 d 1 k 1 f t d 1 δ θ 1 δ θ 2 k 2 when z d 1 2 k t n 1 i 1 d n f t n 1 i 1 d n δ θ n δ θ i n 1 i 1 d n k n f t n 1 i 1 d n δ θ n δ θ i k i when d t o t z d 1 with z being the depth of the leading wetting front evaluated as d i 1 f t δ θ i flerchinger et al 1988 that is while the front is in the first layer the hydraulic conductivity at any time kt is equal to k1 the hydraulic conductivity of the first soil horizon when the leading edge passes the first layer the effective hydraulic conductivity is calculated based on the depth of the leading edge of the wetting front z as a harmonic mean of the wetted layers downer and ogden 2003 the cumulative infiltration solved iteratively using the newton raphson method upton et al 2008 at the t 1 time level is chow et al 1988 is 3 f t 1 f t k t δ t f δ θ ln f t 1 f δ θ f t f δ θ the infiltration rate is 4 f t 1 k t f δ θ f t 1 1 where ψ f is the wetting front suction head and δθ is the moisture deficit of the layer containing the leading front if at any timestep the rainfall intensity is higher than infiltration capacity ft the excess rainfall will first fill the surface storage and then contribute to surface runoff thus a significant parameter is the ponding time eq 5 or the time at which infiltration stops and runoff starts for a storm of a specific duration and intensity p tp is given by 5 t p k i ψ f θ s θ i p p k i where k and δθ are the effective conductivity and the moisture deficit of the layer containing the leading front and ψ f is the wetting front suction head the local authorities arpav 2015 provided the input required for the green ampt model table 1 changes in the surrounding environment dynamically alter the hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix therefore the infiltration parameters for the green ampt equation should change for each storm event risse et al 1995 different saturation 0 25 50 75 90 100 were simulated to account for changes in the soil due to the antecedent soil moisture conditions amc as 6 θ i θ s m with m 0 00 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 90 1 00 with θ s saturated moisture content and θ i initial antecedent moisture content 2 4 statistical inference 2 4 1 return time and saturation vs ponding time and unsi according to sofia and tarolli 2017 ponding time and δunsi vary depending on the event return period or the saturation condition following 7 y a e b x with y being the ponding time tp or the δunsi x being the return period or the saturation condition and a and b two empirical coefficients of different magnitude for this study we tested the same hypothesis fitting the proposed equation to the δunsi and ponding times evaluated in each subarea within the study site having a homogeneous soil type the areas represented in fig 1c the fitting was accomplished by a non linear approximation approach based on a gaussian model in this method the parameters of the approximating functions are not necessarily linear on the original function and they are determined using non linear optimisation dennis et al 1996 the fitting automatically calculates optimised start points for gaussian models based on the fitted dataset and imposes no bounds on the resulting coefficients further we tested the value of r2 for each fitted equation with a two tailed student s t test for statistical significance at α 0 05 this procedure is implemented to verify if the sofia and tarolli 2017 also applies when infiltration is evaluated using a multi layer green ampt approach and to verify the effects of different soil types the fitted values of a and b have been classified according to a natural breaks classification assessing changes in the coefficients it is not an easy task identifying significant variations between coefficients given their order of magnitude is challenging classifying them into classes of high low values ensure a greater understanding of the data and highlights differences better as a consequence the results will be discussed addressing a and b as low a l b l medium low a ml b ml medium high a mh b mh and high a h b h a and b fitted for tp have been plotted together to define hydrological similarities between the different soils we applied a k means clustering algorithm david and vassilvitski 2007 to partition the soils into three main groups the k means clustering for its simplicity and speed is a widely used iterative data partitioning algorithm that minimises the average squared distance between points in the same cluster david and vassilvitski 2007 2 4 2 quantifying differences the influence of the hyetographs shapes soil types and network parameters on ponding time or δunsi was tested using multiple linear regression models considering each criterion as a single predictor or implying an interaction among them statistically an interaction describes a situation in which the simultaneous influence of two variables on a third is not additive given the high number of variables four storm parameters and three network parameters this research aimed to optimise the best subset of predictors to explain the watershed response redundant predictors should be removed to explain the data most simply and effectively and to reduce collinearity moreover unnecessary predictors would merely add noise to the estimation of the ponding time and δunsi rather than explaining them thus as a novel step respect to sofia and tarolli 2017 we consider the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1987 1981 pan 2001 as an estimator of the relative quality of the statistical model for each given set of data given a collection of models for the data the aic forward backwards selection estimates the quality of each model relative to each of the other models all the assumptions for the regression models were checked and in the case of non linearity between explanatory and response variables a boxplot transformation was applied further the cook distance cook 1979 was used to remove outliers when needed we tested the presence of serial correlation among the residuals and when present the durbin watson dw test durbin and watson 1950 at α 0 05 confirmed or declined the significance of the relationship given by the analysis of variance anova results the significance threshold level for the anova was set to p 0 05 3 results 3 1 ponding time vs return period and saturation eq 7 was fitted to the values of ponding time tp as a function of the return period rp fig 4 a or saturation sat fig 4b table 3 reports the estimated a and b coefficients obtained for each soil type as well as the goodness of fits when considering the relationship with the return period fig 4a table 3 testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows there is a significant relationship between the two variables as observed for a different soil in sofia and tarolli 2017 the return period has a weaker influence on ponding at the increase of the magnitude of the event increasing rp the saturation time always decreases observing the coefficients of tp f rp for the same return period soils with al would saturate quicker than soils having ah however differences arise depending on the magnitude of the events the response of soils in al are not that marked for the lowest return periods rp 2 year while they are highly evident a saturation 60 faster for the less frequent events rp 200 year for a similar b soils having al display a higher sensitivity to changes in the return period the less frequent event rp 200 year would result in a decrease of the ponding time of about 1 h and a half 63 for soils with al whereas for soils having ah the same change would result in an anticipation of the ponding time of about 1 h 40 the values of b assume the highest value for the mostly sandy soil cap1 and the lowest value for the soil lcm1 with clay in the upper horizon changes in b result in similar changes in ponding time independently from the return period with soils in bl having a quicker saturation 60 respect soils in bh however changes in the return period from a frequent rp 2 year to a rare rp 200 year event for a similar a would result in higher changes in ponding time for soils having bh respect to soils having bl 1 5 h vs 50 m respectively observing a and b together fig 4a the k means algorithm define three groups g1 g2 and g3 according to variations in ponding time vs return period al and bl bound the first group g1 that includes lcm1 ved1 and alb1 alb1 is the soil with silty loam texture in all horizons table 1 lcm1 has clay in the first horizon loam in the second and silty loam in the third while ved1 presents loam in all horizons table 1 the second group g2 is bounded by amd medium low medium high and bmd medium low medium high and it comprises cpe1 fra1 van1 cpe1 presents clay loam or loamy horizons fra1 silty clay loam and van1 has loamy horizons closer to the surface or sandy loam horizons in depth the third group g3 has ah and bmh h and it includes ss1 zie1 vmo1 and cap1 ss1 presents silty clay loam horizons alternated to silt loam horizons zie1 presents silty clay loam texture up to about 120 cm of depth and then silt loam vmo1 is entirely silty clay loam while cap1 is sandy loam closer to the surface and sandy in depth according to the proposed model eq 7 and averaging a and b for each group for the same return period soils pertaining to g1 would saturate earlier in time respect soils in g3 with slight differences depending on the frequency of the events 22 for rp 2 year vs 40 for rp 200 year the change in response due to the change in the event frequency rp 2 year to rp 200 year would be 60 more evident for soils in g1 vs soils in g3 this classification highlights how changes in the magnitude of the events have a more significant effect on ponding time than soil texture when taken as an independent parameter when considering saturation fig 4b testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows that except for the soil cap1 there is a significant relationship between the two variables one must notice that cap1 is the only soil characterised by a sandy texture the lack of correlation between ponding time and saturation is mostly because a large number of the simulated hyetographs is not capable of saturating this specific soil for the considered rainfall duration observing the coefficients of tp f sat as expected they show a negative correlation between ponding time and saturation with a reduction of the ponding time at the increase of the soil moisture content lower values of a are related to soils having silty loam textures whereas a increases for soils having more uniform silty clay loam textures to reach the highest values for sandy soils this defines more permeable soils ah result in delayed ponding times vs more impervious soils with an increase of about 70 in time independently from the saturation considering the parameter b the lowest values bl are related to lcm1 while the coefficient progressively increases to reach the highest values at the increase of the permeability or water retention capacity fra1 van1 lcm1 zie1 cap1 differences in b determine differences in response to the amc for the same saturation sat 0 bh vs bl results in an almost unnoticeable delayed response 0 5 whereas an almost saturated soil sat 90 would have a delay of 5 in ponding time as well soils with bh would result in a lower response to saturation changes with about a 4 delay in time changing from dry to saturated soils sat 0 to 90 whereas soils with bl would result doubled time increase 8 for the same saturation change considering both a and b fig 4b soils can be clustered together into three groups the first group g1 is bounded by al and bl ml and it includes lcm1 ved1 and alb1 the second group g2 is bounded by aml and bmd medium low medium high and it comprises cpe1 fra1 van1 the third group g3 has amh h and bmd h and it includes ss1 zie1 vmo1 and cap1 interestingly this classification creates the same groups like the one for the return period equation coefficients thus indicating how soil textures and hydraulic properties in general plays a similar role in soil response respect changes in amc and magnitude of the rainfall event according to the proposed model eq 7 and averaging a and b in each group for the same saturation conditions soils pertaining to g1 would saturate about 70 earlier in time respect soils in g3 with slight differences depending on the soil moisture condition 69 for sat 0 vs 75 for sat 90 averaging soils in g1 saturates in about 1 h and 45 min vs soils in g3 that saturates in about 3 h the change in response due to the change in saturation sat 0 to 90 would be 50 more evident for soils in g1 vs soils in g3 this classification highlights how changes in textures have a more significant effect on ponding time than amc 3 2 ponding time and interstorm variability according to the aic approach the best fit model to represent the variations in ponding time is given by eq 8 8 p t i m e s o i l g b r l o c b r n t r n a s y m s o i l g b r l o c s o i l g t r n s o i l g b r l o c t r n b r l o c t r n b r l o c a s y m t r n a s y m b r l o c t r n

p value 2 2e 16 compared to the model before the aic approach eq 8 reduces the residual standard error 0 01 increases the r2 0 01 increases f 20 and it increases the degrees of freedom 10 thus effectively removing drivers excessive to estimate the parameters variability the location of the heaviest storm burst brloc the regularity of the rainfall intensity trn the asymmetry of the rainfall volume asym have in average a statistically significant influence the ponding time table 4 while brloc is always significant independently from the magnitude of the events and from the amc trn becomes significant only for increasing saturation sat 50 table 4 or for increasing magnitude on dry soils rp 200 year sat 0 asym is only significant for dry soils and average return periods sat 50 rp 2 year table 4 or for rare events with increasing amc sat 50 rp 200 year table 4 the number of bursts brn is only significant for dry soils and rather frequent events rp 50 year sat 0 always significant with average amc independently from the magnitude of the events and it is significant for very rare rp 200 year or rather frequent rp 2 year events in saturated amc sat 90 overall early peak events brloc b vs e fig 5 tend to reduce the ponding time negatively skewed hyetographs also determine a quicker runoff production overall rainfall intensity trn l vs h also influence negatively the ponding time and so do multipeak rainfalls but only when intensity is high trn low interactions in fact arise independently from soil groups the location of the peak the asymmetry of the rainfall and its triangularity matter at all saturation and independently from the magnitude of the event table 4 fig 5a soil groups on the other hand interact with storm triangularity and peak location fig 5b and with triangularity and number of bursts fig 5c but the strength of this interaction changes with changes in saturation fig 6 runoff production is the quickest for intense storms trn l with early peaks brloc b vs e fig 5a and negatively skewed hyetographs most of the rainfall volume falling before the bursts a strong quickening in runoff production is also related to intense events trn low fig 5b and impervious soils g1 especially for early peak storms brloc e faster runoff productions are also related to impervious soils g1 and intense trn low multipeak brn mp storms fig 5c the type of correlation with ponding time as described above however changes at different saturations sat and return period rp for the various predictors fig 6 the importance of soil groups as independent predictor decreases at the increase of saturation moving from soils in g1 more permeable to g3 less permeable decreases the ponding time fig 5 but these textural changes matter the most in low amc sat 50 fig 6 the predictor with the highest negative effect on ponding time is the number of peaks brn with the highest negative effect on ponding time in dry soils the highest positive effect is given by the interaction between soil groups and number of peaks especially in frequent events rp 2 year and dry soils sat 0 followed by the interaction between triangularity trn number of peaks brn increasing the magnitude of the events reduces the correlation between each predictor s and ponding time interestingly there is a drastic shift in correlation between low magnitude events rp 2 year and extreme ones rp 200 year for the soil soilg as single predictor or interacting with others the number of peaks brn as single predictor or interacting with others and triangularity trn as single predictor or interacting with others for low magnitude events the increase in saturation reduces the anticipation of ponding time at the changes in soil texture at the increase of peak numbers and the more regular the events are differently extreme events produce a quicker runoff at the increase of the peak number and of the intensity of the event 3 2 1 similarities with previous findings analysing the actual soil response without considering the network changes offers a starting point to understand future changes sofia and tarolli 2017 for this case study focusing on soil response the results underlined how changes in the magnitude of the events has a larger effect on ponding time than soil texture when taken as an independent parameter while different texture classes have a larger effect on ponding time than amc the effect of texture on ponding time is also observed for other parts of the world where initial soil moisture effects on the flood response have been shown to depend on event magnitude rather than on the climate or region properties grillakis et al 2016 when considering interstorm variability this research confirmed what found in sofia and tarolli 2017 the proposed analysis suggests that an expected quickening of the runoff production is related to rainfall having a large intensity peak at the beginning of the storm coupled with an increase of the volume of water falling before the heaviest burst and intensity of the event the effects of the peak locations are in line with what found in the literature zhang et al 1997 reported that runoff was twice as large and quicker in early peak events than in delayed peak events that delivered the same total depth of rain in the same event duration similarly when dealing with chemical losses on relatively dry soils amc 6 potter et al 2006 found greater chemical loss thus a quicker runoff with early peak than in constant intensity simulated rainfall events having the same duration the latter effect is also found in this study where low values of rainfall triangularity thus a high concentration of the event coupled with the rainfall burst location and rainfall asymmetry resulting in a decreased ponding time similar conclusions have been found by frauenfeld and truman 2004 as well dunkerley 2012 found the longest average time to runoff was related to late peak events followed by uniform events early peak events shed runoff more quickly and early peak gap event in which the peak is very close to the start of the event yielded the shortest time to runoff this research further observed the effects of storm properties on different soil groups overall the general behaviours described independently from soils are maintained in all simulations however differences have been found for the number of peaks in permeable soils g3 frequent multi peak events in average or almost saturated amc resulted in a delayed runoff production for these soils this was also highlighted in relation to rainfall regularity more regular rainfalls with multiple peaks for frequent or rather frequent events increased the ponding time mei and anagnostou 2015 found that multi peak runoff event timing properties are in general taking larger values and wider value ranges than those of the single peak ones frauenfeld and truman 2004 speculated that many of the differences between different events might be accounted for in terms of greater tendency to soil surface sealing arising in the higher peak intensity of the variable intensity events higher surface permeability might also exist in the uppermost soil of uniform events dunkerley 2012 thus soil surface sealing should not be expected for regular events especially in the more permeable soils hence the lower ponding time for multi peak regular rainfalls 3 3 δunsi vs return time and saturation eq 7 was fitted to the values of δunsi and return period fig 8a or saturation fig 8b table 5 reports the estimated a and b coefficients obtained for each soil type as well as the goodness of fits when considering the relationship with the return period fig 7 a testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows there is a significant relationship between the two variables values of a range from 2 2 to 0 5 with the lowest value related to alb1 and the highest one to zie1 according to the natural breaks classification low values of a al are related only to zones with soils alb1 aml is for van1 lcm1 ss1 and ved1 amh is for vmo1 and cpe1 while the higher levels ah are for cap1 fra1 zie1 in this case there is no correlation between the values of a and the soil properties this because the δunsi is also influenced by the network properties the values of b range from 0 0079 to 0 0033 the level classification attributes low values of b to areas with the alb1 soil bml is for van1 lcm1 ss1 and ved1 bmh is for zie1 while the higher levels bh are for cap1 fra1 vmo1 different levels of b imply that for the same a soils having bl have a watershed response δunsi about 30 min quicker in 2010 respect 1924 while soils with bh have a response about 1 h quicker as well changes in the magnitude of the events for soils with bl produce more visible effects with a reduction of the unsi to about 30 min for the rare vs the frequent events soils in bh instead have a difference of only 20 min by observing both a and b at the same time fig 7a alb1 appears to be isolated even if both confidence bounds overlap with the other soils one must note that alb1 is the soil where the most significant urbanisation happened over the years and the network conformation changed the most by using the group classification proposed for the ponding time in the δunsi realm soils in g1 are bounded by al and bml l soils in g2 are more scattered and are bounded by aml h and bml h soils in g3 are bounded in bmh and aml according to the proposed model eq 7 and considering the average a and b per soil group g1 has an average δunsi of about 1 h whereas soils in g3 have an average δunsi of about 30 min this indicates that soils in g1 together with being more prone to runoff see the previous chapter have witnessed a more significant change in the network response with a much quicker response in 2010 vs 1924 as well the areas with soils in g1 have a much higher sensitivity to changes in the magnitude of the events with rare events increasing the changes of up 30 min respect to less than 10 min for the areas with soils in g2 and g3 higher changes are expected for frequent events 1 h for soils in g1 respect to g3 rather than for rare events 22 min considering saturation fig 7b testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows there is a significant relationship between the two variables except for the soils alb1 van1 and cap1 these three are the soils of the areas that have been mostly modified during the years thus saturation plays a lower role in the watershed response compared to modification of the network itself confirming what found in sofia and tarolli 2017 when considering the saturation condition the scaling coefficient a overlaps with that of eq 7 fitted for the return period while the exponent b has a larger order of magnitude values of a range from 1 7 to 0 5 with the lowest value related to alb1 and the highest one to cpe1 according to the natural breaks classification low values of a al are related only to the soil alb1 aml is for van1 lcm1 vmo1 amh is for ved1 and zie1 while the higher levels ah are for cap1 fra1 ssi1 cpe1 differences in a indicate that soils having al vs ah have greater changes in the watershed response with an average of 1 h and 45 min vs 40 min considering b values range between 0 704 to 0 702 the level classification attributes lower b bl to ss1 and zie1 bml to alb1 and vmo1 bmh van1 and cap1 and bh to cpe1 ved1 lcm1 fra1 soils with bl have a lower change in the network response respect soils in bh however they have a higher sensitivity to changes in the amc with an anticipation of 40 for wet soils vs dry soils vs a delay of about 60 in the same situation for soils having bh the latter effect could be explained by increases in the network properties higher storage capacity for example in 2010 respect 1924 in these areas according to the proposed model eq 7 and considering the average a and b per soil group the different soil groups varying sensitivity to changes in saturation with areas with g1 soils enhancing the network response for saturated vs dry soils δunsi is 30 min greater respect g3 soils 15 min difference more significant differences are expected for entirely saturated soils thus highlighting how network properties play a critical role in runoff production δunsi is 1 h and 15 min greater for g1 vs g3 respect a difference of 30 min in dry conditions 3 4 δunsi network changes interstorm variability and soil according to the aic approach the best model describing variations in the δunsi respect to the considered drivers is expressed by eq 9 9 δ u n s i s o i l g b r l o c b r n t r n a s y m δ f d δ s t o r c a p δ d r a i n d s o i l g b r l o c s

aic approach eq 8 reduces the residual standard error 0 01 increases the r2 0 23 increases f 50 and it increases the degrees of freedom 247 thus effectively removing excessive to estimate the parameters variability storm properties as independent drivers are always significant in average table 6 trn and brn become not significant for high magnitude events in saturated soils conditions this means that they become not significant when the watershed response is completely controlled by the network properties rather than by the soil properties asym on the other hand is not significant for rare events and saturated soils or for frequent events in saturated conditions this means that the rainfall asymmetry has no influence for frequent events when the network controls completely the watershed response or when frequent events more than likely saturate entirely the soils the magnitude of the event is large indeed asym had been shown to have no significant effect on ponding time as displayed in table 5 storm properties interact with soil but for frequent events rp 2 year the location of the peak the number of peaks and the regularity of the rainfall are not significantly correlated with soil groups when the network properties control the response sat 100 completely as an independent predictor the drainage density does not have a significant average correlation with δunsi and it appears to be significant only for frequent events rp 2 year independently from the amc on the other hand difference in storage capacity δstorcap are significant only when the magnitude of events increases rp 50 year for increasing amc sat 100 they become highly important for frequent event instead when they offer the only storage available soil is completely saturated table 6 this because low magnitude events on dry soils will saturate the available soil storage rather than the network one difference in the network fractal dimension δfd are always significant independently from the saturation or the return time of the event these behaviours are maintained when network parameters interact with soils table 6 network and storm properties also interact with relationships between the number of bursts or triangularity and the network fractal dimension increasing soil permeability g1 to g3 generally delay the watershed response however there are instances where increased permeability g1 to g3 anticipates the watershed response namely in the case of multipeak events with regular intensity or single peak intense events fig 8 a or late peak intense fig 8b or negatively skewed storms fig 8c when considering soil permeability together with network properties fig 8d f decrease permeability g3 to g1 matters mostly for decreasing losses of superficial storage with simultaneous high losses in fractal dimension or high losses in storage and low losses in fractal dimension fig 8e in the case of events with regular intensity however decrease permeability delays the network response if changes in network patterns δfd are low fig 8e extreme simultaneous changes in storage capacity and network fractal dimension deltas are high fig 8f are related to a delay in the response for permeable soils fig 8f the more permeable soils g3 produces quicker runoff when changes in the network properties in terms of storage and fractal dimension are low fig 8f independently from soil properties the three network parameters fig 8g extreme modifications during time deltas are high quicken the watershed response however if the network patterns are not modified too much δdraind and δfd are low a loss of superficial storage δstorcap is high is critical in reducing the timing to runoff production fig 8g this interaction between network parameters changes depending on soil type fig 9 if all network parameters are drastically altered deltas are high soil imperviousness enhances the quickening of the watershed response however when the loss of superficial storage is less critical deltas moving towards low and so is the loss of complexity of the network patterns δfd high changes in the drainage density controls the watershed response making permeable soils the most critical anticipation of the timing right hand side of the bottom row in fig 9 the interactions described above changes in relation to soil saturation and event magnitude fig 10 in average independently from the other drivers the delay of the rainfall peak is the parameters that mostly determine a delay in the watershed response differently the highest anticipation in runoff production is due to high changes in fractal dimension related to multipeak events high changes in storage capacity related to events with regular intensity and high changes in drainage density together with an increase in soil permeability for frequent events as saturation increases changes in the network parameters are those determining the strongest anticipation in the watershed response however when the magnitude of the events is high rp 200 year the strongest control on the watershed response is given by the network mostly in the case of dry soils 3 4 1 similarities with previous findings independently from the network properties this research also showed that interstorm variability influence the watershed response confirming other findings in the literature guan et al 2016 qin et al 2013 yao et al 2016 the rainfall peak location has significant effects on runoff for average return times events with late peaks in impervious areas have been shown to produce runoff more quickly than in the past yao et al 2016 findings confirm these results highlighting how in urban watersheds lag time decreased the more delayed the rainfall peak was when using swales for flood reduction qin et al 2013 observed a reduction of flood attenuation capacity the more delayed the peak was this is similar to the proposed analysis where are as having more permeable soils presented decreased differences in the network response the more the rainfall peak was delayed in time considering the network changes and the network response connected to the soil properties sofia and tarolli 2017 found that in maximum soil saturation conditions amc 90 network properties completely control the watershed response and changes are most evident for the lowest return period this research highlighted that as a single predictor the loss of drainage density matters only during frequent events while the storage capacity matters when soil offers reduced storage this is in line with what found in miller et al 2014 where little distinction in hydrological response existed between urban and peri urban developments of similar impervious cover when no significant hydraulic alteration network change was present as a new parameter the reduction of the fractal dimension implies a simplification of the network shape and sinuosity the presented results highlighted that a loss in fractal dimension over time always influences the watershed response with more similar responses the more similar the network shape is this is in line with what the literature for floodplain areas highlighted more sinuous networks reduce peak flows and flooding seo et al 2015 seo and schmidt 2012 and that smaller heterogeneity of path lengths results in higher peak flow a shorter time to peak and shorter duration saco and kumar 2002 as well flood frequency event increases with the decrease of the fractal dimension of the rivers network zhang et al 2015 indicating that the geomorphologic complexity of rivers network has an important effect on flooding this research further highlighted the importance of such changes in relation to soil type and storm properties in average low amc simpler networks decreased fractal dimension results in quicker runoff production especially with an increase of the volume of water falling before the heaviest burst and high concentration of the event the analysis done here showed that rainfall intensification and network shape fractal dimension interact differently depending on soil type during frequent events concentrated rainfalls tend to produce a quicker response in areas with soils prone to saturation and with decreased network complexity however when the event magnitude increases they have the quickest response when rainfall is regular zones with higher permeability instead always present the quicker response to highly concentrated events the simpler the network is similarly previous works highlighted how the shape of hydrographs is determined by interlocking relations between the geometry of the network and temporal and spatial variations of precipitation reaching and traversing a graphically specified network surkan 1969 as well that the relationship between storm speed and direction and the change in the peak runoff is dependent on the network configuration and network efficiency seo and schmidt 2012 these considerations together with the proposed study highlight the importance of focussing on the network shape parameter in the current climatic context of rainfall intensification cortesi et al 2012 monjo and martin vide 2016 sofia et al 2017 this research highlighted that all network parameters interact with different outcomes depending on soil type simplified networks with lowered efficiency storage capacity and path heterogeneity drainage density presents the quicker response independently from the soil type when soils are prone to runoff and the network efficiency is increased the watershed response can be delayed in time when soils have elevated permeability and the network has a reduced efficiency and path heterogeneity increasing the network simplicity would result in similar outcomes as well if the path heterogeneity and network efficiency are increased for a given network sinuosity the watershed response would be delayed this highlight an important suggestion for flood management increasing rainfall infiltration and storage capacity bens et al 2007 marshall et al 2009 or increasing the ways storms can traverse a specified network can help mitigate the effects of land use changes 4 from land drainage to flood management unravelling the chaos currently there is much policy interest in the possible linkages that might exist between land use climate and flood risk alfieri et al 2015 blöschl et al 2017 european parliament and council 2007 feyen et al 2011 pattison and lane 2012 schneider et al 2011 on the one hand this position is sustained by observations from plot and field scale studies that suggest land management does affect runoff macklin and lewin 2015 on the other hand at larger spatiotemporal scales two key factors that lead to the intensification of floods during times are the intensification of causative rainfall and changes in the wetness conditions before rainfall grillakis et al 2016 hlavcova et al 2005 woldemeskel and sharma 2016 and in many catchments soil moisture dependent precipitation excess has been found to be much better predictors of the flooding responses than regional patterns and variability of annual flows berghuijs et al 2016 clearly establishing a link is difficult because of the need to disentangle hydrological response due to anthropogenic changes of the landscape from that due to natural and possible human induced rainfall changes as discussed in the paper multiple previous findings from different disciplines hydrology physical geography confirmed the findings of this paper in relation to the importance of soil storm properties or land use changes in runoff production however putting together those independent findings and descriptive relationships remained chaotic because such an effort would have cut across actual chains of causations and would have not captured the sensitive dependence of those linkages upon the specific catchment scale and event under consideration this paper at the scale of the city political boundaries shows that if there is a relationship between land use management and watershed response it is through the interaction of a range of processes some of which are event specific the assessed results show that not only does a particular change of the drainage in a rural landscape during time has to be carefully investigated with respect to the geography of the catchment soil type but whether or not this change has impacts will end up depending upon the temporal evolution of the rainfall event under consideration this observation shifts the current perspective on historical changes of the landscape that are generally investigated with an overall aim of identifying a universal answer to the question of the link between a specific land use measure storm variability and watershed response the results presented in this work have a wide range of implications measuring extreme flow events is complex and most flood observations already contain a mix of measurement and theory pattison and lane 2012 as a consequence the relationship between land use and flood characteristics is generally showed as simple correlations between the two factors the proposed analysis considers realistic soil data and network structures including the time evolution of such structure and identifies ponding time and watershed responses on the basis of these actual data as compared to storm characteristics the application of eq 7 to different soil types confirms that runoff production and ponding time independently from the soil characteristics follow a common law in nature power law but it further demonstrates that soil properties play an important role in this providing a new insight on the scaling of such relationship to different study areas or for landscape evolution analysis and flood modeling the beginning of the effective rainfall in modeling approaches could be now based on such power laws to simulate events at different magnitude or for different amc further the development of eqs 8 and 9 provides a physical insight on the storm properties controlling the most runoff production and they disentangle the range of processes some of which are event specific that overall control changes in the watershed response this opens new research lines on the importance of land use and climate variability influencing flood generating conditions over timescales of societal relevance generalising their field of action despite comprising a large number of variables exemplifies the fact that land use effects network changes are not mutually exclusive from climate change impacts describing the land use link to flooding has proved difficult since impact has to be disentangled from the climate change effect pattison and lane 2012 sofia et al 2017 many recent studies highlighted how climate is moving toward more intense events with anticipated peaks cortesi et al 2012 feyen et al 2011 monjo and martin vide 2016 woldemeskel and sharma 2016 this work analysing storm characteristics such as its triangularity asymmetry and the peak location together with soil properties and drainage network changes highlights how it is likely that land use changes could amplify the effect of climatic variability at present it is thought that land use change effects are of second order importance behind natural climatic variability o connell et al 2004 2007 but this research hints to the fact that land management policies through a correct planning and management of new or existing networks might be also used to mitigate the effect of climate variability on increasing flood risk overall the proposed analysis show that changes in the same land management practice in terms of network structure will have different effects depending on where it has implemented and also when implemented in the same location may have different impacts on different flood events due to unique spatio temporal patterns of precipitation and soil properties the effect of this specific land management entity network structure furthermore may also change as different processes and interactions emerge for example network changes follows both urbanisation and changes in agricultural mechanisation sofia and tarolli 2017 modern techniques include heavy machinery being used and this can lead to surface roughness collecting runoff tarolli et al 2019 and possibly to a reduction of the hydraulic conductivity of soils coutadeur et al 2002 it is possible for these process impacts to exist at the local scale and interact with the changes in climate soil characteristics and network properties and this should be further investigated 5 final remarks this study analysed the combined product of the storm variability and watershed geomorphology in controlling water fluxes in an agricultural floodplain area in this landscape the configuration of the network layout is not automatically or naturally determined by the topography but rather by operational choices due to irrigation urbanisation or reclamation purposes the results showed that flooding could arise as a combined product of the storm properties soil type and network properties combining the results from previous studies this study showed that it is necessary to consider the planning of the layout of the drainage network with intent because it does have a relationship with the watershed response as well the network layout cannot be taken into consideration without a correct awareness of the different soil properties to mitigate the effects of land use changes in a changing climate where concentrated weather events are expected to generate a larger number of floods land managers should focus on understanding and improving the surface soil permeability this could be accomplished either by increasing the rainfall infiltration and storage capacity or by modifying the ways storms reach and traverse a specified network future research work should also keep into account information about groundwater level and soil crusting and compaction due to different agricultural techniques to improve the understanding of these potential drivers in increasing flooding risk acknowledgments lidar

706,accurate awareness of how rainfall land use changes and soil types control water fluxes in agricultural floodplains remains a crucial challenge in water resource research this study examines soil moisture conditions soil texture and rainfall characteristics together with different artificial drainage network structures covering a time span of 100 years 1924 2010 as drivers for runoff production in an agricultural floodplain the research incorporates a multiple layer generalised green ampt approach to simulate water infiltration into the ground once the storage offered by the soil is saturated a portion of the surface storage provided by the drainage network satisfies the infiltration capacity thus delaying runoff the watershed response is defined by the unsi updated network saturated index sofia and tarolli 2017 that indicates the moment the available storage soil network is 100 saturated the results highlighted how interlocking relations between soil properties the geometry of the network and temporal variations of precipitation determine runoff generation timing for short return times intense rainfalls tend to produce a quicker response in areas with soils prone to saturation and with decreased network complexity however when the event magnitude increases this combination of soil and network structure produces the fastest response when rainfall is more regular intense events in zones with soils with higher permeability produce a quicker response the simpler the network is when soils are prone to runoff and the network efficiency increases runoff production is delayed in time when soils have elevated permeability and the network has a reduced efficiency and path heterogeneity increasing the network simplicity would result in similar outcomes moreover if the path heterogeneity and network efficiency increases for a given network sinuosity runoff generation would be delayed quantifying these effects is indeed crucial for many environmental problems including the prediction of impacts of a changing climate and land use and the associated pressures keywords soil infiltration lidar green ampt runoff flood 1 introduction in a changing climate weather events are expected to generate an increasing number of floods threatening urbanised landscapes sofia et al 2017 zhang et al 2012 and increasing people vulnerability roder et al 2017 many factors affect runoff processes and they can influence flood management and prediction the most important are topography soil properties and land use kalantari et al 2014 amongst human modifications of topography drainage networks are one of the vital components of the landscape they have traditionally been linked with important human settlements throughout history chin et al 2013

also be ascribed to climate effects blöschl et al 2017 dominated mostly by multidecadal variability rather than by long term trends hodgkins et al 2017 however the effects of various storm characteristics on rainfall runoff coupled with imperviousness at the scale of small urbanised systems have not been fully determined guan et al 2016 qin et al 2013 yao et al 2016 identifying the hydrological consequences of these drivers network properties and climate is complicated and requires detailed and accurate data fang et al 2012 van den elsen et al 2003 quantifying these effects is crucial for many environmental problems including the prediction of impacts of a changing climate and land use and the associated pressures but also in the transport of solutes and contaminants botter

coupled with soil characteristics texture antecedent moisture condition and drainage network structures covering a time span of 100 years on runoff production the paper purposely focusses on soil and network properties without considering the influence of land use and land cover the research aims to disentangle inter storm variability landscape soil and human drivers in runoff production more specifically rather than discussing the importance of each driver as single predictor this research highlights their importance and interaction in the complex system of a floodplain agricultural area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the research area covers about 30 km2 and it belongs to two municipalities in the province of padua veneto north eastern italy megliadino san vitale and megliadino san fidenzio fig 1 the study site is bounded by administrative boundaries not by watershed divides in this floodplain landscape the definition of a topographic watershed is very complex and since most of the flows are mechanically controlled each pumping station defines an independent sub unit where flows are constrained the area is about 70 km south west of venice and 35 km south west of padua it is mostly flat avg slope is 2 9 and it is a typical example of the diffuse city environment besussi et al 1998 fabian 2012 it is part of the holocenic plain formed by the adige and agno guà frassine rivers the landscape is mostly agricultural with some spotted urbanised areas that have increased in the last ten years mostly following the road network shape the main agricultural activities include vineyards olive orchards and crop cultivations with more intensive crop and vines production near the urbanised areas the available topographic information is a lidar digital terrain model dtm surveyed in 2008 2010 horizontal accuracy of about 0 3 m and vertical accuracy of 0 15 m fig 1a together with historical maps from 1924 to estimate past drainage network courtesy of consorzio di bonifica adige euganeo fig 1b and 1d and a classification of soils for the whole location fig 1c the soils are characterized by a certain degree of heterogeneity ranging from fine silty inceptisols oxyaquic haplustepts to coarse texture entisols typic ustipsamments to soil rich in organic carbon fluventic hapludolls or with buried organic horizons table 1 arpav 2015 the available soil information stems from pedotransfer functions ptfs based on actual properties of the soil matrix including bulk density organic matter and soil texture arpav 2011 for soils with clay 0 49 and sand 0 50 local authorities applied the ungaro et al 2005 ptfs derived from benchmark soils in the pianura padano veneta northern italy outside the mentioned texture ranges the soil water retention is evaluated from ptfs defined by rawls et al 2003 calibrated on field surveyed values of percentage of clay sand and organic carbon the hydraulic conductivity derives from ptfs calibrated on clay sand and bulk density according to brakensiek et al 1984 2 2 network characterisation a correct characterisation of the drainage network is essential to predict the likely responses of flooding to the large scale changes in the complexity of the drainage system induced by changes in socio economic drivers the study site was divided into subareas of 250 m 250 m to capture the geometry of the network and permanent variations in soil sealing urban expansion three parameters characterise the irrigation network storage capacity drainage density and fractal dimension while storage capacity and drainage density are mostly related to irrigation needs we assumed the fractal dimension to be representative of changes in the network shapes due to changes in agricultural mechanisation and field properties thanks to the availability of a high resolution lidar dtm it has been possible to identify and characterise the current drainage network cazorzi et al 2013 automatically the approach is direct and straightforward and it is based on a detrending technique the topographic information is filtered using a low pass filter resulting in a smoothed surface to subtract from the original lidar dtm cazorzi et al 2013 as the height in the detrended data represents a height difference from a smoothed surface positive peak values highlight microtopographic elements in the landscape in this case the drainage network hence a statistic threshold can be applied to extract the features of interest for each extracted element it is possible to estimate a width and length and thus aggregate this information to estimate an average channel width and subsequently the water storage per areal units please refer to cazorzi et al 2013 sofia et al 2014 for a detailed description of the procedure for the past network we digitalised the drainage channels from historical maps from 1924 gazzin 2017 for each subarea we assumed an average channel cross section equal to the mean value estimated for the year 2010 sofia et al 2014 water storage volumes were then estimated starting from the network length and cross section area for each section to better describe the river networks in this paper the fractal dimension fd for each network is estimated by applying box counting approach backes and bruno 2012 coelho and costa 1996 to evaluate the fd square boxes with side length ɛ were generated and placed over the network the number of boxes n ɛ in which a part of the fractal falls is then counted n ɛ increases with the decrease of the size of the box the fractal dimension fd is then the slope of the relationship between log ε and log n ε according to eqution log n ɛ f d log ɛ c where c is a constant of proportionality which allows for the relationship between n and ɛ zhang et al 2015 for this study case we evaluated fd for each 250 m x 250 m subarea thus the size of the box varied from 1 to 250 m to reduce the high variability the changes in the network characteristics storage capacity δstorcap drainage density δdraind fractal dimension δfd between the two reference years 2010 1924 have been classified into four classes fig 2 g h i named low l medium low ml medium high mh and high h the classes were defined according to a natural breaks classification seeking to minimise each class s average deviation from its mean while maximising each class s deviation from the means of the other groups each class indicates the differences between each parameter in 2010 respect 1924 high means much lower value of the parameter in 2010 respect 1924 it is important to highlight that the low and part of the medium low class represent areas where the network properties increased in 2010 respect to the past for the δstorcap and δdraind the change is towards the end of the ml class while for δfd it is at the beginning of the ml class 2 3 rainfall runoff mechanism this paper considers the updated network saturation index unsi sofia and tarolli 2017 that indicates the time needed for a designed rainfall to saturate the available storage volume depending on the soil characteristics and antecedent moisture condition amc see sofia and tarolli 2017 for the details the basic steps applied for the evaluation of this index are i create depth duration frequency ddf curves see svensson and jones 2010 for a full review to simulate synthetic rainfalls ii simulate a reference rainfall with different hyetographs shapes iii evaluate the infiltration to simulate the effective rainfall and runoff to compute the unsi 2 3 1 storm and interstorm variability to evaluate the effect of storm variability on the watershed response regarding ponding time and the difference in unsi and to make a comparative analysis we followed sofia and tarolli 2017 and we considered the same hyetographs of the referenced work 17 hyetographs hyetographs include a dimensionless rainfall wilson et al 2006 hyetographs for rainfalls of 1 2 4 8 24 48 72 168 240 h florida department of transportation 2015 the scs nrcs hydrographs type i for a design storm of 24 and 48 h type ia for 24 h type ii for a design storm of 24 and 48 h and type iii for 24 h cronshey 1986 and two more hyetographs proposed for a rainfall of 72 and 96 h st johns river water management district 2010 storms could assume multiple forms and these hyetographs are mostly considered as reference example to provide the possibility of generalising the results we considered a qualitative characterisation of the interstorm variability sofia and tarolli 2017 mathematically characterised the rainfall bursts within the storm where a burst is an abrupt change in rainfall rate huff 1967 the authors defined four criteria specifically i the time in percentage of the total to the heaviest burst brloc ii the number of bursts brn iii the shape of the hyetograph trn as in the ratio between the hyetograph area and the area of a triangle having as base the hyetograph duration and as height the height of the main rainfall burst iv the asymmetry of the storm volumes asym defined as the ratio between the amount of rainfall fell before the maximum burst and that after the burst we qualitatively classified each rainfall parameter table 2 according to a natural breaks classification for this classifications asymmetry has been defined as negatively skewed ns right centred rc left centred lc and positively skewed ps trn has been defined as low l medium low ml medium high mh and high h brloc has been defined as beginning b first half fh second half sh and end e furthermore brn has been defined as single peak sp or multi peaks mp fig 3 shows a descriptive example of the different qualitative measures these criteria highlight some climatic characteristics changes in brloc can simulate changes in climate to heavy rainfalls beginning earlier abbs 1999 within a storm the contribute of intense rainfall events cortesi et al 2012 sofia et al 2017 zhang et al 2009 can be simulated according to different brn and trn as well trn and asymmetry can simulate the effect of rainfall non uniformity a critical element increasing flooding wasko 2014 wasko and sharma 2015 for simulation purposes it is necessary to define a rainfall duration sofia and tarolli 2017 considered the time needed for a rainfall to fill the available superficial storage capacity their work did not account for infiltrated water to define this timing in this study since we have different soil types we decided to focus on a duration able to produce an effective rainfall rainfall minus infiltration able to fill the 90th percentile of the storage volumes available in 1924 storage capacity volume is a distributed value one value per subarea of 250 m 250 m thus some local peaks might be related to outliers or locally extracted areas by considering the 90th percentile of these values we ensure the effective rainfall to have a realistic duration and amount to obtain the rainfall duration we simulated an average dry soil type defining a soil having as hydraulic parameters an area weighted average of the parameters of each available soil in the study area and an initial moisture content of 0 to define the rainfall duration we re created a variable rate pattern based on average characteristics of storms defined by the whole set of hyetographs and we selected the time producing an average rainfall intensity average considering all the possible hyetographs able to saturate the first layer of the abovementioned average dry soil type for this study the storm time t is 6 4 h and the rainfall cumulated amount refers to that derived for t 6 4 h and ddf curves for a return time of 2 5 10 30 50 100 200 years 2 3 2 generalized green ampt model previously sofia and tarolli 2017 the infiltration had been investigated considering a single layer of soil and a single soil type however in nature layered soils are the norm rather than the exception independently from the number of layers when a wetting front moves from one layer to the next the infiltration rate will be reduced due to i reduced hydraulic conductivity if a wetting front moves from a more porous to a less porous layer ii reduced wetting front suction in the opposite scenario furthermore if the soils in the lower layers are much coarser than the top ones the wetting front may become unstable and reduce the infiltration substantially downer and ogden 2003 for this reason this work applies a generalised version of green and ampt 1911 approach here the effect of layering is addressed averaging the soil properties based on the depths of the layers downer and ogden 2003 the same basic assumption of the green ampt model applies that is that of a sharp wetting front as the wetting front crosses the layers the model assumes an instantaneous change in the initial moisture content porosity and wetting front suction head for a cumulative infiltration at the t time step f t in a layered soil with a total depth of dtot composed of i layers each one having a specific hydraulic conductivity ki cm h depth di cm moisture deficit δθ i as in the difference between the saturated water content θ s and the initial water content θ i the effective hydraulic conductivity at the time step t is evaluated as 1 k t d 1 f t d 1 δ θ 1 δ θ 2 d 1 k 1 f t d 1 δ θ 1 δ θ 2 k 2 when z d 1 2 k t n 1 i 1 d n f t n 1 i 1 d n δ θ n δ θ i n 1 i 1 d n k n f t n 1 i 1 d n δ θ n δ θ i k i when d t o t z d 1 with z being the depth of the leading wetting front evaluated as d i 1 f t δ θ i flerchinger et al 1988 that is while the front is in the first layer the hydraulic conductivity at any time kt is equal to k1 the hydraulic conductivity of the first soil horizon when the leading edge passes the first layer the effective hydraulic conductivity is calculated based on the depth of the leading edge of the wetting front z as a harmonic mean of the wetted layers downer and ogden 2003 the cumulative infiltration solved iteratively using the newton raphson method upton et al 2008 at the t 1 time level is chow et al 1988 is 3 f t 1 f t k t δ t f δ θ ln f t 1 f δ θ f t f δ θ the infiltration rate is 4 f t 1 k t f δ θ f t 1 1 where ψ f is the wetting front suction head and δθ is the moisture deficit of the layer containing the leading front if at any timestep the rainfall intensity is higher than infiltration capacity ft the excess rainfall will first fill the surface storage and then contribute to surface runoff thus a significant parameter is the ponding time eq 5 or the time at which infiltration stops and runoff starts for a storm of a specific duration and intensity p tp is given by 5 t p k i ψ f θ s θ i p p k i where k and δθ are the effective conductivity and the moisture deficit of the layer containing the leading front and ψ f is the wetting front suction head the local authorities arpav 2015 provided the input required for the green ampt model table 1 changes in the surrounding environment dynamically alter the hydraulic conductivity of the soil matrix therefore the infiltration parameters for the green ampt equation should change for each storm event risse et al 1995 different saturation 0 25 50 75 90 100 were simulated to account for changes in the soil due to the antecedent soil moisture conditions amc as 6 θ i θ s m with m 0 00 0 25 0 50 0 75 0 90 1 00 with θ s saturated moisture content and θ i initial antecedent moisture content 2 4 statistical inference 2 4 1 return time and saturation vs ponding time and unsi according to sofia and tarolli 2017 ponding time and δunsi vary depending on the event return period or the saturation condition following 7 y a e b x with y being the ponding time tp or the δunsi x being the return period or the saturation condition and a and b two empirical coefficients of different magnitude for this study we tested the same hypothesis fitting the proposed equation to the δunsi and ponding times evaluated in each subarea within the study site having a homogeneous soil type the areas represented in fig 1c the fitting was accomplished by a non linear approximation approach based on a gaussian model in this method the parameters of the approximating functions are not necessarily linear on the original function and they are determined using non linear optimisation dennis et al 1996 the fitting automatically calculates optimised start points for gaussian models based on the fitted dataset and imposes no bounds on the resulting coefficients further we tested the value of r2 for each fitted equation with a two tailed student s t test for statistical significance at α 0 05 this procedure is implemented to verify if the sofia and tarolli 2017 also applies when infiltration is evaluated using a multi layer green ampt approach and to verify the effects of different soil types the fitted values of a and b have been classified according to a natural breaks classification assessing changes in the coefficients it is not an easy task identifying significant variations between coefficients given their order of magnitude is challenging classifying them into classes of high low values ensure a greater understanding of the data and highlights differences better as a consequence the results will be discussed addressing a and b as low a l b l medium low a ml b ml medium high a mh b mh and high a h b h a and b fitted for tp have been plotted together to define hydrological similarities between the different soils we applied a k means clustering algorithm david and vassilvitski 2007 to partition the soils into three main groups the k means clustering for its simplicity and speed is a widely used iterative data partitioning algorithm that minimises the average squared distance between points in the same cluster david and vassilvitski 2007 2 4 2 quantifying differences the influence of the hyetographs shapes soil types and network parameters on ponding time or δunsi was tested using multiple linear regression models considering each criterion as a single predictor or implying an interaction among them statistically an interaction describes a situation in which the simultaneous influence of two variables on a third is not additive given the high number of variables four storm parameters and three network parameters this research aimed to optimise the best subset of predictors to explain the watershed response redundant predictors should be removed to explain the data most simply and effectively and to reduce collinearity moreover unnecessary predictors would merely add noise to the estimation of the ponding time and δunsi rather than explaining them thus as a novel step respect to sofia and tarolli 2017 we consider the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1987 1981 pan 2001 as an estimator of the relative quality of the statistical model for each given set of data given a collection of models for the data the aic forward backwards selection estimates the quality of each model relative to each of the other models all the assumptions for the regression models were checked and in the case of non linearity between explanatory and response variables a boxplot transformation was applied further the cook distance cook 1979 was used to remove outliers when needed we tested the presence of serial correlation among the residuals and when present the durbin watson dw test durbin and watson 1950 at α 0 05 confirmed or declined the significance of the relationship given by the analysis of variance anova results the significance threshold level for the anova was set to p 0 05 3 results 3 1 ponding time vs return period and saturation eq 7 was fitted to the values of ponding time tp as a function of the return period rp fig 4 a or saturation sat fig 4b table 3 reports the estimated a and b coefficients obtained for each soil type as well as the goodness of fits when considering the relationship with the return period fig 4a table 3 testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows there is a significant relationship between the two variables as observed for a different soil in sofia and tarolli 2017 the return period has a weaker influence on ponding at the increase of the magnitude of the event increasing rp the saturation time always decreases observing the coefficients of tp f rp for the same return period soils with al would saturate quicker than soils having ah however differences arise depending on the magnitude of the events the response of soils in al are not that marked for the lowest return periods rp 2 year while they are highly evident a saturation 60 faster for the less frequent events rp 200 year for a similar b soils having al display a higher sensitivity to changes in the return period the less frequent event rp 200 year would result in a decrease of the ponding time of about 1 h and a half 63 for soils with al whereas for soils having ah the same change would result in an anticipation of the ponding time of about 1 h 40 the values of b assume the highest value for the mostly sandy soil cap1 and the lowest value for the soil lcm1 with clay in the upper horizon changes in b result in similar changes in ponding time independently from the return period with soils in bl having a quicker saturation 60 respect soils in bh however changes in the return period from a frequent rp 2 year to a rare rp 200 year event for a similar a would result in higher changes in ponding time for soils having bh respect to soils having bl 1 5 h vs 50 m respectively observing a and b together fig 4a the k means algorithm define three groups g1 g2 and g3 according to variations in ponding time vs return period al and bl bound the first group g1 that includes lcm1 ved1 and alb1 alb1 is the soil with silty loam texture in all horizons table 1 lcm1 has clay in the first horizon loam in the second and silty loam in the third while ved1 presents loam in all horizons table 1 the second group g2 is bounded by amd medium low medium high and bmd medium low medium high and it comprises cpe1 fra1 van1 cpe1 presents clay loam or loamy horizons fra1 silty clay loam and van1 has loamy horizons closer to the surface or sandy loam horizons in depth the third group g3 has ah and bmh h and it includes ss1 zie1 vmo1 and cap1 ss1 presents silty clay loam horizons alternated to silt loam horizons zie1 presents silty clay loam texture up to about 120 cm of depth and then silt loam vmo1 is entirely silty clay loam while cap1 is sandy loam closer to the surface and sandy in depth according to the proposed model eq 7 and averaging a and b for each group for the same return period soils pertaining to g1 would saturate earlier in time respect soils in g3 with slight differences depending on the frequency of the events 22 for rp 2 year vs 40 for rp 200 year the change in response due to the change in the event frequency rp 2 year to rp 200 year would be 60 more evident for soils in g1 vs soils in g3 this classification highlights how changes in the magnitude of the events have a more significant effect on ponding time than soil texture when taken as an independent parameter when considering saturation fig 4b testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows that except for the soil cap1 there is a significant relationship between the two variables one must notice that cap1 is the only soil characterised by a sandy texture the lack of correlation between ponding time and saturation is mostly because a large number of the simulated hyetographs is not capable of saturating this specific soil for the considered rainfall duration observing the coefficients of tp f sat as expected they show a negative correlation between ponding time and saturation with a reduction of the ponding time at the increase of the soil moisture content lower values of a are related to soils having silty loam textures whereas a increases for soils having more uniform silty clay loam textures to reach the highest values for sandy soils this defines more permeable soils ah result in delayed ponding times vs more impervious soils with an increase of about 70 in time independently from the saturation considering the parameter b the lowest values bl are related to lcm1 while the coefficient progressively increases to reach the highest values at the increase of the permeability or water retention capacity fra1 van1 lcm1 zie1 cap1 differences in b determine differences in response to the amc for the same saturation sat 0 bh vs bl results in an almost unnoticeable delayed response 0 5 whereas an almost saturated soil sat 90 would have a delay of 5 in ponding time as well soils with bh would result in a lower response to saturation changes with about a 4 delay in time changing from dry to saturated soils sat 0 to 90 whereas soils with bl would result doubled time increase 8 for the same saturation change considering both a and b fig 4b soils can be clustered together into three groups the first group g1 is bounded by al and bl ml and it includes lcm1 ved1 and alb1 the second group g2 is bounded by aml and bmd medium low medium high and it comprises cpe1 fra1 van1 the third group g3 has amh h and bmd h and it includes ss1 zie1 vmo1 and cap1 interestingly this classification creates the same groups like the one for the return period equation coefficients thus indicating how soil textures and hydraulic properties in general plays a similar role in soil response respect changes in amc and magnitude of the rainfall event according to the proposed model eq 7 and averaging a and b in each group for the same saturation conditions soils pertaining to g1 would saturate about 70 earlier in time respect soils in g3 with slight differences depending on the soil moisture condition 69 for sat 0 vs 75 for sat 90 averaging soils in g1 saturates in about 1 h and 45 min vs soils in g3 that saturates in about 3 h the change in response due to the change in saturation sat 0 to 90 would be 50 more evident for soils in g1 vs soils in g3 this classification highlights how changes in textures have a more significant effect on ponding time than amc 3 2 ponding time and interstorm variability according to the aic approach the best fit model to represent the variations in ponding time is given by eq 8 8 p t i m e s o i l g b r l o c b r n t r n a s y m s o i l g b r l o c s o i l g t r n s o i l g b r l o c t r n b r l o c t r n b r l o c a s y m t r n a s y m b r l o c t r n a s y m b r n t r n s o i l g b r n t r n the final model present a residual standard error of 0 30 on 148 of freedom df multiple r2 of 0 91 adjusted r2 of 0 89 f statistic 67 36 on 21 and 148 df and p value 2 2e 16 compared to the model before the aic approach eq 8 reduces the residual standard error 0 01 increases the r2 0 01 increases f 20 and it increases the degrees of freedom 10 thus effectively removing drivers excessive to estimate the parameters variability the location of the heaviest storm burst brloc the regularity of the rainfall intensity trn the asymmetry of the rainfall volume asym have in average a statistically significant influence the ponding time table 4 while brloc is always significant independently from the magnitude of the events and from the amc trn becomes significant only for increasing saturation sat 50 table 4 or for increasing magnitude on dry soils rp 200 year sat 0 asym is only significant for dry soils and average return periods sat 50 rp 2 year table 4 or for rare events with increasing amc sat 50 rp 200 year table 4 the number of bursts brn is only significant for dry soils and rather frequent events rp 50 year sat 0 always significant with average amc independently from the magnitude of the events and it is significant for very rare rp 200 year or rather frequent rp 2 year events in saturated amc sat 90 overall early peak events brloc b vs e fig 5 tend to reduce the ponding time negatively skewed hyetographs also determine a quicker runoff production overall rainfall intensity trn l vs h also influence negatively the ponding time and so do multipeak rainfalls but only when intensity is high trn low interactions in fact arise independently from soil groups the location of the peak the asymmetry of the rainfall and its triangularity matter at all saturation and independently from the magnitude of the event table 4 fig 5a soil groups on the other hand interact with storm triangularity and peak location fig 5b and with triangularity and number of bursts fig 5c but the strength of this interaction changes with changes in saturation fig 6 runoff production is the quickest for intense storms trn l with early peaks brloc b vs e fig 5a and negatively skewed hyetographs most of the rainfall volume falling before the bursts a strong quickening in runoff production is also related to intense events trn low fig 5b and impervious soils g1 especially for early peak storms brloc e faster runoff productions are also related to impervious soils g1 and intense trn low multipeak brn mp storms fig 5c the type of correlation with ponding time as described above however changes at different saturations sat and return period rp for the various predictors fig 6 the importance of soil groups as independent predictor decreases at the increase of saturation moving from soils in g1 more permeable to g3 less permeable decreases the ponding time fig 5 but these textural changes matter the most in low amc sat 50 fig 6 the predictor with the highest negative effect on ponding time is the number of peaks brn with the highest negative effect on ponding time in dry soils the highest positive effect is given by the interaction between soil groups and number of peaks especially in frequent events rp 2 year and dry soils sat 0 followed by the interaction between triangularity trn number of peaks brn increasing the magnitude of the events reduces the correlation between each predictor s and ponding time interestingly there is a drastic shift in correlation between low magnitude events rp 2 year and extreme ones rp 200 year for the soil soilg as single predictor or interacting with others the number of peaks brn as single predictor or interacting with others and triangularity trn as single predictor or interacting with others for low magnitude events the increase in saturation reduces the anticipation of ponding time at the changes in soil texture at the increase of peak numbers and the more regular the events are differently extreme events produce a quicker runoff at the increase of the peak number and of the intensity of the event 3 2 1 similarities with previous findings analysing the actual soil response without considering the network changes offers a starting point to understand future changes sofia and tarolli 2017 for this case study focusing on soil response the results underlined how changes in the magnitude of the events has a larger effect on ponding time than soil texture when taken as an independent parameter while different texture classes have a larger effect on ponding time than amc the effect of texture on ponding time is also observed for other parts of the world where initial soil moisture effects on the flood response have been shown to depend on event magnitude rather than on the climate or region properties grillakis et al 2016 when considering interstorm variability this research confirmed what found in sofia and tarolli 2017 the proposed analysis suggests that an expected quickening of the runoff production is related to rainfall having a large intensity peak at the beginning of the storm coupled with an increase of the volume of water falling before the heaviest burst and intensity of the event the effects of the peak locations are in line with what found in the literature zhang et al 1997 reported that runoff was twice as large and quicker in early peak events than in delayed peak events that delivered the same total depth of rain in the same event duration similarly when dealing with chemical losses on relatively dry soils amc 6 potter et al 2006 found greater chemical loss thus a quicker runoff with early peak than in constant intensity simulated rainfall events having the same duration the latter effect is also found in this study where low values of rainfall triangularity thus a high concentration of the event coupled with the rainfall burst location and rainfall asymmetry resulting in a decreased ponding time similar conclusions have been found by frauenfeld and truman 2004 as well dunkerley 2012 found the longest average time to runoff was related to late peak events followed by uniform events early peak events shed runoff more quickly and early peak gap event in which the peak is very close to the start of the event yielded the shortest time to runoff this research further observed the effects of storm properties on different soil groups overall the general behaviours described independently from soils are maintained in all simulations however differences have been found for the number of peaks in permeable soils g3 frequent multi peak events in average or almost saturated amc resulted in a delayed runoff production for these soils this was also highlighted in relation to rainfall regularity more regular rainfalls with multiple peaks for frequent or rather frequent events increased the ponding time mei and anagnostou 2015 found that multi peak runoff event timing properties are in general taking larger values and wider value ranges than those of the single peak ones frauenfeld and truman 2004 speculated that many of the differences between different events might be accounted for in terms of greater tendency to soil surface sealing arising in the higher peak intensity of the variable intensity events higher surface permeability might also exist in the uppermost soil of uniform events dunkerley 2012 thus soil surface sealing should not be expected for regular events especially in the more permeable soils hence the lower ponding time for multi peak regular rainfalls 3 3 δunsi vs return time and saturation eq 7 was fitted to the values of δunsi and return period fig 8a or saturation fig 8b table 5 reports the estimated a and b coefficients obtained for each soil type as well as the goodness of fits when considering the relationship with the return period fig 7 a testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows there is a significant relationship between the two variables values of a range from 2 2 to 0 5 with the lowest value related to alb1 and the highest one to zie1 according to the natural breaks classification low values of a al are related only to zones with soils alb1 aml is for van1 lcm1 ss1 and ved1 amh is for vmo1 and cpe1 while the higher levels ah are for cap1 fra1 zie1 in this case there is no correlation between the values of a and the soil properties this because the δunsi is also influenced by the network properties the values of b range from 0 0079 to 0 0033 the level classification attributes low values of b to areas with the alb1 soil bml is for van1 lcm1 ss1 and ved1 bmh is for zie1 while the higher levels bh are for cap1 fra1 vmo1 different levels of b imply that for the same a soils having bl have a watershed response δunsi about 30 min quicker in 2010 respect 1924 while soils with bh have a response about 1 h quicker as well changes in the magnitude of the events for soils with bl produce more visible effects with a reduction of the unsi to about 30 min for the rare vs the frequent events soils in bh instead have a difference of only 20 min by observing both a and b at the same time fig 7a alb1 appears to be isolated even if both confidence bounds overlap with the other soils one must note that alb1 is the soil where the most significant urbanisation happened over the years and the network conformation changed the most by using the group classification proposed for the ponding time in the δunsi realm soils in g1 are bounded by al and bml l soils in g2 are more scattered and are bounded by aml h and bml h soils in g3 are bounded in bmh and aml according to the proposed model eq 7 and considering the average a and b per soil group g1 has an average δunsi of about 1 h whereas soils in g3 have an average δunsi of about 30 min this indicates that soils in g1 together with being more prone to runoff see the previous chapter have witnessed a more significant change in the network response with a much quicker response in 2010 vs 1924 as well the areas with soils in g1 have a much higher sensitivity to changes in the magnitude of the events with rare events increasing the changes of up 30 min respect to less than 10 min for the areas with soils in g2 and g3 higher changes are expected for frequent events 1 h for soils in g1 respect to g3 rather than for rare events 22 min considering saturation fig 7b testing the value of r2 for this equation with a two tailed student s t test at α 0 05 shows there is a significant relationship between the two variables except for the soils alb1 van1 and cap1 these three are the soils of the areas that have been mostly modified during the years thus saturation plays a lower role in the watershed response compared to modification of the network itself confirming what found in sofia and tarolli 2017 when considering the saturation condition the scaling coefficient a overlaps with that of eq 7 fitted for the return period while the exponent b has a larger order of magnitude values of a range from 1 7 to 0 5 with the lowest value related to alb1 and the highest one to cpe1 according to the natural breaks classification low values of a al are related only to the soil alb1 aml is for van1 lcm1 vmo1 amh is for ved1 and zie1 while the higher levels ah are for cap1 fra1 ssi1 cpe1 differences in a indicate that soils having al vs ah have greater changes in the watershed response with an average of 1 h and 45 min vs 40 min considering b values range between 0 704 to 0 702 the level classification attributes lower b bl to ss1 and zie1 bml to alb1 and vmo1 bmh van1 and cap1 and bh to cpe1 ved1 lcm1 fra1 soils with bl have a lower change in the network response respect soils in bh however they have a higher sensitivity to changes in the amc with an anticipation of 40 for wet soils vs dry soils vs a delay of about 60 in the same situation for soils having bh the latter effect could be explained by increases in the network properties higher storage capacity for example in 2010 respect 1924 in these areas according to the proposed model eq 7 and considering the average a and b per soil group the different soil groups varying sensitivity to changes in saturation with areas with g1 soils enhancing the network response for saturated vs dry soils δunsi is 30 min greater respect g3 soils 15 min difference more significant differences are expected for entirely saturated soils thus highlighting how network properties play a critical role in runoff production δunsi is 1 h and 15 min greater for g1 vs g3 respect a difference of 30 min in dry conditions 3 4 δunsi network changes interstorm variability and soil according to the aic approach the best model describing variations in the δunsi respect to the considered drivers is expressed by eq 9 9 δ u n s i s o i l g b r l o c b r n t r n a s y m δ f d δ s t o r c a p δ d r a i n d s o i l g b r l o c s

final model has a residual standard error of 0 51 on 2026 of freedom df multiple r2 of 0 66 adjusted r2 of 0 65 f statistic 61 27 on 64 and 2026 df and p value 2 2e 16 compared to the model before the aic approach eq 8 reduces the residual standard error 0 01 increases the r2 0 23 increases f 50 and it increases the degrees of freedom 247 thus effectively removing excessive to estimate the parameters variability storm properties as independent drivers are always significant in average table 6 trn and brn become not significant for high magnitude events in saturated soils conditions this means that they become not significant when the watershed response is completely controlled by the network properties rather than by the soil properties asym on the other hand is not significant for rare events and saturated soils or for frequent events in saturated conditions this means that the rainfall asymmetry has no influence for frequent events when the network controls completely the watershed response or when frequent events more than likely saturate entirely the soils the magnitude of the event is large indeed asym had been shown to have no significant effect on ponding time as displayed in table 5 storm properties interact with soil but for frequent events rp 2 year the location of the peak the number of peaks and the regularity of the rainfall are not significantly correlated with soil groups when the network properties control the response sat 100 completely as an independent predictor the drainage density does not have a significant average correlation with δunsi and it appears to be significant only for frequent events rp 2 year independently from the amc on the other hand difference in storage capacity δstorcap are significant only when the magnitude of events increases rp 50 year for increasing amc sat 100 they become highly important for frequent event instead when they offer the only storage available soil is completely saturated table 6 this because low magnitude events on dry soils will saturate the available soil storage rather than the network one difference in the network fractal dimension δfd are always significant independently from the saturation or the return time of the event these behaviours are maintained when network parameters interact with soils table 6 network and storm properties also interact with relationships between the number of bursts or triangularity and the network fractal dimension increasing soil permeability g1 to g3 generally delay the watershed response however there are instances where increased permeability g1 to g3 anticipates the watershed response namely in the case of multipeak events with regular intensity or single peak intense events fig 8 a or late peak intense fig 8b or negatively skewed storms fig 8c when considering soil permeability together with network properties fig 8d f decrease permeability g3 to g1 matters mostly for decreasing losses of superficial storage with simultaneous high losses in fractal dimension or high losses in storage and low losses in fractal dimension fig 8e in the case of events with regular intensity however decrease permeability delays the network response if changes in network patterns δfd are low fig 8e extreme simultaneous changes in storage capacity and network fractal dimension deltas are high fig 8f are related to a delay in the response for permeable soils fig 8f the more permeable soils g3 produces quicker runoff when changes in the network properties in terms of storage and fractal dimension are low fig 8f independently from soil properties the three network parameters fig 8g extreme modifications during time deltas are high quicken the watershed response however if the network patterns are not modified too much δdraind and δfd are low a loss of superficial storage δstorcap is high is critical in reducing the timing to runoff production fig 8g this interaction between network parameters changes depending on soil type fig 9 if all network parameters are drastically altered deltas are high soil imperviousness enhances the quickening of the watershed response however when the loss of superficial storage is less critical deltas moving towards low and so is the loss of complexity of the network patterns δfd high changes in the drainage density controls the watershed response making permeable soils the most critical anticipation of the timing right hand side of the bottom row in fig 9 the interactions described above changes in relation to soil saturation and event magnitude fig 10 in average independently from the other drivers the delay of the rainfall peak is the parameters that mostly determine a delay in the watershed response differently the highest anticipation in runoff production is due to high changes in fractal dimension related to multipeak events high changes in storage capacity related to events with regular intensity and high changes in drainage density together with an increase in soil permeability for frequent events as saturation increases changes in the network parameters are those determining the strongest anticipation in the watershed response however when the magnitude of the events is high rp 200 year the strongest control on the watershed response is given by the network mostly in the case of dry soils 3 4 1 similarities with previous findings independently from the network properties this research also showed that interstorm variability influence the watershed response confirming other findings in the literature guan et al 2016 qin et al 2013 yao et al 2016 the rainfall peak location has significant effects on runoff for average return times events with late peaks in impervious areas have been shown to produce runoff more quickly than in the past yao et al 2016 findings confirm these results highlighting how in urban watersheds lag time decreased the more delayed the rainfall peak was when using swales for flood reduction qin et al 2013 observed a reduction of flood attenuation capacity the more delayed the peak was this is similar to the proposed analysis where are as having more permeable soils presented decreased differences in the network response the more the rainfall peak was delayed in time considering the network changes and the network response connected to the soil properties sofia and tarolli 2017 found that in maximum soil saturation conditions amc 90 network properties completely control the watershed response and changes are most evident for the lowest return period this research highlighted that as a single predictor the loss of drainage density matters only during frequent events while the storage capacity matters when soil offers reduced storage this is in line with what found in miller et al 2014 where little distinction in hydrological response existed between urban and peri urban developments of similar impervious cover when no significant hydraulic alteration network change was present as a new parameter the reduction of the fractal dimension implies a simplification of the network shape and sinuosity the presented results highlighted that a loss in fractal dimension over time always influences the watershed response with more similar responses the more similar the network shape is this is in line with what the literature for floodplain areas highlighted more sinuous networks reduce peak flows and flooding seo et al 2015 seo and schmidt 2012 and that smaller heterogeneity of path lengths results in higher peak flow a shorter time to peak and shorter duration saco and kumar 2002 as well flood frequency event increases with the decrease of the fractal dimension of the rivers network zhang et al 2015 indicating that the geomorphologic complexity of rivers network has an important effect on flooding this research further highlighted the importance of such changes in relation to soil type and storm properties in average low amc simpler networks decreased fractal dimension results in quicker runoff production especially with an increase of the volume of water falling before the heaviest burst and high concentration of the event the analysis done here showed that rainfall intensification and network shape fractal dimension interact differently depending on soil type during frequent events concentrated rainfalls tend to produce a quicker response in areas with soils prone to saturation and with decreased network complexity however when the event magnitude increases they have the quickest response when rainfall is regular zones with higher permeability instead always present the quicker response to highly concentrated events the simpler the network is similarly previous works highlighted how the shape of hydrographs is determined by interlocking relations between the geometry of the network and temporal and spatial variations of precipitation reaching and traversing a graphically specified network surkan 1969 as well that the relationship between storm speed and direction and the change in the peak runoff is dependent on the network configuration and network efficiency seo and schmidt 2012 these considerations together with the proposed study highlight the importance of focussing on the network shape parameter in the current climatic context of rainfall intensification cortesi et al 2012 monjo and martin vide 2016 sofia et al 2017 this research highlighted that all network parameters interact with different outcomes depending on soil type simplified networks with lowered efficiency storage capacity and path heterogeneity drainage density presents the quicker response independently from the soil type when soils are prone to runoff and the network efficiency is increased the watershed response can be delayed in time when soils have elevated permeability and the network has a reduced efficiency and path heterogeneity increasing the network simplicity would result in similar outcomes as well if the path heterogeneity and network efficiency are increased for a given network sinuosity the watershed response would be delayed this highlight an important suggestion for flood management increasing rainfall infiltration and storage capacity bens et al 2007 marshall et al 2009 or increasing the ways storms can traverse a specified network can help mitigate the effects of land use changes 4 from land drainage to flood management unravelling the chaos currently there is much policy interest in the possible linkages that might exist between land use climate and flood risk alfieri et al 2015 blöschl et al 2017 european parliament and council 2007 feyen et al 2011 pattison and lane 2012 schneider et al 2011 on the one hand this position is sustained by observations from plot and field scale studies that suggest land management does affect runoff macklin and lewin 2015 on the other hand at larger spatiotemporal scales two key factors that lead to the intensification of floods during times are the intensification of causative rainfall and changes in the wetness conditions before rainfall grillakis et al 2016 hlavcova et al 2005 woldemeskel and sharma 2016 and in many catchments soil moisture dependent precipitation excess has been found to be much better predictors of the flooding responses than regional patterns and variability of annual flows berghuijs et al 2016 clearly establishing a link is difficult because of the need to disentangle hydrological response due to anthropogenic changes of the landscape from that due to natural and possible human induced rainfall changes as discussed in the paper multiple previous findings from different disciplines hydrology physical geography confirmed the findings of this paper in relation to the importance of soil storm properties or land use changes in runoff production however putting together those independent findings and descriptive relationships remained chaotic because such an effort would have cut across actual chains of causations and would have not captured the sensitive dependence of those linkages upon the specific catchment scale and event under consideration this paper at the scale of the city political boundaries shows that if there is a relationship between land use management and watershed response it is through the interaction of a range of processes some of which are event specific the assessed results show that not only does a particular change of the drainage in a rural landscape during time has to be carefully investigated with respect to the geography of the catchment soil type but whether or not this change has impacts will end up depending upon the temporal evolution of the rainfall event under consideration this observation shifts the current perspective on historical changes of the landscape that are generally investigated with an overall aim of identifying a universal answer to the question of the link between a specific land use measure storm variability and watershed response the results presented in this work have a wide range of implications measuring extreme flow events is complex and most flood observations already contain a mix of measurement and theory pattison and lane 2012 as a consequence the relationship between land use and flood characteristics is generally showed as simple correlations between the two factors the proposed analysis considers realistic soil data and network structures including the time evolution of such structure and identifies ponding time and watershed responses on the basis of these actual data as compared to storm characteristics the application of eq 7 to different soil types confirms that runoff production and ponding time independently from the soil characteristics follow a common law in nature power law but it further demonstrates that soil properties play an important role in this providing a new insight on the scaling of such relationship to different study areas or for landscape evolution analysis and flood modeling the beginning of the effective rainfall in modeling approaches could be now based on such power laws to simulate events at different magnitude or for different amc further the development of eqs 8 and 9 provides a physical insight on the storm properties controlling the most runoff production and they disentangle the range of processes some of which are event specific that overall control changes in the watershed response this opens new research lines on the importance of land use and climate variability influencing flood generating conditions over timescales of societal relevance generalising their field of action despite comprising a large number of variables exemplifies the fact that land use effects network changes are not mutually exclusive from climate change impacts describing the land use link to flooding has proved difficult since impact has to be disentangled from the climate change effect pattison and lane 2012 sofia et al 2017 many recent studies highlighted how climate is moving toward more intense events with anticipated peaks cortesi et al 2012 feyen et al 2011 monjo and martin vide 2016 woldemeskel and sharma 2016 this work analysing storm characteristics such as its triangularity asymmetry and the peak location together with soil properties and drainage network changes highlights how it is likely that land use changes could amplify the effect of climatic variability at present it is thought that land use change effects are of second order importance behind natural climatic variability o connell et al 2004 2007 but this research hints to the fact that land management policies through a correct planning and management of new or existing networks might be also used to mitigate the effect of climate variability on increasing flood risk overall the proposed analysis show that changes in the same land management practice in terms of network structure will have different effects depending on where it has implemented and also when implemented in the same location may have different impacts on different flood events due to unique spatio temporal patterns of precipitation and soil properties the effect of this specific land management entity network structure furthermore may also change as different processes and interactions emerge for example network changes follows both urbanisation and changes in agricultural mechanisation sofia and tarolli 2017 modern techniques include heavy machinery being used and this can lead to surface roughness collecting runoff tarolli et al 2019 and possibly to a reduction of the hydraulic conductivity of soils coutadeur et al 2002 it is possible for these process impacts to exist at the local scale and interact with the changes in climate soil characteristics and network properties and this should be further investigated 5 final remarks this study analysed the combined product of the storm variability and watershed geomorphology in controlling water fluxes in an agricultural floodplain area in this landscape the configuration of the network layout is not automatically or naturally determined by the topography but rather by operational choices due to irrigation urbanisation or reclamation purposes the results showed that flooding could arise as a combined product of the storm properties soil type and network properties combining the results from previous studies this study showed that it is necessary to consider the planning of the layout of the drainage network with intent because it does have a relationship with the watershed response as well the network layout cannot be taken into consideration without a correct awareness of the different soil properties to mitigate the effects of land use changes in a changing climate where concentrated weather events are expected to generate a larger number of floods land managers should focus on understanding and improving the surface soil permeability this could be accomplished either by increasing the rainfall infiltration and storage capacity or by modifying the ways storms reach and traverse a specified network future research work should also keep into account information about groundwater level and soil crusting and compaction due to different agricultural techniques to improve the understanding of these potential drivers in increasing flooding risk acknowledgments lidar

707,biogeochemical reactions take place when reactants are present at the same location and time which occurs through pore scale mixing although the degree of mixing should be variable in space and time most conventional reactive transport models do not consider mixing dependent reaction rates and often make predictions based on rates measured with batch experiments we quantify the effect of pore scale mixing on the biodegradation rate of dissolved organic carbon doc with sediment batch experiments and study its potential impact on the field scale fate and transport of doc with numerical simulations we collected sediment samples from an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr field site located in busan south korea and conducted batch experiments to measure mixing dependent biodegradation rates complete mixing conditions were realized by continuously shaking the batch and diffusion limited mixing conditions were realized by keeping the batch under static conditions the two mixing conditions are most widely used conditions in batch experiments and they also represent the maximum and minimum degree of mixing the different mixing conditions led to significant differences in the biodegradation rates a factor of 4 9 on average we then performed reactive transport modeling using the measured biodegradation rates to study the potential impact of pore scale incomplete mixing on the field scale doc biodegradation the results show that pore scale mixing can significantly affect the effectiveness of biodegradation at the astr site we generalize this finding by performing a comprehensive nondimensional sensitivity analysis of the fate and transport of doc to pore scale mixing conditions over a wide range of p e clet and damköhler numbers we show that pore scale incomplete mixing can be a major source of uncertainty in field scale model predictions keywords incomplete mixing biodegradation rate dissolved organic carbon batch experiment field scale modeling aquifer storage transfer and recovery 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc in soils and groundwater plays an important role in biogeochemical cycling mineral weathering processes and subsurface contaminant transport drever and stillings 1997 kalbitz et al 2000 despite intensive research over past few decades our knowledge on the fate and transport of doc in the subsurface is still fragmented and too uncertain arndt et al 2013 keil and mayer 2014 one major knowledge gap is in the estimation of reaction rates reaction rates are the key input parameters to field scale reactive transport models but accurate estimation of doc degradation rates is challenging a common way of estimating reaction rates is to perform laboratory experiments and a few studies used kinetic relationships obtained from laboratory experiments to make field scale predictions clement et al 2000 schirmer et al 2000 sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 toräng et al 2002 another common way of estimating reaction rates is to calibrate them in a reactive transport model using field data ng et al 2015 2017 phanikumar et al 2005 wallis et al 2011 however reaction rates estimated in the laboratory and in the field often reveal large discrepancies with orders of magnitude lower rates in the field chapelle and lovley 1990 phanikumar et al 2005 swoboda colberg and drever 1993 velbel 1993 many recent studies on chemical weathering maher et al 2004 salehikhoo et al 2013 swoboda colberg and drever 1993 velbel 1993 white and brantley 2003 yoo and mudd 2008 and biodegradation chapelle and lovley 1990 langner et al 1998 phanikumar et al 2005 also questioned the validity of applying the rates obtained from laboratory experiments in field scale reactive transport modeling the discrepancy between laboratory measured and field calibrated reaction rates has been mainly attributed to macroscopic hydrological controls such as preferential flow paths caused by geological heterogeneity which reduce the reactive surfaces in contact with the fluid velbel 1993 and control global mixing properties de barros et al 2012 2015 theoretical studies clearly revealed the importance of distinguishing solute spreading due to geological heterogeneity and true solute mixing kitanidis 1994 for example molz and widdowson 1988 showed that the depth averaged dispersivity significantly overpredicts global mixing and cannot explain the existence of large vertical concentration gradients in aquifers incomplete mixing at pore scale is another key mechanism that can cause the discrepancy dentz et al 2011 kapoor et al 1997 and recent studies on mixing limited bimolecular reactions clearly demonstrated its importance benson and bolster 2016 de anna et al 2014 ding et al 2013 paster et al 2014 porta et al 2016 2012 any small scale chemical physical or microbiological heterogeneity that causes pore scale concentration gradients can lead to incomplete mixing conditions at pore scale fig 1 the conventional darcy scale reactive transport description assumes well mixed conditions at pore scale and batch experiments under shaking conditions are consistent with well mixed conditions however real field conditions can experience incomplete mixing at pore scale fig 1 and the shaken batch experiments only quantifies the maximum amount of reaction under ideal conditions batch experiments are often conducted to estimate reaction rates but there is no consensus on realistic mixing conditions and both shaking conditions althoff et al 2001 leglize et al 2006 ni et al 2015 wang et al 2009b and static conditions liu et al 2010 park et al 2017 wang et al 2009a are widely used in practice meile and tuncay 2006 showed that the mismatch between reaction rates obtained from well mixed batch conditions and from pore scale simulations can be significant for heterogeneous solid fluid reactions recent studies based on pore scale reactive transport simulations pereira nunes et al 2016 and laboratory x ray microtomography menke et al 2017 also demonstrated that the transport limitations at pore scale make reaction rates significantly lower than batch reaction rates despite the active research on pore scale mixing effect on reaction rates the potential impact of pore scale incomplete mixing on batch and field scale biodegradation has not yet been elucidated in this paper we propose a framework that quantifies the potential impact of pore scale incomplete mixing on biodegradation we first evaluate the impact of pore scale mixing on doc biodegradation rates with laboratory batch experiments we perform sediment batch experiments to obtain doc biodegradation rates under two different conditions shaking maximum mixing and static minimum mixing conditions we then study how much uncertainty can originate in field scale biodegradation due to the pore scale incomplete mixing effect we first evaluate the uncertainty caused by the pore scale mixing effect on a scenario with multiple injection extraction wells motivated by an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr field site in south korea we then compare the uncertainty caused by the pore scale mixing effect to the uncertainties caused by the typical uncertainty in porosity and dispersivity finally we generalize our finding by performing a dimensionless sensitivity analysis of this system over a wide range of p e clet and damköhler numbers and identify the major source of uncertainty on field scale biodegradation predictions 2 methods 2 1 field site sediment samples for batch experiments were obtained from a field site that is developed for the purpose of aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr astr technology involves the injection of source water into an aquifer through wells for storage and the recovery of the injected water through separate wells for usage this technology utilizes aquifers for the purpose of storage and treatment the field site is located in the delta of the nakdong river in busan south korea where pretreated river water is injected into a confined aquifer with nine injection wells and the injected water is recovered from eight extraction wells fig 2 during the operation of the astr system doc in the injected water is expected to be degraded in the subsurface by biogeochemical reactions maeng et al 2011 sediment samples were obtained from a sand layer at a depth around 40 m beneath the surface in the target confined alluvial aquifer sediment samples consist of approximately 85 of sand 11 of silt and 4 of clay 2 2 batch experiment 2 2 1 batch biodegradation experiment batch experiments were conducted to investigate the potential impact of pore scale mixing on acetate biodegradation by indigenous bacteria in sediments batch methods are effective at determining biodegradation rates because biogeochemical processes can be separated from physical processes advection and dispersion however batch tests have disadvantages of being conducted under conditions that may differ from the field specifically batch experiments are typically conducted under well mixed conditions and at solid to liquid ratios lower than in real field conditions a few studies showed that the solid liquid ratio in batch can be an important factor that affects reaction rates porro et al 2000 wang et al 2009b to cover typical ranges of solid to liquid ratios christensen et al 1996 fox and makam 2011 kao et al 2003 ni et al 2015 wang et al 2018 we conducted batch experiments with four different solid to liquid ratios between 1 2 and 1 20 the batch experiment conditions are summarized in table 1 the amount of sediment suitable for the target solid to liquid ratio was first added to graduated laboratory glass bottles and then solutions containing 0 4 g l of sodium acetate c2h3nao2 99 sigma aldrich and 0 0326 g l of potassium nitrate kno3 99 0 sigma aldrich were added to the bottles acetate and nitrate were used as the sources of organic carbon and electron acceptor respectively all solutions were prepared with deionized di water 18 mω cm obtained from a millipore system milli q plus usa the bottles were then sealed with parafilm and connected to nitrogen gas bags to prevent additional air intrusion during experiments batch experiments were conducted at 25 c in a shaking incubator js research inc jssi 100c batches under well mixed conditions were shaken at 150 rpm and batches under diffusion controlled conditions were placed in the same incubator but without shaking 0 rpm all batch experiments were run in quadruplicate to confirm the reproducibility control experiments were also conducted with sterilized sediment and 0 4 g l of sodium azide nan3 99 5 sigma aldrich to check the possibility of acetate removal by sorption these were run in duplicate at solid to liquid ratio of 1 2 sodium azide was added to prevent bacteria growth bertelkamp et al 2014 for estimating the residual doc and nitrate concentrations 3 to 4 ml of solution samples were carefully collected at predetermined times using a valve located at the bottom of the bottle each sample was filtered through a 0 45 µm syringe filter to remove fine particles before analysis acetate concentration was analyzed using gas chromatography gc hp 6890 series gc system equipped with an agilent hp inowax column and nitrate concentration was measured using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000 equipped with an ionpac as9 hc column 2 2 2 kinetic model for biodegradation we use a first order kinetic model to describe doc biodegradation 1 d c d t μ c where c is the doc concentration and μ is the first order biodegradation rate constant batch experiments under shaking and static conditions provide data sets to estimate the potential impact of pore scale mixing on μ first order kinetics is a simple but commonly applied microbial degradation kinetic model alshafie and ghoshal 2003 barry et al 2002 fetter 2008 langner et al 1998 ng et al 2017 park et al 1990 peters et al 1999 the concentration of substrate acetate is the only variable that affects the biodegration rate in this model depending on the type of doc and specific conditions more complex models could be required to accurately model biodegradation barry et al 2002 bauer et al 2008 cirpka and valocchi 2007 but the first order model suffices to describe the observed doc degradation behavior presented in section 3 1 in reality the interplay between a complex distribution of organic compounds and indigenous bacterial community can lead to complicated degradation pattern 2 3 field scale reactive transport modeling 2 3 1 model setup groundwater flow and reactive transport models of the busan astr site were developed modflow harbaugh 2005 is used to simulate groundwater flow and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 is used to simulate reactive transport including advection dispersion and first order decay reaction the model domain is a square centered on the well field with a side length equal to 875 m i e approximately 10 times the diameter of the circle formed by the outer wells fig 3 this domain size is sufficient to avoid boundary effects on the solution the domain is discretized horizontally i e in the x y plane by a 200 200 rectangular grid the grid step is regular and equal to 0 9 m in a smaller square centered on the well field with a side length equal to 131 m i e approximately 1 5 times the diameter of the circle formed by the outer wells fig 3 beyond this area the grid step increases following a geometric progression towards the domain boundaries the aquifer is assumed to be perfectly confined i e no leakage through confining units and is represented by a single layer i e groundwater flow is assumed to be purely horizontal the top and bottom elevations of the aquifer were obtained from 13 wells drilled within the well field area from this dataset continuous top and bottom elevation layers were created by ordinary kriging the confined aquifer thickness varies between 40 4 m and 47 5 m groundwater flow is simulated in steady state the total injection rate is 2 500 m3 day target injection rate at this site and is equally distributed among the 9 injections wells the total extraction rate is equal to the total injection rate and is equally distributed among the 8 extraction wells this model is a simplified representation of the astr operation scheme as in reality the injection and extraction rates may be temporally variable depending on the availability of the water source due to quantity and quality constraints and the water supply demand likewise the boundary conditions are idealized by specifying a uniform hydraulic head h 0 m along all the domain boundaries that is no regional flow the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is taken homogeneous since the impact of aquifer heterogeneity on the biodegradation is not the focus of this study the hydraulic conductivity is fixed at 3 6 m day value obtained from field pumping tests the effect of heterogeneity on transport is implicitly incorporated through the use of a macroscale fickian dispersion model values for the dispersivity coefficients are discussed below as a consequence macroscale mixing could be overestimated in this model compared to a model with resolved heterogeneity nonetheless this effect is not expected to have a significant impact on the sensitivity of the model results to pore scale mixing through its influence on the kinetic rate which is the main focus of this study note that for a homogeneous field with a specified injection extraction rate the value of hydraulic conductivity does not influence solute transport because it does not affect the flow pattern or groundwater velocity which are a function of the well configuration and injection extraction rates in modflow the lpf package is employed to formulate the finite difference equations the injection and extraction wells are implemented with the well package the pcg package is used to solve the system of equations the convergence criterion on the maximum head change between iterations hclose is set to 10 4 m and the convergence criterion on the maximum flow residual rclose is set to 8 6 m3 day i e 0 34 of the total injection rate both criteria were met without difficulties in all the simulations solute transport is also simulated in steady state this approach is suitable as we are not interested in the front displacement of the doc instead this study focuses on the biodegradation achieved under normal operation when injection and extraction are carried out over a relatively long time compared to the groundwater travel time the median travel time is estimated to be 37 days from the simulation results the injection concentration c 0 is set identical in all the injection wells the actual value of c 0 is unimportant because it only has a scaling effect on the concentrations in this study and accordingly only the normalized concentrations c c 0 are analyzed the effective porosity dispersivity coefficients and first order biodegradation rate constant are considered constant in space and time best estimate and likely range of values for these parameters are given in table 2 the range of values for effective porosity ϕ is based on the analysis of 19 core samples from the target aquifer and the best estimate is calculated as the arithmetic mean the best estimate for longitudinal dispersivity αl is based on the rule of thumb α l 0 1 l c where lc is the travel distance this classical rule of thumb expresses what is known as the scale effect i e an increase of macrodispersivity with transport distance and was derived from a compilation of published values of dispersivity bear and cheng 2010 fetter et al 2017 specifically lc is taken as the median travel distance obtained by particle tracking analysis using modpath pollock 2012 1 000 particles are placed around each injection well and tracked until they reach an extraction well lc 37 m the range of values for αl covers three orders of magnitude around this best estimate gelhar et al 1992 the transverse dispersivity αt is defined by applying a fixed ratio of transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity equal to 0 1 the range of values for the first order decay constant μ is based on the batch experiments in this study specifically the minimum value is taken as the average of μ obtained under static conditions and the maximum value is taken as the average of μ obtained under shaking conditions and the best estimate is calculated as the arithmetic mean of these two values in mt3dms the implicit finite difference method with upstream weighting is employed as the solution scheme for advection no numerical dispersion was observed as checked by verifying that the results are the same when using a finer grid including for cases where the pe number is high hydrodynamic dispersion is implemented with the dispersion package and the first order decay reaction is implemented with the chemical reaction package the gcg package is used to solve the system of equations the convergence criterion on the maximum relative concentration change between iterations cclose is set equal to 10 7 and we further impose that the mass balance error should be less than 0 02 the latter criterion which is not part of mt3dms appeared necessary after observing that in a few cases the converged solution showed non negligible mass balance errors in such cases the above criterion was achieved by changing the initial concentration distribution and or the type of preconditioner in the gcg package additionally a number of cases required that we recompile mt3dms and modflow using double precision instead of the single precision with which the codes are usually distributed the reason for these additional steps is that we explored a very wide range of parameter values as explained in the following section 2 3 2 non dimensional formulation we formulate the problem in a non dimensional form to generalize the results to potentially different conditions including different injection extraction rates aquifer type and site scale however note that the relative well configuration is unchanged the darcy scale advection dispersion reaction equation adre is first recalled in its dimensional form 2 c t d c v c μ c where d is the dispersion tensor defined following the scheidegger bear model zheng and wang 1999 v is the groundwater velocity or average linear velocity and μ is the first order biodegradation rate constant note that recent studies showed that doc transport can follow anomalous transport dietrich et al 2013 mcinnis et al 2014 2015 however the complex interplay between transport and reaction is not the focus of this study we assume doc transport is fickian in this study to focus on the potential impact of incomplete mixng on biodegradation the median groundwater travel length lc is chosen as the characteristic length scale and the median groundwater travel time tc is chosen as the characteristic time scale these can be obtained by particle tracking analysis as described in section 2 3 1 this gave lc 37 m and tc 37 days the identical values are purely by coincidence note that lc is significantly larger than the grid size of 0 9 m the median travel time cannot be related to simulation temporal resolution since simulation is in steady state both for flow and transport the p e clet pe and damköhler da numbers are defined at darcy scale as 3 p e l c v c d c 4 d a μ t c where vc is the characteristic velocity scale defined as lc tc and dc is the characteristic dispersion scale defined as αlvc which is in line with the scheidegger bear model pe is a dimensionless number that represents the ratio of the characteristic advection rate to the characteristic dispersion rate while da is a dimensionless number that represents the ratio of the characteristic reaction rate to the characteristic transport rate here da is introduced in relation with field scale i e darcy scale transport which is typically dominated by advection and not by dispersion e g cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 golfier et al 2002 salehikhoo et al 2013 tartakovsky et al 2009 advective time scale is also relevant in the context of aquifer storage transfer and recovery further defining the following dimensionless variables 5 c c c 0 x x l c y y l c z z l c t t t c d d d c v v v c the adre can be recast in a dimensionless form as 6 c t 1 p e d c v c d a c note that d and v are not simply equal to 1 as would be the case if both d and v are constants while here they are spatially variable for a fixed relative well configuration the non dimensional problem is solely a function of pe and da we now discuss the realistic ranges of values for pe and da it should first be noted that with the above definition of dc d c α l v c pe can be rewritten as 7 p e l c α l if we further make use of the rule of thumb α l 0 1 l c mentioned in section 2 3 1 the rule of thumb p e 10 arises in reality field scale estimates of αl show a large scatter with values ranging over about 3 orders of magnitude for a given scale gelhar et al 1992 hence we suggest that 10 2 5 10 0 5 l c is a typical range of values for αl accordingly we suggest that 10 0 5 10 2 5 is a typical range of values for pe on the other hand da is controlled by μ and tc for the busan astr site a realistic range of value for μ is derived from the batch experiments see section 3 1 and tc is fixed once the injection and extraction rates are fixed however we aim to produce results that are applicable to different injection extraction rates and site scale affecting tc and different conditions that could affect μ therefore we do not limit a priori the range of values for da in the generalization i e we vary da over a wide range of values that comprehensively captures its influence on the results 3 results 3 1 batch experiment results the results of the batch experiments with the two different mixing conditions and four different solid liquid ratios are shown in fig 4 doc biodegradation is significantly faster under shaking conditions compared to static conditions across all the tested solid liquid ratios the biodegradation behavior was reasonably consistent among quadruplicate the control experiments confirm that the sorption of acetate was negligible and biodegradation was the driver for the reduction in acetate concentration fig 5 a shows the estimated first order kinetic rate constants and fig 5b shows the ratio of the rates between shaking and static conditions the error bar for reaction constants represents standard error and we obtained error bars for the ratio and the mean of ratio by following rules for the evaluation of standard uncertainty through functional relationships with uncorrelated variables farrance and frenkel 2012 the reaction rate constants under shaking conditions are significantly larger than the rate constants under static conditions over all solid liquid ratios the dependency of the reaction rate constant on the solid liquid ratio is not evident for application to field scale modeling we assume that there is no significant dependency of the reaction rate constants on the solid liquid ratio the average reaction rate constant over all solid liquid ratios is 0 44 1 day under shaking conditions and 0 092 1 day under static conditions these values are used in the field scale modeling of the busan site as shown in fig 5b the ratios between reaction rate constants are not very sensitive to the solid liquid ratio and are all around 4 9 blue horizontal line in fig 5b this mean ratio of 4 9 is used in the generalization section 3 2 2 3 2 field scale modeling results 3 2 1 busan site results the results for the specific case of the busan site with the astr operation scheme described in section 2 3 1 are first presented the contours of the calculated hydraulic heads and a number of flow lines are shown in fig 6 the spatial organization of the flow lines is complex due to the multiple injection extraction wells most of the injection wells can be seen to feed two or three different extraction wells the influence of pore scale mixing on the field scale biodegradation is analyzed from the sensitivity of the reactive transport simulation results to the first order decay rate constant the spatial concentration distributions for μ obtained under both shaking and static conditions are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7b respectively the influence of the mixing conditions is clearly visible while both cases show a decrease in concentration with increasing distance from the injection wells the biodegradation is significantly larger in the case of μ obtained under well mixed conditions the average normalized concentration at the extraction wells c ext c 0 is 0 154 in the first case with μ from diffusion limited mixing condition and 0 027 in the second case with μ from complete mixing condition this clearly shows a significant difference in the biodegradation efficiency and demonstrates that the pore scale mixing effect can have a significant impact on field scale biodegradation the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the first order decay rate constant the range of values arising from the difference in the mixing conditions is compared to the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity in fig 8 the latter two parameters are the most uncertain parameters of the model after the biodegradation rate and the rationale behind the ranges of values assumed for these parameters table 2 is discussed in section 2 3 1 the ranges of the values are representative of the typical uncertainty one has to deal with in practice this figure reveals that the biodegradation rate is the most sensitive parameter in the busan field site around the case where the best parameter estimates are used this result indicates that the uncertainty that would arise from not knowing the pore scale mixing conditions or in other words the error that could arise from assuming incorrect pore scale mixing conditions can be larger than the typical uncertainty arising from other parameters effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity 3 2 2 generalization the analysis is generalized through a global sensitivity analysis in the parameter space formed by the two relevant dimensionless numbers of this problem pe and da a contour plot of c ext c 0 in the pe da parameter space is shown in fig 9 a in normal scale and fig 9b in logarithmic scale which better highlights the results where concentration is small note that pe is varied over 10 orders of magnitude i e beyond its realistic range of values so as to get a comprehensive analysis of its theoretical influence only the results between the white dashed lines correspond to realistic pe values da is also varied over 10 orders of magnitude although it is difficult to know how much da may vary in reality 10 orders of magnitude may not be unrealistic since da is a function of advection time scale which can vary significantly depending on pumping rate hydraulic parameters and distance between wells and reaction time scale which might vary significantly depending on bio physico chemical conditions both fig 9a and fig 9b show that the biodegradation efficiency increases with increasing da as expected the influence of pe is more complex biodegradation efficiency generally decreases with increasing pe for small values of da fig 9a whereas it generally increases with increasing pe for large values of da fig 9b overall the dependency on both pe and da is strongly nonlinear a major result of our study lies in fig 10 a this figure shows a contour plot of the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the pore scale mixing conditions through its impact on μ and therefore on da in the pe da parameter space the sensitivity s is defined as 8 s p e d a c ext c 0 2 c ext c 0 1 where c ext c 0 1 is the average normalized doc concentration at the extraction wells at pe and da 1 and c ext c 0 2 is the average normalized doc concentration at the extraction wells at pe and da 2 the subscript numbers 1 and 2 denote a difference in the value of da pe fixed where 9 d a 1 d a r μ 10 d a 2 d a r μ where rμ is the ratio between the value of μ obtained under shaking conditions and the value of μ obtained under static conditions r μ 4 9 this figure allows to identify where in the pe da parameter space the pore scale mixing conditions have a significant impact such a region e g where s 0 2 covers several orders of magnitude of da values and all the realistic values of pe the largest effect of the mixing conditions occurs for values of da around 1 this result is in line with the above observation that the influence of both pe and da becomes null when da is either very small or very large for comparison fig 10b shows a contour plot of the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the effective porosity ϕ through its impact on tc and therefore on da in the pe da parameter space the sensitivity s is also defined according to eq 8 where the subscript numbers 1 and 2 denote a difference in the value of da but here da 1 and da 2 are defined as 11 d a 1 d a r ϕ 12 d a 2 d a r ϕ where rϕ is the ratio between the maximum and the minimum values of ϕ at the busan site r ϕ 2 which is a typical uncertainty one has to deal with because ϕ also impacts da the sensitivity to ϕ displays the same patterns as the sensitivity to the mixing conditions in the pe da parameter space however it has a smaller magnitude reflecting the smaller range of values for ϕ compared to μ i e rϕ rμ in the similar manner fig 10c shows a contour plot of the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the longitudinal dispersivity αl through its impact on pe in the pe da parameter space the sensitivity s is again defined according to eq 8 but here the subscript numbers 1 and 2 denote a difference in the value of pe i e p e p e 1 or p e p e 2 da fixed where 13 p e 1 p e r α l 14 p e 2 p e r α l where r α l is the ratio between the maximum and the minimum values of αl at the busan site r α l 10 3 which is a typical uncertainty one has to deal with this figure shows that c ext c 0 is mostly sensitive to αl for relatively low pe values ranging from about 10 5 to 101 with a maximum at p e 10 2 and for da values ranging from about 10 3 to 101 finally fig 11 identifies which parameter μ ϕ or αl is the most sensitive parameter in each point of the pe da parameter space this figure reveals that c ext c 0 is predominantly sensitive to either the mixing conditions through mixing dependent μ or αl depending on the value of pe and da the mixing conditions are the most sensitive factor over more than half of the parameter space this region includes the pe and da values that are relevant to the busan astr site therefore careful consideration of pore scale mixing dependent μ is critical for reducing uncertainty in field scale biodegradation predictions 4 summary and discussion this study demonstrates the importance of pore scale mixing on field scale biodegradation by combining laboratory sediment batch experiments and field scale modeling effective reaction rate constants obtained from two different mixing shaking and static conditions revealed that pore scale mixing alone can lead upto factor of about 5 difference in the reaction rate constants the biodegradation rate should be controlled by solid liquid interactions since microbial activity should be higher near the solid surface where microbes are attached fetter 2008 wen et al 2015 it is therefore intuitive that the reaction rate is a function of the degree of mixing because the surface contact probability should increase as pore scale mixing increases this study shows that pore scale mixing may be a major source of discrepancy between batch measured reaction rates and field calibrated reaction rates pore scale mixing has major implications on darcy scale model predictions darcy scale reactive transport models typically assume well mixed concentration below representative elementary volume rev scale therefore neglecting sub rev scale concentration fluctuations reaction rates obtained from well mixed batch experiments are consistent with this framework however this can lead to a large error since in reality concentration values can be inhomogeneous at the sub rev scale pore scale studies demonstrated that darcy scale models that do not consider incomplete mixing at pore scale may fail to properly predict reactive transport battiato et al 2009 de anna et al 2014 gramling et al 2002 knutson et al 2007 raje and kapoor 2000 tartakovsky et al 2009 this study confirms that pore scale mixing is indeed a key mechanism that affects biodegradation rates under realistic groundwater flow conditions pore scale mixing will likely be neither complete mixing nor diffusion limited mixing but somewhere in between the two bounds developing effective reactive transport models that accounts for pore scale mixing effects is mathematically very challenging and still an active area of research bolster et al 2012 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 ginn 2001 herrera et al 2017 lichtner and kang 2007 dykaar and kitanidis 1996 and sund et al 2015 upscaled solute degradation in an wavy walled channel and sund et al 2017 recently presented a variant of the spatial markov model dentz et al 2016 kang et al 2011 2017 le borgne et al 2008 that takes pore scale mixing effect into account however these studies are so far only applied to idealized periodic pore geometries recently numerical and theoretical upscaling strategies have been proposed to capture the effects of incomplete mixing on reaction rates especially in the context of bimolecular mixing driven reactions benson and bolster 2016 de anna et al 2014 ding et al 2013 paster et al 2014 porta et al 2016 2012 obtaining upscaled reaction models that take pore scale mixing into account is still largely an open question but the recent advances in bimolecular reactions and hybrid models that takes nonlinear heterogeneous reactions into account show promise battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2011 scheibe et al 2015 it should be noted that in this study the quantified impact of pore scale mixing on field scale biodegradation is restricted to our batch experimental conditions we assumed identical physico biochemical properties e g temperature ph and microbial community between batch and field the degree of mixing for the static conditions is never strictly zero and is ultimately controlled by the ratio of pore scale diffusion rate to surface reaction rate battiato et al 2009 solid liquid ratio is also a potentially important parameter that deserves further study and the types of indigenous bacteria will also affect the reaction rates while the actual degree of mixing in the aquifer remains unknown this study shows that pore scale mixing can be a major source of uncertainty in model predictions also our framework of impact quantification is not limited to a specific scenario therefore the impact of pore scale mixing can be further studied by extending our findings to different conditions geological heterogeneity and flow configuration are other key parameters that can play a major role spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and boundary conditions can have major impacts on global mixing and transport properties to focus on the effects of pore scale mixing we assumed effectively homogeneous aquifer which does not cause macroscopic preferential flow paths the relative importance of pore scale mixing and macroscopic flow pattern on effective reaction rates and the interplay between the two processes are not yet clear the framework established in this study can be extended to address such questions acknowledgments the authors acknowledge a grant 17awmp b066761 05 from the

707,biogeochemical reactions take place when reactants are present at the same location and time which occurs through pore scale mixing although the degree of mixing should be variable in space and time most conventional reactive transport models do not consider mixing dependent reaction rates and often make predictions based on rates measured with batch experiments we quantify the effect of pore scale mixing on the biodegradation rate of dissolved organic carbon doc with sediment batch experiments and study its potential impact on the field scale fate and transport of doc with numerical simulations we collected sediment samples from an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr field site located in busan south korea and conducted batch experiments to measure mixing dependent biodegradation rates complete mixing conditions were realized by continuously shaking the batch and diffusion limited mixing conditions were realized by keeping the batch under static conditions the two mixing conditions are most widely used conditions in batch experiments and they also represent the maximum and minimum degree of mixing the different mixing conditions led to significant differences in the biodegradation rates a factor of 4 9 on average we then performed reactive transport modeling using the measured biodegradation rates to study the potential impact of pore scale incomplete mixing on the field scale doc biodegradation the results show that pore scale mixing can significantly affect the effectiveness of biodegradation at the astr site we generalize this finding by performing a comprehensive nondimensional sensitivity analysis of the fate and transport of doc to pore scale mixing conditions over a wide range of p e clet and damköhler numbers we show that pore scale incomplete mixing can be a major source of uncertainty in field scale model predictions keywords incomplete mixing biodegradation rate dissolved organic carbon batch experiment field scale modeling aquifer storage transfer and recovery 1 introduction dissolved organic carbon doc in soils and groundwater plays an important role in biogeochemical cycling mineral weathering processes and subsurface contaminant transport drever and stillings 1997 kalbitz et al 2000 despite intensive research over past few decades our knowledge on the fate and transport of doc in the subsurface is still fragmented and too uncertain arndt et al 2013 keil and mayer 2014 one major knowledge gap is in the estimation of reaction rates reaction rates are the key input parameters to field scale reactive transport models but accurate estimation of doc degradation rates is challenging a common way of estimating reaction rates is to perform laboratory experiments and a few studies used kinetic relationships obtained from laboratory experiments to make field scale predictions clement et al 2000 schirmer et al 2000 sverdrup and warfvinge 1988 toräng et al 2002 another common way of estimating reaction rates is to calibrate them in a reactive transport model using field data ng et al 2015 2017 phanikumar et al 2005 wallis et al 2011 however reaction rates estimated in the laboratory and in the field often reveal large discrepancies with orders of magnitude lower rates in the field chapelle and lovley 1990 phanikumar et al 2005 swoboda colberg and drever 1993 velbel 1993 many recent studies on chemical weathering maher et al 2004 salehikhoo et al 2013 swoboda colberg and drever 1993 velbel 1993 white and brantley 2003 yoo and mudd 2008 and biodegradation chapelle and lovley 1990 langner et al 1998 phanikumar et al 2005 also questioned the validity of applying the rates obtained from laboratory experiments in field scale reactive transport modeling the discrepancy between laboratory measured and field calibrated reaction rates has been mainly attributed to macroscopic hydrological controls such as preferential flow paths caused by geological heterogeneity which reduce the reactive surfaces in contact with the fluid velbel 1993 and control global mixing properties de barros et al 2012 2015 theoretical studies clearly revealed the importance of distinguishing solute spreading due to geological heterogeneity and true solute mixing kitanidis 1994 for example molz and widdowson 1988 showed that the depth averaged dispersivity significantly overpredicts global mixing and cannot explain the existence of large vertical concentration gradients in aquifers incomplete mixing at pore scale is another key mechanism that can cause the discrepancy dentz et al 2011 kapoor et al 1997 and recent studies on mixing limited bimolecular reactions clearly demonstrated its importance benson and bolster 2016 de anna et al 2014 ding et al 2013 paster et al 2014 porta et al 2016 2012 any small scale chemical physical or microbiological heterogeneity that causes pore scale concentration gradients can lead to incomplete mixing conditions at pore scale fig 1 the conventional darcy scale reactive transport description assumes well mixed conditions at pore scale and batch experiments under shaking conditions are consistent with well mixed conditions however real field conditions can experience incomplete mixing at pore scale fig 1 and the shaken batch experiments only quantifies the maximum amount of reaction under ideal conditions batch experiments are often conducted to estimate reaction rates but there is no consensus on realistic mixing conditions and both shaking conditions althoff et al 2001 leglize et al 2006 ni et al 2015 wang et al 2009b and static conditions liu et al 2010 park et al 2017 wang et al 2009a are widely used in practice meile and tuncay 2006 showed that the mismatch between reaction rates obtained from well mixed batch conditions and from pore scale simulations can be significant for heterogeneous solid fluid reactions recent studies based on pore scale reactive transport simulations pereira nunes et al 2016 and laboratory x ray microtomography menke et al 2017 also demonstrated that the transport limitations at pore scale make reaction rates significantly lower than batch reaction rates despite the active research on pore scale mixing effect on reaction rates the potential impact of pore scale incomplete mixing on batch and field scale biodegradation has not yet been elucidated in this paper we propose a framework that quantifies the potential impact of pore scale incomplete mixing on biodegradation we first evaluate the impact of pore scale mixing on doc biodegradation rates with laboratory batch experiments we perform sediment batch experiments to obtain doc biodegradation rates under two different conditions shaking maximum mixing and static minimum mixing conditions we then study how much uncertainty can originate in field scale biodegradation due to the pore scale incomplete mixing effect we first evaluate the uncertainty caused by the pore scale mixing effect on a scenario with multiple injection extraction wells motivated by an aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr field site in south korea we then compare the uncertainty caused by the pore scale mixing effect to the uncertainties caused by the typical uncertainty in porosity and dispersivity finally we generalize our finding by performing a dimensionless sensitivity analysis of this system over a wide range of p e clet and damköhler numbers and identify the major source of uncertainty on field scale biodegradation predictions 2 methods 2 1 field site sediment samples for batch experiments were obtained from a field site that is developed for the purpose of aquifer storage transfer and recovery astr astr technology involves the injection of source water into an aquifer through wells for storage and the recovery of the injected water through separate wells for usage this technology utilizes aquifers for the purpose of storage and treatment the field site is located in the delta of the nakdong river in busan south korea where pretreated river water is injected into a confined aquifer with nine injection wells and the injected water is recovered from eight extraction wells fig 2 during the operation of the astr system doc in the injected water is expected to be degraded in the subsurface by biogeochemical reactions maeng et al 2011 sediment samples were obtained from a sand layer at a depth around 40 m beneath the surface in the target confined alluvial aquifer sediment samples consist of approximately 85 of sand 11 of silt and 4 of clay 2 2 batch experiment 2 2 1 batch biodegradation experiment batch experiments were conducted to investigate the potential impact of pore scale mixing on acetate biodegradation by indigenous bacteria in sediments batch methods are effective at determining biodegradation rates because biogeochemical processes can be separated from physical processes advection and dispersion however batch tests have disadvantages of being conducted under conditions that may differ from the field specifically batch experiments are typically conducted under well mixed conditions and at solid to liquid ratios lower than in real field conditions a few studies showed that the solid liquid ratio in batch can be an important factor that affects reaction rates porro et al 2000 wang et al 2009b to cover typical ranges of solid to liquid ratios christensen et al 1996 fox and makam 2011 kao et al 2003 ni et al 2015 wang et al 2018 we conducted batch experiments with four different solid to liquid ratios between 1 2 and 1 20 the batch experiment conditions are summarized in table 1 the amount of sediment suitable for the target solid to liquid ratio was first added to graduated laboratory glass bottles and then solutions containing 0 4 g l of sodium acetate c2h3nao2 99 sigma aldrich and 0 0326 g l of potassium nitrate kno3 99 0 sigma aldrich were added to the bottles acetate and nitrate were used as the sources of organic carbon and electron acceptor respectively all solutions were prepared with deionized di water 18 mω cm obtained from a millipore system milli q plus usa the bottles were then sealed with parafilm and connected to nitrogen gas bags to prevent additional air intrusion during experiments batch experiments were conducted at 25 c in a shaking incubator js research inc jssi 100c batches under well mixed conditions were shaken at 150 rpm and batches under diffusion controlled conditions were placed in the same incubator but without shaking 0 rpm all batch experiments were run in quadruplicate to confirm the reproducibility control experiments were also conducted with sterilized sediment and 0 4 g l of sodium azide nan3 99 5 sigma aldrich to check the possibility of acetate removal by sorption these were run in duplicate at solid to liquid ratio of 1 2 sodium azide was added to prevent bacteria growth bertelkamp et al 2014 for estimating the residual doc and nitrate concentrations 3 to 4 ml of solution samples were carefully collected at predetermined times using a valve located at the bottom of the bottle each sample was filtered through a 0 45 µm syringe filter to remove fine particles before analysis acetate concentration was analyzed using gas chromatography gc hp 6890 series gc system equipped with an agilent hp inowax column and nitrate concentration was measured using ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1000 equipped with an ionpac as9 hc column 2 2 2 kinetic model for biodegradation we use a first order kinetic model to describe doc biodegradation 1 d c d t μ c where c is the doc concentration and μ is the first order biodegradation rate constant batch experiments under shaking and static conditions provide data sets to estimate the potential impact of pore scale mixing on μ first order kinetics is a simple but commonly applied microbial degradation kinetic model alshafie and ghoshal 2003 barry et al 2002 fetter 2008 langner et al 1998 ng et al 2017 park et al 1990 peters et al 1999 the concentration of substrate acetate is the only variable that affects the biodegration rate in this model depending on the type of doc and specific conditions more complex models could be required to accurately model biodegradation barry et al 2002 bauer et al 2008 cirpka and valocchi 2007 but the first order model suffices to describe the observed doc degradation behavior presented in section 3 1 in reality the interplay between a complex distribution of organic compounds and indigenous bacterial community can lead to complicated degradation pattern 2 3 field scale reactive transport modeling 2 3 1 model setup groundwater flow and reactive transport models of the busan astr site were developed modflow harbaugh 2005 is used to simulate groundwater flow and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 is used to simulate reactive transport including advection dispersion and first order decay reaction the model domain is a square centered on the well field with a side length equal to 875 m i e approximately 10 times the diameter of the circle formed by the outer wells fig 3 this domain size is sufficient to avoid boundary effects on the solution the domain is discretized horizontally i e in the x y plane by a 200 200 rectangular grid the grid step is regular and equal to 0 9 m in a smaller square centered on the well field with a side length equal to 131 m i e approximately 1 5 times the diameter of the circle formed by the outer wells fig 3 beyond this area the grid step increases following a geometric progression towards the domain boundaries the aquifer is assumed to be perfectly confined i e no leakage through confining units and is represented by a single layer i e groundwater flow is assumed to be purely horizontal the top and bottom elevations of the aquifer were obtained from 13 wells drilled within the well field area from this dataset continuous top and bottom elevation layers were created by ordinary kriging the confined aquifer thickness varies between 40 4 m and 47 5 m groundwater flow is simulated in steady state the total injection rate is 2 500 m3 day target injection rate at this site and is equally distributed among the 9 injections wells the total extraction rate is equal to the total injection rate and is equally distributed among the 8 extraction wells this model is a simplified representation of the astr operation scheme as in reality the injection and extraction rates may be temporally variable depending on the availability of the water source due to quantity and quality constraints and the water supply demand likewise the boundary conditions are idealized by specifying a uniform hydraulic head h 0 m along all the domain boundaries that is no regional flow the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer is taken homogeneous since the impact of aquifer heterogeneity on the biodegradation is not the focus of this study the hydraulic conductivity is fixed at 3 6 m day value obtained from field pumping tests the effect of heterogeneity on transport is implicitly incorporated through the use of a macroscale fickian dispersion model values for the dispersivity coefficients are discussed below as a consequence macroscale mixing could be overestimated in this model compared to a model with resolved heterogeneity nonetheless this effect is not expected to have a significant impact on the sensitivity of the model results to pore scale mixing through its influence on the kinetic rate which is the main focus of this study note that for a homogeneous field with a specified injection extraction rate the value of hydraulic conductivity does not influence solute transport because it does not affect the flow pattern or groundwater velocity which are a function of the well configuration and injection extraction rates in modflow the lpf package is employed to formulate the finite difference equations the injection and extraction wells are implemented with the well package the pcg package is used to solve the system of equations the convergence criterion on the maximum head change between iterations hclose is set to 10 4 m and the convergence criterion on the maximum flow residual rclose is set to 8 6 m3 day i e 0 34 of the total injection rate both criteria were met without difficulties in all the simulations solute transport is also simulated in steady state this approach is suitable as we are not interested in the front displacement of the doc instead this study focuses on the biodegradation achieved under normal operation when injection and extraction are carried out over a relatively long time compared to the groundwater travel time the median travel time is estimated to be 37 days from the simulation results the injection concentration c 0 is set identical in all the injection wells the actual value of c 0 is unimportant because it only has a scaling effect on the concentrations in this study and accordingly only the normalized concentrations c c 0 are analyzed the effective porosity dispersivity coefficients and first order biodegradation rate constant are considered constant in space and time best estimate and likely range of values for these parameters are given in table 2 the range of values for effective porosity ϕ is based on the analysis of 19 core samples from the target aquifer and the best estimate is calculated as the arithmetic mean the best estimate for longitudinal dispersivity αl is based on the rule of thumb α l 0 1 l c where lc is the travel distance this classical rule of thumb expresses what is known as the scale effect i e an increase of macrodispersivity with transport distance and was derived from a compilation of published values of dispersivity bear and cheng 2010 fetter et al 2017 specifically lc is taken as the median travel distance obtained by particle tracking analysis using modpath pollock 2012 1 000 particles are placed around each injection well and tracked until they reach an extraction well lc 37 m the range of values for αl covers three orders of magnitude around this best estimate gelhar et al 1992 the transverse dispersivity αt is defined by applying a fixed ratio of transverse dispersivity to longitudinal dispersivity equal to 0 1 the range of values for the first order decay constant μ is based on the batch experiments in this study specifically the minimum value is taken as the average of μ obtained under static conditions and the maximum value is taken as the average of μ obtained under shaking conditions and the best estimate is calculated as the arithmetic mean of these two values in mt3dms the implicit finite difference method with upstream weighting is employed as the solution scheme for advection no numerical dispersion was observed as checked by verifying that the results are the same when using a finer grid including for cases where the pe number is high hydrodynamic dispersion is implemented with the dispersion package and the first order decay reaction is implemented with the chemical reaction package the gcg package is used to solve the system of equations the convergence criterion on the maximum relative concentration change between iterations cclose is set equal to 10 7 and we further impose that the mass balance error should be less than 0 02 the latter criterion which is not part of mt3dms appeared necessary after observing that in a few cases the converged solution showed non negligible mass balance errors in such cases the above criterion was achieved by changing the initial concentration distribution and or the type of preconditioner in the gcg package additionally a number of cases required that we recompile mt3dms and modflow using double precision instead of the single precision with which the codes are usually distributed the reason for these additional steps is that we explored a very wide range of parameter values as explained in the following section 2 3 2 non dimensional formulation we formulate the problem in a non dimensional form to generalize the results to potentially different conditions including different injection extraction rates aquifer type and site scale however note that the relative well configuration is unchanged the darcy scale advection dispersion reaction equation adre is first recalled in its dimensional form 2 c t d c v c μ c where d is the dispersion tensor defined following the scheidegger bear model zheng and wang 1999 v is the groundwater velocity or average linear velocity and μ is the first order biodegradation rate constant note that recent studies showed that doc transport can follow anomalous transport dietrich et al 2013 mcinnis et al 2014 2015 however the complex interplay between transport and reaction is not the focus of this study we assume doc transport is fickian in this study to focus on the potential impact of incomplete mixng on biodegradation the median groundwater travel length lc is chosen as the characteristic length scale and the median groundwater travel time tc is chosen as the characteristic time scale these can be obtained by particle tracking analysis as described in section 2 3 1 this gave lc 37 m and tc 37 days the identical values are purely by coincidence note that lc is significantly larger than the grid size of 0 9 m the median travel time cannot be related to simulation temporal resolution since simulation is in steady state both for flow and transport the p e clet pe and damköhler da numbers are defined at darcy scale as 3 p e l c v c d c 4 d a μ t c where vc is the characteristic velocity scale defined as lc tc and dc is the characteristic dispersion scale defined as αlvc which is in line with the scheidegger bear model pe is a dimensionless number that represents the ratio of the characteristic advection rate to the characteristic dispersion rate while da is a dimensionless number that represents the ratio of the characteristic reaction rate to the characteristic transport rate here da is introduced in relation with field scale i e darcy scale transport which is typically dominated by advection and not by dispersion e g cunningham and mendoza sanchez 2006 golfier et al 2002 salehikhoo et al 2013 tartakovsky et al 2009 advective time scale is also relevant in the context of aquifer storage transfer and recovery further defining the following dimensionless variables 5 c c c 0 x x l c y y l c z z l c t t t c d d d c v v v c the adre can be recast in a dimensionless form as 6 c t 1 p e d c v c d a c note that d and v are not simply equal to 1 as would be the case if both d and v are constants while here they are spatially variable for a fixed relative well configuration the non dimensional problem is solely a function of pe and da we now discuss the realistic ranges of values for pe and da it should first be noted that with the above definition of dc d c α l v c pe can be rewritten as 7 p e l c α l if we further make use of the rule of thumb α l 0 1 l c mentioned in section 2 3 1 the rule of thumb p e 10 arises in reality field scale estimates of αl show a large scatter with values ranging over about 3 orders of magnitude for a given scale gelhar et al 1992 hence we suggest that 10 2 5 10 0 5 l c is a typical range of values for αl accordingly we suggest that 10 0 5 10 2 5 is a typical range of values for pe on the other hand da is controlled by μ and tc for the busan astr site a realistic range of value for μ is derived from the batch experiments see section 3 1 and tc is fixed once the injection and extraction rates are fixed however we aim to produce results that are applicable to different injection extraction rates and site scale affecting tc and different conditions that could affect μ therefore we do not limit a priori the range of values for da in the generalization i e we vary da over a wide range of values that comprehensively captures its influence on the results 3 results 3 1 batch experiment results the results of the batch experiments with the two different mixing conditions and four different solid liquid ratios are shown in fig 4 doc biodegradation is significantly faster under shaking conditions compared to static conditions across all the tested solid liquid ratios the biodegradation behavior was reasonably consistent among quadruplicate the control experiments confirm that the sorption of acetate was negligible and biodegradation was the driver for the reduction in acetate concentration fig 5 a shows the estimated first order kinetic rate constants and fig 5b shows the ratio of the rates between shaking and static conditions the error bar for reaction constants represents standard error and we obtained error bars for the ratio and the mean of ratio by following rules for the evaluation of standard uncertainty through functional relationships with uncorrelated variables farrance and frenkel 2012 the reaction rate constants under shaking conditions are significantly larger than the rate constants under static conditions over all solid liquid ratios the dependency of the reaction rate constant on the solid liquid ratio is not evident for application to field scale modeling we assume that there is no significant dependency of the reaction rate constants on the solid liquid ratio the average reaction rate constant over all solid liquid ratios is 0 44 1 day under shaking conditions and 0 092 1 day under static conditions these values are used in the field scale modeling of the busan site as shown in fig 5b the ratios between reaction rate constants are not very sensitive to the solid liquid ratio and are all around 4 9 blue horizontal line in fig 5b this mean ratio of 4 9 is used in the generalization section 3 2 2 3 2 field scale modeling results 3 2 1 busan site results the results for the specific case of the busan site with the astr operation scheme described in section 2 3 1 are first presented the contours of the calculated hydraulic heads and a number of flow lines are shown in fig 6 the spatial organization of the flow lines is complex due to the multiple injection extraction wells most of the injection wells can be seen to feed two or three different extraction wells the influence of pore scale mixing on the field scale biodegradation is analyzed from the sensitivity of the reactive transport simulation results to the first order decay rate constant the spatial concentration distributions for μ obtained under both shaking and static conditions are shown in fig 7 a and fig 7b respectively the influence of the mixing conditions is clearly visible while both cases show a decrease in concentration with increasing distance from the injection wells the biodegradation is significantly larger in the case of μ obtained under well mixed conditions the average normalized concentration at the extraction wells c ext c 0 is 0 154 in the first case with μ from diffusion limited mixing condition and 0 027 in the second case with μ from complete mixing condition this clearly shows a significant difference in the biodegradation efficiency and demonstrates that the pore scale mixing effect can have a significant impact on field scale biodegradation the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the first order decay rate constant the range of values arising from the difference in the mixing conditions is compared to the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity in fig 8 the latter two parameters are the most uncertain parameters of the model after the biodegradation rate and the rationale behind the ranges of values assumed for these parameters table 2 is discussed in section 2 3 1 the ranges of the values are representative of the typical uncertainty one has to deal with in practice this figure reveals that the biodegradation rate is the most sensitive parameter in the busan field site around the case where the best parameter estimates are used this result indicates that the uncertainty that would arise from not knowing the pore scale mixing conditions or in other words the error that could arise from assuming incorrect pore scale mixing conditions can be larger than the typical uncertainty arising from other parameters effective porosity and longitudinal dispersivity 3 2 2 generalization the analysis is generalized through a global sensitivity analysis in the parameter space formed by the two relevant dimensionless numbers of this problem pe and da a contour plot of c ext c 0 in the pe da parameter space is shown in fig 9 a in normal scale and fig 9b in logarithmic scale which better highlights the results where concentration is small note that pe is varied over 10 orders of magnitude i e beyond its realistic range of values so as to get a comprehensive analysis of its theoretical influence only the results between the white dashed lines correspond to realistic pe values da is also varied over 10 orders of magnitude although it is difficult to know how much da may vary in reality 10 orders of magnitude may not be unrealistic since da is a function of advection time scale which can vary significantly depending on pumping rate hydraulic parameters and distance between wells and reaction time scale which might vary significantly depending on bio physico chemical conditions both fig 9a and fig 9b show that the biodegradation efficiency increases with increasing da as expected the influence of pe is more complex biodegradation efficiency generally decreases with increasing pe for small values of da fig 9a whereas it generally increases with increasing pe for large values of da fig 9b overall the dependency on both pe and da is strongly nonlinear a major result of our study lies in fig 10 a this figure shows a contour plot of the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the pore scale mixing conditions through its impact on μ and therefore on da in the pe da parameter space the sensitivity s is defined as 8 s p e d a c ext c 0 2 c ext c 0 1 where c ext c 0 1 is the average normalized doc concentration at the extraction wells at pe and da 1 and c ext c 0 2 is the average normalized doc concentration at the extraction wells at pe and da 2 the subscript numbers 1 and 2 denote a difference in the value of da pe fixed where 9 d a 1 d a r μ 10 d a 2 d a r μ where rμ is the ratio between the value of μ obtained under shaking conditions and the value of μ obtained under static conditions r μ 4 9 this figure allows to identify where in the pe da parameter space the pore scale mixing conditions have a significant impact such a region e g where s 0 2 covers several orders of magnitude of da values and all the realistic values of pe the largest effect of the mixing conditions occurs for values of da around 1 this result is in line with the above observation that the influence of both pe and da becomes null when da is either very small or very large for comparison fig 10b shows a contour plot of the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the effective porosity ϕ through its impact on tc and therefore on da in the pe da parameter space the sensitivity s is also defined according to eq 8 where the subscript numbers 1 and 2 denote a difference in the value of da but here da 1 and da 2 are defined as 11 d a 1 d a r ϕ 12 d a 2 d a r ϕ where rϕ is the ratio between the maximum and the minimum values of ϕ at the busan site r ϕ 2 which is a typical uncertainty one has to deal with because ϕ also impacts da the sensitivity to ϕ displays the same patterns as the sensitivity to the mixing conditions in the pe da parameter space however it has a smaller magnitude reflecting the smaller range of values for ϕ compared to μ i e rϕ rμ in the similar manner fig 10c shows a contour plot of the sensitivity of c ext c 0 to the longitudinal dispersivity αl through its impact on pe in the pe da parameter space the sensitivity s is again defined according to eq 8 but here the subscript numbers 1 and 2 denote a difference in the value of pe i e p e p e 1 or p e p e 2 da fixed where 13 p e 1 p e r α l 14 p e 2 p e r α l where r α l is the ratio between the maximum and the minimum values of αl at the busan site r α l 10 3 which is a typical uncertainty one has to deal with this figure shows that c ext c 0 is mostly sensitive to αl for relatively low pe values ranging from about 10 5 to 101 with a maximum at p e 10 2 and for da values ranging from about 10 3 to 101 finally fig 11 identifies which parameter μ ϕ or αl is the most sensitive parameter in each point of the pe da parameter space this figure reveals that c ext c 0 is predominantly sensitive to either the mixing conditions through mixing dependent μ or αl depending on the value of pe and da the mixing conditions are the most sensitive factor over more than half of the parameter space this region includes the pe and da values that are relevant to the busan astr site therefore careful consideration of pore scale mixing dependent μ is critical for reducing uncertainty in field scale biodegradation predictions 4 summary and discussion this study demonstrates the importance of pore scale mixing on field scale biodegradation by combining laboratory sediment batch experiments and field scale modeling effective reaction rate constants obtained from two different mixing shaking and static conditions revealed that pore scale mixing alone can lead upto factor of about 5 difference in the reaction rate constants the biodegradation rate should be controlled by solid liquid interactions since microbial activity should be higher near the solid surface where microbes are attached fetter 2008 wen et al 2015 it is therefore intuitive that the reaction rate is a function of the degree of mixing because the surface contact probability should increase as pore scale mixing increases this study shows that pore scale mixing may be a major source of discrepancy between batch measured reaction rates and field calibrated reaction rates pore scale mixing has major implications on darcy scale model predictions darcy scale reactive transport models typically assume well mixed concentration below representative elementary volume rev scale therefore neglecting sub rev scale concentration fluctuations reaction rates obtained from well mixed batch experiments are consistent with this framework however this can lead to a large error since in reality concentration values can be inhomogeneous at the sub rev scale pore scale studies demonstrated that darcy scale models that do not consider incomplete mixing at pore scale may fail to properly predict reactive transport battiato et al 2009 de anna et al 2014 gramling et al 2002 knutson et al 2007 raje and kapoor 2000 tartakovsky et al 2009 this study confirms that pore scale mixing is indeed a key mechanism that affects biodegradation rates under realistic groundwater flow conditions pore scale mixing will likely be neither complete mixing nor diffusion limited mixing but somewhere in between the two bounds developing effective reactive transport models that accounts for pore scale mixing effects is mathematically very challenging and still an active area of research bolster et al 2012 cirpka and kitanidis 2000 ginn 2001 herrera et al 2017 lichtner and kang 2007 dykaar and kitanidis 1996 and sund et al 2015 upscaled solute degradation in an wavy walled channel and sund et al 2017 recently presented a variant of the spatial markov model dentz et al 2016 kang et al 2011 2017 le borgne et al 2008 that takes pore scale mixing effect into account however these studies are so far only applied to idealized periodic pore geometries recently numerical and theoretical upscaling strategies have been proposed to capture the effects of incomplete mixing on reaction rates especially in the context of bimolecular mixing driven reactions benson and bolster 2016 de anna et al 2014 ding et al 2013 paster et al 2014 porta et al 2016 2012 obtaining upscaled reaction models that take pore scale mixing into account is still largely an open question but the recent advances in bimolecular reactions and hybrid models that takes nonlinear heterogeneous reactions into account show promise battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2011 scheibe et al 2015 it should be noted that in this study the quantified impact of pore scale mixing on field scale biodegradation is restricted to our batch experimental conditions we assumed identical physico biochemical properties e g temperature ph and microbial community between batch and field the degree of mixing for the static conditions is never strictly zero and is ultimately controlled by the ratio of pore scale diffusion rate to surface reaction rate battiato et al 2009 solid liquid ratio is also a potentially important parameter that deserves further study and the types of indigenous bacteria will also affect the reaction rates while the actual degree of mixing in the aquifer remains unknown this study shows that pore scale mixing can be a major source of uncertainty in model predictions also our framework of impact quantification is not limited to a specific scenario therefore the impact of pore scale mixing can be further studied by extending our findings to different conditions geological heterogeneity and flow configuration are other key parameters that can play a major role spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and boundary conditions can have major impacts on global mixing and transport properties to focus on the effects of pore scale mixing we assumed effectively homogeneous aquifer which does not cause macroscopic preferential flow paths the relative importance of pore scale mixing and macroscopic flow pattern on effective reaction rates and the interplay between the two processes are not yet clear the framework established in this study can be extended to address such questions acknowledgments the authors acknowledge a grant 17awmp b066761 05 from the

708,many agricultural soils are tile drained in order to lower water tables and improve crop production but tile drains have a large impact on water flows and nutrient transport the objectives of the study were to assess modelling requirements for describing shallow groundwater and tile drainage dynamics and to evaluate how tile drains affect groundwater flow across the redox interface where nitrate reduction in the subsurface occurs the study was conducted on a 33 hectare tile drained field within a weichsel till area in fensholt catchment denmark the study consisted of 2 5 years high frequency monitoring and numerical modelling using a variably saturated 3d hydrological model feflow with a detailed representation of the tile drain network field data showed extremely rapid increases up to 1 m per day in the groundwater heads when the autumn water surplus starts drain discharge was found to follow the dynamics in heads high frequency monitoring at least once per day is therefore necessary in order to capture the dynamics in shallow groundwater and tile discharge the dynamics showed simultaneous rapid increase in groundwater heads down to a depth of 22 m illustrating the key importance of deeper geology in understanding the hydrological processes in this area the temporal dynamics in head and drain discharge were successfully captured by the hydrological model and the steepness of the retention curve was found to be important for this the calibrated model was successfully tested against discharge in the stream draining a larger area the model results showed that tile drains affect the water flow in the area and significantly decrease the downward fluxes across the redox interface located on average at 3 6 m depth tile drains therefore have a large effect on the amount of nitrate reduction in the subsurface and on the nitrate fluxes to receiving surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological modeling field scale tile drainage shallow groundwater temporal dynamics high frequency data 1 introduction many agricultural fields in humid areas are artificially drained via tile drains in order to lower the water table and thereby prevent water logging and improve plant growth tile drains have a large impact on the hydrology and flow patterns in a catchment schilling et al 2012 boland brien et al 2014 king et al 2014 schilling et al 2015 sloan et al 2016 thomas et al 2016 amado et al 2017 tile drains are also found to affect the nitrogen n loadings to surface water van den eertwegh et al 2006 rozemeijer et al 2010b schilling et al 2015 amado et al 2017 which is a concern due to the large eutrophication problems in many european waters eea 2005 gustafsson et al 2012 in denmark around 50 of the agricultural area is tile drained especially the glacially derived clayey soils in the eastern part of the country olesen 2009 moller et al 2018 most climate models predict an increase in precipitation for denmark in the future seaby et al 2013 and the need for tile drainage on agricultural fields is therefore expected to increase refsgaard et al 2013 a large part of denmark is covered by young glacial sediments weichselian age and here the redox interface is normally found close to the surface the redox interface delineates the transition from oxic to anoxic conditions where nitrate n is naturally reduced to n2 fujikawa and hendry 1991 postma et al 1991 ernstsen 1996 rodvang and simpkins 2001 hansen et al 2008 the shallow depth of the redox interface together with a groundwater dominated hydrology results in a high extent of nitrate reduction in groundwater in denmark højberg et al 2015 højberg et al 2017 tile drains however act as a shortcut from the field directly to streams whereby nitrate leaching from agricultural fields bypasses the natural reduction capacity present in the subsurface and riparian wetlands blicher mathiesen et al 2014 ernstsen et al 2015 schilling et al 2015 therefore it is important to understand how tile drainage affects the split of water flowing into tile drains and percolating to the deeper subsurface and crossing the redox interface the effect of tile drains have received increasing attention the last years but the studies have focused on the effect of tile drainage on the stream hydrograph schilling et al 2012 boland brien et al 2014 king et al 2014 sloan et al 2016 thomas et al 2016 amado et al 2017 or mean groundwater travel times schilling et al 2012 schilling et al 2015 to our knowledge no studies have looked at the effect of tile drainage on the flow across the redox interface numerical models can help us improve our understanding of tile drainage dynamics and their effect on water flows tile drained areas have been modelled using a variety of numerical models ranging from one dimensional 1d root zone models such as drainmod sammons et al 2005 wang et al 2006 rzwqm walker et al 2000 ma et al 2007 and adapt nangia et al 2010 to the semi distributed models with a simple groundwater zone such as drain warmf dayyani et al 2010b mhydas drain tiemeyer et al 2007 and swat moriasi et al 2013 bosch et al 2014 and finally to the fully distributed models with three dimensional 3d representation of groundwater flow such as mike she hansen et al 2013 drainflow shokri and bardsley 2016 cathy muma et al 2014 muma et al 2016 flush turunen et al 2013 nousiainen et al 2015 salo et al 2017 and hydrogeosphere rozemeijer et al 2010a de schepper et al 2015 frey et al 2016 thomas et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 amado et al 2018 in catchment scale studies the tile drain systems are normally implemented in a simplified way partly because there is often little knowledge about the locations of the tile drains and because including the exact location of tile drains would require a highly discretized model grid and thereby long computational times some catchment scale studies include tile drains as a head dependent sink in all grid cells in the model hansen et al 2013 or as a uniform high conductivity layer at the drain depth thomas et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 set up a hydrogeosphere model for the fensholt catchment in denmark here they implemented tile drains as nodal sinks seepage faces with specific locations but they simplified the drain network and included only the main pipes in order to reduce simulation time in field scale studies it is possible to model tile drains more detailed many field scale studies on tile drainage have been conducted using the 1d root zone models such as drainmod singh et al 2006 wang et al 2006 dayyani et al 2010a but some more recent field scale studies have used the 3d models hydrogeosphere rozemeijer et al 2010a de schepper et al 2015 amado et al 2018 and flush turunen et al 2013 nousiainen et al 2015 salo et al 2017 almost all field scale studies on tile drains consider only the upper few meters 1 5 m below ground surface mbgs in the models and thereby do not include deeper geology to our knowledge only the study by de schepper et al 2015 included deeper geology below 5 mbgs high frequency monitoring of the temporal dynamics in shallow groundwater has been reported in several studies dayyani et al 2009 van der velde et al 2010 ernstsen et al 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 however such high frequency measurements have not been included in long term 3d modelling studies of tile drain dynamics rozemeijer et al 2010a used continuous hydraulic head measurements from one well in their 3d model but the simulation period was only 2 days dayyani et al 2009 used daily data on water table depths from three wells in a long term modelling study but applied only a 1d root zone model using drainmod the research objectives of this study were i to assess the modelling requirements for obtaining a sound description of shallow groundwater and tile drainage dynamics and ii to evaluate the effects of tile drains on the groundwater flow across the redox interface besides the novelty of the research objectives the novelty of this study lies in our modeling approach since we set up a 3d field scale tile drain model with a detailed representation of the tile drain network including deeper geology down to 22 mbgs and we use a long term data set 2 5 years with high frequency monitoring of the temporal dynamics in the shallow groundwater 2 field site the field site was located in the 606 hectare ha fensholt catchment which is a headwater catchment within the 101 km2 norsminde fjord catchment located on the east coast of jutland in denmark fig 1 norsminde fjord is subject to eutrophication and sensitive to nitrogen why a significant decrease in n load to the fjord is required to meet the environmental goals of the eu water framework directive danish nature agency 2016 the land use in fensholt catchment is dominated by intensive agriculture with the main crop types being winter wheat and spring barley the climate is temperate and humid see supplementary material a and due to predominance of clayey till soils the catchment is to a large extent tile drained the study was conducted on a 33 ha tile drained field drain area fig 1d in the north eastern part of the fensholt catchment where the outflow from the tile drains has been continuously monitored tile drains are found at depth 1 m the location of the tile drains was digitized based on a drain map from det danske hedeselskab the danish heath society dated 1944 a constructed mini wetland was established in 2014 at the outlet of the drain area fig 1d with the purpose of removing nitrate from the drainage water 2 1 geology and groundwater system the surficial geology in the area consists of a 20 50 m thick quaternary cover of glacial deposits of weichselian age overlain in parts of the main stream valley by 2 3 m of post glacial freshwater peat the glacial deposits are composed of clayey till a danish clay till is defined by a clay content of 12 35 with smaller distributed sand units of glaciofluvial origin embedded within the till neogene and paleogene marine sediments are located underneath the quaternary cover the neogene layers comprise a clay dominated formation from miocene with sandy units interbedded which can reach thicknesses of more than 10 m the paleogene layers are composed of very fine grained impermeable marl and clay the groundwater system in the till is unconfined with water table close to terrain the miocene sand comprises a confined aquifer from where water extraction in the area takes place he et al 2014 de schepper et al 2017 2 2 redox interface and nitrate based on observations of sediment colour change in boreholes the redox interface at the field site is found between 2 2 5 5 mbgs and on average at 3 6 mbgs several studies have found sediment colour change to be a good indication of the redox interface in quaternary till deposits ernstsen 1996 hansen et al 2008 a geochemical investigation at the field site jakobsen et al 2018 has found the nitrate concentration in the oxidized groundwater above the redox interface to be around 60 mg l and decreasing to 0 mg l at around 4 5 mbgs together with the decrease in nitrate an increase in sulfate has been observed from 30 50 mg l above the redox interface to 60 120 mg l below the redox interface indicating that nitrate reduction by pyrite oxidation is occurring at the field site more information in supplementary material b 3 field methods 3 1 field installations the installations at the field site were made in a number of steps during the period july 2014 to february 2016 some installations were removed during the field period due to plowing harvest or were used only for geochemical investigations in the following we describe only the installations used in the hydrological modeling fig 2 a full description of all installations and collected data at the field site is found in jakobsen et al 2016 2018 3 1 1 piezometers hydraulic head measurements were obtained from 44 piezometers installed within the drain area at depths between 1 8 m to 6 7 m fig 2 the piezometers consisted of four groups find more information in supplementary material g the p piezometers p1 p24 were installed in july november 2014 p1 p19 and in february 2016 p20 p24 they were placed around the drain area and included four nests of piezometers at different depths at the foot of the hill p20 p22 and p14 p15 in the middle p7 and p16 and at the top of the hill p10 p13 the m piezometers m1 m21 labelled m transect in fig 2 were installed in february 2016 at various depths as a 2d transect along the direction of groundwater flow the piezometers c2 c6 e7 and e8 were installed in october 2014 but removed again in august 2015 due to harvest these piezometers were part of a cluster of piezometers a e piezometers see location in supplementary material b which were mainly used for water sampling the piezometers were installed by hand auger and consisted of plastic tubes with outer diameters of 22 or 32 mm the tubes had 0 3 mm slotted screens with screen lengths of mostly 0 20 0 30 m a few piezometers had a screen length of 1 0 m see supplementary material g all piezometers were installed with fine filter sand around the screen and the screened section was sealed off with quartz flour and or bentonite the last group consisted of three piezometers already existing at the field site when starting our study these piezometers were installed by the idræn project by aarhus university see more www idraen dk and located at the foot of the hill idrain low in the middle idrain mid and at the top of the hill idrain up fig 2 these piezometers were 2 m deep and screened all the way to the ground surface 3 1 2 deep well to get an idea of the deeper downwards flux from the drain area the piezometers were supplemented by a deep multiscreened well t1 located northeast of the m transect the well was installed using auger drilling with five screens one in the underlying miocene sand and four where minor intervals of sand were encountered the five screens depth to middle of screen where located at 9 0 m t1 5 12 5 m t1 4 17 2 m t1 3 21 8 m t1 2 and 43 3 m t1 1 below ground surface the well consisted of five tubes with outer diameters of 32 mm the tubes had 0 3 mm slotted screens with screen lengths of 0 5 for the lower screen t1 1 and 1 m for the four upper screens t1 2 t1 5 the screens were installed with a fine sand gravel pack around them and the screened intervals were separated hydraulically by bentonite the bentonite was separated from the screened interval by a quartz flour slurry to minimize geochemical effects of the bentonite 3 2 head measurements the hydraulic head in the piezometers and the deep well was manually measured using a water level meter pls 50 elwa teknik herning denmark in total 19 measuring campaigns were conducted during the field period from july 2014 to november 2017 however since the piezometers and the deep well were installed at different times and some were removed during the field period a varying number of manually measured hydraulic head data exist in addition to the manual measurements water level loggers solinst levellogger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada and schlumberger mini diver schlumberger water services delft the netherlands were used for continuous monitoring of the hydraulic head the water level loggers were set to record the pressure every 4th hour and the heads were afterwards corrected for variations in the atmospheric pressure by readings from a barologger solinst barologger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada located above the water table in piezometer idrain up continuous head data covering different parts of the field period were obtained from in total 23 piezometers and the two lower screens in well t1 3 3 drain and stream discharge drain and stream discharges were measured by the idræn project aarhus university www idraen dk drain discharge was measured at the drain outlet fig 1d using an electromagnetic flowmeter khrone optiflux 3070 flow meter khrone messtechnik gmbh duisburg germany which measures the electrical potential difference generated by water flowing through a magnetic field stream discharge was measured at two stations fig 1c by continuously logging the water level using water level loggers ott orpheus mini water level logger ott hydromet gmbh kempten germany and a q h relation to convert to discharge 4 modelling methods the hydrological model was set up using the finite element model feflow trefry and muffels 2007 diersch 2014 as a transient model simulating 3d unsaturated saturated flow using richards equation the model was run for the period 1 may 2012 to 31 may 2017 where the period 1 may 2012 to 31 december 2014 was used as warm up period for the model and the period 1 january 2015 to 31 may 2017 as calibration period 4 1 model area and discretization the model area covers 92 hectare fig 3 and extends vertically from the ground surface down to 22 mbgs when drilling the deep well t1 we came across a 5 m thick layer of fat oligocene clay between the two deepest screens at 22 and 43 mbgs we also found a head difference of 30 m and different dynamics between these two screens see fig 7 third row we therefore expect only limited flow to occur between these levels and consequently defined the model bottom at 22 mbgs the stream was used to delineate the model area along the western and southern boundary whereas the northern and eastern model boundaries were delineated based on topographical divides the model mesh was generated using the build in mesh generator based on the triangle algorithm shewchuk 1996 the outline of the gauged drain system was included in the mesh generation in order to have nodes placed exactly along the tile drains fig 4 the mesh was refined close to the stream and around the gauged drain system the mesh was simplified around the ungauged drain system in order to reduce simulation time the final 2d model mesh consisted of 22 501 triangular elements with an element edge length varying between 2 8 m and 26 6 m the 2d mesh was extended in the vertical direction and was divided into 27 layers with thicknesses from 0 125 to 2 m fig 5 resulting in a 3d mesh of 607 527 elements the elevation of the mesh was interpolated from a 1 6 m digital elevation model the constructed mini wetland was included in the model mesh by cutting out elements down to one m depth by making the elements inactive 4 2 climate input the precipitation data used in the study originate from two local precipitation stations precipitation station 1 was located within the fensholt catchment and precipitation station 2 a few kilometres south of the catchment fig 1 precipitation station 1 was started in august 2016 and until then data from station 2 were used data on temperature and potential evapotranspiration originate from the danish metrologic institute s dmi 20 km grid since the feflow model does not simulate evapotranspiration the climate data were run through an existing mike she model for the norsminde fjord catchment he et al 2015 to estimate the actual evapotranspiration afterwards the daily net precipitation rate was calculated as the precipitation rate minus the actual evapotranspiration rate and this was used as the climate input to the model on all top nodes the net precipitation input was positive in days where precipitation was higher than evapotranspiration and negative during periods when the evapotranspiration was larger than precipitation more information on the climate data can be found in supplementary material a 4 3 boundary conditions bc along the stream at the western and southern model boundaries a general head bc called a fluid transfer bc in feflow was defined on the nodes on top and bottom of layer 1 i e down to 0 25 m depth the reference hydraulic head at the bc was set equal to the elevation of the given node and a flow constrain was applied in order to only allow outflow from the model domain the outflow to the stream was controlled by a conductance parameter assigned to the elements neighbouring the bc nodes along the northern and eastern model boundaries following topographical divides a no flow boundary was defined on the bottom of the model 22 mbgs a small constant flux bc leakage to the underlying aquifer was defined which was subject to calibration a constant flux bc was chosen on the model bottom instead of a no flow bc since some flow to the underlying miocene aquifer is expected based on the modelling results from he et al 2015 and the fact that the net precipitation is larger 20 50 mm yr than stream discharge see supplementary material a in the constructed mini wetland a constant head bc was defined at the bottom located 1 m below surface equal to 0 5 m above the bottom elevation 4 4 tile drains the tile drains were implemented in the model at 1 mbgs i e between model layer 5 and 6 and were represented by a seepage face bc a seepage face is a hydraulic head bc equal to the elevation of the node where only outflow from the model is allowed i e the drains become active when the water table rises above the drain level and become in active when it drops below when using a seepage face bc there is full contact between the drain and the porous medium during the work at the field site it came to our attention that the actual extent of the gauged drain system was less than shown in fig 3 the drain map from 1944 of the planned drain system includes a note stating that the tile drain work was carried out in 1948 however there is no confirmation that the plans in the map were strictly followed during the summer of 2016 the local water supply company dug down a new pipe across the top of the drain area and did not find any tile drains until they got close to the stream it was therefore decided to remove part of the gauged drain system in the model seen as the green part in fig 3a 4 5 soil and geology the distribution of soils and geological units used in the model was based on danish national soils and geology maps geophysical data and stochastic modeling fig 5 the geology was described in detail for the a e piezometers as clayey till with small sand stringers few centimetres thick this corresponds well with the danish national soil map adhikari et al 2013 which shows that the whole model area is covered by a sand mixed clay soil standard weight for this type of soil 10 15 clay 0 30 silt 55 90 sand and the danish national surface geology map pedersen et al 2011 showing a uniform distribution of clayey till based on this information the upper 1 5 m of the model was described as a uniform sand mixed clay soil and from 1 5 to 3 mbgs as a uniform clayey till the sand stringers described in the a e piezometers were too small to be directly included in the model geophysical data were also available from the idræn project for a large part of the model area based on electromagnetic induction emi using a dualem sensor the resistivities of the sediments have been measured for each 0 5 m down to 3 5 mbgs these data indicate the presence of a zone with higher resistivity and thereby higher sand content and higher hydraulic conductivity this zone shown for the upper layer from 0 to 0 5 mbgs in fig 3b is visible in all the resistivity layers from 0 to 3 5 m the high k zone was manually delineated in gis and implemented in the upper three meters of the model below three meters depth a stochastically generated geological model covering the entire norsminde fjord catchment was used consisting of two units clayey till and glaciofluvial sand the geological model was constructed by he et al 2014 based on borehole data and geophysical data using the airborne transient electromagnetic system skytem and generated using the geostatistical software tprogs 4 6 model initialization parameters and calibration the model was initialized by first running the model with initial conditions equal to fully saturated conditions the following model runs during the calibration phase then used the simulated hydraulic head from the last time step from the previous simulation as initial conditions the initial and calibrated model parameters 24 in total are seen in table 1 the initial values for the saturated parameters were based on de schepper et al 2017 and he et al 2015 however the initial k value for the clayey till below 3 mbgs was based on results from slug tests conducted at the field site see supplementary material c the calibrated k value for this unit ended up being equal to the arithmetic mean k value from the slug tests the unsaturated zone parameters were based on standard values for a sand clay loam and a loamy sand from the unsoda database nemes et al 2001 the model parameters were manually calibrated using a trial and error approach against hydraulic head data from the piezometers and the deep well together with daily drain discharge from the drain station the overall water balance was also evaluated during the calibration due to long simulation time 30 h and much longer in cases of steep retention curves an automated calibration nor a formal sensitivity analysis were performed the parameters found to be sensitive during the manual calibration were mainly the hydraulic conductivities the van genuchten n for clay retention curve steepness and out transfer rate conductance at the stream bc the model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and volumetric error ve for drain discharge and root mean square error rmse and mean error me for hydraulic head see supplementary material d 4 7 model testing because of the short observation period a traditional split sample validation was not conducted instead the model was tested by making a comparison of the simulated discharge to the stream against observed stream discharge the model area only covers a part of the stream system in fensholt catchment 92 ha out of 412 ha so the comparison of simulated and observed stream discharge was done by comparing the discharge in millimeter the observed stream discharge was taken as the discharge measured at the downstream station minus the discharge at the upstream station divided by the area between the two stations fig 1c 4 8 scenario no tile drainage after the calibration of the reference model representing the present situation at the field site a scenario was run to test the impact of tile drainage on the flow compared to undrained conditions the scenario was run by removing all tile drain nodes in the model and keeping all other parameters unchanged 5 field results 5 1 hydraulic heads and groundwater flow based on observations of hydraulic heads the horizontal groundwater flow direction at the field site is found to generally follow the terrain from northeast to southwest see supplementary material e vertical contouring of the observed hydraulic heads in the m transect from 17 february and 24 august 2016 are seen in fig 6 the groundwater flow in february is primarily horizontal in the upper part of the transect above the redox interface turning to a more vertical direction in the deeper part below the redox interface this indicates that only some of the water leaving the root zone will cross the redox interface in august the upper piezometers are dry and the flow is more vertical the temporal variation in hydraulic head is seen in fig 7 for three of the m piezometers screened at different depths together with the estimated net precipitation the head is seen to vary by up to 2 7 m in m5 and 1 9 m in m4 at m18 the shallowest of the three piezometers the water table falls below the bottom of the screen during both summers the decrease in head starts when the net precipitation begins to be negative due to high evapotranspiration in summer and occurs gradually over a period of 5 5½ months in fall when the net precipitation becomes primarily positive the head increases again the increase in head in the fall is seen to happen very rapidly with most of the increase happening within 5 6 days when the head increase is at its highest the head in e g m5 rises 93 cm within one day this rapid increase in heads indicates a steep retention curve for the sediment plotting the hydraulic head from the three piezometers on the same plot fig 7 bottom left reveals that the head increase in the fall occurs at the same time in all three depths the rapid and synchronous response is likely due to the fractures in the till the hydraulic head variation in the two lower screens of the deep well t1 is also seen in fig 7 the head in the upper four screens t1 5 t1 2 are very similar with an average hydraulic head of around 82 m see data from t1 5 t1 3 in supplementary material f and the vertical gradient between these screens is thus very low 0 02 0 04 m m the hydraulic head in the lowest screen t1 1 is on average 52 m and thereby 30 m below the head in the screens above the vertical gradient between the two lower screens t1 2 to t1 1 is thereby much larger and varies between 1 3 to 1 4 m m furthermore there is much more variation in the hydraulic head during the year for the upper four screens 1 2 m than for the lowermost screen 0 4 m the hydraulic head from t1 2 was compared to m4 5 9 m deep in order to compare the timing fig 7 bottom right it is seen that the increase in head in the fall in t1 2 happens simultaneously with the increase in m4 the remaining observations of hydraulic head can be found in supplementary material f 5 2 drain discharge the daily observed drain discharge at the outlet of the drain area fig 1d is seen in fig 8 the drain discharge is low in summer months and high in winter months with many peaks the drain discharge thereby follows the temporal patterns in net precipitation and hydraulic head fig 7 it is clear that the tile drains starts to receive water in september 2016 coinciding with the rapid increase in hydraulic head in the piezometers fig 7 6 modelling results 6 1 reference model 6 1 1 hydraulic head the simulated and observed hydraulic head for all 48 piezometers wells included in the model calibration can be found in supplementary material f the model is found to capture the observed hydraulic heads and their variation in most of the piezometers error statistics for all 48 piezometers wells resulted in an average me of 0 12 m and an average rmse of 0 61 m table 2 however the head is overestimated in piezometers p24 p7 and p16 p7 and p16 are located underneath a power pylon and we suspect that the soil and the hydraulic head in this area is disturbed by the pylon base the model is also able to capture the dynamics observed in the m transect with the slow decrease in head during summer and the fast increase in fall the hydraulic heads in the deep t well are found to be overestimated by around one meter in all of the four upper screens the deepest screen is outside the model domain the dynamics in the simulated heads at the t well are furthermore found to be delayed compared to the observations about 30 days 6 1 2 drain discharge the simulated daily drain discharge is plotted together with the observed drain discharge from the drain station in fig 8 the model is seen to capture the general dynamics in observed daily drain flow reasonably well but some peaks are overestimated and some are underestimated on monthly scale the simulated drain flow also fits the observations reasonably well in most month but in december 2015 the simulated drain flow is notably overestimated see supplementary material h the error statistics for the simulated daily drain discharge is seen in table 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the whole calibration period is 0 48 but it increases to 0 73 if only considering the second half of the calibration period after 1 3 2016 the volumetric error is 19 for the whole calibration period and improves to 15 after 1 3 2016 6 1 3 stream discharge in order to test the model a comparison of the simulated discharge to the stream against observed stream discharge was made fig 9 the simulated stream discharge is defined as the sum of the discharge going directly to the stream bc and the drain discharge from both the gauged and ungauged drain system the model is seen to capture both the level and the daily dynamics in stream discharge well fig 9 at monthly scale the model is found to fit the observed stream discharge well in most months however in january 2015 and may 2015 the simulated stream discharge is too low and in december 2015 the stream discharge is too high see supplementary material h the nash sutcliffe efficiency table 2 for daily stream discharge for the whole calibration period is 0 42 but it increases to 0 78 if only considering the second half of the calibration period after 1 3 2016 the volumetric error is 11 for the whole calibration period and improves to 1 after 1 3 2016 6 1 4 water balance the total simulated water balance for the whole calibration period 1 1 2015 to 31 5 2017 is seen in fig 10 the total inflow to the model is 838 mm yr and the outflow is 830 mm yr which means the model has a water balance error of 8 1 mm yr corresponding to 1 0 of the inflow the inflow is dominated by the positive net precipitation i e days where precipitation is higher than evapotranspiration which makes up 804 mm yr corresponding to 96 of the inflow the rest of the inflow 34 mm y or 4 originates from the constructed mini wetland and storage change the outflow is mainly occurring as negative net precipitation i e days where evapotranspiration is higher than precipitation which makes up 392 mm yr corresponding to 47 of the outflow the second largest outflow is the outflow at the stream bc which is equal to 235 mm yr or 28 outflow to both the gauged and ungauged drain system makes up 167 mm yr or 20 the remaining outflow 36 mm yr or 4 occurs at the lower bc and at the constructed mini wetland the water balances for the winter period 1 10 2015 to 31 3 2016 and the summer period 1 4 2016 to 30 9 2016 are seen in fig 10 as well the total inflow and outflow in the model are rather similar during the two seasons but the contributions to the water balance are different in the winter period the inflow to the model is completely dominated by positive net precipitation 451 mm half yr or 99 7 of inflow in the summer period the positive net precipitation only makes up 69 316 mm half yr of the total inflow and 30 of the input to the model comes from storage release from the porous medium 139 mm half yr inflow from the mini wetland contributes to 0 3 1 mm half yr of the inflow in the winter period and 1 5 mm half yr in the summer period the major outflows from the model in the winter period are discharge to the tile drains corresponding to 38 171 mm half yr and discharge to the stream corresponding to 37 163 mm half yr the negative net precipitation i e evapotranspiration makes up 14 60 mm half yr of the outflow the remaining outflow 52 mm half yr or 12 occurs as storage capture outflow at the lower bc and outflow to the mini wetland in the summer period the outflow is dominated by negative net precipitation which makes up 72 329 mm half yr of the total outflow discharge to the stream corresponds to 19 89 mm half yr of the outflow in the summer period and discharge to the drains systems is equal to 5 25 mm half yr the remaining outflow in the summer period 16 mm half yr or 3 is outflow through the lower bc and to the mini wetland 6 2 scenario no tile drainage 6 2 1 water balance the water balance for the whole calibration period for the no tile drainage scenario is seen in fig 10 removing the tile drains from the model is seen to result in an increase in discharge directly to the stream compared to the reference model from 28 to 45 of the total outflow the undrained scenario also has an increase in outflow to the wetland 6 2 2 flow patterns the flow patterns in the model were investigated by looking at the vertical water fluxes between model layers in three different parts of the model fig 3 flux area 1 and flux area 2 located on the uphill plateau and flux area 3 located in a 50 m buffer around the main stream on the southern border of the model flux area 1 is tile drained and flux area 2 is undrained in the reference model the vertical water fluxes for the tile drained flux area 1 are seen in fig 11 the downward fluxes fig 11 upper row in the reference model are high in all the upper model layers down to the depth of the tile drains at 1 mbgs just below the drain level the downward flux decreases significantly in both the calibration and winter period from 1 5 mbgs and further down the downward fluxes become more or less stable this indicates that some of the infiltrating water is removed by horizontal flow in the upper part of the profile above the redox interface which was also seen in the m transect fig 6 when removing the tile drains in the undrained scenario the downward fluxes are also high in the upper model layers but decrease gradually over the entire depth the fluxes are considerably larger below the drain level in the undrained scenario compared to the reference model in the summer period the downward fluxes are considerably smaller compared to winter and the fluxes are higher in the undrained scenario than in the reference model for the reference model the downward fluxes in the summer period are seen not to be significantly affected by the tile drains at 1 mbgs since the drain system is not active during most of the summer period the upward water fluxes fig 11 lower row are highest just below the drain level in the reference model for the calibration and winter period in the undrained scenario the upward water fluxes gradually decrease with depth during the summer period the upward fluxes are highest in the upper model layer due to high evapotranspiration in this period the vertical water fluxes in the undrained flux area 2 are shown in fig 12 the downward fluxes gradually decrease with depth for the reference model in the calibration and winter period when removing the tile drains in the rest of the model in the undrained scenario the downward fluxes increase in this area thus even though this area is undrained it is still affected by the tile drains in the neighboring area the downward fluxes below the drain level are considerable larger for flux area 2 than for flux area 1 for both the reference model and the undrained scenario which may be due to the higher elevation of this area fig 3 the vertical fluxes in the zone around the main stream flux area 3 is seen in fig 13 this area of the model is dominated by very high upward fluxes in both the reference model and the undrained scenario the patterns in upwards fluxes are similar between the reference model and the undrained scenario but the fluxes are around 20 higher since discharge directly to the stream is the main output in the undrained scenario as was seen in the water balance fig 10 the upward fluxes are highest in model layer 2 and then decreases with increasing depth the same pattern is seen both for the winter period and the summer period the dominating downwards and upwards vertical flow components in flux areas 1 2 and flux area 3 respectively show that water is flowing horizontally downhill towards the river flux area 3 illustrating the 3 d nature of the flow pattern 6 2 3 flow across the redox interface the tile drains are thus found to decrease the downward water flux on the uphill plateau both for the tile drained flux area 1 and undrained flux area 2 area at the depth of the redox interface average depth 3 6 mbgs the downward flux in the drained area flux area 1 is decreased by 45 when having tile drains in the model for the undrained area flux area 2 the downward flux is decreased by 8 when tile drains are included in the neighbouring area at the field site nitrate is found to disappear as it crosses the redox interface located on average at 3 6 mbgs the geochemical data indicates that nitrate is removed due to reduction by pyrite the downward fluxes from the hydrological model can give an indication of the amount of nitrate reduction occurring in the sediment and how the tile drains affect this comparing the downward fluxes at the redox interface with the flux just below the root zone below the c horizon in 0 75 mbgs we find that 23 of the water and thereby also nitrate leaving the root zone will pass the redox interface and will be reduced in the tile drained area flux area 1 in the reference model when removing all tile drains in the model the nitrate reduction is 44 tile drainage is thereby estimated to decrease the nitrate reduction in the subsurface at the field site by 21 7 discussion and conclusions 7 1 model performance the hydrological model set up in this study fits the observed daily hydraulic heads and drain discharge reasonably well the model overestimated the drain discharge volume by 19 for the whole calibration period and 15 after 1 3 2016 the model was tested against stream discharge which the model also captured satisfactorily the stream flow volume was underestimated by 11 for the whole calibration period but when considering the period after 1 3 2016 the stream flow volume was overestimated by only 1 the reason for the lower performance in the start of the simulation period could be that data from the precipitation station within fensholt catchment station 1 fig 1 were not available until august 2016 until then precipitation data from station 2 located further away were used and this station could be less representative for the conditions at the field site there can be a number of possible reasons why the model overestimates the drain discharge the hydraulic heads are in general well estimated but for some piezometers and for some periods during the calibration period the head is overestimated which can result in too much drain discharge in the model another reason can be that the extent of the tile drain system defined in the reference model is still too large compared to reality we did try to map the location of the drain system using gpr ground penetrating radar but the results were not good enough to be used to locate the tile drains a third reason for the overestimation can be that the tile drains are not fully effective anymore as assumed in the model and finally observations along the stream indicated additional drain outlets whereby some drain flow is bypassing the drain gauge even though the drain flow is overestimated we find that the total discharge to the stream is underestimated when considering the whole calibration period this could indicate that the discharge to the stream from the non simulated part of the area between the two stream gauging stations is higher than in the model area a reason for this could be that there is a connection between the stream and the underlying miocene sand aquifer in this part of the catchment and thereby an inflow from this deeper aquifer de schepper et al 2017 set up a model for the entire fensholt catchment and simulated drain discharge from both the gauged drain system included in our study and another drain system situated outside our model area however they simplified the drain network greatly and included only the main pipes de schepper et al 2017 reached a satisfactory performance for simulated drain discharge from the gauged drain system ve 5 but their model had a poor performance for the other drain area ve 80 and stream discharge ve 34 7 2 model requirements limitations and uncertainties 7 2 1 hydrological processes the feflow code trefry and muffels 2007 diersch 2014 simulates the flow processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones by solving richards equation for both domains in an integrated manner rather than coupling two independent partial differential equations like in e g mike she abbott et al 1986b 1986a contrary to other integrated model codes like hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 feflow does not include description of evapotranspiration and overland flow processes it is well known that comprehensive computational requirements puts a constraint to which setups and applications of integrated models are possible in practice as an example the hydrogeosphere model for the fensholt catchment established by de schepper et al 2017 required 10 days simulation time for a single model run although the drainage network was grossly simplified in our model setup we have utilised the window of practical simulation time max a couple of days for one run to focus on obtaining a very detailed subsurface process description with fine temporal and spatial resolutions while we did not explicitly include evapotranspiration and overland flow process descriptions instead we forced the model with net precipitation calculated by another hydrological model known to simulate evapotranspiration processes in this area well and we ignored overland flow which is of minor importance in our study area our results with the good reproductions of the dynamics of local scale groundwater heads and drain discharge justify these priorities comparing our results to the poorer performance of the hydrogeosphere and mike she models for the same area reported by de schepper et al 2017 we suggest that a detailed spatial resolution around the individual tile drains is crucial for obtaining a physically sound description of the drain flow dynamics including the split between water flowing horizontally into the drains and water flowing vertically to and from deeper groundwater 7 2 2 tile drains the tile drains were included in the model as seepage face bc s i e nodal sinks that removes the water from the model when the water table rises above the drain level and becomes in active when it drops below a theoretically more correct description of the tile drains would be to describe them as 1d line elements where the model simulates the water flowing in the pipes and also allows the water to run out of the pipes however describing tile drains as 1d line elements requires very long simulations times de schepper et al 2015 2017 and is therefore not feasible when 3d catchment models are used to simulate several years only a few studies have described tile drains as 1d line elements in 3d models macquarrie and sudicky 1996 rozemeijer et al 2010a yue 2010 de schepper et al 2015 but the areas including discrete tile drains in these studies were small few hectares and the simulation periods were short hours to a few days by using a seepage face bc for the tile drains we as mentioned assume full contact between the drains and the porous medium thereby the efficiency of the tile drains is not included in the model since the drain network at the field site was installed in 1948 the drains may not be fully effective anymore nousiainen et al 2015 stated that the efficiency of older networks is often lower and also showed that it is important to consider the efficiency of tile drains however we have no information of the maintenance of the drains the effectiveness of the tile drains could have been implemented in the model using a fluid transfer bc which was used for the stream where a conductance term controls the exchange however using a fluid transfer bc for tile drains would require a much finer discretization of the model mesh where tile drain lines meet since this would increase the simulation time this boundary type was not chosen in this study 7 2 3 geological heterogeneity and uncertainty during the field work we encountered several small sand stringers in the till these are not included in the model since they are too small to include directly the model also does not include fractures and macropores which several studies have documented are common in danish clayey tills fredericia 1990 klint and gravesen 1999 mckay et al 1999 nilsson et al 2001 these small scale heterogeneities are instead included implicitly via the parameter values the model is an equivalent porous medium epm model where the hydraulic conductivities assigned to the different soil and geological units represent a bulk conductivity for the matrix as well as sand stringers fractures and macropores the geology in the model below 3 m was based on a stochastic geological model developed by he et al 2014 using borehole and geophysical data in our model area there are only few boreholes available and the geology is therefore mainly based on the geophysical data due to the uncertain relationship between geophysical data and geology the hydraulic parameters and flow paths in the model will be subject to considerable uncertainty particularly for small support scales 7 2 4 hydraulic conductivities the calibrated hydraulic conductivities in the model table 1 are relatively high especially for the a and b horizon compared to values used in the models by de schepper et al 2017 and he et al 2015 these high conductivities were needed in order to transmit enough water to the stream and the drain system and at the same time match the simulated hydraulic heads to observations and implicitly represent the above mentioned sand stringers macropores and fractures which are not described in the model hydraulic conductivities for a clayey till of the same magnitude as the calibrated k values in this study were reported in two studies from ringe denmark which is geologically similar to the fensholt area based on infiltration tests nilsson et al 2001 estimated hydraulic conductivities in oxidized till of 1 11 m d at depth 1 5 mbgs and 0 3 1 m d at depth 3 25 mbgs in unoxidized till they estimated a hydraulic conductivity of 0 01 m d at depths 6 13 mbgs sidle et al 1998 estimated hydraulic conductivities for the same area using a tracer test and found hydraulic conductivities of 0 7 2 5 m d at depth 2 5 mbgs and 0 3 2 2 m d at 4 mbgs 7 3 groundwater and tile drain dynamics the temporal dynamics in hydraulic head at the field site were found to be large the heads in the m piezometers were found to vary up to nearly 3 m between summer and winter the decrease in head in spring summer occurred over a period of 5 5 5 months whereas the increase in head in the fall happened much more rapidly with up to almost one meter per day by comparing the timing of the head increase in the fall between piezometers at different depths and screen t1 2 at 21 8 m we found that the increase in head happened simultaneously at all depths the increase in head happens when autumn water surplus starts i e when the net precipitation gets positive the drain discharge follows the dynamics in heads and the tile drains start receiving water when the rapid increase in heads occurs in fall based on these findings we can conclude that it is important to have high frequency monitoring of the hydraulic heads in order to capture these highly transient dynamics within tile drained fields in the study by de schepper et al 2017 they used monthly observations of hydraulic head from eight shallow piezometers and here they were not able to see the very transient dynamics that we have observed in this study because the monitoring was simply not frequent enough we also conclude that it is important to include geology deeper than just the upper few meters in a hydrological model since the transient dynamics in the shallow groundwater can propagate several meters down in the saturated porous medium in some areas it may be reasonable not to include deeper geology if an impermeable layer is found at shallow depth as the case is in e g rozemeijer et al 2010a our modelling work showed that it is important to capture the transient dynamics in head correctly in the model in order to simulate the dynamics in tile drain discharge we found that the van genuchten n parameter which controls the slope of the retention curve was an important parameter for simulating the head and thereby also the tile drain dynamics 7 4 effect of tile drains on flow patterns and implications for nitrate removal the model results showed that tile drains affect the water balance when the area is tile drained 20 of the outflow is removed by the tile drains and 28 is discharge directly to the stream if no tile drainage is included in the model the discharge to the stream is increased to 45 this change in water balance is found to affect the flow patterns within the field the tile drains are found to decrease the downward water flux on the uphill plateau both for the tile drained area flux area 1 and the undrained area flux area 2 indicating that tile drains do not only affect the flow where they are installed but also in neighbouring areas at the depth of the redox interface 3 8 mbgs the flux was decreased by 45 for tile drained area flux area 1 and 8 for the undrained area flux area 2 based on these modelling results we conclude that tile drains significantly decrease the flow across the redox interface based on the modelling results in this study tile drainage is estimated to decrease nitrate reduction in the subsurface by around 20 this analysis is simplified since it is based on the assumption of vertical flow which is of course not the case in reality this number can therefore only be taken as an indication our study however clearly illustrates that draining of areas may imply less removal of nitrate in the subsurface at the field site there is always nitrate present at the level of the drains see supplementary material b so adding more tile drains in this area would potentially lead to an increase in nitrate fluxes to the surface water bodies receiving the drain water

708,many agricultural soils are tile drained in order to lower water tables and improve crop production but tile drains have a large impact on water flows and nutrient transport the objectives of the study were to assess modelling requirements for describing shallow groundwater and tile drainage dynamics and to evaluate how tile drains affect groundwater flow across the redox interface where nitrate reduction in the subsurface occurs the study was conducted on a 33 hectare tile drained field within a weichsel till area in fensholt catchment denmark the study consisted of 2 5 years high frequency monitoring and numerical modelling using a variably saturated 3d hydrological model feflow with a detailed representation of the tile drain network field data showed extremely rapid increases up to 1 m per day in the groundwater heads when the autumn water surplus starts drain discharge was found to follow the dynamics in heads high frequency monitoring at least once per day is therefore necessary in order to capture the dynamics in shallow groundwater and tile discharge the dynamics showed simultaneous rapid increase in groundwater heads down to a depth of 22 m illustrating the key importance of deeper geology in understanding the hydrological processes in this area the temporal dynamics in head and drain discharge were successfully captured by the hydrological model and the steepness of the retention curve was found to be important for this the calibrated model was successfully tested against discharge in the stream draining a larger area the model results showed that tile drains affect the water flow in the area and significantly decrease the downward fluxes across the redox interface located on average at 3 6 m depth tile drains therefore have a large effect on the amount of nitrate reduction in the subsurface and on the nitrate fluxes to receiving surface waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydrological modeling field scale tile drainage shallow groundwater temporal dynamics high frequency data 1 introduction many agricultural fields in humid areas are artificially drained via tile drains in order to lower the water table and thereby prevent water logging and improve plant growth tile drains have a large impact on the hydrology and flow patterns in a catchment schilling et al 2012 boland brien et al 2014 king et al 2014 schilling et al 2015 sloan et al 2016 thomas et al 2016 amado et al 2017 tile drains are also found to affect the nitrogen n loadings to surface water van den eertwegh et al 2006 rozemeijer et al 2010b schilling et al 2015 amado et al 2017 which is a concern due to the large eutrophication problems in many european waters eea 2005 gustafsson et al 2012 in denmark around 50 of the agricultural area is tile drained especially the glacially derived clayey soils in the eastern part of the country olesen 2009 moller et al 2018 most climate models predict an increase in precipitation for denmark in the future seaby et al 2013 and the need for tile drainage on agricultural fields is therefore expected to increase refsgaard et al 2013 a large part of denmark is covered by young glacial sediments weichselian age and here the redox interface is normally found close to the surface the redox interface delineates the transition from oxic to anoxic conditions where nitrate n is naturally reduced to n2 fujikawa and hendry 1991 postma et al 1991 ernstsen 1996 rodvang and simpkins 2001 hansen et al 2008 the shallow depth of the redox interface together with a groundwater dominated hydrology results in a high extent of nitrate reduction in groundwater in denmark højberg et al 2015 højberg et al 2017 tile drains however act as a shortcut from the field directly to streams whereby nitrate leaching from agricultural fields bypasses the natural reduction capacity present in the subsurface and riparian wetlands blicher mathiesen et al 2014 ernstsen et al 2015 schilling et al 2015 therefore it is important to understand how tile drainage affects the split of water flowing into tile drains and percolating to the deeper subsurface and crossing the redox interface the effect of tile drains have received increasing attention the last years but the studies have focused on the effect of tile drainage on the stream hydrograph schilling et al 2012 boland brien et al 2014 king et al 2014 sloan et al 2016 thomas et al 2016 amado et al 2017 or mean groundwater travel times schilling et al 2012 schilling et al 2015 to our knowledge no studies have looked at the effect of tile drainage on the flow across the redox interface numerical models can help us improve our understanding of tile drainage dynamics and their effect on water flows tile drained areas have been modelled using a variety of numerical models ranging from one dimensional 1d root zone models such as drainmod sammons et al 2005 wang et al 2006 rzwqm walker et al 2000 ma et al 2007 and adapt nangia et al 2010 to the semi distributed models with a simple groundwater zone such as drain warmf dayyani et al 2010b mhydas drain tiemeyer et al 2007 and swat moriasi et al 2013 bosch et al 2014 and finally to the fully distributed models with three dimensional 3d representation of groundwater flow such as mike she hansen et al 2013 drainflow shokri and bardsley 2016 cathy muma et al 2014 muma et al 2016 flush turunen et al 2013 nousiainen et al 2015 salo et al 2017 and hydrogeosphere rozemeijer et al 2010a de schepper et al 2015 frey et al 2016 thomas et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 amado et al 2018 in catchment scale studies the tile drain systems are normally implemented in a simplified way partly because there is often little knowledge about the locations of the tile drains and because including the exact location of tile drains would require a highly discretized model grid and thereby long computational times some catchment scale studies include tile drains as a head dependent sink in all grid cells in the model hansen et al 2013 or as a uniform high conductivity layer at the drain depth thomas et al 2016 de schepper et al 2017 set up a hydrogeosphere model for the fensholt catchment in denmark here they implemented tile drains as nodal sinks seepage faces with specific locations but they simplified the drain network and included only the main pipes in order to reduce simulation time in field scale studies it is possible to model tile drains more detailed many field scale studies on tile drainage have been conducted using the 1d root zone models such as drainmod singh et al 2006 wang et al 2006 dayyani et al 2010a but some more recent field scale studies have used the 3d models hydrogeosphere rozemeijer et al 2010a de schepper et al 2015 amado et al 2018 and flush turunen et al 2013 nousiainen et al 2015 salo et al 2017 almost all field scale studies on tile drains consider only the upper few meters 1 5 m below ground surface mbgs in the models and thereby do not include deeper geology to our knowledge only the study by de schepper et al 2015 included deeper geology below 5 mbgs high frequency monitoring of the temporal dynamics in shallow groundwater has been reported in several studies dayyani et al 2009 van der velde et al 2010 ernstsen et al 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 however such high frequency measurements have not been included in long term 3d modelling studies of tile drain dynamics rozemeijer et al 2010a used continuous hydraulic head measurements from one well in their 3d model but the simulation period was only 2 days dayyani et al 2009 used daily data on water table depths from three wells in a long term modelling study but applied only a 1d root zone model using drainmod the research objectives of this study were i to assess the modelling requirements for obtaining a sound description of shallow groundwater and tile drainage dynamics and ii to evaluate the effects of tile drains on the groundwater flow across the redox interface besides the novelty of the research objectives the novelty of this study lies in our modeling approach since we set up a 3d field scale tile drain model with a detailed representation of the tile drain network including deeper geology down to 22 mbgs and we use a long term data set 2 5 years with high frequency monitoring of the temporal dynamics in the shallow groundwater 2 field site the field site was located in the 606 hectare ha fensholt catchment which is a headwater catchment within the 101 km2 norsminde fjord catchment located on the east coast of jutland in denmark fig 1 norsminde fjord is subject to eutrophication and sensitive to nitrogen why a significant decrease in n load to the fjord is required to meet the environmental goals of the eu water framework directive danish nature agency 2016 the land use in fensholt catchment is dominated by intensive agriculture with the main crop types being winter wheat and spring barley the climate is temperate and humid see supplementary material a and due to predominance of clayey till soils the catchment is to a large extent tile drained the study was conducted on a 33 ha tile drained field drain area fig 1d in the north eastern part of the fensholt catchment where the outflow from the tile drains has been continuously monitored tile drains are found at depth 1 m the location of the tile drains was digitized based on a drain map from det danske hedeselskab the danish heath society dated 1944 a constructed mini wetland was established in 2014 at the outlet of the drain area fig 1d with the purpose of removing nitrate from the drainage water 2 1 geology and groundwater system the surficial geology in the area consists of a 20 50 m thick quaternary cover of glacial deposits of weichselian age overlain in parts of the main stream valley by 2 3 m of post glacial freshwater peat the glacial deposits are composed of clayey till a danish clay till is defined by a clay content of 12 35 with smaller distributed sand units of glaciofluvial origin embedded within the till neogene and paleogene marine sediments are located underneath the quaternary cover the neogene layers comprise a clay dominated formation from miocene with sandy units interbedded which can reach thicknesses of more than 10 m the paleogene layers are composed of very fine grained impermeable marl and clay the groundwater system in the till is unconfined with water table close to terrain the miocene sand comprises a confined aquifer from where water extraction in the area takes place he et al 2014 de schepper et al 2017 2 2 redox interface and nitrate based on observations of sediment colour change in boreholes the redox interface at the field site is found between 2 2 5 5 mbgs and on average at 3 6 mbgs several studies have found sediment colour change to be a good indication of the redox interface in quaternary till deposits ernstsen 1996 hansen et al 2008 a geochemical investigation at the field site jakobsen et al 2018 has found the nitrate concentration in the oxidized groundwater above the redox interface to be around 60 mg l and decreasing to 0 mg l at around 4 5 mbgs together with the decrease in nitrate an increase in sulfate has been observed from 30 50 mg l above the redox interface to 60 120 mg l below the redox interface indicating that nitrate reduction by pyrite oxidation is occurring at the field site more information in supplementary material b 3 field methods 3 1 field installations the installations at the field site were made in a number of steps during the period july 2014 to february 2016 some installations were removed during the field period due to plowing harvest or were used only for geochemical investigations in the following we describe only the installations used in the hydrological modeling fig 2 a full description of all installations and collected data at the field site is found in jakobsen et al 2016 2018 3 1 1 piezometers hydraulic head measurements were obtained from 44 piezometers installed within the drain area at depths between 1 8 m to 6 7 m fig 2 the piezometers consisted of four groups find more information in supplementary material g the p piezometers p1 p24 were installed in july november 2014 p1 p19 and in february 2016 p20 p24 they were placed around the drain area and included four nests of piezometers at different depths at the foot of the hill p20 p22 and p14 p15 in the middle p7 and p16 and at the top of the hill p10 p13 the m piezometers m1 m21 labelled m transect in fig 2 were installed in february 2016 at various depths as a 2d transect along the direction of groundwater flow the piezometers c2 c6 e7 and e8 were installed in october 2014 but removed again in august 2015 due to harvest these piezometers were part of a cluster of piezometers a e piezometers see location in supplementary material b which were mainly used for water sampling the piezometers were installed by hand auger and consisted of plastic tubes with outer diameters of 22 or 32 mm the tubes had 0 3 mm slotted screens with screen lengths of mostly 0 20 0 30 m a few piezometers had a screen length of 1 0 m see supplementary material g all piezometers were installed with fine filter sand around the screen and the screened section was sealed off with quartz flour and or bentonite the last group consisted of three piezometers already existing at the field site when starting our study these piezometers were installed by the idræn project by aarhus university see more www idraen dk and located at the foot of the hill idrain low in the middle idrain mid and at the top of the hill idrain up fig 2 these piezometers were 2 m deep and screened all the way to the ground surface 3 1 2 deep well to get an idea of the deeper downwards flux from the drain area the piezometers were supplemented by a deep multiscreened well t1 located northeast of the m transect the well was installed using auger drilling with five screens one in the underlying miocene sand and four where minor intervals of sand were encountered the five screens depth to middle of screen where located at 9 0 m t1 5 12 5 m t1 4 17 2 m t1 3 21 8 m t1 2 and 43 3 m t1 1 below ground surface the well consisted of five tubes with outer diameters of 32 mm the tubes had 0 3 mm slotted screens with screen lengths of 0 5 for the lower screen t1 1 and 1 m for the four upper screens t1 2 t1 5 the screens were installed with a fine sand gravel pack around them and the screened intervals were separated hydraulically by bentonite the bentonite was separated from the screened interval by a quartz flour slurry to minimize geochemical effects of the bentonite 3 2 head measurements the hydraulic head in the piezometers and the deep well was manually measured using a water level meter pls 50 elwa teknik herning denmark in total 19 measuring campaigns were conducted during the field period from july 2014 to november 2017 however since the piezometers and the deep well were installed at different times and some were removed during the field period a varying number of manually measured hydraulic head data exist in addition to the manual measurements water level loggers solinst levellogger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada and schlumberger mini diver schlumberger water services delft the netherlands were used for continuous monitoring of the hydraulic head the water level loggers were set to record the pressure every 4th hour and the heads were afterwards corrected for variations in the atmospheric pressure by readings from a barologger solinst barologger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada located above the water table in piezometer idrain up continuous head data covering different parts of the field period were obtained from in total 23 piezometers and the two lower screens in well t1 3 3 drain and stream discharge drain and stream discharges were measured by the idræn project aarhus university www idraen dk drain discharge was measured at the drain outlet fig 1d using an electromagnetic flowmeter khrone optiflux 3070 flow meter khrone messtechnik gmbh duisburg germany which measures the electrical potential difference generated by water flowing through a magnetic field stream discharge was measured at two stations fig 1c by continuously logging the water level using water level loggers ott orpheus mini water level logger ott hydromet gmbh kempten germany and a q h relation to convert to discharge 4 modelling methods the hydrological model was set up using the finite element model feflow trefry and muffels 2007 diersch 2014 as a transient model simulating 3d unsaturated saturated flow using richards equation the model was run for the period 1 may 2012 to 31 may 2017 where the period 1 may 2012 to 31 december 2014 was used as warm up period for the model and the period 1 january 2015 to 31 may 2017 as calibration period 4 1 model area and discretization the model area covers 92 hectare fig 3 and extends vertically from the ground surface down to 22 mbgs when drilling the deep well t1 we came across a 5 m thick layer of fat oligocene clay between the two deepest screens at 22 and 43 mbgs we also found a head difference of 30 m and different dynamics between these two screens see fig 7 third row we therefore expect only limited flow to occur between these levels and consequently defined the model bottom at 22 mbgs the stream was used to delineate the model area along the western and southern boundary whereas the northern and eastern model boundaries were delineated based on topographical divides the model mesh was generated using the build in mesh generator based on the triangle algorithm shewchuk 1996 the outline of the gauged drain system was included in the mesh generation in order to have nodes placed exactly along the tile drains fig 4 the mesh was refined close to the stream and around the gauged drain system the mesh was simplified around the ungauged drain system in order to reduce simulation time the final 2d model mesh consisted of 22 501 triangular elements with an element edge length varying between 2 8 m and 26 6 m the 2d mesh was extended in the vertical direction and was divided into 27 layers with thicknesses from 0 125 to 2 m fig 5 resulting in a 3d mesh of 607 527 elements the elevation of the mesh was interpolated from a 1 6 m digital elevation model the constructed mini wetland was included in the model mesh by cutting out elements down to one m depth by making the elements inactive 4 2 climate input the precipitation data used in the study originate from two local precipitation stations precipitation station 1 was located within the fensholt catchment and precipitation station 2 a few kilometres south of the catchment fig 1 precipitation station 1 was started in august 2016 and until then data from station 2 were used data on temperature and potential evapotranspiration originate from the danish metrologic institute s dmi 20 km grid since the feflow model does not simulate evapotranspiration the climate data were run through an existing mike she model for the norsminde fjord catchment he et al 2015 to estimate the actual evapotranspiration afterwards the daily net precipitation rate was calculated as the precipitation rate minus the actual evapotranspiration rate and this was used as the climate input to the model on all top nodes the net precipitation input was positive in days where precipitation was higher than evapotranspiration and negative during periods when the evapotranspiration was larger than precipitation more information on the climate data can be found in supplementary material a 4 3 boundary conditions bc along the stream at the western and southern model boundaries a general head bc called a fluid transfer bc in feflow was defined on the nodes on top and bottom of layer 1 i e down to 0 25 m depth the reference hydraulic head at the bc was set equal to the elevation of the given node and a flow constrain was applied in order to only allow outflow from the model domain the outflow to the stream was controlled by a conductance parameter assigned to the elements neighbouring the bc nodes along the northern and eastern model boundaries following topographical divides a no flow boundary was defined on the bottom of the model 22 mbgs a small constant flux bc leakage to the underlying aquifer was defined which was subject to calibration a constant flux bc was chosen on the model bottom instead of a no flow bc since some flow to the underlying miocene aquifer is expected based on the modelling results from he et al 2015 and the fact that the net precipitation is larger 20 50 mm yr than stream discharge see supplementary material a in the constructed mini wetland a constant head bc was defined at the bottom located 1 m below surface equal to 0 5 m above the bottom elevation 4 4 tile drains the tile drains were implemented in the model at 1 mbgs i e between model layer 5 and 6 and were represented by a seepage face bc a seepage face is a hydraulic head bc equal to the elevation of the node where only outflow from the model is allowed i e the drains become active when the water table rises above the drain level and become in active when it drops below when using a seepage face bc there is full contact between the drain and the porous medium during the work at the field site it came to our attention that the actual extent of the gauged drain system was less than shown in fig 3 the drain map from 1944 of the planned drain system includes a note stating that the tile drain work was carried out in 1948 however there is no confirmation that the plans in the map were strictly followed during the summer of 2016 the local water supply company dug down a new pipe across the top of the drain area and did not find any tile drains until they got close to the stream it was therefore decided to remove part of the gauged drain system in the model seen as the green part in fig 3a 4 5 soil and geology the distribution of soils and geological units used in the model was based on danish national soils and geology maps geophysical data and stochastic modeling fig 5 the geology was described in detail for the a e piezometers as clayey till with small sand stringers few centimetres thick this corresponds well with the danish national soil map adhikari et al 2013 which shows that the whole model area is covered by a sand mixed clay soil standard weight for this type of soil 10 15 clay 0 30 silt 55 90 sand and the danish national surface geology map pedersen et al 2011 showing a uniform distribution of clayey till based on this information the upper 1 5 m of the model was described as a uniform sand mixed clay soil and from 1 5 to 3 mbgs as a uniform clayey till the sand stringers described in the a e piezometers were too small to be directly included in the model geophysical data were also available from the idræn project for a large part of the model area based on electromagnetic induction emi using a dualem sensor the resistivities of the sediments have been measured for each 0 5 m down to 3 5 mbgs these data indicate the presence of a zone with higher resistivity and thereby higher sand content and higher hydraulic conductivity this zone shown for the upper layer from 0 to 0 5 mbgs in fig 3b is visible in all the resistivity layers from 0 to 3 5 m the high k zone was manually delineated in gis and implemented in the upper three meters of the model below three meters depth a stochastically generated geological model covering the entire norsminde fjord catchment was used consisting of two units clayey till and glaciofluvial sand the geological model was constructed by he et al 2014 based on borehole data and geophysical data using the airborne transient electromagnetic system skytem and generated using the geostatistical software tprogs 4 6 model initialization parameters and calibration the model was initialized by first running the model with initial conditions equal to fully saturated conditions the following model runs during the calibration phase then used the simulated hydraulic head from the last time step from the previous simulation as initial conditions the initial and calibrated model parameters 24 in total are seen in table 1 the initial values for the saturated parameters were based on de schepper et al 2017 and he et al 2015 however the initial k value for the clayey till below 3 mbgs was based on results from slug tests conducted at the field site see supplementary material c the calibrated k value for this unit ended up being equal to the arithmetic mean k value from the slug tests the unsaturated zone parameters were based on standard values for a sand clay loam and a loamy sand from the unsoda database nemes et al 2001 the model parameters were manually calibrated using a trial and error approach against hydraulic head data from the piezometers and the deep well together with daily drain discharge from the drain station the overall water balance was also evaluated during the calibration due to long simulation time 30 h and much longer in cases of steep retention curves an automated calibration nor a formal sensitivity analysis were performed the parameters found to be sensitive during the manual calibration were mainly the hydraulic conductivities the van genuchten n for clay retention curve steepness and out transfer rate conductance at the stream bc the model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse and volumetric error ve for drain discharge and root mean square error rmse and mean error me for hydraulic head see supplementary material d 4 7 model testing because of the short observation period a traditional split sample validation was not conducted instead the model was tested by making a comparison of the simulated discharge to the stream against observed stream discharge the model area only covers a part of the stream system in fensholt catchment 92 ha out of 412 ha so the comparison of simulated and observed stream discharge was done by comparing the discharge in millimeter the observed stream discharge was taken as the discharge measured at the downstream station minus the discharge at the upstream station divided by the area between the two stations fig 1c 4 8 scenario no tile drainage after the calibration of the reference model representing the present situation at the field site a scenario was run to test the impact of tile drainage on the flow compared to undrained conditions the scenario was run by removing all tile drain nodes in the model and keeping all other parameters unchanged 5 field results 5 1 hydraulic heads and groundwater flow based on observations of hydraulic heads the horizontal groundwater flow direction at the field site is found to generally follow the terrain from northeast to southwest see supplementary material e vertical contouring of the observed hydraulic heads in the m transect from 17 february and 24 august 2016 are seen in fig 6 the groundwater flow in february is primarily horizontal in the upper part of the transect above the redox interface turning to a more vertical direction in the deeper part below the redox interface this indicates that only some of the water leaving the root zone will cross the redox interface in august the upper piezometers are dry and the flow is more vertical the temporal variation in hydraulic head is seen in fig 7 for three of the m piezometers screened at different depths together with the estimated net precipitation the head is seen to vary by up to 2 7 m in m5 and 1 9 m in m4 at m18 the shallowest of the three piezometers the water table falls below the bottom of the screen during both summers the decrease in head starts when the net precipitation begins to be negative due to high evapotranspiration in summer and occurs gradually over a period of 5 5½ months in fall when the net precipitation becomes primarily positive the head increases again the increase in head in the fall is seen to happen very rapidly with most of the increase happening within 5 6 days when the head increase is at its highest the head in e g m5 rises 93 cm within one day this rapid increase in heads indicates a steep retention curve for the sediment plotting the hydraulic head from the three piezometers on the same plot fig 7 bottom left reveals that the head increase in the fall occurs at the same time in all three depths the rapid and synchronous response is likely due to the fractures in the till the hydraulic head variation in the two lower screens of the deep well t1 is also seen in fig 7 the head in the upper four screens t1 5 t1 2 are very similar with an average hydraulic head of around 82 m see data from t1 5 t1 3 in supplementary material f and the vertical gradient between these screens is thus very low 0 02 0 04 m m the hydraulic head in the lowest screen t1 1 is on average 52 m and thereby 30 m below the head in the screens above the vertical gradient between the two lower screens t1 2 to t1 1 is thereby much larger and varies between 1 3 to 1 4 m m furthermore there is much more variation in the hydraulic head during the year for the upper four screens 1 2 m than for the lowermost screen 0 4 m the hydraulic head from t1 2 was compared to m4 5 9 m deep in order to compare the timing fig 7 bottom right it is seen that the increase in head in the fall in t1 2 happens simultaneously with the increase in m4 the remaining observations of hydraulic head can be found in supplementary material f 5 2 drain discharge the daily observed drain discharge at the outlet of the drain area fig 1d is seen in fig 8 the drain discharge is low in summer months and high in winter months with many peaks the drain discharge thereby follows the temporal patterns in net precipitation and hydraulic head fig 7 it is clear that the tile drains starts to receive water in september 2016 coinciding with the rapid increase in hydraulic head in the piezometers fig 7 6 modelling results 6 1 reference model 6 1 1 hydraulic head the simulated and observed hydraulic head for all 48 piezometers wells included in the model calibration can be found in supplementary material f the model is found to capture the observed hydraulic heads and their variation in most of the piezometers error statistics for all 48 piezometers wells resulted in an average me of 0 12 m and an average rmse of 0 61 m table 2 however the head is overestimated in piezometers p24 p7 and p16 p7 and p16 are located underneath a power pylon and we suspect that the soil and the hydraulic head in this area is disturbed by the pylon base the model is also able to capture the dynamics observed in the m transect with the slow decrease in head during summer and the fast increase in fall the hydraulic heads in the deep t well are found to be overestimated by around one meter in all of the four upper screens the deepest screen is outside the model domain the dynamics in the simulated heads at the t well are furthermore found to be delayed compared to the observations about 30 days 6 1 2 drain discharge the simulated daily drain discharge is plotted together with the observed drain discharge from the drain station in fig 8 the model is seen to capture the general dynamics in observed daily drain flow reasonably well but some peaks are overestimated and some are underestimated on monthly scale the simulated drain flow also fits the observations reasonably well in most month but in december 2015 the simulated drain flow is notably overestimated see supplementary material h the error statistics for the simulated daily drain discharge is seen in table 2 the nash sutcliffe efficiency for the whole calibration period is 0 48 but it increases to 0 73 if only considering the second half of the calibration period after 1 3 2016 the volumetric error is 19 for the whole calibration period and improves to 15 after 1 3 2016 6 1 3 stream discharge in order to test the model a comparison of the simulated discharge to the stream against observed stream discharge was made fig 9 the simulated stream discharge is defined as the sum of the discharge going directly to the stream bc and the drain discharge from both the gauged and ungauged drain system the model is seen to capture both the level and the daily dynamics in stream discharge well fig 9 at monthly scale the model is found to fit the observed stream discharge well in most months however in january 2015 and may 2015 the simulated stream discharge is too low and in december 2015 the stream discharge is too high see supplementary material h the nash sutcliffe efficiency table 2 for daily stream discharge for the whole calibration period is 0 42 but it increases to 0 78 if only considering the second half of the calibration period after 1 3 2016 the volumetric error is 11 for the whole calibration period and improves to 1 after 1 3 2016 6 1 4 water balance the total simulated water balance for the whole calibration period 1 1 2015 to 31 5 2017 is seen in fig 10 the total inflow to the model is 838 mm yr and the outflow is 830 mm yr which means the model has a water balance error of 8 1 mm yr corresponding to 1 0 of the inflow the inflow is dominated by the positive net precipitation i e days where precipitation is higher than evapotranspiration which makes up 804 mm yr corresponding to 96 of the inflow the rest of the inflow 34 mm y or 4 originates from the constructed mini wetland and storage change the outflow is mainly occurring as negative net precipitation i e days where evapotranspiration is higher than precipitation which makes up 392 mm yr corresponding to 47 of the outflow the second largest outflow is the outflow at the stream bc which is equal to 235 mm yr or 28 outflow to both the gauged and ungauged drain system makes up 167 mm yr or 20 the remaining outflow 36 mm yr or 4 occurs at the lower bc and at the constructed mini wetland the water balances for the winter period 1 10 2015 to 31 3 2016 and the summer period 1 4 2016 to 30 9 2016 are seen in fig 10 as well the total inflow and outflow in the model are rather similar during the two seasons but the contributions to the water balance are different in the winter period the inflow to the model is completely dominated by positive net precipitation 451 mm half yr or 99 7 of inflow in the summer period the positive net precipitation only makes up 69 316 mm half yr of the total inflow and 30 of the input to the model comes from storage release from the porous medium 139 mm half yr inflow from the mini wetland contributes to 0 3 1 mm half yr of the inflow in the winter period and 1 5 mm half yr in the summer period the major outflows from the model in the winter period are discharge to the tile drains corresponding to 38 171 mm half yr and discharge to the stream corresponding to 37 163 mm half yr the negative net precipitation i e evapotranspiration makes up 14 60 mm half yr of the outflow the remaining outflow 52 mm half yr or 12 occurs as storage capture outflow at the lower bc and outflow to the mini wetland in the summer period the outflow is dominated by negative net precipitation which makes up 72 329 mm half yr of the total outflow discharge to the stream corresponds to 19 89 mm half yr of the outflow in the summer period and discharge to the drains systems is equal to 5 25 mm half yr the remaining outflow in the summer period 16 mm half yr or 3 is outflow through the lower bc and to the mini wetland 6 2 scenario no tile drainage 6 2 1 water balance the water balance for the whole calibration period for the no tile drainage scenario is seen in fig 10 removing the tile drains from the model is seen to result in an increase in discharge directly to the stream compared to the reference model from 28 to 45 of the total outflow the undrained scenario also has an increase in outflow to the wetland 6 2 2 flow patterns the flow patterns in the model were investigated by looking at the vertical water fluxes between model layers in three different parts of the model fig 3 flux area 1 and flux area 2 located on the uphill plateau and flux area 3 located in a 50 m buffer around the main stream on the southern border of the model flux area 1 is tile drained and flux area 2 is undrained in the reference model the vertical water fluxes for the tile drained flux area 1 are seen in fig 11 the downward fluxes fig 11 upper row in the reference model are high in all the upper model layers down to the depth of the tile drains at 1 mbgs just below the drain level the downward flux decreases significantly in both the calibration and winter period from 1 5 mbgs and further down the downward fluxes become more or less stable this indicates that some of the infiltrating water is removed by horizontal flow in the upper part of the profile above the redox interface which was also seen in the m transect fig 6 when removing the tile drains in the undrained scenario the downward fluxes are also high in the upper model layers but decrease gradually over the entire depth the fluxes are considerably larger below the drain level in the undrained scenario compared to the reference model in the summer period the downward fluxes are considerably smaller compared to winter and the fluxes are higher in the undrained scenario than in the reference model for the reference model the downward fluxes in the summer period are seen not to be significantly affected by the tile drains at 1 mbgs since the drain system is not active during most of the summer period the upward water fluxes fig 11 lower row are highest just below the drain level in the reference model for the calibration and winter period in the undrained scenario the upward water fluxes gradually decrease with depth during the summer period the upward fluxes are highest in the upper model layer due to high evapotranspiration in this period the vertical water fluxes in the undrained flux area 2 are shown in fig 12 the downward fluxes gradually decrease with depth for the reference model in the calibration and winter period when removing the tile drains in the rest of the model in the undrained scenario the downward fluxes increase in this area thus even though this area is undrained it is still affected by the tile drains in the neighboring area the downward fluxes below the drain level are considerable larger for flux area 2 than for flux area 1 for both the reference model and the undrained scenario which may be due to the higher elevation of this area fig 3 the vertical fluxes in the zone around the main stream flux area 3 is seen in fig 13 this area of the model is dominated by very high upward fluxes in both the reference model and the undrained scenario the patterns in upwards fluxes are similar between the reference model and the undrained scenario but the fluxes are around 20 higher since discharge directly to the stream is the main output in the undrained scenario as was seen in the water balance fig 10 the upward fluxes are highest in model layer 2 and then decreases with increasing depth the same pattern is seen both for the winter period and the summer period the dominating downwards and upwards vertical flow components in flux areas 1 2 and flux area 3 respectively show that water is flowing horizontally downhill towards the river flux area 3 illustrating the 3 d nature of the flow pattern 6 2 3 flow across the redox interface the tile drains are thus found to decrease the downward water flux on the uphill plateau both for the tile drained flux area 1 and undrained flux area 2 area at the depth of the redox interface average depth 3 6 mbgs the downward flux in the drained area flux area 1 is decreased by 45 when having tile drains in the model for the undrained area flux area 2 the downward flux is decreased by 8 when tile drains are included in the neighbouring area at the field site nitrate is found to disappear as it crosses the redox interface located on average at 3 6 mbgs the geochemical data indicates that nitrate is removed due to reduction by pyrite the downward fluxes from the hydrological model can give an indication of the amount of nitrate reduction occurring in the sediment and how the tile drains affect this comparing the downward fluxes at the redox interface with the flux just below the root zone below the c horizon in 0 75 mbgs we find that 23 of the water and thereby also nitrate leaving the root zone will pass the redox interface and will be reduced in the tile drained area flux area 1 in the reference model when removing all tile drains in the model the nitrate reduction is 44 tile drainage is thereby estimated to decrease the nitrate reduction in the subsurface at the field site by 21 7 discussion and conclusions 7 1 model performance the hydrological model set up in this study fits the observed daily hydraulic heads and drain discharge reasonably well the model overestimated the drain discharge volume by 19 for the whole calibration period and 15 after 1 3 2016 the model was tested against stream discharge which the model also captured satisfactorily the stream flow volume was underestimated by 11 for the whole calibration period but when considering the period after 1 3 2016 the stream flow volume was overestimated by only 1 the reason for the lower performance in the start of the simulation period could be that data from the precipitation station within fensholt catchment station 1 fig 1 were not available until august 2016 until then precipitation data from station 2 located further away were used and this station could be less representative for the conditions at the field site there can be a number of possible reasons why the model overestimates the drain discharge the hydraulic heads are in general well estimated but for some piezometers and for some periods during the calibration period the head is overestimated which can result in too much drain discharge in the model another reason can be that the extent of the tile drain system defined in the reference model is still too large compared to reality we did try to map the location of the drain system using gpr ground penetrating radar but the results were not good enough to be used to locate the tile drains a third reason for the overestimation can be that the tile drains are not fully effective anymore as assumed in the model and finally observations along the stream indicated additional drain outlets whereby some drain flow is bypassing the drain gauge even though the drain flow is overestimated we find that the total discharge to the stream is underestimated when considering the whole calibration period this could indicate that the discharge to the stream from the non simulated part of the area between the two stream gauging stations is higher than in the model area a reason for this could be that there is a connection between the stream and the underlying miocene sand aquifer in this part of the catchment and thereby an inflow from this deeper aquifer de schepper et al 2017 set up a model for the entire fensholt catchment and simulated drain discharge from both the gauged drain system included in our study and another drain system situated outside our model area however they simplified the drain network greatly and included only the main pipes de schepper et al 2017 reached a satisfactory performance for simulated drain discharge from the gauged drain system ve 5 but their model had a poor performance for the other drain area ve 80 and stream discharge ve 34 7 2 model requirements limitations and uncertainties 7 2 1 hydrological processes the feflow code trefry and muffels 2007 diersch 2014 simulates the flow processes in the unsaturated and saturated zones by solving richards equation for both domains in an integrated manner rather than coupling two independent partial differential equations like in e g mike she abbott et al 1986b 1986a contrary to other integrated model codes like hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 feflow does not include description of evapotranspiration and overland flow processes it is well known that comprehensive computational requirements puts a constraint to which setups and applications of integrated models are possible in practice as an example the hydrogeosphere model for the fensholt catchment established by de schepper et al 2017 required 10 days simulation time for a single model run although the drainage network was grossly simplified in our model setup we have utilised the window of practical simulation time max a couple of days for one run to focus on obtaining a very detailed subsurface process description with fine temporal and spatial resolutions while we did not explicitly include evapotranspiration and overland flow process descriptions instead we forced the model with net precipitation calculated by another hydrological model known to simulate evapotranspiration processes in this area well and we ignored overland flow which is of minor importance in our study area our results with the good reproductions of the dynamics of local scale groundwater heads and drain discharge justify these priorities comparing our results to the poorer performance of the hydrogeosphere and mike she models for the same area reported by de schepper et al 2017 we suggest that a detailed spatial resolution around the individual tile drains is crucial for obtaining a physically sound description of the drain flow dynamics including the split between water flowing horizontally into the drains and water flowing vertically to and from deeper groundwater 7 2 2 tile drains the tile drains were included in the model as seepage face bc s i e nodal sinks that removes the water from the model when the water table rises above the drain level and becomes in active when it drops below a theoretically more correct description of the tile drains would be to describe them as 1d line elements where the model simulates the water flowing in the pipes and also allows the water to run out of the pipes however describing tile drains as 1d line elements requires very long simulations times de schepper et al 2015 2017 and is therefore not feasible when 3d catchment models are used to simulate several years only a few studies have described tile drains as 1d line elements in 3d models macquarrie and sudicky 1996 rozemeijer et al 2010a yue 2010 de schepper et al 2015 but the areas including discrete tile drains in these studies were small few hectares and the simulation periods were short hours to a few days by using a seepage face bc for the tile drains we as mentioned assume full contact between the drains and the porous medium thereby the efficiency of the tile drains is not included in the model since the drain network at the field site was installed in 1948 the drains may not be fully effective anymore nousiainen et al 2015 stated that the efficiency of older networks is often lower and also showed that it is important to consider the efficiency of tile drains however we have no information of the maintenance of the drains the effectiveness of the tile drains could have been implemented in the model using a fluid transfer bc which was used for the stream where a conductance term controls the exchange however using a fluid transfer bc for tile drains would require a much finer discretization of the model mesh where tile drain lines meet since this would increase the simulation time this boundary type was not chosen in this study 7 2 3 geological heterogeneity and uncertainty during the field work we encountered several small sand stringers in the till these are not included in the model since they are too small to include directly the model also does not include fractures and macropores which several studies have documented are common in danish clayey tills fredericia 1990 klint and gravesen 1999 mckay et al 1999 nilsson et al 2001 these small scale heterogeneities are instead included implicitly via the parameter values the model is an equivalent porous medium epm model where the hydraulic conductivities assigned to the different soil and geological units represent a bulk conductivity for the matrix as well as sand stringers fractures and macropores the geology in the model below 3 m was based on a stochastic geological model developed by he et al 2014 using borehole and geophysical data in our model area there are only few boreholes available and the geology is therefore mainly based on the geophysical data due to the uncertain relationship between geophysical data and geology the hydraulic parameters and flow paths in the model will be subject to considerable uncertainty particularly for small support scales 7 2 4 hydraulic conductivities the calibrated hydraulic conductivities in the model table 1 are relatively high especially for the a and b horizon compared to values used in the models by de schepper et al 2017 and he et al 2015 these high conductivities were needed in order to transmit enough water to the stream and the drain system and at the same time match the simulated hydraulic heads to observations and implicitly represent the above mentioned sand stringers macropores and fractures which are not described in the model hydraulic conductivities for a clayey till of the same magnitude as the calibrated k values in this study were reported in two studies from ringe denmark which is geologically similar to the fensholt area based on infiltration tests nilsson et al 2001 estimated hydraulic conductivities in oxidized till of 1 11 m d at depth 1 5 mbgs and 0 3 1 m d at depth 3 25 mbgs in unoxidized till they estimated a hydraulic conductivity of 0 01 m d at depths 6 13 mbgs sidle et al 1998 estimated hydraulic conductivities for the same area using a tracer test and found hydraulic conductivities of 0 7 2 5 m d at depth 2 5 mbgs and 0 3 2 2 m d at 4 mbgs 7 3 groundwater and tile drain dynamics the temporal dynamics in hydraulic head at the field site were found to be large the heads in the m piezometers were found to vary up to nearly 3 m between summer and winter the decrease in head in spring summer occurred over a period of 5 5 5 months whereas the increase in head in the fall happened much more rapidly with up to almost one meter per day by comparing the timing of the head increase in the fall between piezometers at different depths and screen t1 2 at 21 8 m we found that the increase in head happened simultaneously at all depths the increase in head happens when autumn water surplus starts i e when the net precipitation gets positive the drain discharge follows the dynamics in heads and the tile drains start receiving water when the rapid increase in heads occurs in fall based on these findings we can conclude that it is important to have high frequency monitoring of the hydraulic heads in order to capture these highly transient dynamics within tile drained fields in the study by de schepper et al 2017 they used monthly observations of hydraulic head from eight shallow piezometers and here they were not able to see the very transient dynamics that we have observed in this study because the monitoring was simply not frequent enough we also conclude that it is important to include geology deeper than just the upper few meters in a hydrological model since the transient dynamics in the shallow groundwater can propagate several meters down in the saturated porous medium in some areas it may be reasonable not to include deeper geology if an impermeable layer is found at shallow depth as the case is in e g rozemeijer et al 2010a our modelling work showed that it is important to capture the transient dynamics in head correctly in the model in order to simulate the dynamics in tile drain discharge we found that the van genuchten n parameter which controls the slope of the retention curve was an important parameter for simulating the head and thereby also the tile drain dynamics 7 4 effect of tile drains on flow patterns and implications for nitrate removal the model results showed that tile drains affect the water balance when the area is tile drained 20 of the outflow is removed by the tile drains and 28 is discharge directly to the stream if no tile drainage is included in the model the discharge to the stream is increased to 45 this change in water balance is found to affect the flow patterns within the field the tile drains are found to decrease the downward water flux on the uphill plateau both for the tile drained area flux area 1 and the undrained area flux area 2 indicating that tile drains do not only affect the flow where they are installed but also in neighbouring areas at the depth of the redox interface 3 8 mbgs the flux was decreased by 45 for tile drained area flux area 1 and 8 for the undrained area flux area 2 based on these modelling results we conclude that tile drains significantly decrease the flow across the redox interface based on the modelling results in this study tile drainage is estimated to decrease nitrate reduction in the subsurface by around 20 this analysis is simplified since it is based on the assumption of vertical flow which is of course not the case in reality this number can therefore only be taken as an indication our study however clearly illustrates that draining of areas may imply less removal of nitrate in the subsurface at the field site there is always nitrate present at the level of the drains see supplementary material b so adding more tile drains in this area would potentially lead to an increase in nitrate fluxes to the surface water bodies receiving the drain water

709,the eulerian advection dispersion reaction equation adre suffers the well known scale effect of reduced apparent reaction rates between chemically dissimilar fluids at larger scales or dimensional averaging the dispersion tensor in the adre must equally and simultaneously account for both solute mixing and spreading recent reactive particle tracking rpt algorithms can by separate mechanisms simulate 1 smaller scale mixing by inter particle mass transfer and 2 mass spreading by traditional random walks to test the supposition that the rpt can accurately track these separate mechanisms we upscale reactive transport in hagen poiseuille flow between two plates the simple upscaled 1 d rpt model with one velocity value an upscaled taylor macro dispersivity and the local molecular diffusion coefficient matches the results obtained from a detailed 2 d model with fully described velocity and diffusion both models use the same thermodynamic reaction rate because the rate is not forced to absorb the loss of information upon upscaling analytic and semi analytic upscaling is also performed using volume averaging and ensemble streamtube techniques volume averaging does not perform as well as the rpt while the streamtube approach using an effective dispersion coefficient along with macro dispersion performs almost exactly the same as rpt keywords particle methods diffusion reaction equation advection diffusion reaction equation numerical methods 1 introduction a recent improvement of the reactive particle tracking rpt method allows mass transfer between particles and subsequent reactions between any number of chemical constituents on the particles benson and bolster 2016 one of the features of this algorithm is that inter particle mixing occurs separately from dispersive random walks true mixing between dissimilar fluids usually occurs on smaller scales and at slower rates than the dispersive spreading cirpka and kitanidis 2000b danckwerts 1953 de simoni et al 2005 dentz et al 2011 dentz and carrera 2007 ding et al 2017 donado et al 2009 hill 1976 le borgne et al 2013 le borgne et al 2014 lehwald et al 2012 molz and widdowson 1988 nauman and buffham 1983 rezaei et al 2005 schmidt et al 2018a suggested that the separate simulation of mixing and spreading by the rpt method could provide a way to accurately upscale reactive solute transport because the smaller scale true mixing dictates reaction rates while the random walks simulate the process of particle separation that accompanies sub grid upscaled velocity perturbations recent work has further extended the particle methods to allow fluid solid interaction schmidt et al 2018b for additional reasons such as surface area scaling and solubility saturations near mineral grains dissolution precipitation reactions also suffer significant scaling effects of reaction rates see brantley et al 2008 white and peterson 1990 two of the classic examinations of the disparity between mixing and spreading in moving fluids and the effect on global reaction rates were performed by kapoor et al 1997 1998 these authors chose a simple system because it can be completely defined at the pore scale laminar miscible displacement of chemically distinct and reactive fluids in hagen poiseuille flow either in a tube or between plates in these cases transport is exactly known with the well known parabolic velocity profile between no slip walls and random motion solely by molecular diffusion the higher velocities at the center of the tube cause overlap of the fluids when projected to 1 d but mixing only occurs along the warped interface this system exemplifies the lag of mixing behind spreading in non uniform velocity fields the spreading rate was first derived for poiseuille flow by taylor 1953 who showed that the 2 d transport of nonreactive tracer in a tube could be upscaled averaged to 1 d given enough time to sample the entire velocity variability by local diffusion transport can be effectively described by a one dimensional advection dispersion equation with constant velocity and an enhanced macro dispersion coefficient reflecting subscale advection induced spreading the asymptotic t upscaled longitudinal hydrodynamic macro dispersion coefficient dmac may be orders of magnitude larger than the local scale molecular diffusion coefficient dmol and its functional form depends on the shear velocity distribution and molecular diffusion coefficient e g bolster et al 2011 this has inspired two tacks for upscaled reactive transport the first tack has derived two dispersion coefficients one for the effective mixing deff and another corresponding to taylor s dmac that describes macro dispersive spreading in this approach mixing is assumed to be the dominant mechanism dictating reaction rates i e reactions are nearly instantaneous so that the statistics of mixing via destruction of concentration gradients give an effective smaller dispersion coefficient cirpka and kitanidis 2000a 2000b dentz and carrera 2007 dentz et al 2000 this smaller deff is designed to slow down reactions but not place solutes in the correct locations so cirpka and kitanidis 2000a suggests a streamtube approach in which the spreading of the centers of mass for the streamtubes is given by dmac while mixing within a streamtube is given by the smaller deff the second tack seeks to adjust the reaction rate itself by recognizing that the reactant segregation that results from upscaling should modify the effective reaction rate this approach has been used on simpler diffusion only problems that allow direct calculation of segregation as measured by reactant concentration covariance evolution equations bolster et al 2012 paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 tartakovsky et al 2012 however in heterogeneous velocity distributions these equations have yet to be analytically solved and only simpler expressions based on very fast or very slow reactions end members have been developed porta et al 2012 these upscaling approaches point out the fundamental problem associated with an eulerian advection dispersion and reaction equation adre the dispersion coefficient valid for conservative transport at some scale will over predict fluid mixing and reaction at the same scale but under predict spreading at some larger scale or volume averaged to fewer spatial dimensions we seek to correct this problem with a lagrangian framework for m species undergoing fickian dispersion in incompressible flow the coupled adres are 1 c i t v c i d c i r c a c b c m k 1 k n i a b m where ci is the concentration of each of the species labeled i a b m v is a velocity vector d is a dispersion tensor and r is a reaction function among the m constituents with n reaction channels the adre assumes that d describes mixing and spreading in exactly the same way for continuously varying v this is only true at the molecular scale in practice however all variables and parameters in 1 have some finite support scale and the discrepancy between mixing and spreading grows with support scale dentz et al 2011 le borgne et al 2013 le borgne et al 2014 indeed if v is given by darcy s law and a hydraulic conductivity parameter then this type of upscaling has already occurred as briefly reviewed above this discrepancy may be accounted for by adjusting the only remaining equation parameters that are held in the reaction term r or by solving the equation separately with larger and smaller d to figure out mixing versus proper positions of reactants if the perturbations of ci v and d are known as well as their auto and cross correlations in time and space then the adjusted r can be approximated with closure assumptions dentz et al 2011 porta et al 2013 2012 tartakovsky et al 2012 that may not be particularly accurate for some values of coefficients we include a brief comparison of the two most notable analytic upscaling approximations to our numerical method in this paper on the other hand the micro scale physics of particle motion and interaction may already carry all information neglected by the analytic upscaling here we show that for the simplest case the rpt method does indeed automatically track the necessary small scale information and performs a natural upscaling 2 hagen poiseuille flow we simulate an identical problem of flow transport and kinetic bimolecular reaction a b c between two parallel plates as did kapoor et al 1997 fig 1 the concentration units are arbitrary but we will use moles l molar the local thermodynamic reaction rate is given by the law of mass action r k c a c b for constituents a and b where k molar 1 t 1 is a rate coefficient without loss of generality we assume unit activity coefficients this type of reaction has been studied experimentally and theoretically because of its simplicity and dependence on local mixing e g ding et al 2012 edery et al 2009 edery et al 2010 gramling et al 2002 raje and kapoor 2000 sánchez vila et al 2010 zhang and papelis 2011 the plates are separated by aperture b 1 mm and the molecular diffusion coefficient is 10 3 mm2 s an initial slug of reactant a is placed across the entire aperture from x 95 to x 105 mm zero elsewhere while reactant b is placed with unlimited extent only on either side of the slug the velocity field follows v v x y 0 where v x y 6 v y b y b 2 the mean velocity is specified as v 1 0132 mm s giving a characteristic advection time of t a b v 0 99 s kapoor et al define an effective diffusion time t d b π 2 d m o l different from more recent definitions of t d b 2 d m o l e g porta et al 2012 so their peclet and damkohler numbers 100 and 10 respectively are off by a factor of π 2 10 our peclet number is defined by t d t a v b d m o l 1013 kapoor et al chose a reaction rate coefficient k 0 0987 mol s 1 to yield a damkohler number of d a k c a t 0 b 2 d m o l 98 7 where the initial nonzero reactant concentrations are c a c b 1 molar first we construct a 2 d simulation of the system using the particle number preserving method bolster et al 2016 this is an extension of the original rpt algorithm that killed entire particles on reaction see benson and meerschaert 2008 the newer algorithm makes each particle carry only one species and the mass and concentration given a particle support volume on that particle is continuously adjusted to account for reactions we chose this method because the reactions are independent of the particle random walks and we need to accurately track the variance of particle positions to validate upscaling to 1 d increasing particle numbers until convergence showed that 20 000 a particles and 240 000 total b particles in two 60 mm zones on either side of the initial a slug were sufficient a gray scale plot of the binned concentrations of a remaining at t d 0 1 t 100 s shows the segregation of reactants that results from the parabolic velocity profile fig 2 a kapoor et al used centered finite differences in their solution with a maximum grid peclet number of v max δ x d m o l 37 5 so that their solution was vastly artificially over mixed and over reacted their peak concentrations of remaining reactant a are about 70 times less than ours but the general shapes agree quite well if one wished to use a first order accurate similar to kapoor et al 1997 finite difference method with a grid peclet number on the order of unity then δ x 1 7 10 4 using 100 nodes in the y direction the 200 mm 1 mm domain would require on the order of 120 million nodes a more accurate advection scheme would require fewer nodes but would still be computationally demanding so we use the particle method for the benchmark 2 d simulations see benson et al 2017 for a comparison of methods the rpt algorithm of bolster et al 2016 was used because individual particles are composed solely of a b or c this allows us to track all a particles in the initial slug to verify the analytically upscaled value of dmac t derived in the appendix the centered second moment i e the plume variance grows as expected fig 3 quadratically near t 0 because of ballistic particle motion according to the velocity profile transitioning to linear growth according to fick s law we took first differences in discretized time to calculate dmac t δvar xa 2δt we fit d m a c t 4 88 m m 2 s 1 exp t 25 s for the upscaled 1 d model from the 2 d data note that the analytic dmac t is almost exactly equal to our measured dmac t see appendix the locally well mixed 2 d model used a particle density of 2 000 mm2 or a 2 d volume per particle of 5 10 4 mm2 an equivalent volume or average spacing in 1 d is defined by δ s 5 10 4 1 2 0 0224 mm therefore for the 10 mm initial condition for reactant a an equivalently well mixed 1 d model would use n 10 mm 0 0224 mm 447 the total particle number including the surrounding initial b reactant is 5811 upon upscaling however the concentrations are not locally well mixed the projection to 1 d places disparate concentrations in the same x location the particles may represent these different concentrations and do so by representing some support volume this volume has been shown paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 to represent the concentration auto correlation and as time grows the cross correlation distance previous studies e g kapoor et al 1997 have shown that in poiseuille flow the reactants segregate in regions that occupy about one half the width of the aperture this is verified in fig 2a therefore each particle occupies a 1 d volume upon upscaling of 0 5 mm this gives an initial particle number of 20 for the a initial condition or 260 total particles this visual estimate is formally shown to be representative in the appendix these particle numbers 5811 and 260 for well mixed and segregated were placed in a 1 d model using a newer particle tracking algorithm benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018a for the lower number we also used an ensemble of 100 simulations due to noisy runs this newer algorithm benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018a transfers masses or moles of any and all species denoted by a superscipt i e species a as ma during a time step of duration δt between all particle pairs i and j denoted by subscripts according to 2 m j a t δ t m j a t i 1 2 m i a t m j a t p i j using each particle pair s collocation probability 3 p i j δ s 8 π η d m o l δ t exp r 2 8 η d m o l δ t where δs is the particle support volume r is the distance between the i and j particles and 0 η 1 is the fraction of the isotropic diffusion simulated by interparticle mass transfer because the mass transfer process is diffusive schmidt et al 2018a any leftover diffusion is added to macro dispersion i e by 1 η d m o l d m a c which is simulated by random walks benson and bolster 2016 we chose η 1 2 although it makes no observable difference as long as the value is not extremely close to 0 or 1 note that δs is essentially calculated automatically as for any j the probabilities must satisfy i p i j 1 therefore a matrix of probabilities is adjusted to have a column sum of unity see schmidt et al 2018a also the masses in the sum can be from the beginning or end of a time step or updated sequentially schmidt et al 2018a we chose the sequential updating here for stability after mass transfer of a and b among all particles the bimolecular reaction proceeds according to a first order implementation of the law of mass action benson and bolster 2016 namely 4 δ m j a δ m j b δ m j c k δ t δ s m j a δ s m j b δ s after mass transfer and reaction the particles experience advection and any additional local and macro dispersion by well known random walk methods labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 specifically in the 2 d model particles are advected by vx y δt and isotropically diffused by 1 η d m o l while the 1 d models advect by v δ t and disperse using taylor s 1 η d m o l d m a c t unless otherwise specified for hypothesis testing 3 results and discussion the rates of c production and late time a decline agree quite well in both log log and linear coordinates when the lower number of initial a particles n 260 is used to represent concentration fluctuation distances on the order of one half pore width fig 4 we expect that an even better fit could be achieved by adjusting the particle number but we have not changed our original visual estimate of particle support volume equal to one half pore width see also the appendix this level of agreement was not expected due to the loss of detailed velocity information upon upscaling by virtue of a constant velocity and gaussian random walks the 1 d model has a gaussian shape at any time the fact that the shape of the plume appears to be of secondary importance would indicate that the magnitude of concentration fluctuations along with the rate at which these fluctuations mix at the local scale is a primary driver of reaction rate see also tartakovsky and barajas solano 2018 we can inspect the degree to which different concentrations coexist in close proximity by examining a plot of each particle s concentration of a versus position along the x axis in both the 2 d and 1 d rpt models fig 5 these concentrations are given by diving the species masses by particle support volume δs for clarity we plot every 25 th particle from the 260 000 initial a particle model in 2 d along with single realizations from the 5811 particle and 260 particle models in 1 d all at a time of 100 s td 10 unlike an eulerian model the 1 d upscaled models have particles at or near the same position with very different concentrations this happens because the properly upscaled dispersive random walks take particles with different masses and move them relatively large distances using dmac t into areas of very different concentrations the local transfer of mass between particles takes place more slowly than this according to dmol so there is not enough time to equilibrate with surroundings before a new excursion this is especially true in the 260 particle model and shows that a key to this upscaling is a correct calculation of the large scale excursion lengths versus the local scale mixing rate also evident in fig 5 is that the 1 d model has lost information about the particular velocity distribution and performs gaussian random walks a more important point is the difference between the lagrangian model with mixing given by d 10 3 mm2 s and spreading by dmac t and an eulerian model that uses the same value either dmol or dmac t for both mixing and spreading we ran the 1 d models using these potential end member choices for mixing and dispersion and found that those upscaled models under predict and over predict reaction magnitudes significantly fig 6 this is further emphasized by a plot of the global reaction rates fig 7 to check the accuracy of these particle models we also coded a 1 d eulerian model using upwind finite differences fd and dmac t with a constant velocity and courant number of unity the fd model does not suffer numerical dispersion and it verifies the rpt model using upscaled single valued d d m a c t this model using dmac t for both mixing and spreading is a better model than using dmol for both which indicates that it is more important for the reactants to be placed in the proper positions before mixing begins even if the local mixing is overdone that is why for t 0 the reactant initial condition specifies the correct positions and using dmol is the better model after a time of approximately td 10 the solute if placed in the proper positions becomes better mixed and using dmac is more appropriate see cirpka and kitanidis 2000a dentz and carrera 2007 porta et al 2012 if one is forced to use a deterministic eulerian model however in the next section we will see that an effective intermediate value dmol deff dmac is better still 3 1 analytic semi analytic upscaling as discussed in the introduction two forms of upscaling have been derived and or suggested for the mixing versus spreading problem one extends the approach of porta et al 2012 who volume average the reactive transport equations those authors solve for the asymptotic t coefficients in upscaled equations that keep first order terms only we extend their approach for coefficients that are functions of time appendix the result is two coupled transport equations one for a reactive species and another for the conservative species a b a galilean invariant i e v 0 set of these equations was solved on a finite difference grid using centered differences for first derivatives a classical 3 point stencil for second derivatives and operator splitting for reaction so that the solution is o δ x 2 δ t discretization was decreased until convergence was observed with a final δ x 0 1 mm δ t 0 001 s plots of the global reaction rate and the masses of a and c over time fig 8 show that the perturbation upscaling overpredicts the mixing and reaction rates although the inclusion of an adjusted reaction rate in 24 improves the results relative to a simple 1 d finite difference solution of 1 using upscaled dmac t compare fig 8 to figs 6 and 7 the full perturbation upscaled solution shown in fig 8 still overpredicts reaction rates relative to the rpt solution either because of the neglect of higher order moments or other terms to achieve closure specifically the regime in question is defined by a moderately fast reaction rate d a 10 as defined by kapoor et al or da 100 by porta s definition which is assumed to be infinite in order for 18 to reduce to 19 a second method called the streamtube approach by cirpka et al derives two upscaled dispersion coefficients for a conservative tracer one for effective mixing within a theoretically isolated streamtube deff and another for the spreading that includes the separation of the centers of mass from different velocities among the streamtubes dmac cirpka and kitanidis 2000a 2000b dentz and carrera 2007 dentz et al 2000 actual streamtubes allow mass transfer between each other this process promotes mixing therefore the derivation of the effective diffusion within an isolated 1 d streamtube must include the effects of cross streamtube mixing that is lost see the appendix a practical application of this method requires solving the reactive system of transport equations 1 using deff and mapping those solutions to the positions of the streamtubes at time t the centers of mass have advected to a mean position of v t and accumulated some extra spreading we may adopt the upscaled and gaussian approximation of the extra spreading by using the accumulated difference d δ t 0 t d m a c τ d eff τ d τ calculation of dmac t is already provided in the appendix and using the methodology in dentz and carrera 2007 we further calculate d m a c d eff as a function of time the 1 d solution of the reactive system using deff t has an excellent representation of the reaction rate and evolution of reactant and product moles fig 8 a superposition of these 1 d solutions with random mean positions given by v t 2 t d δ t z where z is a standard normal yields plots very close to the ensemble rpt model using 260 particles fig 9 at the time shown in fig 9 t 100 s t d 10 the total moles of a remaining in the ensemble streamtube and ensemble rpt models are 0 0466 and 0 0462 while the centered second moments are 528 and 519 mm2 respectively we speculate that for this moderately fast reaction d a 100 the particle method is a stochastic implementation of the streamtube method each particle moves by mean advection and macrodispersion but transfers mass according to 1 the local diffusive green s function schmidt et al 2018a and 2 the covariance of concentrations given by the particle support volume an open question is the regions of the da pe and chemical sequestration parameter space under which the correspondence holds 4 conclusions in this technical note we show that the rpt method can accurately simulate dimensionally upscaled transport and reaction for pre asymptotic times in poiseuille flow we used the time dependent upscaled effective taylor macro dispersion coefficient dmac for random walks and the isotropic molecular diffusion for locally diffusive mass transfer between particles an accurate model using finite differences would require full specification of the velocity in 2 d and take tens of millions of nodes using higher order methods and hundreds of millions for first order methods benson et al 2017 the properly upscaled rpt model used 20 initial a 260 total particles and an ensemble of 100 simulations ran in minutes on a laptop pc the volume averaging upscaling method did not perform as well as the streamtube method with effective diffusion for the pe and da values selected by kapoor et al 1997 the streamtube and rpt methods were essentially identical for this reactive scenario this suggests that the rpt method is performing an equivalent upscaling procedure automatically because the particles experience the velocity perturbations as well as the local green s function of mixing both of those quantities are the key elements of the streamtube approach an interesting hypothesis is that the rpt method will succeed in upscaling regardless of the da pe regime because it does not discard any terms if true the particle method would be not only convenient but theoretically preferred because at any scale above the molecular scale in moving fluids mixing spreading and chemical kinetics are completely different phenomena that should be simulated as such furthermore the rpt method can accommodate any velocity field with variability in time and space and any reactions whether fluid fluid as done here or fluid solid schmidt et al 2018b because the success of the rpt method depends on an accurate estimate of the particle numbers densities which in turn encodes the concentration perturbation autocovariance this study highlights the importance of measuring or estimating these statistics acknowledgements we thank the editor graham sander reviewers olaf

volume averaged closure we take a perturbative approach for upscaling by volume averaging in the y direction in particular we follow porta et al 2012 and bolster et al 2011 with an extension to

explains any possible discrepancies between our findings and theirs in porta s work they do not consider an explicit time dependent reaction coefficient as above later work also by porta et al 2016 suggests that more complex closures can be used when coefficients are time dependent resulting in a nonlocal integro differential equation however that system is significantly more computationally intensive than this closure additionally the closure approximation was originally postulated strictly for cases where da pe although it was verified also for cases where da 1 and pe and da had similar values as here a3 streamtube mixing model let us define global first second and second centered moments 27 m 1 t 1 b 0 b x c t x y d x d y m 2 t 1 b 0 b x 2 c t x y d x d y k 2 m 2 t m 1 2 t the

measure of mixing than dmac which captures both mixing and spreading cirpka and kitanidis 2000b dentz and carrera 2007 consider the difference between the first local and global moment p y t m 1 y t m

concentrations mixing in the poiseuille system is dominated by transverse concentration gradients so we may examine the transverse autocovariance and reactant segregation that develops almost immediately after the initial condition is distorted by the velocity field to our knowledge expressions for the concentration statistics have not been developed for the reactive system indeed even the conservative system will experience dilution and reduced total variance as time gets large so we look at the concentrations that develop early at a dimensionless time of 5 t a t d 20 5 s this ensures plenty of advective distortion but minimal dilution a 260 000 particle simulation was run with all parameters identical to the reactive simulation except that the reaction rate coefficient was set to zero at a time of 5 s the a concentrations were binned fig 10 c and the covariance functions at each of 40 y transects were calculated numerically fig 10b we are especially interested in the area corresponding to the positive covariance portion at small spatial separations in the center of these plots a visual estimate of the extent of the a concentrations is on the order of one half pore width fig 2 which is the number we used in our uncalibrated simulations of course the a concentration covariance will be different along the length of the a plume so we examine the variability here the autocovariance function fig 10a for uniformly randomly placed dirac delta function particles placed in a finite domain was derived by schmidt et al 2017 36 c o v c a y c a l n a m p 2 ω δ y l 1 ω c a m p δ y l 1 ω where c a c a t 0 is the initial undiluted a concentration na is the initial number of a particles mp is the mass of each particle ω is the extent of the domain here 1 mm in the transverse direction and δ is a dirac delta function several studies have shown that equating the integral of this covariance to the integral of the real covariance function makes the particle model most closely match concentration evolution in real and numerical systems with concentration segregation bolster et al 2016 ding et al 2012 ding et al 2017 paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 the fact that the delta particles have an atom of covariance at the origin fig 10a is not a problem as they assume a gaussian kernel shape when the mass transfer algorithm is applied integrating the covariance function means that the near origin integrated area for the delta particles is camp because the particle mass is m p c a ω n a the area can be written c a 2 ω n a with units c 2 l equating this to the numerically estimated near origin area with units c 2 l gives a particle density n a ω c a 2 a r e a 1 m o l 2 a r e a this number is particles per mm in the y direction the initial condition here is 10 mm in the x direction so the total number of initial a particles is 10 the density a plot of the near origin areas and the resultant total number of a particles fig 10d shows that the number ranges from 11 to 40 in the high mixing regions with an average of 21 supporting our visual estimate of 20 for the initial condition it may well be that a lower number would give an even better i e slightly

709,the eulerian advection dispersion reaction equation adre suffers the well known scale effect of reduced apparent reaction rates between chemically dissimilar fluids at larger scales or dimensional averaging the dispersion tensor in the adre must equally and simultaneously account for both solute mixing and spreading recent reactive particle tracking rpt algorithms can by separate mechanisms simulate 1 smaller scale mixing by inter particle mass transfer and 2 mass spreading by traditional random walks to test the supposition that the rpt can accurately track these separate mechanisms we upscale reactive transport in hagen poiseuille flow between two plates the simple upscaled 1 d rpt model with one velocity value an upscaled taylor macro dispersivity and the local molecular diffusion coefficient matches the results obtained from a detailed 2 d model with fully described velocity and diffusion both models use the same thermodynamic reaction rate because the rate is not forced to absorb the loss of information upon upscaling analytic and semi analytic upscaling is also performed using volume averaging and ensemble streamtube techniques volume averaging does not perform as well as the rpt while the streamtube approach using an effective dispersion coefficient along with macro dispersion performs almost exactly the same as rpt keywords particle methods diffusion reaction equation advection diffusion reaction equation numerical methods 1 introduction a recent improvement of the reactive particle tracking rpt method allows mass transfer between particles and subsequent reactions between any number of chemical constituents on the particles benson and bolster 2016 one of the features of this algorithm is that inter particle mixing occurs separately from dispersive random walks true mixing between dissimilar fluids usually occurs on smaller scales and at slower rates than the dispersive spreading cirpka and kitanidis 2000b danckwerts 1953 de simoni et al 2005 dentz et al 2011 dentz and carrera 2007 ding et al 2017 donado et al 2009 hill 1976 le borgne et al 2013 le borgne et al 2014 lehwald et al 2012 molz and widdowson 1988 nauman and buffham 1983 rezaei et al 2005 schmidt et al 2018a suggested that the separate simulation of mixing and spreading by the rpt method could provide a way to accurately upscale reactive solute transport because the smaller scale true mixing dictates reaction rates while the random walks simulate the process of particle separation that accompanies sub grid upscaled velocity perturbations recent work has further extended the particle methods to allow fluid solid interaction schmidt et al 2018b for additional reasons such as surface area scaling and solubility saturations near mineral grains dissolution precipitation reactions also suffer significant scaling effects of reaction rates see brantley et al 2008 white and peterson 1990 two of the classic examinations of the disparity between mixing and spreading in moving fluids and the effect on global reaction rates were performed by kapoor et al 1997 1998 these authors chose a simple system because it can be completely defined at the pore scale laminar miscible displacement of chemically distinct and reactive fluids in hagen poiseuille flow either in a tube or between plates in these cases transport is exactly known with the well known parabolic velocity profile between no slip walls and random motion solely by molecular diffusion the higher velocities at the center of the tube cause overlap of the fluids when projected to 1 d but mixing only occurs along the warped interface this system exemplifies the lag of mixing behind spreading in non uniform velocity fields the spreading rate was first derived for poiseuille flow by taylor 1953 who showed that the 2 d transport of nonreactive tracer in a tube could be upscaled averaged to 1 d given enough time to sample the entire velocity variability by local diffusion transport can be effectively described by a one dimensional advection dispersion equation with constant velocity and an enhanced macro dispersion coefficient reflecting subscale advection induced spreading the asymptotic t upscaled longitudinal hydrodynamic macro dispersion coefficient dmac may be orders of magnitude larger than the local scale molecular diffusion coefficient dmol and its functional form depends on the shear velocity distribution and molecular diffusion coefficient e g bolster et al 2011 this has inspired two tacks for upscaled reactive transport the first tack has derived two dispersion coefficients one for the effective mixing deff and another corresponding to taylor s dmac that describes macro dispersive spreading in this approach mixing is assumed to be the dominant mechanism dictating reaction rates i e reactions are nearly instantaneous so that the statistics of mixing via destruction of concentration gradients give an effective smaller dispersion coefficient cirpka and kitanidis 2000a 2000b dentz and carrera 2007 dentz et al 2000 this smaller deff is designed to slow down reactions but not place solutes in the correct locations so cirpka and kitanidis 2000a suggests a streamtube approach in which the spreading of the centers of mass for the streamtubes is given by dmac while mixing within a streamtube is given by the smaller deff the second tack seeks to adjust the reaction rate itself by recognizing that the reactant segregation that results from upscaling should modify the effective reaction rate this approach has been used on simpler diffusion only problems that allow direct calculation of segregation as measured by reactant concentration covariance evolution equations bolster et al 2012 paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 tartakovsky et al 2012 however in heterogeneous velocity distributions these equations have yet to be analytically solved and only simpler expressions based on very fast or very slow reactions end members have been developed porta et al 2012 these upscaling approaches point out the fundamental problem associated with an eulerian advection dispersion and reaction equation adre the dispersion coefficient valid for conservative transport at some scale will over predict fluid mixing and reaction at the same scale but under predict spreading at some larger scale or volume averaged to fewer spatial dimensions we seek to correct this problem with a lagrangian framework for m species undergoing fickian dispersion in incompressible flow the coupled adres are 1 c i t v c i d c i r c a c b c m k 1 k n i a b m where ci is the concentration of each of the species labeled i a b m v is a velocity vector d is a dispersion tensor and r is a reaction function among the m constituents with n reaction channels the adre assumes that d describes mixing and spreading in exactly the same way for continuously varying v this is only true at the molecular scale in practice however all variables and parameters in 1 have some finite support scale and the discrepancy between mixing and spreading grows with support scale dentz et al 2011 le borgne et al 2013 le borgne et al 2014 indeed if v is given by darcy s law and a hydraulic conductivity parameter then this type of upscaling has already occurred as briefly reviewed above this discrepancy may be accounted for by adjusting the only remaining equation parameters that are held in the reaction term r or by solving the equation separately with larger and smaller d to figure out mixing versus proper positions of reactants if the perturbations of ci v and d are known as well as their auto and cross correlations in time and space then the adjusted r can be approximated with closure assumptions dentz et al 2011 porta et al 2013 2012 tartakovsky et al 2012 that may not be particularly accurate for some values of coefficients we include a brief comparison of the two most notable analytic upscaling approximations to our numerical method in this paper on the other hand the micro scale physics of particle motion and interaction may already carry all information neglected by the analytic upscaling here we show that for the simplest case the rpt method does indeed automatically track the necessary small scale information and performs a natural upscaling 2 hagen poiseuille flow we simulate an identical problem of flow transport and kinetic bimolecular reaction a b c between two parallel plates as did kapoor et al 1997 fig 1 the concentration units are arbitrary but we will use moles l molar the local thermodynamic reaction rate is given by the law of mass action r k c a c b for constituents a and b where k molar 1 t 1 is a rate coefficient without loss of generality we assume unit activity coefficients this type of reaction has been studied experimentally and theoretically because of its simplicity and dependence on local mixing e g ding et al 2012 edery et al 2009 edery et al 2010 gramling et al 2002 raje and kapoor 2000 sánchez vila et al 2010 zhang and papelis 2011 the plates are separated by aperture b 1 mm and the molecular diffusion coefficient is 10 3 mm2 s an initial slug of reactant a is placed across the entire aperture from x 95 to x 105 mm zero elsewhere while reactant b is placed with unlimited extent only on either side of the slug the velocity field follows v v x y 0 where v x y 6 v y b y b 2 the mean velocity is specified as v 1 0132 mm s giving a characteristic advection time of t a b v 0 99 s kapoor et al define an effective diffusion time t d b π 2 d m o l different from more recent definitions of t d b 2 d m o l e g porta et al 2012 so their peclet and damkohler numbers 100 and 10 respectively are off by a factor of π 2 10 our peclet number is defined by t d t a v b d m o l 1013 kapoor et al chose a reaction rate coefficient k 0 0987 mol s 1 to yield a damkohler number of d a k c a t 0 b 2 d m o l 98 7 where the initial nonzero reactant concentrations are c a c b 1 molar first we construct a 2 d simulation of the system using the particle number preserving method bolster et al 2016 this is an extension of the original rpt algorithm that killed entire particles on reaction see benson and meerschaert 2008 the newer algorithm makes each particle carry only one species and the mass and concentration given a particle support volume on that particle is continuously adjusted to account for reactions we chose this method because the reactions are independent of the particle random walks and we need to accurately track the variance of particle positions to validate upscaling to 1 d increasing particle numbers until convergence showed that 20 000 a particles and 240 000 total b particles in two 60 mm zones on either side of the initial a slug were sufficient a gray scale plot of the binned concentrations of a remaining at t d 0 1 t 100 s shows the segregation of reactants that results from the parabolic velocity profile fig 2 a kapoor et al used centered finite differences in their solution with a maximum grid peclet number of v max δ x d m o l 37 5 so that their solution was vastly artificially over mixed and over reacted their peak concentrations of remaining reactant a are about 70 times less than ours but the general shapes agree quite well if one wished to use a first order accurate similar to kapoor et al 1997 finite difference method with a grid peclet number on the order of unity then δ x 1 7 10 4 using 100 nodes in the y direction the 200 mm 1 mm domain would require on the order of 120 million nodes a more accurate advection scheme would require fewer nodes but would still be computationally demanding so we use the particle method for the benchmark 2 d simulations see benson et al 2017 for a comparison of methods the rpt algorithm of bolster et al 2016 was used because individual particles are composed solely of a b or c this allows us to track all a particles in the initial slug to verify the analytically upscaled value of dmac t derived in the appendix the centered second moment i e the plume variance grows as expected fig 3 quadratically near t 0 because of ballistic particle motion according to the velocity profile transitioning to linear growth according to fick s law we took first differences in discretized time to calculate dmac t δvar xa 2δt we fit d m a c t 4 88 m m 2 s 1 exp t 25 s for the upscaled 1 d model from the 2 d data note that the analytic dmac t is almost exactly equal to our measured dmac t see appendix the locally well mixed 2 d model used a particle density of 2 000 mm2 or a 2 d volume per particle of 5 10 4 mm2 an equivalent volume or average spacing in 1 d is defined by δ s 5 10 4 1 2 0 0224 mm therefore for the 10 mm initial condition for reactant a an equivalently well mixed 1 d model would use n 10 mm 0 0224 mm 447 the total particle number including the surrounding initial b reactant is 5811 upon upscaling however the concentrations are not locally well mixed the projection to 1 d places disparate concentrations in the same x location the particles may represent these different concentrations and do so by representing some support volume this volume has been shown paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 to represent the concentration auto correlation and as time grows the cross correlation distance previous studies e g kapoor et al 1997 have shown that in poiseuille flow the reactants segregate in regions that occupy about one half the width of the aperture this is verified in fig 2a therefore each particle occupies a 1 d volume upon upscaling of 0 5 mm this gives an initial particle number of 20 for the a initial condition or 260 total particles this visual estimate is formally shown to be representative in the appendix these particle numbers 5811 and 260 for well mixed and segregated were placed in a 1 d model using a newer particle tracking algorithm benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018a for the lower number we also used an ensemble of 100 simulations due to noisy runs this newer algorithm benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2018a transfers masses or moles of any and all species denoted by a superscipt i e species a as ma during a time step of duration δt between all particle pairs i and j denoted by subscripts according to 2 m j a t δ t m j a t i 1 2 m i a t m j a t p i j using each particle pair s collocation probability 3 p i j δ s 8 π η d m o l δ t exp r 2 8 η d m o l δ t where δs is the particle support volume r is the distance between the i and j particles and 0 η 1 is the fraction of the isotropic diffusion simulated by interparticle mass transfer because the mass transfer process is diffusive schmidt et al 2018a any leftover diffusion is added to macro dispersion i e by 1 η d m o l d m a c which is simulated by random walks benson and bolster 2016 we chose η 1 2 although it makes no observable difference as long as the value is not extremely close to 0 or 1 note that δs is essentially calculated automatically as for any j the probabilities must satisfy i p i j 1 therefore a matrix of probabilities is adjusted to have a column sum of unity see schmidt et al 2018a also the masses in the sum can be from the beginning or end of a time step or updated sequentially schmidt et al 2018a we chose the sequential updating here for stability after mass transfer of a and b among all particles the bimolecular reaction proceeds according to a first order implementation of the law of mass action benson and bolster 2016 namely 4 δ m j a δ m j b δ m j c k δ t δ s m j a δ s m j b δ s after mass transfer and reaction the particles experience advection and any additional local and macro dispersion by well known random walk methods labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 specifically in the 2 d model particles are advected by vx y δt and isotropically diffused by 1 η d m o l while the 1 d models advect by v δ t and disperse using taylor s 1 η d m o l d m a c t unless otherwise specified for hypothesis testing 3 results and discussion the rates of c production and late time a decline agree quite well in both log log and linear coordinates when the lower number of initial a particles n 260 is used to represent concentration fluctuation distances on the order of one half pore width fig 4 we expect that an even better fit could be achieved by adjusting the particle number but we have not changed our original visual estimate of particle support volume equal to one half pore width see also the appendix this level of agreement was not expected due to the loss of detailed velocity information upon upscaling by virtue of a constant velocity and gaussian random walks the 1 d model has a gaussian shape at any time the fact that the shape of the plume appears to be of secondary importance would indicate that the magnitude of concentration fluctuations along with the rate at which these fluctuations mix at the local scale is a primary driver of reaction rate see also tartakovsky and barajas solano 2018 we can inspect the degree to which different concentrations coexist in close proximity by examining a plot of each particle s concentration of a versus position along the x axis in both the 2 d and 1 d rpt models fig 5 these concentrations are given by diving the species masses by particle support volume δs for clarity we plot every 25 th particle from the 260 000 initial a particle model in 2 d along with single realizations from the 5811 particle and 260 particle models in 1 d all at a time of 100 s td 10 unlike an eulerian model the 1 d upscaled models have particles at or near the same position with very different concentrations this happens because the properly upscaled dispersive random walks take particles with different masses and move them relatively large distances using dmac t into areas of very different concentrations the local transfer of mass between particles takes place more slowly than this according to dmol so there is not enough time to equilibrate with surroundings before a new excursion this is especially true in the 260 particle model and shows that a key to this upscaling is a correct calculation of the large scale excursion lengths versus the local scale mixing rate also evident in fig 5 is that the 1 d model has lost information about the particular velocity distribution and performs gaussian random walks a more important point is the difference between the lagrangian model with mixing given by d 10 3 mm2 s and spreading by dmac t and an eulerian model that uses the same value either dmol or dmac t for both mixing and spreading we ran the 1 d models using these potential end member choices for mixing and dispersion and found that those upscaled models under predict and over predict reaction magnitudes significantly fig 6 this is further emphasized by a plot of the global reaction rates fig 7 to check the accuracy of these particle models we also coded a 1 d eulerian model using upwind finite differences fd and dmac t with a constant velocity and courant number of unity the fd model does not suffer numerical dispersion and it verifies the rpt model using upscaled single valued d d m a c t this model using dmac t for both mixing and spreading is a better model than using dmol for both which indicates that it is more important for the reactants to be placed in the proper positions before mixing begins even if the local mixing is overdone that is why for t 0 the reactant initial condition specifies the correct positions and using dmol is the better model after a time of approximately td 10 the solute if placed in the proper positions becomes better mixed and using dmac is more appropriate see cirpka and kitanidis 2000a dentz and carrera 2007 porta et al 2012 if one is forced to use a deterministic eulerian model however in the next section we will see that an effective intermediate value dmol deff dmac is better still 3 1 analytic semi analytic upscaling as discussed in the introduction two forms of upscaling have been derived and or suggested for the mixing versus spreading problem one extends the approach of porta et al 2012 who volume average the reactive transport equations those authors solve for the asymptotic t coefficients in upscaled equations that keep first order terms only we extend their approach for coefficients that are functions of time appendix the result is two coupled transport equations one for a reactive species and another for the conservative species a b a galilean invariant i e v 0 set of these equations was solved on a finite difference grid using centered differences for first derivatives a classical 3 point stencil for second derivatives and operator splitting for reaction so that the solution is o δ x 2 δ t discretization was decreased until convergence was observed with a final δ x 0 1 mm δ t 0 001 s plots of the global reaction rate and the masses of a and c over time fig 8 show that the perturbation upscaling overpredicts the mixing and reaction rates although the inclusion of an adjusted reaction rate in 24 improves the results relative to a simple 1 d finite difference solution of 1 using upscaled dmac t compare fig 8 to figs 6 and 7 the full perturbation upscaled solution shown in fig 8 still overpredicts reaction rates relative to the rpt solution either because of the neglect of higher order moments or other terms to achieve closure specifically the regime in question is defined by a moderately fast reaction rate d a 10 as defined by kapoor et al or da 100 by porta s definition which is assumed to be infinite in order for 18 to reduce to 19 a second method called the streamtube approach by cirpka et al derives two upscaled dispersion coefficients for a conservative tracer one for effective mixing within a theoretically isolated streamtube deff and another for the spreading that includes the separation of the centers of mass from different velocities among the streamtubes dmac cirpka and kitanidis 2000a 2000b dentz and carrera 2007 dentz et al 2000 actual streamtubes allow mass transfer between each other this process promotes mixing therefore the derivation of the effective diffusion within an isolated 1 d streamtube must include the effects of cross streamtube mixing that is lost see the appendix a practical application of this method requires solving the reactive system of transport equations 1 using deff and mapping those solutions to the positions of the streamtubes at time t the centers of mass have advected to a mean position of v t and accumulated some extra spreading we may adopt the upscaled and gaussian approximation of the extra spreading by using the accumulated difference d δ t 0 t d m a c τ d eff τ d τ calculation of dmac t is already provided in the appendix and using the methodology in dentz and carrera 2007 we further calculate d m a c d eff as a function of time the 1 d solution of the reactive system using deff t has an excellent representation of the reaction rate and evolution of reactant and product moles fig 8 a superposition of these 1 d solutions with random mean positions given by v t 2 t d δ t z where z is a standard normal yields plots very close to the ensemble rpt model using 260 particles fig 9 at the time shown in fig 9 t 100 s t d 10 the total moles of a remaining in the ensemble streamtube and ensemble rpt models are 0 0466 and 0 0462 while the centered second moments are 528 and 519 mm2 respectively we speculate that for this moderately fast reaction d a 100 the particle method is a stochastic implementation of the streamtube method each particle moves by mean advection and macrodispersion but transfers mass according to 1 the local diffusive green s function schmidt et al 2018a and 2 the covariance of concentrations given by the particle support volume an open question is the regions of the da pe and chemical sequestration parameter space under which the correspondence holds 4 conclusions in this technical note we show that the rpt method can accurately simulate dimensionally upscaled transport and reaction for pre asymptotic times in poiseuille flow we used the time dependent upscaled effective taylor macro dispersion coefficient dmac for random walks and the isotropic molecular diffusion for locally diffusive mass transfer between particles an accurate model using finite differences would require full specification of the velocity in 2 d and take tens of millions of nodes using higher order methods and hundreds of millions for first order methods benson et al 2017 the properly upscaled rpt model used 20 initial a 260 total particles and an ensemble of 100 simulations ran in minutes on a laptop pc the volume averaging upscaling method did not perform as well as the streamtube method with effective diffusion for the pe and da values selected by kapoor et al 1997 the streamtube and rpt methods were essentially identical for this reactive scenario this suggests that the rpt method is performing an equivalent upscaling procedure automatically because the particles experience the velocity perturbations as well as the local green s function of mixing both of those quantities are the key elements of the streamtube approach an interesting hypothesis is that the rpt method will succeed in upscaling regardless of the da pe regime because it does not discard any terms if true the particle method would be not only convenient but theoretically preferred because at any scale above the molecular scale in moving fluids mixing spreading and chemical kinetics are completely different phenomena that should be simulated as such furthermore the rpt method can accommodate any velocity field with variability in time and space and any reactions whether fluid fluid as done here or fluid solid schmidt et al 2018b because the success of the rpt method depends on an accurate estimate of the particle numbers densities which in turn encodes the concentration perturbation autocovariance this study highlights the importance of measuring or estimating these statistics acknowledgements we thank the editor graham sander reviewers olaf

reaction terms r k c a c b for i a b and r k c a c b for i c an equation for pseudo species concentration c d c b c a given by subtracting the equation for ca from the same for cb is conservative due to the cancellation of their respective reaction terms in particular the resulting equation for cd is just 1 with r 0 we may decompose concentrations and the velocity field into mean and fluctuation terms 5 c i t x y c i t x c i t x y v x y v v x y where the overbar refers to the volume average across the y direction and the prime to the zero mean fluctuations about the average a1 two equation volume averaged closure we take a perturbative approach for upscaling by volume averaging in the y direction in particular we follow porta et al 2012 and bolster et al 2011 with an extension to include time variable upscaled coefficients this approach discards a number of second and higher order moments in order to reach closure with two pdes for the conservative compound place 5 and r 0

assuming that transverse processes are most important implies that p p y t satisfies 10 p t v d m o l 2 p y 2 the solution of this boundary value problem is 11 p y t 0 t 0 b v η g y t τ η d η d τ where g is the transverse diffusion green s function namely 12 g y t η 1 b 2 b n 1 cos n π y b cos n π η b exp d m o l n 2 π 2 t b 2 thus 13 p y t n 1 12 b 2 v d m o l n 4 π 4 cos n π y b 1 exp d m o

explains any possible discrepancies between our findings and theirs in porta s work they do not consider an explicit time dependent reaction coefficient as above later work also by porta et al 2016 suggests that more complex closures can be used when coefficients are time dependent resulting in a nonlocal integro differential equation however that system is significantly more computationally intensive than this closure additionally the closure approximation was originally postulated strictly for cases where da pe although it was verified also for cases where da 1 and pe and da had similar values as here a3 streamtube mixing model let us define global first second and second centered moments 27 m 1 t 1 b 0 b x c t x y d x d y m 2 t 1 b 0 b x 2 c t x y d x d y k 2 m 2 t m 1 2 t the

29 m 1 y t x c t x y d x m 2 y t x 2 c t x y d x κ 2 y t m 2 y t m 1 2 y t with these we can define an alternative dispersion coefficient 30 d eff 1 2 d d t 1 b 0 b κ 2 y t d y which is a better measure of mixing than dmac which captures both mixing and spreading cirpka and kitanidis 2000b dentz and carrera 2007 consider the difference between the first local and global moment p y t m 1 y t m

concentrations mixing in the poiseuille system is dominated by transverse concentration gradients so we may examine the transverse autocovariance and reactant segregation that develops almost immediately after the initial condition is distorted by the velocity field to our knowledge expressions for the concentration statistics have not been developed for the reactive system indeed even the conservative system will experience dilution and reduced total variance as time gets large so we look at the concentrations that develop early at a dimensionless time of 5 t a t d 20 5 s this ensures plenty of advective distortion but minimal dilution a 260 000 particle simulation was run with all parameters identical to the reactive simulation except that the reaction rate coefficient was set to zero at a time of 5 s the a concentrations were binned fig 10 c and the covariance functions at each of 40 y transects were calculated numerically fig 10b we are especially interested in the area corresponding to the positive covariance portion at small spatial separations in the center of these plots a visual estimate of the extent of the a concentrations is on the order of one half pore width fig 2 which is the number we used in our uncalibrated simulations of course the a concentration covariance will be different along the length of the a plume so we examine the variability here the autocovariance function fig 10a for uniformly randomly placed dirac delta function particles placed in a finite domain was derived by schmidt et al 2017 36 c o v c a y c a l n a m p 2 ω δ y l 1 ω c a m p δ y l 1 ω where c a c a t 0 is the initial undiluted a concentration na is the initial number of a particles mp is the mass of each particle ω is the extent of the domain here 1 mm in the transverse direction and δ is a dirac delta function several studies have shown that equating the integral of this covariance to the integral of the real covariance function makes the particle model most closely match concentration evolution in real and numerical systems with concentration segregation bolster et al 2016 ding et al 2012 ding et al 2017 paster et al 2014 schmidt et al 2017 the fact that the delta particles have an atom of covariance at the origin fig 10a is not a problem as they assume a gaussian kernel shape when the mass transfer algorithm is applied integrating the covariance function means that the near origin integrated area for the delta particles is camp because the particle mass is m p c a ω n a the area can be written c a 2 ω n a with units c 2 l equating this to the numerically estimated near origin area with units c 2 l gives a particle density n a ω c a 2 a r e a 1 m o l 2 a r e a this number is particles per mm in the y direction the initial condition here is 10 mm in the x direction so the total number of initial a particles is 10 the density a plot of the near origin areas and the resultant total number of a particles fig 10d shows that the number ranges from 11 to 40 in the high mixing regions with an average of 21 supporting our visual estimate of 20 for the initial condition it may well be that a lower number would give an even better i e slightly slower mixing model but we have not performed any calibration supplementary material supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10 1016 j advwatres
