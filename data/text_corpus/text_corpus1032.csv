5160,heat as a groundwater tracer has potential application in identifying earthquake induced changes in fluid flow since convective heat transport modifies the phase and amplitude of periodic oscillations under pure heat conduction condition temporal variation of groundwater flux can thus be derived from multi depth periodic temperature signals here we present groundwater flux changes after two large earthquakes nearby determined from in situ bedrock temperature measurements in the xianshuihe fault zone at the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau five year temperature time series at six different locations are recorded by high sensitivity temperature sensors 10 4 k installed at various depths ranging from 0 to 20 m groundwater fluxes are estimated through time varying amplitudes and phases of the annual oscillations extracted from the dynamic harmonic regression technique results show different hydrological responses to these two earthquakes after the 2013 m s 7 0 lushan earthquake sustained rise in upward flux was revealed at all locations in the intermediate field contradicting to the modeled coseismic static dilatational strains however groundwater flux patterns after the 2014 m s 6 3 kangding earthquake are consistent with the coseismic volumetric strain distribution of a quadrantal pattern of this event we propose that enhanced hydraulic permeability by dynamic stress might cause the increased upward fluid flux after the lushan earthquake in the intermediate field while coseismic static volumetric strain may account for the hydrological changes after the kangding earthquake in the near field this is the first time that temperature time series are used to quantify continuous earthquake related changes in groundwater fluxes in situ temperature monitoring can provide insights into earthquake driven hydrologic responses and also offer additional information to identify temporal changes in crustal strain or hydraulic properties keywords in situ temperature measurement eastern margin of the tibetan plateau heat as a tracer hydrological response to earthquake near field fault zone 1 introduction it has been documented that earthquakes can induce various hydrological responses including changes in streamflow and spring discharge montgomery and manga 2003 muir wood and king 1993 wang and manga 2010 changes in water levels in wells ingebritsen and manga 2019 wakita 1975 and hydrochemical changes in springs li et al 2019 several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these hydrological changes in response to earthquakes 1 pore pressure changes by coseismic static elastic strain jónsson et al 2003 muir wood and king 1993 wakita 1975 2 increase or decrease in permeability caused by dynamic stresses brodsky et al 2003 rojstaczer et al 1995 shi et al 2019 3 coseismic liquefaction or consolidation of loose sediments manga 2001 wang et al 2003 as earthquake changes crustal stress and physical properties such as permeability or porosity interactions between seismological and hydrological processes provide the potential for understanding the temporal variability of strain and hydraulic properties montgomery and manga 2003 xue et al 2013 faults can act as favorable pathways for groundwater migration faulkner et al 2010 and are tectonically active therefore earthquake induced groundwater flow changes may appear more frequently in fault zones however due to difficulties of monitoring in the vicinity of the seismogenic faults many research focused on hydrological responses detectable hundreds or thousands of kilometers from earthquake epicenters brodsky et al 2003 montgomery and manga 2003 yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 only a few studies based on in situ measurements in the near field hosono et al 2019 jónsson et al 2003 the mechanism of hydrological alterations near the rupture zone is still poorly understood furthermore most observations are limited to single earthquake there are only few cases that systematically studied fluid flow changes in response to multiple earthquakes e g manga et al 2003 shi et al 2014 so it is still unclear whether the mechanisms would vary in space and time the xianshuihe fault is one of the world s most active faults which has experienced prominent tectonic deformation and frequently strong earthquakes allen et al 1991 zhang 2013 the fault plane is also a hydraulic conduit with many deep circulation thermal springs guo et al 2017 tang et al 2017 two large earthquakes 2013 lushan m s 7 0 earthquake and 2014 kangding m s 6 3 earthquake sequentially occurred in the xianshuihe and the nearby longmenshan fault zones few studies have reported the hydrological responses to the kangding earthquake because of sparse fluid monitoring wells in the region li et al 2019 however an in site temperature measurement network has been built since 2009 along the xianshuihe fault zone the epicentral distances of most temperature monitoring stations are within 50 km for the kangding earthquake and 150 km for the lushan earthquake boreholes were drilled in bedrocks with depths of 10 20 m for monitoring temperature changes at various depths the long term temperature series give us unique opportunities to study groundwater flux variations responding to two nearby earthquakes and explore their mechanisms actually besides monitoring stream discharge or water level groundwater flux can also be traced from temperature based approaches utilizing temperature time series or temperature depth profiles anderson 2005 bense et al 2017 fulton and brodsky 2016 kurylyk and irvine 2019 rau et al 2014 stallman 1965 taniguchi 1993 the advantage of using heat over other tracers to estimate groundwater flux is that heat is ubiquitous economical easily measured and properties such as thermal conductivity and specific heat vary much less than hydraulic properties in darcy s law saar 2011 miyakoshi et al 2020 first reported post earthquake groundwater flow changes identified through repeated temperature depth profiles by now no research has used temperature time series to quantify continuous earthquake induced groundwater flux changes temperature measured at shallow depths generally show daily or annual cyclic variations thermal diffusivities can be derived from either phase shift or amplitude damping of the periodic oscillations at two different depths seward and prieto 2018 tabbagh et al 1999 when groundwater flow occurs convective heat transport would make the amplitude and phase of the periodic variations deviate from those expected under purely conductive conditions goto et al 2005 hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 as a consequence groundwater flux can be determined through the discrepancy between thermal diffusivities estimated from the phase method and that from the amplitude method liu et al 2019 most research used diel periodic signals to trace water flow in near surface sediments constantz 2008 gordon et al 2012 mccallum et al 2012 but methods relying on diurnal oscillations are only valid where groundwater fluxes are high 2 10 7 m s and in the very shallow subsurface depth 2 m kurylyk and irvine 2019 stallman 1965 in contrast annual signals are applicable for lower groundwater flux magnitudes 1 10 8 m s and can extend to depths greater than 25 m chen et al 2019 stallman 1965 in this study we estimate groundwater flow rate changes after two nearby strong earthquakes using high resolution temperature time series recorded by a bedrock temperature monitoring network in the fault zone we identify different hydrological responses to the earthquakes in the near and intermediate fields and then test hypotheses responsible for them 2 study area there is a y shaped fault system located in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau which consists of the xianshuihe longmenshan and anninghe fault zones fig 1 a this area has complicated tectonic deformation and numerous devastating earthquakes e g the 2008 wenchuan m s 8 0 earthquake the fault system represents the transitional zone of the bayan har sichuan yunnan and the south china blocks the 2013 lushan m s 7 0 earthquake took place at the ne trending longmenshan fault zone which has been active in the latest quaternary dominated by thrusting with dextral component densmore et al 2007 ran et al 2010 the lushan earthquake has a mostly thrust mechanism and the ruptured length is about 35 km with dominant focal depth ranging from 10 to 20 km fang et al 2013 han et al 2014 the causative fault dips to the north west the 2014 kangding m s 6 3 earthquake occurred on the nw trending xianshuihe fault zone this fault zone appears to become active due to outward growth of the tibetan plateau in about 10 ma characterized by large scale left lateral strike slip motions zhang 2013 the kangding earthquake has a strike slip mechanism with a nearly vertical causative plane striking roughly north northwest xie et al 2017 the rupture of the kangding earthquake extended along the strike direction by about 20 km yi et al 2015 the study area is mainly covered by proterozoic and triassic metamorphic rocks permian basalt triassic sedimentary rocks and magmatic rocks of the proterozoic indosinian and himalayan periods fig 1b the shallow groundwater in the fault zone is mainly bedrock fissure water mostly recharged by atmospheric precipitation fractures are extensively distributed in the sandstone marble slate and cenozoic granite representing high permeability aquifers while the less cracked proterozoic granite and mudstone strata represent medium permeability aquifers zhang et al 2018a there are strong manifestations of hydrothermal activity in this area especially the zonal distribution of a large number of hot springs near the active faults known as the eastern tibetan plateau geothermal belt tang et al 2017 the xianshuihe fault zone serves as favorable hydraulic conduits which are permeable and allow easy thermal groundwater circulation guo et al 2017 li et al 2019 river systems are in parallel with mountain chains mainly flowing southward with several minor rivers flowing eastward which probably developed along several small faults under the influence of terrain and monsoon circulation the area belongs to subtropical climate local meteorological records show that the annual temperature ranges from 14 c to 28 c with an average of 8 c mean annual precipitation is 909 mm concentrated between april and september 3 materials and methods 3 1 data a bedrock temperature measurement network was constructed along the xianshuihe fault zone during 2009 2010 fig 1 table 1 the temperature monitoring stations are 101 158 km and 19 53 km from the epicentres of the m s 7 0 lushan and m s 6 3 kangding earthquakes respectively for each measurement station a borehole was drilled down to a depth of 10 20 m with a radius of 89 mm chen et al 2019 chen et al 2016 eight temperature sensors were set into the borehole each of which is a platinum resistance temperature transmitter with a resolution of 0 0001 k pt1000 heraeus m222 20nipt10 class a made in germany four sensors were located at depths of 0 0 0 25 0 8 and 3 2 m fig s1 in the supplementary materials the other sensors were installed in bedrock at deeper depths according to drilling and installation conditions table 1 fig 2 then cement paste was filled into the borehole with a pipe set into the bottom of the borehole this step ensured the borehole free from fluid movement and the sensors thermally coupled with the surrounding bedrock finally the pipe was removed temperature data were sampled every 15 min recorded using a data acquisition system and then sent to the data center by a wireless communication mode called general packet radio service zhang et al 2018b a storage battery was placed in each borehole to supply the power of the recording system during the solidification of the cement heat was gradually released and thermal balance was reached after about one month fig s2 for this reason data selected for this research are from 1st june 2011 to 1st june 2016 to avoid records for at least the initial eight months since the filling of cement the raw data are almost continuous with only several short interruptions each lasting a couple of hours table s1 3 2 method of analysis near surface temperature time series usually demonstrate periodical variations such as changes in annual seasonal or daily cycles on this basis ground surface temperature could be assumed as a summation of periodic oscillations superimposed on an average surface temperature t 0 1 t 0 t t 0 n 1 m a n cos ω n t φ n where t is time ωn 2π τn is the angular frequency of the n order cyclic variation an φ n τn are the amplitude phase and period of the n order component using eq 1 as the boundary condition at the surface we can obtain an analytical solution to the one dimensional heat conduction equation in a homogeneous medium for a half infinite space kinoshita et al 1996 2 t z t t 0 g z n 1 m a n exp ω n 2 α z cos ω n t φ n ω n 2 α z where t is temperature z is the depth from the surface α is thermal diffusivity and g is the steady state geothermal gradient which reflects the heat flow from below eq 2 shows that the amplitude of periodic oscillation decreases exponentially with depth while the phase lag linearly increases with depth high frequency components of the temperature variation such as daily fluctuations damp fast with depth at depths greater than 2 m only 0 01 of the daily fluctuations are remained if thermal diffusivity is assumed to be 1 5 10 6 m2 s chen et al 2019 as temperature in the surface zone is very sensitive to short time changes of weather condition we only chose temperature records beyond 5 m for study at which depth the daily variation vanishes entirely fig 3 therefore the following calculation focuses on the annual periodic variation when temperature oscillations over time are measured at different depths thermal diffusivity can be calculated using the amplitude ratio or the phase lag of the annual variations at two different depths z 1 and z 2 tabbagh et al 1999 3 α a ω z 1 z 2 2 2 ln 2 a 1 a 2 4 α φ ω z 1 z 2 2 2 φ 1 φ 2 2 where a 1 a 2 φ1 and φ2 are the amplitudes and phases at depths z 1 and z 2 ω is the angular frequency of the annual wave the thermal diffusivities obtained from eqs 3 and 4 are hereinafter referred to as the amplitude method and phase method respectively if fluid movement exists as what usually happens in fault zones or groundwater aquifers the temperature distribution would follow the heat transfer equation incorporating both thermal conduction and convection processes described as eq 5 for a homogeneous medium in the 1d case stallman 1965 5 t t α 2 t z 2 c w c r u t z where u is the groundwater flux positive downward cw is the volumetric heat capacity of water 4 18 106 j m3k cr is the volumetric heat capacity of the rock fluid system which is defined as rau et al 2014 6 c r n c w 1 n c s where n is the fractional porosity c s is the volumetric heat capacity of the solids given a cosinusoidal surface temperature boundary condition the analytical solution to eq 5 is 7 t z t t 0 g z a 0 exp d m z cos ω t φ 0 d n z where a 0 and φ0 are the amplitude and phase of the cosinusoidal surface temperature d ω 2 α m d ω γ 1 2 γ 2 γ 4 4 ω 4 d 4 1 2 1 2 n 2 ω d γ 2 γ 4 4 ω 4 d 4 1 2 1 2 γ c w c r u gao et al 2008 eq 7 shows that upward groundwater flow accelerates the damping of temperature variations whereas downward groundwater flow decreases the damping nevertheless the groundwater flow always reduces the phase lag regardless of flow direction fig 4 as a consequence the impact of water flow on phase and amplitude would make the estimated thermal diffusivities from eqs 3 and 4 inconsistent with those under pure heat conduction when upward groundwater flow exists the thermal diffusivity determined with a phase method α φ is larger than that obtained with an amplitude method αa and vice versa liu et al 2019 thus the discrepancy between α φ and αa provides the opportunity to determine water flow derection then the groundwater flux can be further yielded from relationship between α φ and αa liu et al 2019 8 u c r 2 ω α φ c w 2 α a α φ α a 1 as the amplitudes and phases of the annual oscillation may vary over time the thermal diffusivities determined with the phase and amplitude methods would also change over time we can then obtain a temporal variation of the groundwater flux thus a non stationary time series analysis is necessary to extract the time varying amplitude and phase of the cyclical signal time series analysis was performed using dynamic harmonic regression dhr young et al 1999 which is a special case of the unobserved components model formulated with a stochastic state space setting this model is commonly used in economic forecasting pedregal and trapero 2007 but also useful for adaptive seasonal adjustment signal extraction and backcasting the dhr model can be considered as a straightforward extension of the constant parameter harmonic regression fourier series or trigonometric model in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonic components can vary as a result of estimated time variable trigonometric parameters the observed time series yt can be decomposed into the trend seasonal and irregular components through the dhr model fig 5 expressed by 9 y t t t s t e t where tt is a long term trend or low frequency component st is a seasonal component in this case describing the annual seasonality represented by cosinusoidal patterns with time varying parameters and et is an irregular component i e uncorrelated gaussian white noise the seasonal component is recursively estimated along with the trend using a combination of a kalman filter and a fixed interval smoothing algorithms in optimizing the estimation of parameters dhr employs a cost function minimising the difference between the logarithmic pseudo spectrum of the model and the logarithmic autoregressive spectrum of the time series this cost function yields more excellent convergence and efficient computation when compared with the alternative maximum likelihood cost function the dhr model is available in the captain toolbox taylor et al 2007 the cosinusoidal pattern isolated by dhr is a real component of the raw data rather than an approximation and has greater accuracy than that acquired with a simple band pass filter for a more detailed description of the dhr model see young et al 1999 time series from 1st june 2011 to 1st june 2016 at various depths of the locations were selected for analysis except the kdd station whose data have been stopped since 25th april 2014 as the sampling period of 15 min generates more than thirty thousand samples per annual cycle spurious filtration artifacts may appear associated with oversampling therefore we did low pass filtering on the data and resampled them to a lower sampling period of three days to reduce the filtering problems the new sampling period is quite small compared to the period of the annual oscillation which allows dhr to isolate the annual wave efficiently from a raw time series after the temporal variations of amplitude and phase of the annual waves were determined thermal diffusivities were calculated through the amplitude method eq 3 and phase method eq 4 between pairs of depth fig s3 then vertical flow rate was determined according to eq 8 as with all digital filtering the results of dhr decomposition may be unreliable at the beginning and end of the time series for this reason we discarded the results of the first and last years to avoid the edge effects 4 results 4 1 temporal variability of groundwater flux it can be seen from the raw temperature records that the annual signal is the dominant signal within the range of depths observed fig 6 dhr was employed to each temperature time series to isolate the cosinusoidal components of the annual wave from the raw data obvious amplitude attenuation and phase delay of the annual oscillation with depth are demonstrated in fig 7 then with time varying amplitudes and phases at various paired depths eqs 3 4 and 8 were solved for each location to determine the groundwater flux temperatures recorded by sensors that were installed quite close to each other were not used in flux calculation because such small depth difference may result in large errors for determining thermal diffusivity between the depth pair since measurements of the physical properties of the rock fluid system were not available for the fractured drill core it is necessary to account for the uncertainty in flow rate estimates given the uncertainty in physical parameters main parameter concerning the computed results is the volumetric heat capacity of the rock fluid system which is determined by the volumetric thermal capacity of matrix and porosity eq 6 the volumetric thermal capacities of the solids were derived from the value of nonporous rocks measured by waples and waples 2004 table 2 bedrocks of the study area are igneous metamorphic and triassic sedimentary rocks with low porosity for instance critical porosity for cracked igneous rocks is only 5 nur et al 1998 hence a mean porosity of 4 was used in the calculation an uncertainty analysis for the properties was conducted in the next section 4 2 uncertainty analysis computed groundwater fluxes are shown in fig 8 groundwater near the kdv and kds stations were upward flowing as a whole while upward and downward flow alternately occurred at the other stations after the m s 7 0 lushan earthquake a remarkable rise in upward flux was revealed at all the locations the flux reached a peak and then began to decrease the whole process of groundwater flow anomaly lasted four months to more than two years in contrast the groundwater flux series after the m s 6 3 kangding earthquake show various responses at different locations upward flow rates distinctly increased after the earthquake at the kds station and slightly increased at the dfz station while a marked decrease in flow rate occurred at the xwv station nevertheless it seemed that groundwater fluxes had little changes after the kangding earthquake at the kdv and dfl stations the groundwater flow anomalies recovered quicker after the kangding earthquake than that after the lushan earthquake on the whole 4 2 uncertainty analysis due to lack of direct information for the physical property of the fractured rocks an uncertainty analysis was employed to evaluate to what extent the error would be caused by parameter changes we estimated the influence of volumetric thermal capacity and porosity on the flux calculation values for each parameter were varied assuming normal distributions with mean and standard deviation as given in table 2 standard deviations were assumed to be 1 for the porosity and 10 of the mean value for the volumetric thermal capacity of the matrix then a monte carlo analysis of flux calculation was carried out for 4096 sets of parameters note that the uncertainty in properties has been exaggerated and that measurement of the properties would constrain the uncertainty in flux estimation substantially despite the exaggerated parameter ranges the estimated fluxes fall within a relatively narrow range and clear changes in flux after the earthquakes are shown in fig 9 relatively large uncertainties occur at high flow rates as expected when advection becomes important for heat transport we have assumed constant physical property of rocks over time although by accounting for a range of physical properties the results still illustrate significant contrast in groundwater flux after the earthquakes uncertainty in flux estimates may also result from the dhr processes adequate samplings in one period of annual cycle makes the extraction of the annual oscillation effective from the raw data errors of the fit by the dhr model to the raw series are typically on the order of 10 5 which are rather small compared to the other components as expected and desirable besides the irregular components are zero mean uncorrelated sequences according with the white noise fig 5c which ensures the validity of the time series analysis 5 discussion the effect from fluid movement in the borehole was avoided in our temperature measurement system as a whole this is because the borehole was completely filled with cement to thermally couple sensors with the surrounding bedrock even if small volume of water was sealed in the borehole the fluid advection along the borehole wall would display an exponential feature of thermal diffusion which is generated by the additional heat due to water level changes involved with stress variations chen et al 2019 the exponential temperature changes due to sealed water are of low amplitude and quickly attenuated that exists only within several days therefore the estimated fluxes may represent groundwater flow in the surrounding formations of the boreholes groundwater flux changes may result from non seismic processes such as rainfall or seismic processes such as co seismic static strain wakita 1975 permeability enhancement rojstaczer et al 1995 or consolidation of saturated sediments manga 2001 because our temperature sensors were installed in bedrock not in loose sediments we discard consolidation as a dominant process here we discuss other mechanisms for flow rate changes 5 1 did groundwater flux respond to changes in surface condition surface temperature volume of rainfall and groundwater saturation of the area might affect the evolution of the temperature measured by sensors we evaluated how much influence these factors would have on the derived groundwater flux groundwater level of the study area varied between 0 38 m and 3 11 m with an average of 1 78 m during 2012 2014 fig 10 a zhu et al 2017 all the temperature data used in this study were recorded by sensors at depth of at least 5 9 m which were below the groundwater table during the period of observation and could be considered in the saturated zone thus groundwater saturation might have little impact on the estimated groundwater flux then correlation with rainfall was analyzed by calculating the correlation coefficient between the groundwater flux and average precipitation for the preceded 7 days as a whole groundwater flux has a weak correlation with the rainfall table 3 althrough their correlation might be enhanced after some heavy precipitation events we also calculated the correlation coefficients for the earthquakes using time series of 45 days before and after the earthquakes low correlations were showed between the fluid flow rate changes and rainfall at the time of both earthquakes table 3 in fact there was no precipitation within 6 days before the 2013 lushan earthquake and 8 days before the 2014 kangding earthquake lastly we analyzed to what extent the surface temperature may affect temperature records at depth high frequency temperature variations usually decay quickly with depth variations of amplitude and phase of the surface annual periodic oscillation were extracted through the dhr model fig 10d temperatures at depth of 6 16 m where the sensors located would be delayed 78 207 days from the surface when thermal diffusivity is assumed to be 2 10 6 m2 s taking the delay time into account amplitude changes within the sensor spacing 1 5 2 0 m generated by surface annual wave were less than 1 10 3 at the time of both earthquakes and the phase changes were only about 3 10 4 and 6 10 5 for the lushan and kangding earthquakes respectively therefore temperature changes after the earthquakes may not be due to surface temperature variations 5 2 did groundwater flux respond to static strain in most igneous metamorphic and well lithified sediments mobile water is held and transported in fractures and variations in stresses under compressive stress cracks close and water is expelled whereas tensional stress facilitates cracks open and water is drawn in muir wood and king 1993 we used the dislocation model okada 1992 to test if it would explain the groundwater flux changes in the study area coseismic static volume strain changes of the two earthquakes were modeled using coulomb 3 3 lin and stein 2004 toda et al 2005 focal mechanisms are provided by global cmt https www globalcmt org and other model parameters referred to fang et al 2013 yi et al 2015 and xie et al 2017 the estimated static volumetric strains are shown in fig 11 for the m s 7 0 lushan earthquake all stations are located in the coseismic dilational zone fig 11a if flux changes were caused by static strain decrease in upward flux would be expected however upward fluxes were all enhanced after the earthquake at these stations the epicentral distance of the stations ranges from three to four ruptured fault lengths of the lushan earthquake table 1 which corresponds to the intermediate field wang and manga 2010 previous studies also showed that water level changes after this earthquake of most wells in the intermediate field are not consistent with the static strain distribution shi et al 2014 yang et al 2014 this indicates that the static strain hypothesis might not be the dominant mechanism causing the water flux changes after the lushan earthquake for the m s 6 3 kangding earthquake the strike slip focal mechanism delineates the affected area into quadrants of static compression negative volume strain and dilatation positive volume strain fig 11b the spatial distribution of surface deformation coincides with results from the insar observations jiang et al 2015 the xwv station is located in the dilatational zone of coseismic strains with significant increase in downward flow rate after the earthquake the kds station is located in the compressional quadrant and enhanced upward flux was revealed after the earthquake the dfz station lies near the seismogenic fault and the coseismic elastic strain would generally be small fig 11b although the uncertainty in the strike of the focal mechanism might have some impacts on the calculated coseismic volumetric strain the water flux of the dfz station changed slightly after the earthquake the kdv and dfl stations are near the boundary between dilatational and compressional regimes and the groundwater flow rates had no obvious changes after the earthquake this suggests a possible correlation between the flux changes and co seismic strain the epicentral distances of these stations are only 19 to 53 km table 1 most of which are within two rupture fault lengths thus regional groundwater flow responses for the earthquake might be as a result of coseismic elastic strain in comparison of the two nearby earthquakes coseismic volumetric strain might be the dominant reason for earthquake induced groundwater flow changes within two rupture fault lengths but become non dominant beyond this distance 5 3 did groundwater flux respond to permeability variation from the discussion above coseismic static strain might be discarded as a primary mechanism for the hydrological responses after the lushan earthquake our stations are in the intermediate field of the lushan earthquake where permeability variation induced by dynamic stress is often considered as the most plausible mechanism to explain hydrological changes wang and chia 2008 yang et al 2014 reported water level rose after the lushan earthquake in five wells east of the epicenter contradicting to the coseismic dilatation volumetric strain analyses of the tidal response to this earthquake in some intermediate field wells suggested permeability enhancement following the earthquake lai et al 2016 shi and wang 2016 the seismic energy density provides a convenient and physically metric to relate the hydrologic responses wang and manga 2010 seismic energy density e can be calculated empirically as a function of earthquake magnitude m and epicentral distance r log r 0 48 m 0 33 log e 1 4 wang and manga 2010 we calculated the seismic energy density for the locations table 1 and it is between 0 05 and 0 19 j m 3 for the lushan earthquake large enough to initiate permeability enhancement in the aquifer wang and manga 2010 thus the hypothesis of permeability enhancement caused by seismic waves of the lushan earthquake might be valid it should be noted that upward water flux increased at all the locations after the lushan earthquake whether downward or upward flux was dominant before the earthquake the flux changes sustained months to years furthermore the trend of the bedrock temperature time series rose after the earthquake fig 5a inconsistent with the decline in temperature if coseismic release of water from mountains occurred wang et al 2004 it is reasonable to deduce that the increased groundwater flux might come from deeper sources some studies have documented that earthquakes can enhance vertical permeability by breaching of aquitards bounding the aquifer via subvertical tension cracks or clearing clogged pore throats allowing groundwater to drain vertically liao et al 2015 mohr et al 2017 shi and wang 2016 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2004 shi and wang 2016 showed that the vertical permeability was enhanced following the lushan earthquake in two wells in the intermediate field through studying the tidal response of the water level the enhanced vertical permeability induced by the earthquake may improve the ability of deep groundwater to transmit upward in the fault zone the permeability would then recover through the healing or reclogging of fractures manga et al 2012 rojstaczer et al 1995 previous research indicated that the enhanced permeability typically recovers to the prestimulated value over a period of months to years manga et al 2012 xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the increasing upward flux after the lushan earthquake lasted four months to more than two years which might represent the recover time of the permeability in the study area 5 4 limitations there are several limitations associated with the assumptions in groundwater flux calculation measurement resolution signal processing and borehole spatial coverage firstly we assumed that groundwater fluxes were predominantly vertical within the sensors depth range actually lateral heat transfer might exist in highly heterogeneous environments however within the xianshuihe fault zone where the temperature sensors were installed the fault planes are nearly vertical papadimitriou et al 2004 yi et al 2015 fluid might be discharged mainly vertically along the fault trace lopez and smith 1995 horizontal flow will introduce a significant error only when horizontal component of flux is large in comparison to the vertical component secondly the governing equation assumes that physical and thermal properties of the rock fluid system are steady and uniform nevertheless by accounting for a range of physical parameters through uncertainty analysis of our results the estimated fluxes still demonstrate significant temporal variability in the further if direct measurement of some physical properties of the drill cores the uncertainty in flow calculations can be reduced thirdly resolution and accuracy of temperature measurements can impose a practical limitation on the accurate estimation of groundwater fluxes in particular for low flow environments shanafield et al 2011 but the resolution of the temperature sensors used in our study are as high as 0 0001 k fourthly processing temperature time series data involves filtering signals edge effects at the beginning and end of the time series would cause errors in the estimated flux hatch et al 2006 so we omitted results from the first and last years to ensure analysis of flux changes in response to the two earthquakes are unaffected additionally coarse sampling intervals may lead to erroneously identified amplitudes or phases information our sampling period is 15 min so that the annual signal could be isolated efficiently but to acquire more detailed information a higher sampling frequency may be required lastly temperature monitoring stations are spatially limited in the study area so the spatial groundwater flow pattern after the earthquakes may need more evidence to support in future studies temperature observations for more suitable wells in the area can bring us a better understanding of the groundwater movements temperature data can also be used in combination with hydraulic heads or measured fluxes to help constrain the models 6 conclusions we present new evidence for hydrological responses to two nearby large earthquakes at the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau through long term bedrock temperature time series at six locations groundwater fluxes were estimated using time varying amplitude and phase of the annual temperature oscillations at different depths which were extracted from the dynamic harmonic regression model sustained notable rise in upward flux was revealed at all the locations after the m s 7 0 lushan earthquake whereas groundwater flux changes after the m s 6 3 kangding earthquake exhibit a quadrantal pattern we used the dislocation model to test if it may explain the flux changes induced by these earthquakes results showed that groundwater flow changes are inconsistent with the coseismic static dilatational strains for the lushan earthquake but mimic the distribution of coseismic volumetric strain for the kangding earthquake in view of the epicentral distance of the locations we infer that coseismic elastic strain may be the dominant mechanism for the groundwater flux changes within two rupture fault lengths but become non dominant beyond this distance combined with previous studies we suggest that earthquake enhanced vertical permeability might improve the ability of deep groundwater to transmit upward in the intermediate field after the lushan earthquake bedrock temperature measurement provides a potential method to detect earthquake induced changes in groundwater flow and can offer additional information to identify changes in crustal strain or hydraulic properties in seismic

5160,heat as a groundwater tracer has potential application in identifying earthquake induced changes in fluid flow since convective heat transport modifies the phase and amplitude of periodic oscillations under pure heat conduction condition temporal variation of groundwater flux can thus be derived from multi depth periodic temperature signals here we present groundwater flux changes after two large earthquakes nearby determined from in situ bedrock temperature measurements in the xianshuihe fault zone at the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau five year temperature time series at six different locations are recorded by high sensitivity temperature sensors 10 4 k installed at various depths ranging from 0 to 20 m groundwater fluxes are estimated through time varying amplitudes and phases of the annual oscillations extracted from the dynamic harmonic regression technique results show different hydrological responses to these two earthquakes after the 2013 m s 7 0 lushan earthquake sustained rise in upward flux was revealed at all locations in the intermediate field contradicting to the modeled coseismic static dilatational strains however groundwater flux patterns after the 2014 m s 6 3 kangding earthquake are consistent with the coseismic volumetric strain distribution of a quadrantal pattern of this event we propose that enhanced hydraulic permeability by dynamic stress might cause the increased upward fluid flux after the lushan earthquake in the intermediate field while coseismic static volumetric strain may account for the hydrological changes after the kangding earthquake in the near field this is the first time that temperature time series are used to quantify continuous earthquake related changes in groundwater fluxes in situ temperature monitoring can provide insights into earthquake driven hydrologic responses and also offer additional information to identify temporal changes in crustal strain or hydraulic properties keywords in situ temperature measurement eastern margin of the tibetan plateau heat as a tracer hydrological response to earthquake near field fault zone 1 introduction it has been documented that earthquakes can induce various hydrological responses including changes in streamflow and spring discharge montgomery and manga 2003 muir wood and king 1993 wang and manga 2010 changes in water levels in wells ingebritsen and manga 2019 wakita 1975 and hydrochemical changes in springs li et al 2019 several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these hydrological changes in response to earthquakes 1 pore pressure changes by coseismic static elastic strain jónsson et al 2003 muir wood and king 1993 wakita 1975 2 increase or decrease in permeability caused by dynamic stresses brodsky et al 2003 rojstaczer et al 1995 shi et al 2019 3 coseismic liquefaction or consolidation of loose sediments manga 2001 wang et al 2003 as earthquake changes crustal stress and physical properties such as permeability or porosity interactions between seismological and hydrological processes provide the potential for understanding the temporal variability of strain and hydraulic properties montgomery and manga 2003 xue et al 2013 faults can act as favorable pathways for groundwater migration faulkner et al 2010 and are tectonically active therefore earthquake induced groundwater flow changes may appear more frequently in fault zones however due to difficulties of monitoring in the vicinity of the seismogenic faults many research focused on hydrological responses detectable hundreds or thousands of kilometers from earthquake epicenters brodsky et al 2003 montgomery and manga 2003 yan et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 only a few studies based on in situ measurements in the near field hosono et al 2019 jónsson et al 2003 the mechanism of hydrological alterations near the rupture zone is still poorly understood furthermore most observations are limited to single earthquake there are only few cases that systematically studied fluid flow changes in response to multiple earthquakes e g manga et al 2003 shi et al 2014 so it is still unclear whether the mechanisms would vary in space and time the xianshuihe fault is one of the world s most active faults which has experienced prominent tectonic deformation and frequently strong earthquakes allen et al 1991 zhang 2013 the fault plane is also a hydraulic conduit with many deep circulation thermal springs guo et al 2017 tang et al 2017 two large earthquakes 2013 lushan m s 7 0 earthquake and 2014 kangding m s 6 3 earthquake sequentially occurred in the xianshuihe and the nearby longmenshan fault zones few studies have reported the hydrological responses to the kangding earthquake because of sparse fluid monitoring wells in the region li et al 2019 however an in site temperature measurement network has been built since 2009 along the xianshuihe fault zone the epicentral distances of most temperature monitoring stations are within 50 km for the kangding earthquake and 150 km for the lushan earthquake boreholes were drilled in bedrocks with depths of 10 20 m for monitoring temperature changes at various depths the long term temperature series give us unique opportunities to study groundwater flux variations responding to two nearby earthquakes and explore their mechanisms actually besides monitoring stream discharge or water level groundwater flux can also be traced from temperature based approaches utilizing temperature time series or temperature depth profiles anderson 2005 bense et al 2017 fulton and brodsky 2016 kurylyk and irvine 2019 rau et al 2014 stallman 1965 taniguchi 1993 the advantage of using heat over other tracers to estimate groundwater flux is that heat is ubiquitous economical easily measured and properties such as thermal conductivity and specific heat vary much less than hydraulic properties in darcy s law saar 2011 miyakoshi et al 2020 first reported post earthquake groundwater flow changes identified through repeated temperature depth profiles by now no research has used temperature time series to quantify continuous earthquake induced groundwater flux changes temperature measured at shallow depths generally show daily or annual cyclic variations thermal diffusivities can be derived from either phase shift or amplitude damping of the periodic oscillations at two different depths seward and prieto 2018 tabbagh et al 1999 when groundwater flow occurs convective heat transport would make the amplitude and phase of the periodic variations deviate from those expected under purely conductive conditions goto et al 2005 hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 as a consequence groundwater flux can be determined through the discrepancy between thermal diffusivities estimated from the phase method and that from the amplitude method liu et al 2019 most research used diel periodic signals to trace water flow in near surface sediments constantz 2008 gordon et al 2012 mccallum et al 2012 but methods relying on diurnal oscillations are only valid where groundwater fluxes are high 2 10 7 m s and in the very shallow subsurface depth 2 m kurylyk and irvine 2019 stallman 1965 in contrast annual signals are applicable for lower groundwater flux magnitudes 1 10 8 m s and can extend to depths greater than 25 m chen et al 2019 stallman 1965 in this study we estimate groundwater flow rate changes after two nearby strong earthquakes using high resolution temperature time series recorded by a bedrock temperature monitoring network in the fault zone we identify different hydrological responses to the earthquakes in the near and intermediate fields and then test hypotheses responsible for them 2 study area there is a y shaped fault system located in the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau which consists of the xianshuihe longmenshan and anninghe fault zones fig 1 a this area has complicated tectonic deformation and numerous devastating earthquakes e g the 2008 wenchuan m s 8 0 earthquake the fault system represents the transitional zone of the bayan har sichuan yunnan and the south china blocks the 2013 lushan m s 7 0 earthquake took place at the ne trending longmenshan fault zone which has been active in the latest quaternary dominated by thrusting with dextral component densmore et al 2007 ran et al 2010 the lushan earthquake has a mostly thrust mechanism and the ruptured length is about 35 km with dominant focal depth ranging from 10 to 20 km fang et al 2013 han et al 2014 the causative fault dips to the north west the 2014 kangding m s 6 3 earthquake occurred on the nw trending xianshuihe fault zone this fault zone appears to become active due to outward growth of the tibetan plateau in about 10 ma characterized by large scale left lateral strike slip motions zhang 2013 the kangding earthquake has a strike slip mechanism with a nearly vertical causative plane striking roughly north northwest xie et al 2017 the rupture of the kangding earthquake extended along the strike direction by about 20 km yi et al 2015 the study area is mainly covered by proterozoic and triassic metamorphic rocks permian basalt triassic sedimentary rocks and magmatic rocks of the proterozoic indosinian and himalayan periods fig 1b the shallow groundwater in the fault zone is mainly bedrock fissure water mostly recharged by atmospheric precipitation fractures are extensively distributed in the sandstone marble slate and cenozoic granite representing high permeability aquifers while the less cracked proterozoic granite and mudstone strata represent medium permeability aquifers zhang et al 2018a there are strong manifestations of hydrothermal activity in this area especially the zonal distribution of a large number of hot springs near the active faults known as the eastern tibetan plateau geothermal belt tang et al 2017 the xianshuihe fault zone serves as favorable hydraulic conduits which are permeable and allow easy thermal groundwater circulation guo et al 2017 li et al 2019 river systems are in parallel with mountain chains mainly flowing southward with several minor rivers flowing eastward which probably developed along several small faults under the influence of terrain and monsoon circulation the area belongs to subtropical climate local meteorological records show that the annual temperature ranges from 14 c to 28 c with an average of 8 c mean annual precipitation is 909 mm concentrated between april and september 3 materials and methods 3 1 data a bedrock temperature measurement network was constructed along the xianshuihe fault zone during 2009 2010 fig 1 table 1 the temperature monitoring stations are 101 158 km and 19 53 km from the epicentres of the m s 7 0 lushan and m s 6 3 kangding earthquakes respectively for each measurement station a borehole was drilled down to a depth of 10 20 m with a radius of 89 mm chen et al 2019 chen et al 2016 eight temperature sensors were set into the borehole each of which is a platinum resistance temperature transmitter with a resolution of 0 0001 k pt1000 heraeus m222 20nipt10 class a made in germany four sensors were located at depths of 0 0 0 25 0 8 and 3 2 m fig s1 in the supplementary materials the other sensors were installed in bedrock at deeper depths according to drilling and installation conditions table 1 fig 2 then cement paste was filled into the borehole with a pipe set into the bottom of the borehole this step ensured the borehole free from fluid movement and the sensors thermally coupled with the surrounding bedrock finally the pipe was removed temperature data were sampled every 15 min recorded using a data acquisition system and then sent to the data center by a wireless communication mode called general packet radio service zhang et al 2018b a storage battery was placed in each borehole to supply the power of the recording system during the solidification of the cement heat was gradually released and thermal balance was reached after about one month fig s2 for this reason data selected for this research are from 1st june 2011 to 1st june 2016 to avoid records for at least the initial eight months since the filling of cement the raw data are almost continuous with only several short interruptions each lasting a couple of hours table s1 3 2 method of analysis near surface temperature time series usually demonstrate periodical variations such as changes in annual seasonal or daily cycles on this basis ground surface temperature could be assumed as a summation of periodic oscillations superimposed on an average surface temperature t 0 1 t 0 t t 0 n 1 m a n cos ω n t φ n where t is time ωn 2π τn is the angular frequency of the n order cyclic variation an φ n τn are the amplitude phase and period of the n order component using eq 1 as the boundary condition at the surface we can obtain an analytical solution to the one dimensional heat conduction equation in a homogeneous medium for a half infinite space kinoshita et al 1996 2 t z t t 0 g z n 1 m a n exp ω n 2 α z cos ω n t φ n ω n 2 α z where t is temperature z is the depth from the surface α is thermal diffusivity and g is the steady state geothermal gradient which reflects the heat flow from below eq 2 shows that the amplitude of periodic oscillation decreases exponentially with depth while the phase lag linearly increases with depth high frequency components of the temperature variation such as daily fluctuations damp fast with depth at depths greater than 2 m only 0 01 of the daily fluctuations are remained if thermal diffusivity is assumed to be 1 5 10 6 m2 s chen et al 2019 as temperature in the surface zone is very sensitive to short time changes of weather condition we only chose temperature records beyond 5 m for study at which depth the daily variation vanishes entirely fig 3 therefore the following calculation focuses on the annual periodic variation when temperature oscillations over time are measured at different depths thermal diffusivity can be calculated using the amplitude ratio or the phase lag of the annual variations at two different depths z 1 and z 2 tabbagh et al 1999 3 α a ω z 1 z 2 2 2 ln 2 a 1 a 2 4 α φ ω z 1 z 2 2 2 φ 1 φ 2 2 where a 1 a 2 φ1 and φ2 are the amplitudes and phases at depths z 1 and z 2 ω is the angular frequency of the annual wave the thermal diffusivities obtained from eqs 3 and 4 are hereinafter referred to as the amplitude method and phase method respectively if fluid movement exists as what usually happens in fault zones or groundwater aquifers the temperature distribution would follow the heat transfer equation incorporating both thermal conduction and convection processes described as eq 5 for a homogeneous medium in the 1d case stallman 1965 5 t t α 2 t z 2 c w c r u t z where u is the groundwater flux positive downward cw is the volumetric heat capacity of water 4 18 106 j m3k cr is the volumetric heat capacity of the rock fluid system which is defined as rau et al 2014 6 c r n c w 1 n c s where n is the fractional porosity c s is the volumetric heat capacity of the solids given a cosinusoidal surface temperature boundary condition the analytical solution to eq 5 is 7 t z t t 0 g z a 0 exp d m z cos ω t φ 0 d n z where a 0 and φ0 are the amplitude and phase of the cosinusoidal surface temperature d ω 2 α m d ω γ 1 2 γ 2 γ 4 4 ω 4 d 4 1 2 1 2 n 2 ω d γ 2 γ 4 4 ω 4 d 4 1 2 1 2 γ c w c r u gao et al 2008 eq 7 shows that upward groundwater flow accelerates the damping of temperature variations whereas downward groundwater flow decreases the damping nevertheless the groundwater flow always reduces the phase lag regardless of flow direction fig 4 as a consequence the impact of water flow on phase and amplitude would make the estimated thermal diffusivities from eqs 3 and 4 inconsistent with those under pure heat conduction when upward groundwater flow exists the thermal diffusivity determined with a phase method α φ is larger than that obtained with an amplitude method αa and vice versa liu et al 2019 thus the discrepancy between α φ and αa provides the opportunity to determine water flow derection then the groundwater flux can be further yielded from relationship between α φ and αa liu et al 2019 8 u c r 2 ω α φ c w 2 α a α φ α a 1 as the amplitudes and phases of the annual oscillation may vary over time the thermal diffusivities determined with the phase and amplitude methods would also change over time we can then obtain a temporal variation of the groundwater flux thus a non stationary time series analysis is necessary to extract the time varying amplitude and phase of the cyclical signal time series analysis was performed using dynamic harmonic regression dhr young et al 1999 which is a special case of the unobserved components model formulated with a stochastic state space setting this model is commonly used in economic forecasting pedregal and trapero 2007 but also useful for adaptive seasonal adjustment signal extraction and backcasting the dhr model can be considered as a straightforward extension of the constant parameter harmonic regression fourier series or trigonometric model in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonic components can vary as a result of estimated time variable trigonometric parameters the observed time series yt can be decomposed into the trend seasonal and irregular components through the dhr model fig 5 expressed by 9 y t t t s t e t where tt is a long term trend or low frequency component st is a seasonal component in this case describing the annual seasonality represented by cosinusoidal patterns with time varying parameters and et is an irregular component i e uncorrelated gaussian white noise the seasonal component is recursively estimated along with the trend using a combination of a kalman filter and a fixed interval smoothing algorithms in optimizing the estimation of parameters dhr employs a cost function minimising the difference between the logarithmic pseudo spectrum of the model and the logarithmic autoregressive spectrum of the time series this cost function yields more excellent convergence and efficient computation when compared with the alternative maximum likelihood cost function the dhr model is available in the captain toolbox taylor et al 2007 the cosinusoidal pattern isolated by dhr is a real component of the raw data rather than an approximation and has greater accuracy than that acquired with a simple band pass filter for a more detailed description of the dhr model see young et al 1999 time series from 1st june 2011 to 1st june 2016 at various depths of the locations were selected for analysis except the kdd station whose data have been stopped since 25th april 2014 as the sampling period of 15 min generates more than thirty thousand samples per annual cycle spurious filtration artifacts may appear associated with oversampling therefore we did low pass filtering on the data and resampled them to a lower sampling period of three days to reduce the filtering problems the new sampling period is quite small compared to the period of the annual oscillation which allows dhr to isolate the annual wave efficiently from a raw time series after the temporal variations of amplitude and phase of the annual waves were determined thermal diffusivities were calculated through the amplitude method eq 3 and phase method eq 4 between pairs of depth fig s3 then vertical flow rate was determined according to eq 8 as with all digital filtering the results of dhr decomposition may be unreliable at the beginning and end of the time series for this reason we discarded the results of the first and last years to avoid the edge effects 4 results 4 1 temporal variability of groundwater flux it can be seen from the raw temperature records that the annual signal is the dominant signal within the range of depths observed fig 6 dhr was employed to each temperature time series to isolate the cosinusoidal components of the annual wave from the raw data obvious amplitude attenuation and phase delay of the annual oscillation with depth are demonstrated in fig 7 then with time varying amplitudes and phases at various paired depths eqs 3 4 and 8 were solved for each location to determine the groundwater flux temperatures recorded by sensors that were installed quite close to each other were not used in flux calculation because such small depth difference may result in large errors for determining thermal diffusivity between the depth pair since measurements of the physical properties of the rock fluid system were not available for the fractured drill core it is necessary to account for the uncertainty in flow rate estimates given the uncertainty in physical parameters main parameter concerning the computed results is the volumetric heat capacity of the rock fluid system which is determined by the volumetric thermal capacity of matrix and porosity eq 6 the volumetric thermal capacities of the solids were derived from the value of nonporous rocks measured by waples and waples 2004 table 2 bedrocks of the study area are igneous metamorphic and triassic sedimentary rocks with low porosity for instance critical porosity for cracked igneous rocks is only 5 nur et al 1998 hence a mean porosity of 4 was used in the calculation an uncertainty analysis for the properties was conducted in the next section 4 2 uncertainty analysis computed groundwater fluxes are shown in fig 8 groundwater near the kdv and kds stations were upward flowing as a whole while upward and downward flow alternately occurred at the other stations after the m s 7 0 lushan earthquake a remarkable rise in upward flux was revealed at all the locations the flux reached a peak and then began to decrease the whole process of groundwater flow anomaly lasted four months to more than two years in contrast the groundwater flux series after the m s 6 3 kangding earthquake show various responses at different locations upward flow rates distinctly increased after the earthquake at the kds station and slightly increased at the dfz station while a marked decrease in flow rate occurred at the xwv station nevertheless it seemed that groundwater fluxes had little changes after the kangding earthquake at the kdv and dfl stations the groundwater flow anomalies recovered quicker after the kangding earthquake than that after the lushan earthquake on the whole 4 2 uncertainty analysis due to lack of direct information for the physical property of the fractured rocks an uncertainty analysis was employed to evaluate to what extent the error would be caused by parameter changes we estimated the influence of volumetric thermal capacity and porosity on the flux calculation values for each parameter were varied assuming normal distributions with mean and standard deviation as given in table 2 standard deviations were assumed to be 1 for the porosity and 10 of the mean value for the volumetric thermal capacity of the matrix then a monte carlo analysis of flux calculation was carried out for 4096 sets of parameters note that the uncertainty in properties has been exaggerated and that measurement of the properties would constrain the uncertainty in flux estimation substantially despite the exaggerated parameter ranges the estimated fluxes fall within a relatively narrow range and clear changes in flux after the earthquakes are shown in fig 9 relatively large uncertainties occur at high flow rates as expected when advection becomes important for heat transport we have assumed constant physical property of rocks over time although by accounting for a range of physical properties the results still illustrate significant contrast in groundwater flux after the earthquakes uncertainty in flux estimates may also result from the dhr processes adequate samplings in one period of annual cycle makes the extraction of the annual oscillation effective from the raw data errors of the fit by the dhr model to the raw series are typically on the order of 10 5 which are rather small compared to the other components as expected and desirable besides the irregular components are zero mean uncorrelated sequences according with the white noise fig 5c which ensures the validity of the time series analysis 5 discussion the effect from fluid movement in the borehole was avoided in our temperature measurement system as a whole this is because the borehole was completely filled with cement to thermally couple sensors with the surrounding bedrock even if small volume of water was sealed in the borehole the fluid advection along the borehole wall would display an exponential feature of thermal diffusion which is generated by the additional heat due to water level changes involved with stress variations chen et al 2019 the exponential temperature changes due to sealed water are of low amplitude and quickly attenuated that exists only within several days therefore the estimated fluxes may represent groundwater flow in the surrounding formations of the boreholes groundwater flux changes may result from non seismic processes such as rainfall or seismic processes such as co seismic static strain wakita 1975 permeability enhancement rojstaczer et al 1995 or consolidation of saturated sediments manga 2001 because our temperature sensors were installed in bedrock not in loose sediments we discard consolidation as a dominant process here we discuss other mechanisms for flow rate changes 5 1 did groundwater flux respond to changes in surface condition surface temperature volume of rainfall and groundwater saturation of the area might affect the evolution of the temperature measured by sensors we evaluated how much influence these factors would have on the derived groundwater flux groundwater level of the study area varied between 0 38 m and 3 11 m with an average of 1 78 m during 2012 2014 fig 10 a zhu et al 2017 all the temperature data used in this study were recorded by sensors at depth of at least 5 9 m which were below the groundwater table during the period of observation and could be considered in the saturated zone thus groundwater saturation might have little impact on the estimated groundwater flux then correlation with rainfall was analyzed by calculating the correlation coefficient between the groundwater flux and average precipitation for the preceded 7 days as a whole groundwater flux has a weak correlation with the rainfall table 3 althrough their correlation might be enhanced after some heavy precipitation events we also calculated the correlation coefficients for the earthquakes using time series of 45 days before and after the earthquakes low correlations were showed between the fluid flow rate changes and rainfall at the time of both earthquakes table 3 in fact there was no precipitation within 6 days before the 2013 lushan earthquake and 8 days before the 2014 kangding earthquake lastly we analyzed to what extent the surface temperature may affect temperature records at depth high frequency temperature variations usually decay quickly with depth variations of amplitude and phase of the surface annual periodic oscillation were extracted through the dhr model fig 10d temperatures at depth of 6 16 m where the sensors located would be delayed 78 207 days from the surface when thermal diffusivity is assumed to be 2 10 6 m2 s taking the delay time into account amplitude changes within the sensor spacing 1 5 2 0 m generated by surface annual wave were less than 1 10 3 at the time of both earthquakes and the phase changes were only about 3 10 4 and 6 10 5 for the lushan and kangding earthquakes respectively therefore temperature changes after the earthquakes may not be due to surface temperature variations 5 2 did groundwater flux respond to static strain in most igneous metamorphic and well lithified sediments mobile water is held and transported in fractures and variations in stresses under compressive stress cracks close and water is expelled whereas tensional stress facilitates cracks open and water is drawn in muir wood and king 1993 we used the dislocation model okada 1992 to test if it would explain the groundwater flux changes in the study area coseismic static volume strain changes of the two earthquakes were modeled using coulomb 3 3 lin and stein 2004 toda et al 2005 focal mechanisms are provided by global cmt https www globalcmt org and other model parameters referred to fang et al 2013 yi et al 2015 and xie et al 2017 the estimated static volumetric strains are shown in fig 11 for the m s 7 0 lushan earthquake all stations are located in the coseismic dilational zone fig 11a if flux changes were caused by static strain decrease in upward flux would be expected however upward fluxes were all enhanced after the earthquake at these stations the epicentral distance of the stations ranges from three to four ruptured fault lengths of the lushan earthquake table 1 which corresponds to the intermediate field wang and manga 2010 previous studies also showed that water level changes after this earthquake of most wells in the intermediate field are not consistent with the static strain distribution shi et al 2014 yang et al 2014 this indicates that the static strain hypothesis might not be the dominant mechanism causing the water flux changes after the lushan earthquake for the m s 6 3 kangding earthquake the strike slip focal mechanism delineates the affected area into quadrants of static compression negative volume strain and dilatation positive volume strain fig 11b the spatial distribution of surface deformation coincides with results from the insar observations jiang et al 2015 the xwv station is located in the dilatational zone of coseismic strains with significant increase in downward flow rate after the earthquake the kds station is located in the compressional quadrant and enhanced upward flux was revealed after the earthquake the dfz station lies near the seismogenic fault and the coseismic elastic strain would generally be small fig 11b although the uncertainty in the strike of the focal mechanism might have some impacts on the calculated coseismic volumetric strain the water flux of the dfz station changed slightly after the earthquake the kdv and dfl stations are near the boundary between dilatational and compressional regimes and the groundwater flow rates had no obvious changes after the earthquake this suggests a possible correlation between the flux changes and co seismic strain the epicentral distances of these stations are only 19 to 53 km table 1 most of which are within two rupture fault lengths thus regional groundwater flow responses for the earthquake might be as a result of coseismic elastic strain in comparison of the two nearby earthquakes coseismic volumetric strain might be the dominant reason for earthquake induced groundwater flow changes within two rupture fault lengths but become non dominant beyond this distance 5 3 did groundwater flux respond to permeability variation from the discussion above coseismic static strain might be discarded as a primary mechanism for the hydrological responses after the lushan earthquake our stations are in the intermediate field of the lushan earthquake where permeability variation induced by dynamic stress is often considered as the most plausible mechanism to explain hydrological changes wang and chia 2008 yang et al 2014 reported water level rose after the lushan earthquake in five wells east of the epicenter contradicting to the coseismic dilatation volumetric strain analyses of the tidal response to this earthquake in some intermediate field wells suggested permeability enhancement following the earthquake lai et al 2016 shi and wang 2016 the seismic energy density provides a convenient and physically metric to relate the hydrologic responses wang and manga 2010 seismic energy density e can be calculated empirically as a function of earthquake magnitude m and epicentral distance r log r 0 48 m 0 33 log e 1 4 wang and manga 2010 we calculated the seismic energy density for the locations table 1 and it is between 0 05 and 0 19 j m 3 for the lushan earthquake large enough to initiate permeability enhancement in the aquifer wang and manga 2010 thus the hypothesis of permeability enhancement caused by seismic waves of the lushan earthquake might be valid it should be noted that upward water flux increased at all the locations after the lushan earthquake whether downward or upward flux was dominant before the earthquake the flux changes sustained months to years furthermore the trend of the bedrock temperature time series rose after the earthquake fig 5a inconsistent with the decline in temperature if coseismic release of water from mountains occurred wang et al 2004 it is reasonable to deduce that the increased groundwater flux might come from deeper sources some studies have documented that earthquakes can enhance vertical permeability by breaching of aquitards bounding the aquifer via subvertical tension cracks or clearing clogged pore throats allowing groundwater to drain vertically liao et al 2015 mohr et al 2017 shi and wang 2016 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2004 shi and wang 2016 showed that the vertical permeability was enhanced following the lushan earthquake in two wells in the intermediate field through studying the tidal response of the water level the enhanced vertical permeability induced by the earthquake may improve the ability of deep groundwater to transmit upward in the fault zone the permeability would then recover through the healing or reclogging of fractures manga et al 2012 rojstaczer et al 1995 previous research indicated that the enhanced permeability typically recovers to the prestimulated value over a period of months to years manga et al 2012 xue et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 the increasing upward flux after the lushan earthquake lasted four months to more than two years which might represent the recover time of the permeability in the study area 5 4 limitations there are several limitations associated with the assumptions in groundwater flux calculation measurement resolution signal processing and borehole spatial coverage firstly we assumed that groundwater fluxes were predominantly vertical within the sensors depth range actually lateral heat transfer might exist in highly heterogeneous environments however within the xianshuihe fault zone where the temperature sensors were installed the fault planes are nearly vertical papadimitriou et al 2004 yi et al 2015 fluid might be discharged mainly vertically along the fault trace lopez and smith 1995 horizontal flow will introduce a significant error only when horizontal component of flux is large in comparison to the vertical component secondly the governing equation assumes that physical and thermal properties of the rock fluid system are steady and uniform nevertheless by accounting for a range of physical parameters through uncertainty analysis of our results the estimated fluxes still demonstrate significant temporal variability in the further if direct measurement of some physical properties of the drill cores the uncertainty in flow calculations can be reduced thirdly resolution and accuracy of temperature measurements can impose a practical limitation on the accurate estimation of groundwater fluxes in particular for low flow environments shanafield et al 2011 but the resolution of the temperature sensors used in our study are as high as 0 0001 k fourthly processing temperature time series data involves filtering signals edge effects at the beginning and end of the time series would cause errors in the estimated flux hatch et al 2006 so we omitted results from the first and last years to ensure analysis of flux changes in response to the two earthquakes are unaffected additionally coarse sampling intervals may lead to erroneously identified amplitudes or phases information our sampling period is 15 min so that the annual signal could be isolated efficiently but to acquire more detailed information a higher sampling frequency may be required lastly temperature monitoring stations are spatially limited in the study area so the spatial groundwater flow pattern after the earthquakes may need more evidence to support in future studies temperature observations for more suitable wells in the area can bring us a better understanding of the groundwater movements temperature data can also be used in combination with hydraulic heads or measured fluxes to help constrain the models 6 conclusions we present new evidence for hydrological responses to two nearby large earthquakes at the eastern margin of the tibetan plateau through long term bedrock temperature time series at six locations groundwater fluxes were estimated using time varying amplitude and phase of the annual temperature oscillations at different depths which were extracted from the dynamic harmonic regression model sustained notable rise in upward flux was revealed at all the locations after the m s 7 0 lushan earthquake whereas groundwater flux changes after the m s 6 3 kangding earthquake exhibit a quadrantal pattern we used the dislocation model to test if it may explain the flux changes induced by these earthquakes results showed that groundwater flow changes are inconsistent with the coseismic static dilatational strains for the lushan earthquake but mimic the distribution of coseismic volumetric strain for the kangding earthquake in view of the epicentral distance of the locations we infer that coseismic elastic strain may be the dominant mechanism for the groundwater flux changes within two rupture fault lengths but become non dominant beyond this distance combined with previous studies we suggest that earthquake enhanced vertical permeability might improve the ability of deep groundwater to transmit upward in the intermediate field after the lushan earthquake bedrock temperature measurement provides a potential method to detect earthquake induced changes in groundwater flow and can offer additional information to identify changes in crustal strain or hydraulic properties in seismic

5161,experiments are performed on channels with emergent one line porous canopy patches distributed along the channel sidewalls in which flow dynamics and turbulent structures are analyzed the evolution of the transverse distribution of the mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress profiles in specific transverse sections with downstream distance suggests that a fully equilibrated zone is reached beyond an adjustment distance and the adjustment distance needed for vegetation with high solid volume fractions is short the flow field can be divided into three main different regions based on the transverse distribution of the mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress in the equilibrium zone a boundary affected region an analog mixing layer and a uniform region in a non vegetated area the analog mixing layer exhibits a two layer structure governed by local coherent vortices the dominant frequencies of the vortices at the interface are determined through spectral analysis and proven to correspond to a patch scale the development of the shear layer the analysis of the frequencies and scales of the vortices and the experiment on flow visualization indicate that von karman vortices continue to form downstream despite the interference of the sidewall and the special one line distribution pattern of patches quadrant analysis is adopted to illustrate the lateral momentum exchange caused by different motions results show that ejections and sweeps are the main contributions to reynolds stress in the analog mixing layer different signs of reynolds stress in the boundary affected region and the analog mixing layer can also be explained through quadrant analysis keywords emergent canopy porous patch one line distribution flow dynamics turbulence structures 1 introduction aquatic vegetation is of great physical and ecological importance for aquatic systems by modifying flow structure influencing sediment deposition and re suspension affecting bed morphology improving water quality and providing food oxygen and habitats to aquatic organisms szabo meszaros et al 2018 sonnenwald et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the modified flow and sediment deposition patterns subsequently affect the growth and distribution of vegetation tsujimoto 1999 obtaining insights into vegetation flow sediment interactions is crucial for river management and ecological river restoration nikora et al 2008 numerous efforts have been devoted to studying vegetation hydrodynamics and most of them have mainly focused on vegetation with continuous uniform horizontal distribution white and nepf 2007 2008 ghisalberti and nepf 2009 chen et al 2010 ben meftah et al 2014 liu et al 2020 however finite patches of vegetation can be found in natural and artificial landscape in particular the distribution of macrophytes is highly patchy in most streams sand jensen and madsen 1992 previous studies investigated a single vegetation patch and showed that the approaching flow is diverted laterally and only a small amount of flow can bleed through porous patches into the downstream wake follett and nepf 2012 chen et al 2012 the enhanced flow around patches inhibit local sediment deposition and accelerate channel erosion which may potentially limit the lateral expansion of patches bouma et al 2007 balke et al 2012 by contrast the reduced velocity in the wake region behind patches can promote local deposition and encourage streamwise vegetation growth tsujimoto 1999 gurnell et al 2012 kim et al 2018 therefore vegetation distributed along the banks is a common feature of natural rivers and artificial ecological channels tooth and nanson 2000 observed that a channel obstructed with dense and chaotic shrubs can evolve into a well organized system wherein vegetation occurs along elongated ridges when overbank flow occurs during flood events riparian bushes may act as an array of emergent vegetation at the interface between the main channel and floodplain mulahasan and stoesser 2017 the impacts of riparian vegetation on both hydraulic and ecological processes are increasingly recognized as an integral component of river management shiono et al 2012 and increasing efforts have been devoted into ecological river restoration by utilizing real vegetation one line of porous canopy patches like reeds fig 1 can serve for several purposes such as bank stabilization habitat creation and landscaping improvement nevertheless the detailed analyses of the flow dynamics and turbulence structures of in line porous canopy patches are scarce these hydraulic effects are of great importance as they are directly related to the bank stability sediment erosion deposition nutrient transport and pollutant dispersion sonnenwald et al 2017 2019 truong and uijttewaal 2019 and may subsequently affect the distribution of plants and the river patterns on longer time scales for effective channel management and river restoration projects design a better understanding of the impact of such riparian vegetation arrangements on the flow structures and transverse momentum exchange is necessary in this study we observed the development of flow from the inlet to the downstream in an open rectangular channel with one line emergent porous patches distributed along channel sidewall this work mainly aimed to investigate the development of the transverse distribution of the mean flow and turbulence structures with different densities of patches in the flume and to identify the adjustment distance needed from the leading edge of the vegetation patch to the equilibrium zone in this zone the mean streamwise velocity gradients at specific transverse sections in the longitudinal direction were small we then observed the coherent vortices at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas determined the frequencies and scales of the vortices and obtained insights into the lateral momentum exchange with conventional spectral and quadrant analyses the experimental results presented in this work can provide a basis for modeling such arrangements in practical application 2 review of flow with partially covered emergent vegetation riparian and aquatic vegetation can exist in various forms previous studies that considered channel flow with partially covered vegetation can be mainly divided into two types based on the vegetation distribution pattern one pattern is continuous vegetation distribution which was studied by numerous researchers white and nepf 2007 investigated the flow properties in a partially vegetated channel with a porous emergent layer they found that the shear layer at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated domains possesses a two layer structure it consists of an inner layer with a width that is determined with the array resistance and an outer layer that resembles a boundary layer and with a thickness that is set by bottom friction and water depth the formation of coherent vortices at this interface has been observed nezu and sanjou 2009 white and nepf 2008 caroppi et al 2019 as a result of the discontinuity of the vegetation resistance at the interface kelvin helmholtz vortices can be generated by large local velocity gradients and grow with the downstream distance until they become fully developed and reach the equilibrium zone ben meftah et al 2014 velocity gradients at the interface increase as vegetation densities increase a uniform region wherein the local velocity is nearly independent of vegetation density can be observed in the outer non vegetated area white and nepf 2008 various theoretical models have been developed to predict the profiles of velocities shear stresses turbulence parameters and momentum exchange in a continuous distributed vegetation channel white and nepf 2008 ben meftah and mossa 2013 meftah et al 2014 truong and uijttewaal 2019 but each model has its own limitations and cannot be broadly applied under different conditions another pattern is vegetation distributed in discontinuous patches shown in fig 1 experimental and numerical studies initially focused on single vegetation patch to understand the flow characteristics with different patch distribution patterns these studies focused on the flow past finite porous patches that consist of arrays of cylinders and revealed that the flow structure behind a porous cylinder patch differs significantly from that behind a solid cylinder takemura and tanaka 2007 studied the flow around a group of cylinders and observed two types of flow structures a primitive cylinder scale of the karman vortex street behind single cylinders and a patch scale of the karman vortex street in the downstream of the patch nicolle and eames 2011 performed a numerical study and found that the region needed for the formation of the von karman vortex street after a porous circular patch which is called the steady wake region varies with different patch porosities to predict the length of the steady wake and the velocity in this region zong and nepf 2012 provided a theoretical model based on a series of experiments that considered different patch sizes and patch porosities as the patch porosity increases the length of the steady wake increases whereas the downstream vortex street weakens moreover chen et al 2012 developed a predictive model to estimate the length of the steady wake and the distance from a patch to the second longitudinal turbulence peak and to predict the exiting velocity at the trailing edge of a porous patch insights into the velocity and turbulence levels within a patch can be obtained from this model chang et al 2017 also investigated the changes in wake structure and secondary flow inside and behind a porous patch and in drag force by applying eddy resolving simulations with different geometrical porous patches in contrast to finite emergent patches the wake behind a submerged circular patch is three dimensional and vortex structures can be generated in horizontal and vertical planes liu et al 2018 interactions between patches have also been investigated vandenbruwaene et al 2011 conducted a large scale flume experiment with spartina anglica patches to quantify the effects of patch diameter d and interpatch distance s on the flow distribution adjacent to and in between a pair of vegetation patches they estimated the threshold values d s of patch interactions meire et al 2014 investigated the flow and deposition properties in the downstream wake of a pair of patches under the influence of different patch sizes patch densities and interpatch distances a wake region of reduced velocity forms immediately behind each individual patch in a manner similar to that with a single patch but it is also a secondary region where a minimum velocity occurs at the centerline between the patches and forms further downstream enhanced deposition in this secondary region might promote a merger of the two patches de lima et al 2015 studied the influence of lateral and longitudinal distances between patches on the wake region ghani et al 2019 conducted a numerical experiment to investigate turbulent characteristics around several circular and staggered patches and observed the significant effect of neighboring and staggered patches on the flow some researchers further explored the growth and evolution of vegetation patches in a channel based on interactions between patches kondziolka and nepf 2014 yamasaki et al 2019 previous studies considered the effects of an array of the emergent impermeable vegetation distributed in one line in channels sun and shiono 2009 and terrier 2010 investigated the flow structures of emergent one line cylinders along floodplain edges in compound channels and found that velocity discharge and boundary shear stress in this case are considerably reduced compared with those in the case without vegetation shiono et al 2012 developed a new analytical solution based on the method of shiono and knight 1991 to predict the transverse distribution of velocity and the boundary shear stress in a rectangular channel with an array of cylinders mulahasan and stoesser 2017 conducted a series of experiments on uniform flow through an array of emergent rods and calculated drag coefficients via a momentum balance they showed that different scales of rods affect flow resistance and the influence of the stem reynolds number on the drag coefficient of in line rods is limited shan et al 2019 investigated the drag forces and velocity for aligned and random tree arrangement and demonstrated that the forest average drag coefficient is lower for aligned forests 3 experimental setup and conditions experiments were conducted in a rectangular flow facility that was 20 m long 0 6 m wide b and 0 5 m deep with a bed slope of 1 a steady flow discharge q 8 5 l s was provided by a recirculating pump and the flow depth h was modified with an adjustable tailgate as shown in fig 2 a flume was filled with one line circular patches of emergent canopy along the channel sidewall and the patches consist of wooden cylinders diameter d 5 mm height h 20 cm placed staggered in perforated pvc boards the diameter of the circular patch was 10 cm d and the first patch was placed 7 m from the flume entrance the net distance between two nearby in line circular patches δl was 0 35 m and the lateral net distance between the patch and the nearby sidewall δs was 0 05 m the density of the vegetation patch was described with n the number of cylinders per unit surface cm 2 a nd the frontal area exposed to the flow per unit volume cm 1 and ф πad 4 the solid volume fractions tests were conducted with patches of two densities of a 0 44 cm 1 and a 0 13 cm 1 corresponding to solid volume fractions of ф 0 17 and ф 0 05 respectively the coordinate system was defined as follows streamwise transverse and vertical coordinate and corresponding instantaneous velocity were x y z and u v w respectively with x 0 at the leading edge of the first circular patch y 0 at the sidewall nearby the vegetation domain and z 0 at the flume bed the velocity field was measured by using a 3d side looking acoustic doppler velocity meter with a recording rate of 50 hz and the sampling period was 160 s which was long enough to obtain the converged first and second order statistics each measurement point had 8000 samples given that the velocity at the mid depth is a good representation of the depth averaged velocity for emergent vegetation white and nepf 2007 kim et al 2018 lateral transects were set at mid depth thirty eight measurement points were set at the mid depth per transect to comprehensively obtain the velocity data set in each measuring line the horizontal distance between two nearby measuring points ranged from 0 5 cm to 2 cm the acquired time series of the velocity were filtered with matlab and samples with a low signal to noise ratio snr 15 or poor correlation coefficients corr 70 were removed mclelland and nicholas 2000 the remaining samples over the recording period were averaged to remove turbulent fluctuations and denoted as u v w for the x y z directions the fluctuating components were denoted as u v w and the root mean square of the fluctuating components u rms u 2 and v rms v 2 were used to evaluate the intensity of turbulent fluctuations the experimental arrangements and flow parameters are given in table 1 where u 0 is the mean channel velocity u0 q bh re0 u0h ν ν is the water kinematic viscosity is the inlet reynolds number fr0 u0 gh 0 5 is the inlet froude number and re2 u2h ν and fr2 u2 gh 0 5 are the reynolds number and the froude number in the uniform region in the non vegetated equilibrium zone respectively 4 experimental results and discussions 4 1 downstream developments we define the middlemost cross sections between two nearby vegetation patches as the specific transverse sections to investigate flow structure the lateral profiles of the mean streamwise velocity u at the specific transverse sections along the longitudinal direction are shown in fig 3 for both cases and our result clearly shows that velocity decreases within the vegetated area and increases in the non vegetated area this finding is similar to that in other partially vegetated channels white and nepf 2008 ben meftah et al 2014 huai et al 2019 with downstream distance the velocity in the uniform region in the non vegetated area defined in section 4 2 accelerates whereas the velocity in the narrow channel between the vegetation and sidewall decelerates we first consider the case of ф 0 17 as illustrated the mean velocity in the vegetated area increases from the first to the third vegetation patches and then decreases after the fifth vegetation patch the transverse profiles at different longitudinal positions almost fall into one curved line this pattern indicates that an equilibrium velocity profile tends to be obtained at x 20 75d for the case of ф 0 05 the evolution of the mean streamwise velocity appears slightly different from the dense vegetation case that is velocity decreases in the vegetated area with the downstream distance the equilibrium state of the velocity profile is obtained after the seventh patch at x 29 75d for ф 0 05 after the first patch velocity in the vegetated area for ф 0 17 is much lower than that in the case of ф 0 05 the velocity around the patch is larger because a stronger lateral diverging flow occurs in the dense vegetation case when the flow first encounters the obstruction the lateral distribution of the reynolds stress at the specific transverse sections is shown in fig 4 in each specific transverse section the presence of two peaks one was positive and the other was negative around the outmost edge of the vegetation patch indicates strong local turbulence for ф 0 17 along the longitudinal direction the net reynolds stress in the region of y 10 cm reaches its maximum between the second and third vegetation patches and then decreases downstream and stabilizes to an equilibrium after the fifth patch whereas the net reynolds stress in the region of y 10 cm keeps to increase within the adjustment distance the net reynolds stress over the whole lateral cross section keeps an increasing trend at ф 0 05 with the downstream distance before it reaches the equilibrium zone also presents a slightly different evolution rule compared with that of the dense vegetation case the net reynolds stress in the dense vegetation case is large the development of the lateral distribution of the mean streamwise velocity in specific transverse sections is presented in fig 5 in this figure a flow adjustment at the beginning of the channel and an almost equilibrium zone u x 0 downstream can be observed the longitudinal distance from the inlet of the vegetation patch x 0 to the equilibrium zone called the adjustment distance is denoted as xeq when ф 0 17 the measured adjustment length xeq is 20 75d the adjustment distance needed for ф 0 05 is long xeq 29 75d notably the evolution of the lateral distribution of the velocity in specific transverse sections is similar to the development of the mixing layer with downstream distance thus we define this layer as the analog mixing layer through the analysis presented in later sections we know that the analog mixing layer also consists of two parts the inner layer and the outer layer the development of the outer analog layer is depicted in fig 5 with the dashed curve line and the thickness of the outer layer in the equilibrium zone is labeled as δ 2 and is further discussed later on the development of the lateral distribution of turbulence kinetic energy ek is shown in fig 6 and ek is determined as follows 1 e k 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 where overbar indicates a time average for both cases fig 6 at the beginning of the adjustment distance two peaks of ek occur at the lateral location of y 5 cm and y 20 cm and are asymmetric with the central axis of the patch as a result of the influence of the nearby sidewall with the downstream distance ek increases and only one peak is found around the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm after the equilibrium zone is reached on the basis of previous studies we observed that the shear layers at the two steady wake edges grow and merge downstream for a single finite porous patch with a solid volume fraction 0 04 ф 0 04 and in the absence of the effect of the sidewall thus a patch scale von karman vortex street can be observed zong and nepf 2012 in our experiment the growth of the shear layer at y 15 cm can be inferred from the evolution profiles of ek as the peak widens until the equilibrium zone is reached the development of the shear layer at the other side of the patch y 5 cm is not so obvious in addition the corresponding patch scale vortex can be observed in the shear layer through flow visualization fig 7 and the coherent vortices grow continuously with the downstream distance this result suggests that the one line distribution of patches with the net distance of δl 0 35 m between nearby patches and the interference of the sidewall δs 0 05 m cannot destroy the downstream formation of von karman vortices furthermore the mean streamwise velocity at the centerline increases between the first and third patch for the case of ф 0 17 fig 3a possibly because the enhancement of the downstream ek by the vortices when ф 0 05 ek is smaller than that of the dense vegetation suggesting weak turbulence the ratio of streamwise velocity turbulent fluctuations to the mean streamwise velocity urms u is shown in fig 8 a from this figure we can see that urms u is large in vegetated areas especially in the densely vegetated area this characteristic indicates that the fluctuations generated by vortices are strong and can cause flow reversion white and nepf 2007 reverse flow can be observed in fig 9 the horizontal flow field from the inlet to the equilibrium zone is depicted some velocity vectors in the vegetated area are opposite to the flow direction in the flume and can be confirmed through the vortices shown in the flow visualization fig 7 however the small values of u v u rms v rms in the vegetated areas for both cases suggest that the fluctuations have a low local momentum transport efficiency by contrast a strong momentum transport induced by vortices can be inferred from the maximum value of u v u rms v rms outside the interface notably the results presented here follow the same rule as the results of the experiment conducted by white and nepf 2007 who investigated the channel flow with partially continuous obstructed arrays of cylinders 4 2 equilibrium velocity and reynolds stress the equilibrium status of the mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress in specific transverse sections for different vegetation densities are shown in fig 10 the flow field can be divided into three main different regions in accordance with the lateral distribution of velocity and reynolds stress and each region is mainly controlled by different physical parameters and dominated by different flow motions the analog mixing layer i ii is governed by local coherent vortices the uniform region in the non vegetated area iii is controlled mainly by bottom friction the boundary affected region iv where the shear layer cannot be fully developed similar to the other side as a result of the interference of the nearby sidewall the determination of the analog mixing layer should be clearly illustrated in reference to a method used to determine the inner edge of a shear layer behind a single porous circular patch developed by zong and nepf 2012 the transverse distribution of reynolds stress between two nearby vegetation patches in the equilibrium zone was used to determine the inner mixing layer δ 1 fig 11 illustrates the transverse distribution of reynolds stress between the fifth and sixth patches for the case of ф 0 17 with the downstream distance the region of the positive reynolds stress in the vegetated area corresponds to the evolution of the shear layer therefore we define the width of the inner analog mixing layer δ 1 as the distance from the left edge streamwise direction y 15 cm of the vegetation patch to the point where reynolds stress reaches zero in the vegetated area notably for each lateral profile of reynolds stress in the specific transverse section fig 4 the special point of u v 0 does not stabilize at y 10 cm until the equilibrium region is reached thus in the equilibrium zone for the specific transverse sections x a 1 75 d a 1 4 5 n 1 where n depends on the order of the front patch in sequence and δ 1 can be considered as the distance from the left edge of the patch to the centerline of the patch fig 10a the width of the outer analog mixing layer in the non vegetated area δ 2 is determined as the distance from the position where the mean streamwise velocity is 5 lower than that in the uniform region in the non vegetated area u 95 u 2 5 u 2 to the left edge of the vegetation patch this method is more consistent and precise than other methods for defining the width of the mixing layer truong and uijttewaal 2019 in the equilibrium zone the streamwise velocity at the centerline of the patch u 1 in the case of dense vegetation is smaller than that in the case of sparse vegetation whereas the velocity in the uniform region within the non vegetated area u 2 appears to be independent of vegetation density fig 10a this result is consistent with the result of a study on a single porous vegetation patch showing that u 1 u 2 decreases as the solid volume fraction increases zong and nepf 2012 in our study the widths of the analog mixing layer for both cases are almost the same suggesting the absence of a large difference in the length scales of the coherent structures caused by the two different vegetation densities in this work in fig 10c the reynolds stresses in the case of dense vegetation are larger than those in the sparse vegetation case in the analog mixing layer this finding suggests that the increasing drag force induced by dense vegetation can reduce the local velocity thereby increasing the velocity gradient around the interface more significantly and resulting in a more momentum exchange furthermore the velocity gradient du dy in both cases reaches their maximum value at y 15 cm inflection point which is exactly the point at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas and the peaks of the reynolds stress are also close to the interface this result was obtained in some previous studies which showed that turbulence attains a peak at or close to the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas nezu and onitsuka 2001 white and nepf 2007 2008 disregarding the region within 2 cm of the sidewall the reynolds stress is negative in the boundary affected region but it remains positive in the analog mixing layer the demarcation point is located exactly at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm and the reason behind this phenomenon is further discussed in section 4 3 furthermore the turbulence in region iv is small because of the boundary effect which may promote sediment deposition and accumulate additional nutrients for the local vegetation growth by contrast accelerated flow and strong turbulence in the analog mixing layer can inhibit sediment deposition thereby restricting the lateral growth of the patch bouma et al 2009 follett and nepf 2012 liu et al 2018 yamasaki et al 2019 4 3 power spectral density analysis and quadrant analysis fig 12 depicts the velocity time series at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm and at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm when ф 0 17 at the interface fig 12a the periodic fluctuations in velocity and the strong velocity correlations u v corresponding to momentum outflows ejections and momentum inflows sweeps formed by vortices can be clearly observed these motions which are in charge of the momentum exchange across the interface considerably contribute to the large reynolds stress around the interface fig 10c this result agrees with the observations in interfacial zones in other continuous uniform horizontal vegetated channels white and nepf 2007 truong and uijttewaal 2019 huai et al 2019 however at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm fig 15b the irregular variation in instantaneous u and v with the time series and the absence of obvious momentum transport motions result in a small net reynolds stress u v 0 which has also been observed deep within the array in the experiment of white and nepf 2007 the power spectral density was analyzed to explore energy distribution over the frequencies of the measured velocity fluctuations and identify the vortices dominating the energy content fig 13 illustrates the power spectral density of the streamwise fluctuation velocity u at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm in the equilibrium zone for both cases in dense vegetation the energy density peaks at the frequency of 0 07 hz and the dominant frequency in the case of sparse vegetation is f 0 11 hz notably the decreasing rate of the energy density for both cases follows a slope of 5 3 suggesting the existence of a large inertial subrange wherein turbulence is isotropic different regions in circular cylinder flow were summarized by morkovin 1964 who found a periodic flow that has a constant frequency and is independent of the reynolds number over a wide range of a subcritical reynolds number 150 re 105 or 300 re 1 3 105 this dimensionless frequency is called the strouhal number st which corresponds to the vortex shedding frequency when a single narrow peak exists in the power spectral density roshko 1961 schewe 1983 st 0 21 in the subcritical region morkovin 1964 schlichting and gersten 2017 st is defined as 2 st f l u where f is the vortex shedding frequency which is the peak frequency in the energy density l is the characteristic length and u is the characteristic flow velocity the velocity approaching an obstacle is used st has been broadly used in many studies to demonstrate the relationship between the characteristic length of an obstacle and vortex shedding frequency poggi et al 2004 huai et al 2019 therefore the characteristic length of the vortex l can be evaluated on the basis of a constant st a dominant frequency at the interface y 15 cm and a velocity approaching the vegetation path the calculated results show that the dense and sparse vegetation had l of 0 11 and 0 09 m respectively the reasonable closeness of the values of the characteristic vortex length for both cases to the vegetation patch diameter d 0 1 m demonstrates that the patch diameter is important in influencing the scales of the vortices in this experiment the corresponding relationship between the patch diameter and the vortex scale connected by the classical st 0 21 further proves that the formation of the karman vortices has not been disrupted by the one line distribution pattern the effect of the vegetation patch on the vortex shedding can also be observed in the strong periodic signature of the time series of the instantaneous horizontal velocity vectors at y 15 cm fig 14 3 v u v u i v j where i and j are unit vectors in the longitudinal and lateral directions respectively the vortex patterns in both cases are clear and the dominant vortex shedding frequencies can be approximated from variation periods quadrant analysis was applied to explore the momentum exchange caused by the presence of vegetation reynolds stress can be divided into four quadrants in accordance with the different signs of the fluctuating components of velocity u v q1 outward interactions u 0 v 0 q2 ejections u 0 v 0 q3 inward interactions u 0 v 0 and q4 sweeps u 0 v 0 lu and willmarth 1973 focused on the occurrences of intense turbulence and established a concept regarding the hole that can extract large contributions to reynolds stress from each quadrant a hole is usually formed by four hyperbolas u t v t h 0 u v where h 0 is the threshold value and u t and v t are the measured instantaneous velocity fluctuations under different threshold values of h 0 the contributions to reynolds stress caused by different motions are defined as 4 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t v t d t where i refers to the ith quadrant t is the averaging time and c i h 0 1 u t v t h 0 u v and u t v t locates in the quadrant q i 0 otherwise the contributions to reynolds stress can be normalized by uv and 5 i 1 4 s i h 0 uv 1 when h 0 0 fig 15 illustrates the lateral distributions of the contributions to reynolds stress from each quadrant in the equilibrium zone for both cases the q2 ejections and q4 sweeps motions are the main contributors to the momentum exchange in the analog mixing layer and the interactions of q1 outward and q3 inward slightly dominate near the sidewall in accordance with the signs of different quadrants we can find that the contributions of q1 and q3 to reynolds stress are negative and the contributions of q2 and q4 are positive notably q1 and q3 are larger than q2 and q4 in the boundary affected region region iv y 10 cm but the opposite trend is observed in the analog mixing layer region iii 10 y 32 cm therefore the phenomenon illustrated in fig 10c can be attributed to the opposing signs of the reynolds stress in regions iii and iv the point at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm is the diving point as indicated by the positive and negative effects on reynolds stress from each quadrant considering the instantaneous velocity fluctuations measured at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm in the equilibrium zone the distributions of u v based on quadrant analysis are shown in fig 16 the momentum exchange that occurs at the interface is mainly dominated by ejections and sweeps in both cases however large u v located outside the hole values especially the large values of u v belonging to ejections and sweeps in the case of sparse vegetation are considerably fewer than those in the case of dense vegetation therefore a strong momentum exchange can be observed at the interface in the case of dense vegetation fig 10c because of the result of strong ejections and sweeps fig 17 illustrates the fractional contributions to the reynolds stress at y 15 cm with magnitudes located outside the hole from each quadrant as a function of the threshold values h 0 the total contribution of the values with the magnitudes located inside holes from all quadrants and the percentage of time duration within holes are also shown in fig 16 in both cases u v is small for a large fraction of time given that the contribution from the hole for example when h 0 1 remains small 10 despite the large time of occupancy 60 which corresponds to a quiescent period the largest contribution originates from q4 sweeps the second largest contribution comes from q2 ejections and the contributions from q1 and q3 motions are negative and small for h 0 3 almost 40 of the total reynolds stress results from q4 which is located outside the hole whereas only a small fraction results from q2 motions located outside the hole and none of them are contributed by q1 and q3 interactions in addition only approximately 10 of the total time duration is occupied by these motions suggesting that the local sweeps are intense and brief when h 0 increases only two contributory components exist one is the q4 motions and the other originates from the hole therefore the predominance of the sweeps in the turbulence is further proven 5 conclusions this study presents new observations on the flow dynamics and turbulent structures of the rarely studied emergent one line porous canopy patches along channel sidewalls the findings of the experiment here are summarized as follows 1 flow velocity significantly decreases in the vegetated area whereas it increases in the non vegetated area with downstream distance the transverse profiles of the mean streamwise velocity and the reynolds stress in specific transverse sections eventually fall into a one curved line and reach an equilibrium zone after the adjustment distance xeq dense vegetation requires a short adjustment distance but has a complicated evolution process with the longitudinal increase in distance the evolution of the lateral distribution of the velocity in specific transverse sections is similar to the development of the mixing layer thus we define this developing region as the analog mixing layer 2 in the equilibrium zone velocity in the vegetated area significantly decreases with high solid volume fractions however in the uniform region the velocity appears to be independent of vegetation density the transverse distribution of the velocity gradient in both cases reaches a maximum value at y 15 cm which is exactly the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas in the case of dense vegetation increasing drag force can significantly reduce local velocity and increase the velocity gradient around the interface resulting in a more momentum exchange velocity and turbulence intensity are inhibited in the narrow channel between the patch and the sidewall 3 the development of the shear layer around the edge of the patch and the experiment on flow visualization suggest that von karman vortices continue to form downstream despite the interference of the sidewall and the special one line distribution pattern the dominant frequencies of the vortices are determined through spectral analysis and the scales of vortices calculated by combining the classical st 0 21 are reasonably close to the vegetation patch diameter these results further prove the formation of karman vortices 4 the flow field in the non vegetated area can be divided into three main different regions based on the transverse distribution of mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress at the specific transverse sections a boundary affected region an analog mixing layer and a uniform region the analog mixing layer exhibits a two layer structure governed mainly by horizontal coherent vortices in general reynolds stress is negative in the boundary affected region but it remains positive in the analog mixing layer the demarcation point is exactly at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm this phenomenon can be clearly explained through quadrant analysis in the analog mixing layer the q2 ejections and q4 sweeps motions that positively contribute to reynolds stress are the main contributors to momentum exchange by contrast the interactions of q1 outward and q3 inward with negative contributions are slightly dominant in the boundary affected region in addition sweeps are crucial for turbulence and the properties of sweeps are intense and brief at the interface given that approximately 40 of the total reynolds stress results from sweeps located outside of the hole at h 0 3 and occupied 10 of the time duration in the future it will be of great interest to investigate how flow properties will change with the variation in net distances between two in line circular patches δl and the distances between vegetation and sidewalls δs this series of experimental results will be of practical importance for ecological river restoration

5161,experiments are performed on channels with emergent one line porous canopy patches distributed along the channel sidewalls in which flow dynamics and turbulent structures are analyzed the evolution of the transverse distribution of the mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress profiles in specific transverse sections with downstream distance suggests that a fully equilibrated zone is reached beyond an adjustment distance and the adjustment distance needed for vegetation with high solid volume fractions is short the flow field can be divided into three main different regions based on the transverse distribution of the mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress in the equilibrium zone a boundary affected region an analog mixing layer and a uniform region in a non vegetated area the analog mixing layer exhibits a two layer structure governed by local coherent vortices the dominant frequencies of the vortices at the interface are determined through spectral analysis and proven to correspond to a patch scale the development of the shear layer the analysis of the frequencies and scales of the vortices and the experiment on flow visualization indicate that von karman vortices continue to form downstream despite the interference of the sidewall and the special one line distribution pattern of patches quadrant analysis is adopted to illustrate the lateral momentum exchange caused by different motions results show that ejections and sweeps are the main contributions to reynolds stress in the analog mixing layer different signs of reynolds stress in the boundary affected region and the analog mixing layer can also be explained through quadrant analysis keywords emergent canopy porous patch one line distribution flow dynamics turbulence structures 1 introduction aquatic vegetation is of great physical and ecological importance for aquatic systems by modifying flow structure influencing sediment deposition and re suspension affecting bed morphology improving water quality and providing food oxygen and habitats to aquatic organisms szabo meszaros et al 2018 sonnenwald et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the modified flow and sediment deposition patterns subsequently affect the growth and distribution of vegetation tsujimoto 1999 obtaining insights into vegetation flow sediment interactions is crucial for river management and ecological river restoration nikora et al 2008 numerous efforts have been devoted to studying vegetation hydrodynamics and most of them have mainly focused on vegetation with continuous uniform horizontal distribution white and nepf 2007 2008 ghisalberti and nepf 2009 chen et al 2010 ben meftah et al 2014 liu et al 2020 however finite patches of vegetation can be found in natural and artificial landscape in particular the distribution of macrophytes is highly patchy in most streams sand jensen and madsen 1992 previous studies investigated a single vegetation patch and showed that the approaching flow is diverted laterally and only a small amount of flow can bleed through porous patches into the downstream wake follett and nepf 2012 chen et al 2012 the enhanced flow around patches inhibit local sediment deposition and accelerate channel erosion which may potentially limit the lateral expansion of patches bouma et al 2007 balke et al 2012 by contrast the reduced velocity in the wake region behind patches can promote local deposition and encourage streamwise vegetation growth tsujimoto 1999 gurnell et al 2012 kim et al 2018 therefore vegetation distributed along the banks is a common feature of natural rivers and artificial ecological channels tooth and nanson 2000 observed that a channel obstructed with dense and chaotic shrubs can evolve into a well organized system wherein vegetation occurs along elongated ridges when overbank flow occurs during flood events riparian bushes may act as an array of emergent vegetation at the interface between the main channel and floodplain mulahasan and stoesser 2017 the impacts of riparian vegetation on both hydraulic and ecological processes are increasingly recognized as an integral component of river management shiono et al 2012 and increasing efforts have been devoted into ecological river restoration by utilizing real vegetation one line of porous canopy patches like reeds fig 1 can serve for several purposes such as bank stabilization habitat creation and landscaping improvement nevertheless the detailed analyses of the flow dynamics and turbulence structures of in line porous canopy patches are scarce these hydraulic effects are of great importance as they are directly related to the bank stability sediment erosion deposition nutrient transport and pollutant dispersion sonnenwald et al 2017 2019 truong and uijttewaal 2019 and may subsequently affect the distribution of plants and the river patterns on longer time scales for effective channel management and river restoration projects design a better understanding of the impact of such riparian vegetation arrangements on the flow structures and transverse momentum exchange is necessary in this study we observed the development of flow from the inlet to the downstream in an open rectangular channel with one line emergent porous patches distributed along channel sidewall this work mainly aimed to investigate the development of the transverse distribution of the mean flow and turbulence structures with different densities of patches in the flume and to identify the adjustment distance needed from the leading edge of the vegetation patch to the equilibrium zone in this zone the mean streamwise velocity gradients at specific transverse sections in the longitudinal direction were small we then observed the coherent vortices at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas determined the frequencies and scales of the vortices and obtained insights into the lateral momentum exchange with conventional spectral and quadrant analyses the experimental results presented in this work can provide a basis for modeling such arrangements in practical application 2 review of flow with partially covered emergent vegetation riparian and aquatic vegetation can exist in various forms previous studies that considered channel flow with partially covered vegetation can be mainly divided into two types based on the vegetation distribution pattern one pattern is continuous vegetation distribution which was studied by numerous researchers white and nepf 2007 investigated the flow properties in a partially vegetated channel with a porous emergent layer they found that the shear layer at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated domains possesses a two layer structure it consists of an inner layer with a width that is determined with the array resistance and an outer layer that resembles a boundary layer and with a thickness that is set by bottom friction and water depth the formation of coherent vortices at this interface has been observed nezu and sanjou 2009 white and nepf 2008 caroppi et al 2019 as a result of the discontinuity of the vegetation resistance at the interface kelvin helmholtz vortices can be generated by large local velocity gradients and grow with the downstream distance until they become fully developed and reach the equilibrium zone ben meftah et al 2014 velocity gradients at the interface increase as vegetation densities increase a uniform region wherein the local velocity is nearly independent of vegetation density can be observed in the outer non vegetated area white and nepf 2008 various theoretical models have been developed to predict the profiles of velocities shear stresses turbulence parameters and momentum exchange in a continuous distributed vegetation channel white and nepf 2008 ben meftah and mossa 2013 meftah et al 2014 truong and uijttewaal 2019 but each model has its own limitations and cannot be broadly applied under different conditions another pattern is vegetation distributed in discontinuous patches shown in fig 1 experimental and numerical studies initially focused on single vegetation patch to understand the flow characteristics with different patch distribution patterns these studies focused on the flow past finite porous patches that consist of arrays of cylinders and revealed that the flow structure behind a porous cylinder patch differs significantly from that behind a solid cylinder takemura and tanaka 2007 studied the flow around a group of cylinders and observed two types of flow structures a primitive cylinder scale of the karman vortex street behind single cylinders and a patch scale of the karman vortex street in the downstream of the patch nicolle and eames 2011 performed a numerical study and found that the region needed for the formation of the von karman vortex street after a porous circular patch which is called the steady wake region varies with different patch porosities to predict the length of the steady wake and the velocity in this region zong and nepf 2012 provided a theoretical model based on a series of experiments that considered different patch sizes and patch porosities as the patch porosity increases the length of the steady wake increases whereas the downstream vortex street weakens moreover chen et al 2012 developed a predictive model to estimate the length of the steady wake and the distance from a patch to the second longitudinal turbulence peak and to predict the exiting velocity at the trailing edge of a porous patch insights into the velocity and turbulence levels within a patch can be obtained from this model chang et al 2017 also investigated the changes in wake structure and secondary flow inside and behind a porous patch and in drag force by applying eddy resolving simulations with different geometrical porous patches in contrast to finite emergent patches the wake behind a submerged circular patch is three dimensional and vortex structures can be generated in horizontal and vertical planes liu et al 2018 interactions between patches have also been investigated vandenbruwaene et al 2011 conducted a large scale flume experiment with spartina anglica patches to quantify the effects of patch diameter d and interpatch distance s on the flow distribution adjacent to and in between a pair of vegetation patches they estimated the threshold values d s of patch interactions meire et al 2014 investigated the flow and deposition properties in the downstream wake of a pair of patches under the influence of different patch sizes patch densities and interpatch distances a wake region of reduced velocity forms immediately behind each individual patch in a manner similar to that with a single patch but it is also a secondary region where a minimum velocity occurs at the centerline between the patches and forms further downstream enhanced deposition in this secondary region might promote a merger of the two patches de lima et al 2015 studied the influence of lateral and longitudinal distances between patches on the wake region ghani et al 2019 conducted a numerical experiment to investigate turbulent characteristics around several circular and staggered patches and observed the significant effect of neighboring and staggered patches on the flow some researchers further explored the growth and evolution of vegetation patches in a channel based on interactions between patches kondziolka and nepf 2014 yamasaki et al 2019 previous studies considered the effects of an array of the emergent impermeable vegetation distributed in one line in channels sun and shiono 2009 and terrier 2010 investigated the flow structures of emergent one line cylinders along floodplain edges in compound channels and found that velocity discharge and boundary shear stress in this case are considerably reduced compared with those in the case without vegetation shiono et al 2012 developed a new analytical solution based on the method of shiono and knight 1991 to predict the transverse distribution of velocity and the boundary shear stress in a rectangular channel with an array of cylinders mulahasan and stoesser 2017 conducted a series of experiments on uniform flow through an array of emergent rods and calculated drag coefficients via a momentum balance they showed that different scales of rods affect flow resistance and the influence of the stem reynolds number on the drag coefficient of in line rods is limited shan et al 2019 investigated the drag forces and velocity for aligned and random tree arrangement and demonstrated that the forest average drag coefficient is lower for aligned forests 3 experimental setup and conditions experiments were conducted in a rectangular flow facility that was 20 m long 0 6 m wide b and 0 5 m deep with a bed slope of 1 a steady flow discharge q 8 5 l s was provided by a recirculating pump and the flow depth h was modified with an adjustable tailgate as shown in fig 2 a flume was filled with one line circular patches of emergent canopy along the channel sidewall and the patches consist of wooden cylinders diameter d 5 mm height h 20 cm placed staggered in perforated pvc boards the diameter of the circular patch was 10 cm d and the first patch was placed 7 m from the flume entrance the net distance between two nearby in line circular patches δl was 0 35 m and the lateral net distance between the patch and the nearby sidewall δs was 0 05 m the density of the vegetation patch was described with n the number of cylinders per unit surface cm 2 a nd the frontal area exposed to the flow per unit volume cm 1 and ф πad 4 the solid volume fractions tests were conducted with patches of two densities of a 0 44 cm 1 and a 0 13 cm 1 corresponding to solid volume fractions of ф 0 17 and ф 0 05 respectively the coordinate system was defined as follows streamwise transverse and vertical coordinate and corresponding instantaneous velocity were x y z and u v w respectively with x 0 at the leading edge of the first circular patch y 0 at the sidewall nearby the vegetation domain and z 0 at the flume bed the velocity field was measured by using a 3d side looking acoustic doppler velocity meter with a recording rate of 50 hz and the sampling period was 160 s which was long enough to obtain the converged first and second order statistics each measurement point had 8000 samples given that the velocity at the mid depth is a good representation of the depth averaged velocity for emergent vegetation white and nepf 2007 kim et al 2018 lateral transects were set at mid depth thirty eight measurement points were set at the mid depth per transect to comprehensively obtain the velocity data set in each measuring line the horizontal distance between two nearby measuring points ranged from 0 5 cm to 2 cm the acquired time series of the velocity were filtered with matlab and samples with a low signal to noise ratio snr 15 or poor correlation coefficients corr 70 were removed mclelland and nicholas 2000 the remaining samples over the recording period were averaged to remove turbulent fluctuations and denoted as u v w for the x y z directions the fluctuating components were denoted as u v w and the root mean square of the fluctuating components u rms u 2 and v rms v 2 were used to evaluate the intensity of turbulent fluctuations the experimental arrangements and flow parameters are given in table 1 where u 0 is the mean channel velocity u0 q bh re0 u0h ν ν is the water kinematic viscosity is the inlet reynolds number fr0 u0 gh 0 5 is the inlet froude number and re2 u2h ν and fr2 u2 gh 0 5 are the reynolds number and the froude number in the uniform region in the non vegetated equilibrium zone respectively 4 experimental results and discussions 4 1 downstream developments we define the middlemost cross sections between two nearby vegetation patches as the specific transverse sections to investigate flow structure the lateral profiles of the mean streamwise velocity u at the specific transverse sections along the longitudinal direction are shown in fig 3 for both cases and our result clearly shows that velocity decreases within the vegetated area and increases in the non vegetated area this finding is similar to that in other partially vegetated channels white and nepf 2008 ben meftah et al 2014 huai et al 2019 with downstream distance the velocity in the uniform region in the non vegetated area defined in section 4 2 accelerates whereas the velocity in the narrow channel between the vegetation and sidewall decelerates we first consider the case of ф 0 17 as illustrated the mean velocity in the vegetated area increases from the first to the third vegetation patches and then decreases after the fifth vegetation patch the transverse profiles at different longitudinal positions almost fall into one curved line this pattern indicates that an equilibrium velocity profile tends to be obtained at x 20 75d for the case of ф 0 05 the evolution of the mean streamwise velocity appears slightly different from the dense vegetation case that is velocity decreases in the vegetated area with the downstream distance the equilibrium state of the velocity profile is obtained after the seventh patch at x 29 75d for ф 0 05 after the first patch velocity in the vegetated area for ф 0 17 is much lower than that in the case of ф 0 05 the velocity around the patch is larger because a stronger lateral diverging flow occurs in the dense vegetation case when the flow first encounters the obstruction the lateral distribution of the reynolds stress at the specific transverse sections is shown in fig 4 in each specific transverse section the presence of two peaks one was positive and the other was negative around the outmost edge of the vegetation patch indicates strong local turbulence for ф 0 17 along the longitudinal direction the net reynolds stress in the region of y 10 cm reaches its maximum between the second and third vegetation patches and then decreases downstream and stabilizes to an equilibrium after the fifth patch whereas the net reynolds stress in the region of y 10 cm keeps to increase within the adjustment distance the net reynolds stress over the whole lateral cross section keeps an increasing trend at ф 0 05 with the downstream distance before it reaches the equilibrium zone also presents a slightly different evolution rule compared with that of the dense vegetation case the net reynolds stress in the dense vegetation case is large the development of the lateral distribution of the mean streamwise velocity in specific transverse sections is presented in fig 5 in this figure a flow adjustment at the beginning of the channel and an almost equilibrium zone u x 0 downstream can be observed the longitudinal distance from the inlet of the vegetation patch x 0 to the equilibrium zone called the adjustment distance is denoted as xeq when ф 0 17 the measured adjustment length xeq is 20 75d the adjustment distance needed for ф 0 05 is long xeq 29 75d notably the evolution of the lateral distribution of the velocity in specific transverse sections is similar to the development of the mixing layer with downstream distance thus we define this layer as the analog mixing layer through the analysis presented in later sections we know that the analog mixing layer also consists of two parts the inner layer and the outer layer the development of the outer analog layer is depicted in fig 5 with the dashed curve line and the thickness of the outer layer in the equilibrium zone is labeled as δ 2 and is further discussed later on the development of the lateral distribution of turbulence kinetic energy ek is shown in fig 6 and ek is determined as follows 1 e k 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 where overbar indicates a time average for both cases fig 6 at the beginning of the adjustment distance two peaks of ek occur at the lateral location of y 5 cm and y 20 cm and are asymmetric with the central axis of the patch as a result of the influence of the nearby sidewall with the downstream distance ek increases and only one peak is found around the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm after the equilibrium zone is reached on the basis of previous studies we observed that the shear layers at the two steady wake edges grow and merge downstream for a single finite porous patch with a solid volume fraction 0 04 ф 0 04 and in the absence of the effect of the sidewall thus a patch scale von karman vortex street can be observed zong and nepf 2012 in our experiment the growth of the shear layer at y 15 cm can be inferred from the evolution profiles of ek as the peak widens until the equilibrium zone is reached the development of the shear layer at the other side of the patch y 5 cm is not so obvious in addition the corresponding patch scale vortex can be observed in the shear layer through flow visualization fig 7 and the coherent vortices grow continuously with the downstream distance this result suggests that the one line distribution of patches with the net distance of δl 0 35 m between nearby patches and the interference of the sidewall δs 0 05 m cannot destroy the downstream formation of von karman vortices furthermore the mean streamwise velocity at the centerline increases between the first and third patch for the case of ф 0 17 fig 3a possibly because the enhancement of the downstream ek by the vortices when ф 0 05 ek is smaller than that of the dense vegetation suggesting weak turbulence the ratio of streamwise velocity turbulent fluctuations to the mean streamwise velocity urms u is shown in fig 8 a from this figure we can see that urms u is large in vegetated areas especially in the densely vegetated area this characteristic indicates that the fluctuations generated by vortices are strong and can cause flow reversion white and nepf 2007 reverse flow can be observed in fig 9 the horizontal flow field from the inlet to the equilibrium zone is depicted some velocity vectors in the vegetated area are opposite to the flow direction in the flume and can be confirmed through the vortices shown in the flow visualization fig 7 however the small values of u v u rms v rms in the vegetated areas for both cases suggest that the fluctuations have a low local momentum transport efficiency by contrast a strong momentum transport induced by vortices can be inferred from the maximum value of u v u rms v rms outside the interface notably the results presented here follow the same rule as the results of the experiment conducted by white and nepf 2007 who investigated the channel flow with partially continuous obstructed arrays of cylinders 4 2 equilibrium velocity and reynolds stress the equilibrium status of the mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress in specific transverse sections for different vegetation densities are shown in fig 10 the flow field can be divided into three main different regions in accordance with the lateral distribution of velocity and reynolds stress and each region is mainly controlled by different physical parameters and dominated by different flow motions the analog mixing layer i ii is governed by local coherent vortices the uniform region in the non vegetated area iii is controlled mainly by bottom friction the boundary affected region iv where the shear layer cannot be fully developed similar to the other side as a result of the interference of the nearby sidewall the determination of the analog mixing layer should be clearly illustrated in reference to a method used to determine the inner edge of a shear layer behind a single porous circular patch developed by zong and nepf 2012 the transverse distribution of reynolds stress between two nearby vegetation patches in the equilibrium zone was used to determine the inner mixing layer δ 1 fig 11 illustrates the transverse distribution of reynolds stress between the fifth and sixth patches for the case of ф 0 17 with the downstream distance the region of the positive reynolds stress in the vegetated area corresponds to the evolution of the shear layer therefore we define the width of the inner analog mixing layer δ 1 as the distance from the left edge streamwise direction y 15 cm of the vegetation patch to the point where reynolds stress reaches zero in the vegetated area notably for each lateral profile of reynolds stress in the specific transverse section fig 4 the special point of u v 0 does not stabilize at y 10 cm until the equilibrium region is reached thus in the equilibrium zone for the specific transverse sections x a 1 75 d a 1 4 5 n 1 where n depends on the order of the front patch in sequence and δ 1 can be considered as the distance from the left edge of the patch to the centerline of the patch fig 10a the width of the outer analog mixing layer in the non vegetated area δ 2 is determined as the distance from the position where the mean streamwise velocity is 5 lower than that in the uniform region in the non vegetated area u 95 u 2 5 u 2 to the left edge of the vegetation patch this method is more consistent and precise than other methods for defining the width of the mixing layer truong and uijttewaal 2019 in the equilibrium zone the streamwise velocity at the centerline of the patch u 1 in the case of dense vegetation is smaller than that in the case of sparse vegetation whereas the velocity in the uniform region within the non vegetated area u 2 appears to be independent of vegetation density fig 10a this result is consistent with the result of a study on a single porous vegetation patch showing that u 1 u 2 decreases as the solid volume fraction increases zong and nepf 2012 in our study the widths of the analog mixing layer for both cases are almost the same suggesting the absence of a large difference in the length scales of the coherent structures caused by the two different vegetation densities in this work in fig 10c the reynolds stresses in the case of dense vegetation are larger than those in the sparse vegetation case in the analog mixing layer this finding suggests that the increasing drag force induced by dense vegetation can reduce the local velocity thereby increasing the velocity gradient around the interface more significantly and resulting in a more momentum exchange furthermore the velocity gradient du dy in both cases reaches their maximum value at y 15 cm inflection point which is exactly the point at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas and the peaks of the reynolds stress are also close to the interface this result was obtained in some previous studies which showed that turbulence attains a peak at or close to the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas nezu and onitsuka 2001 white and nepf 2007 2008 disregarding the region within 2 cm of the sidewall the reynolds stress is negative in the boundary affected region but it remains positive in the analog mixing layer the demarcation point is located exactly at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm and the reason behind this phenomenon is further discussed in section 4 3 furthermore the turbulence in region iv is small because of the boundary effect which may promote sediment deposition and accumulate additional nutrients for the local vegetation growth by contrast accelerated flow and strong turbulence in the analog mixing layer can inhibit sediment deposition thereby restricting the lateral growth of the patch bouma et al 2009 follett and nepf 2012 liu et al 2018 yamasaki et al 2019 4 3 power spectral density analysis and quadrant analysis fig 12 depicts the velocity time series at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm and at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm when ф 0 17 at the interface fig 12a the periodic fluctuations in velocity and the strong velocity correlations u v corresponding to momentum outflows ejections and momentum inflows sweeps formed by vortices can be clearly observed these motions which are in charge of the momentum exchange across the interface considerably contribute to the large reynolds stress around the interface fig 10c this result agrees with the observations in interfacial zones in other continuous uniform horizontal vegetated channels white and nepf 2007 truong and uijttewaal 2019 huai et al 2019 however at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm fig 15b the irregular variation in instantaneous u and v with the time series and the absence of obvious momentum transport motions result in a small net reynolds stress u v 0 which has also been observed deep within the array in the experiment of white and nepf 2007 the power spectral density was analyzed to explore energy distribution over the frequencies of the measured velocity fluctuations and identify the vortices dominating the energy content fig 13 illustrates the power spectral density of the streamwise fluctuation velocity u at the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm in the equilibrium zone for both cases in dense vegetation the energy density peaks at the frequency of 0 07 hz and the dominant frequency in the case of sparse vegetation is f 0 11 hz notably the decreasing rate of the energy density for both cases follows a slope of 5 3 suggesting the existence of a large inertial subrange wherein turbulence is isotropic different regions in circular cylinder flow were summarized by morkovin 1964 who found a periodic flow that has a constant frequency and is independent of the reynolds number over a wide range of a subcritical reynolds number 150 re 105 or 300 re 1 3 105 this dimensionless frequency is called the strouhal number st which corresponds to the vortex shedding frequency when a single narrow peak exists in the power spectral density roshko 1961 schewe 1983 st 0 21 in the subcritical region morkovin 1964 schlichting and gersten 2017 st is defined as 2 st f l u where f is the vortex shedding frequency which is the peak frequency in the energy density l is the characteristic length and u is the characteristic flow velocity the velocity approaching an obstacle is used st has been broadly used in many studies to demonstrate the relationship between the characteristic length of an obstacle and vortex shedding frequency poggi et al 2004 huai et al 2019 therefore the characteristic length of the vortex l can be evaluated on the basis of a constant st a dominant frequency at the interface y 15 cm and a velocity approaching the vegetation path the calculated results show that the dense and sparse vegetation had l of 0 11 and 0 09 m respectively the reasonable closeness of the values of the characteristic vortex length for both cases to the vegetation patch diameter d 0 1 m demonstrates that the patch diameter is important in influencing the scales of the vortices in this experiment the corresponding relationship between the patch diameter and the vortex scale connected by the classical st 0 21 further proves that the formation of the karman vortices has not been disrupted by the one line distribution pattern the effect of the vegetation patch on the vortex shedding can also be observed in the strong periodic signature of the time series of the instantaneous horizontal velocity vectors at y 15 cm fig 14 3 v u v u i v j where i and j are unit vectors in the longitudinal and lateral directions respectively the vortex patterns in both cases are clear and the dominant vortex shedding frequencies can be approximated from variation periods quadrant analysis was applied to explore the momentum exchange caused by the presence of vegetation reynolds stress can be divided into four quadrants in accordance with the different signs of the fluctuating components of velocity u v q1 outward interactions u 0 v 0 q2 ejections u 0 v 0 q3 inward interactions u 0 v 0 and q4 sweeps u 0 v 0 lu and willmarth 1973 focused on the occurrences of intense turbulence and established a concept regarding the hole that can extract large contributions to reynolds stress from each quadrant a hole is usually formed by four hyperbolas u t v t h 0 u v where h 0 is the threshold value and u t and v t are the measured instantaneous velocity fluctuations under different threshold values of h 0 the contributions to reynolds stress caused by different motions are defined as 4 s i h 0 1 t 0 t c i h 0 t u t v t d t where i refers to the ith quadrant t is the averaging time and c i h 0 1 u t v t h 0 u v and u t v t locates in the quadrant q i 0 otherwise the contributions to reynolds stress can be normalized by uv and 5 i 1 4 s i h 0 uv 1 when h 0 0 fig 15 illustrates the lateral distributions of the contributions to reynolds stress from each quadrant in the equilibrium zone for both cases the q2 ejections and q4 sweeps motions are the main contributors to the momentum exchange in the analog mixing layer and the interactions of q1 outward and q3 inward slightly dominate near the sidewall in accordance with the signs of different quadrants we can find that the contributions of q1 and q3 to reynolds stress are negative and the contributions of q2 and q4 are positive notably q1 and q3 are larger than q2 and q4 in the boundary affected region region iv y 10 cm but the opposite trend is observed in the analog mixing layer region iii 10 y 32 cm therefore the phenomenon illustrated in fig 10c can be attributed to the opposing signs of the reynolds stress in regions iii and iv the point at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm is the diving point as indicated by the positive and negative effects on reynolds stress from each quadrant considering the instantaneous velocity fluctuations measured at the interface between vegetated and non vegetated areas y 15 cm in the equilibrium zone the distributions of u v based on quadrant analysis are shown in fig 16 the momentum exchange that occurs at the interface is mainly dominated by ejections and sweeps in both cases however large u v located outside the hole values especially the large values of u v belonging to ejections and sweeps in the case of sparse vegetation are considerably fewer than those in the case of dense vegetation therefore a strong momentum exchange can be observed at the interface in the case of dense vegetation fig 10c because of the result of strong ejections and sweeps fig 17 illustrates the fractional contributions to the reynolds stress at y 15 cm with magnitudes located outside the hole from each quadrant as a function of the threshold values h 0 the total contribution of the values with the magnitudes located inside holes from all quadrants and the percentage of time duration within holes are also shown in fig 16 in both cases u v is small for a large fraction of time given that the contribution from the hole for example when h 0 1 remains small 10 despite the large time of occupancy 60 which corresponds to a quiescent period the largest contribution originates from q4 sweeps the second largest contribution comes from q2 ejections and the contributions from q1 and q3 motions are negative and small for h 0 3 almost 40 of the total reynolds stress results from q4 which is located outside the hole whereas only a small fraction results from q2 motions located outside the hole and none of them are contributed by q1 and q3 interactions in addition only approximately 10 of the total time duration is occupied by these motions suggesting that the local sweeps are intense and brief when h 0 increases only two contributory components exist one is the q4 motions and the other originates from the hole therefore the predominance of the sweeps in the turbulence is further proven 5 conclusions this study presents new observations on the flow dynamics and turbulent structures of the rarely studied emergent one line porous canopy patches along channel sidewalls the findings of the experiment here are summarized as follows 1 flow velocity significantly decreases in the vegetated area whereas it increases in the non vegetated area with downstream distance the transverse profiles of the mean streamwise velocity and the reynolds stress in specific transverse sections eventually fall into a one curved line and reach an equilibrium zone after the adjustment distance xeq dense vegetation requires a short adjustment distance but has a complicated evolution process with the longitudinal increase in distance the evolution of the lateral distribution of the velocity in specific transverse sections is similar to the development of the mixing layer thus we define this developing region as the analog mixing layer 2 in the equilibrium zone velocity in the vegetated area significantly decreases with high solid volume fractions however in the uniform region the velocity appears to be independent of vegetation density the transverse distribution of the velocity gradient in both cases reaches a maximum value at y 15 cm which is exactly the interface between the vegetated and non vegetated areas in the case of dense vegetation increasing drag force can significantly reduce local velocity and increase the velocity gradient around the interface resulting in a more momentum exchange velocity and turbulence intensity are inhibited in the narrow channel between the patch and the sidewall 3 the development of the shear layer around the edge of the patch and the experiment on flow visualization suggest that von karman vortices continue to form downstream despite the interference of the sidewall and the special one line distribution pattern the dominant frequencies of the vortices are determined through spectral analysis and the scales of vortices calculated by combining the classical st 0 21 are reasonably close to the vegetation patch diameter these results further prove the formation of karman vortices 4 the flow field in the non vegetated area can be divided into three main different regions based on the transverse distribution of mean streamwise velocity and reynolds stress at the specific transverse sections a boundary affected region an analog mixing layer and a uniform region the analog mixing layer exhibits a two layer structure governed mainly by horizontal coherent vortices in general reynolds stress is negative in the boundary affected region but it remains positive in the analog mixing layer the demarcation point is exactly at the central axis of the patch y 10 cm this phenomenon can be clearly explained through quadrant analysis in the analog mixing layer the q2 ejections and q4 sweeps motions that positively contribute to reynolds stress are the main contributors to momentum exchange by contrast the interactions of q1 outward and q3 inward with negative contributions are slightly dominant in the boundary affected region in addition sweeps are crucial for turbulence and the properties of sweeps are intense and brief at the interface given that approximately 40 of the total reynolds stress results from sweeps located outside of the hole at h 0 3 and occupied 10 of the time duration in the future it will be of great interest to investigate how flow properties will change with the variation in net distances between two in line circular patches δl and the distances between vegetation and sidewalls δs this series of experimental results will be of practical importance for ecological river restoration projects and channel management in determining appropriate vegetation arrangement parameters such as vegetation densities patch diameters net distances between two in line circular patches and the

5162,the streamtube approximation has been commonly used for upscaling of flow and transport in spatially heterogeneous unsaturated soils this study investigates the prediction ability of streamtube approach to model flow in heterogeneous unsaturated sandy soils under a rainfall event at a plot scale towards this aim a numerical model for solving 3 d richards s equation was developed and verified for 1 d and 3 d cases turning band method was used to generate the random field of soil hydraulic parameters the 3 d soil field heterogeneity was represented by considering variation in both van genuchten parameter α and k s for streamtube models two cases of heterogeneity were investigated i variability in k s only and ii variability in both k s and α both the parameters were assumed to follow a log normal distribution for different boundary conditions at the soil surface and varying soil heterogeneity the average darcy s flux and mean field scale soil moisture obtained using streamtube approach were compared with 3 d numerical solutions the results identify that for high recharge rate at the soil surface streamtube model is a good approximation of the 3 d heterogeneous soil field and the average difference in mean soil moisture obtained from 3 d model and streamtube based 1 d model was below 10 when variability in both k s and α was considered for all timesteps the inclusion of variability in α leads to improvement in prediction capability of streamtube model further regression equations were developed that can be utilized to predict the mean field soil moisture for heterogeneous 3 d sandy soil fields given the mean field soil moisture obtained from streamtube approach for both the cases the regressions equations follow exponential model for case 1 and linear model for case 2 with r 2 values 0 80 and 0 99 respectively the developed equations can be reliably used to predict mean field soil moisture for heterogeneous sandy soil fields keywords streamtube model unsaturated zone heterogeneous soils soil moisture richards equation 1 introduction unsaturated or vadose zone plays an important role in water resources management and understanding of hydrological processes dogan and motz 2005 even though it contains less than 0 01 of total water involved in the hydrologic cycle likos and lu 2004 the movement of water in this zone is significant as it facilitates the necessary transition between the atmosphere and the larger groundwater aquifers it also provides water and nutrients to the biosphere and is being extensively used for human purposes such as cultivation construction waste disposal etc the characterization of water movement in unsaturated zone is difficult due to the non linear and computationally demanding nature of richards equation šimůnek 2005 and it is further complicated by the soil spatial heterogeneity feyen et al 1998 for modeling water movement in heterogeneous soils deterministic and stochastic approaches are popularly used feyen et al 1998 in the deterministic approach either the heterogeneous soil is replaced by an equivalent homogenous soil or the soil heterogeneity is represented as it is this approach though gives reliable results is computationally intensive and time consuming as opposed to deterministic approach stochastic approach accounts for the variability in soil hydraulic properties by treating them as random variables and is simplistic in nature stochastic approaches such as streamtube approach are commonly used for modeling flow in heterogeneous soils in the streamtube approach the spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties is described by probability density functions and the heterogeneous flow field is assumed to be a collection of large number of non interacting vertical columns it is assumed that flow is in vertical direction only and within each tube the soil hydraulic properties are uniform but can vary between the tubes dagan and bresler 1983 butters and jury 1989 ellsworth and jury 1991 russo 1991 feyen et al 1998 zhu and mohanty 2002a b vertical heterogeneity of soil properties in the streamtube can also be incorporated by allowing random heterogeneity in the vertical direction the streamtube or parallel column approach has been used by several researchers to simulate flow and transport in heterogeneous soils bresler and dagan 1983 dagan and bresler 1983 coppola et al 2009 leij et al 2006 or and rubin 1993 protopapas and bras 1991 zhu et al 2006 as well as to determine effective soil hydraulic properties zhu and mohanty 2002ab 2003 2004 ahuja et al 2010 smith and diekkrüger 1996 zhu and sun 2012 ojha et al 2017 in these studies the flow within a column has been described either by 1 d richards equation or the green ampt model vereecken et al 2007 however it is worth noting that despite the extensive use of streamtube models to account for soil heterogeneity in flow and transport studies very less attention has been given to its limitations and applicability as streamtube model is an approximation for 3 d natural soil fields a detailed investigation of its ability to simulate water movement under various field conditions is essential before it can be reliably used for modeling only a few studies have investigated the applicability of streamtube model in heterogeneous soil fields most notable being protopapas and bras 1991 or and rubin 1993 chen et al 1994a b and leij et al 2006 protopapas and bras 1991 compared the 2 d approximate solutions obtained using streamtube approach with those obtained using exact 2 d analytical solutions considering variability in saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and linear relation between hydraulic conductivity k and moisture content θ it was observed that for uniform application of water at the surface the heterogeneous soil medium could be represented by a set of non interacting columns or and rubin 1993 investigated the ability of the parallel column model proposed in rubin and or 1999 to reconstruct 2 d steady flow solutions for heterogeneous media with variability in the hydraulic parameters k s and gardner russo parameter α g r and plant rooting depth they observed that parallel column models provide reliable estimates of pressure head h and saturation s chen et al 1994a b developed green ampt model based on streamtube approach for predicting field scale average water movement in spatially heterogeneous soils considering variability in k s in horizontal direction only and compared areal mean water saturation profiles with respective results from 3 d finite difference model the green ampt based model showed good agreement with the 3 d model the streamtube approach neglects the lateral flow between the soil columns which could become prominent if columns become longer and narrower or if they exhibit a greater contrast in hydraulic properties leij et al 2006 investigated the error caused by ignoring lateral movement in streamtube models they derived analytical expressions to describe flow in a medium of two parallel columns under infiltration for both 2 d vertical and horizontal flow and 1 d vertical flow conditions horizontal flux and the relative error between 1 d and 2 d solutions were computed for different soil types it was found that the relative error was highly affected by the differences in the k s between the columns while these studies have focused on investigating the ability of streamtube model for predicting water movement the studies conducted by protopapas and bras 1991 leij et al 2006 and or and rubin 1993 have been restricted to 2d flows further chen et al 1994a b and protopapas and bras 1991 have been restricted to spatial variation in k s moreover the effects of variation in correlation length scale and correlation between soil hydraulic properties have not been analysed real world situations involve complicated 3 d flow regimes originating from time dependent forcing conditions imposed at the soil surface therefore in this study the results for soil moisture obtained from streamtube model are compared with 3 d numerical model for heterogeneous soils to model flow in heterogeneous unsaturated soils accounting for spatial variability in all the soil hydraulic properties would be most comprehensive however it would increase the computational cost manifold earlier studies based on experimental and numerical investigations of soil fields have indicated that at field scale variability in k s and van genuchten parameter α dominates byers and stephens 1983 kavvas et al 1996 nielsen et al 1973 russo and bresler 1982 and the variability in these parameters has been used by many researchers to give reliable estimates of effective flow parameters e g bresler and dagan 1983 chen et al 1994a b dagan and bresler 1983 destouni 1992 russo 1995 zhu and mohanty 2002a b 2004 thus the variability in k s and α is only considered in this analysis other soil hydraulic parameters are assumed to be constant in this study the ability of streamtube model to predict soil moisture for a 3d unsaturated heterogeneous soil field is investigated the heterogeneity in 3 d soil field is represented by considering variation in both α and k s in the streamtube models two cases of heterogeneity are investigated i variability in k s only and ii variability in both k s and α the specific objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the ability of streamtube model to model flow in unsaturated heterogeneous soils and 2 to develop a simple regression model to predict the mean field soil moisture for heterogeneous 3 d sandy soil fields at different depth and time given the mean field soil moisture obtained from streamtube approach for spatially varying soil hydraulic properties for a rainfall event 2 methodology to meet the objective of this study the following approach will be followed 1 a finite difference model for solving 1 d and 3 d richards equation will be developed 2 random fields of auto and cross correlated hydraulic parameters of both k s and α will be generated 3 the numerical models and the random fields will be integrated to create three different numerical schemes two based on the streamtube model and one 3 d numerical model for heterogeneous soils 4 the flow field will be simulated using the three numerical schemes for different rainfall intensities and varying soil properties 5 the mean field scale soil moisture and velocity calculated using the three numerical schemes will be compared and 6 a regression model will be developed to describe mean field soil moisture for 3 d heterogeneous sandy soils the details of the developed 3 d and 1 d numerical model and random number generation of hydraulic parameters are provided in the sub sections to follow the numerical schemes utilized to investigate the prediction ability of streamtube approach are described in section 3 2 1 domain setup and mathematical framework 2 1 1 physical domain the purpose of our study is to model flow through heterogeneous soil field under a rainfall event for this a 3d heterogeneous field of size 15 m 15 m 2 m with spatial discretization of 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 1 m respectively was set up under the streamtube approximation the 3 d soil field is assumed to be a collection of homogeneous soil columns and each soil column is of 2 m depth root water uptake was ignored in this study 2 1 2 governing equation richards equation is the governing equation that describes the flow in variably saturated porous media richards 1931 the three dimensional continuity equation combined with darcy buckingham equation results in the modified form of richards s equation for a homogeneous and anisotropic system that also includes saturated zone component in its general form celia et al 1990 dogan and motz 2005 1 x k x h h x y k y h h y z k z h h z 1 q ext θ t s w s s h t where k x h k y h and k z h are hydraulic conductivities in the x y and z directions respectively and z is positive upwards q ext is volumetric source or sink term h is pressure head s w is saturation ratio s s is specific storage θ is the moisture content and t is time 2 1 3 mathematical formulation the numerical model for solving 1d and 3d richards equation was based on dogan 1999 and dogan and motz 2005 finite difference approximation with modified picard s iteration scheme was used to solve the modified richards equation the developed 1d and 3d code was validated against the example problems given in dogan and motz 2005 example no 1 which is 1d infiltration and redistribution problem and dogan 1999 example no 5 respectively 2 1 4 characterization of the flow parameters van genuchten and neilson relationship van genuchten 1980 was used to describe the unsaturated soil properties at local scale the soil water saturation pressure head and conductivity are related as 2 k r k h k s 1 β 5 m 2 1 β m β m if h 0 3 and k r k h k s 1 if h 0 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 β m if h 0 5 θ h θ s if h 0 where β h h s n m 1 1 n h s is the air entry or bubbling pressure head n is the fitting parameter in the moisture retention curve θ r is residual water content and θ s is the saturated moisture content 2 1 5 boundary and initial conditions bc and ic for the flow field initial and boundary conditions are given by 6 h h i a t t 0 h r 7 a t t o p b o u n d a r y q q 0 f o r t t p 8 a n d h h pond for t t p where h i is initial pressure head and q 0 is water flux applied at top boundary at the soil surface there is a prescribed time dependent flux q 0 till ponding occurs and after ponding fixed head condition where pressure head is equal to h pond where h pond depends upon the topography of cross section for the 3 d and 1 d field the initial condition must be consistent with the boundary conditions and the random fields of the hydraulic properties for each realization the steady state flow equation was solved using the k s and α fields and boundary conditions for an initial pressure head of 10 m and then the obtained pressure head at different grid points was used as the initial condition for the transient simulations the rainfall rate flux q at the surface was varied between 6 and 15 mm hr the maximum rate of rainfall rate was obtained from hourly rainfall records for a weather station located in iit kanpur for the period 2010 2013 indicating an intensity which is practically feasible at the soil surface flux boundary condition was applied till ponding occurred after ponding dirichlet boundary condition was applied at the surface with h 0 m at the bottom free drainage condition was applied for the 3d field no flow boundary condition was applied at left right front and back surfaces 2 2 generation of the flow parameters field several field studies have been conducted for determining spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties and they have been found to be vertically and horizontally correlated boggs et al 1992 bosch and west 1998 byers and stephens 1983 nielsen et al 1973 sudicky 1986 ünlüet al 1990 these studies indicate that k s α and n of the van genuchten model follow lognormal distribution while θ s follows a normal distribution and the variability in k s and α dominates greminger et al 1985 sudicky 1986 buchter et al 1991 russo and bouton 1992 further they have identified that horizontal correlation length scale λ h is much larger than the vertical correlation length scale λ v the vertical correlation values were usually found to be less than 0 5 m and the horizontal correlation length varied approximately between 0 and 5 m based on the findings of the aforementioned studies in this study at the field scale the soil hydraulic parameters k s and α were assumed to follow a lognormal distribution moreover for the 3 d heterogeneous model k s and α were considered auto and cross correlated a 3 d random field generator based on turning band method proposed by mantoglou and wilson 1982 was used to generate correlated random fields of soil hydraulic parameters turning band method can be used to generate 2d and 3d realizations of a stationary correlated multidimensional random field from a normal distribution with zero mean and a specified covariance structure tompson et al 1989 in this method a multidimensional simulation is transformed into the sum of a series of equivalent unidimensional simulations which preserve the statistics of true field and is computationally less intensive mantoglou and wilson 1982 in this study matlab program tbcosim developed by emery 2008 was utilized tbcosim is based on turning band method and can be used for co simulating a set of stationary or intrinsic gaussian random fields in a 3 d random field in which simple and cross covariance functions are fitted by a linear model of coregionalization for generating multivariate random field of l o g k s and l o g α using tbcosim 10 000 lines were used and l o g k s and l o g α were assumed to follow exponential and exponential sine variogram model 3 design of numerical scheme the 1 d and 3 d models were integrated with the generated random numbers to create three different numerical schemes fig 1 shows the details of the three numerical schemes and the steps followed for investigating the prediction ability of streamtube approach the different numerical schemes are described below a numerical 3d this scheme was implemented for monte carlo simulations of 3d heterogeneous field having hydraulic properties with different horizontal and vertical correlation length scales for 3d heterogeneous field of size 15 m 15 m 2 m with spatial discretization 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 1 m respectively variability in both k s and α is assumed for an example fig 2 a and b show a 3 d heterogeneous soil field with variability in l o g k s and log α for λ h 2 m λ v 0 2 m and σ 2 0 2 λ h λ v a n d σ 2 a r e s a m e f o r b o t h k s a n d α the μ l o g k s and μ l o g α for log normal distribution of k s and α are 2 81 and 1 45 respectively earlier studies have suggested that when the study domain is sufficiently large to ensure ergodicity in the first moment statistics obtained from a single realization may be substituted for ensemble mean statistics without significant errors dagan 1989 however in this study since the domain size was not much larger than the horizontal correlation length scale 500 random fields for a specific set of parameters were generated monte carlo simulations were run for these random fields and the average values obtained for the flow fields were utilized for comparison of results fig 3 shows the effect of the number of realizations on estimates of mean soil moisture and darcy s velocity field for λ h 5 m λ v 0 6 m σ 2 0 6 and q 9 m m h r for all cases convergence in soil moisture and darcy s velocity fields were observed for n 300 random fields and therefore this number was selected it has been observed that no flow boundary condition exerts some influence on statistical structure of the 3 d random field fiori and russo 2007 therefore while computing mean statistics for the numerical 3d zones including 1 5 m from the no flow boundaries were not considered in the averaging domain a total of 10 800 36 different soil parameters and flux combinations 300 realizations 3 d simulations were carried out for t 50 hr b numerical 1d ks this scheme was implemented for monte carlo simulations i e to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the streamtube approximation assuming the variability in k s only in this scheme first a random value of k s was drawn from a prescribed lognormal distribution then for the k s numerical solution of the 1d richards equation was obtained similarly 1000 such monte carlo simulations were utilized to obtain the soil moisture at different depths e θ z t c numerical 1d ks α this scheme was implemented for monte carlo simulations i e to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the streamtube approximation assuming the variability in k s and α in this case random values of both k s and α were drawn from their respective log normal distributions and the richards equation was solved similarly n 1000 such monte carlo simulations were utilized to obtain the soil moisture at different depths e θ z t similar to numerical 3d the steady state flow equation was solved for both numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α and then this solution was used as the initial flow field for the transient simulation while solving both 3 d and1 d numerical schemes monte carlo simulation was used it is a stochastic method in which the probability distribution of uncertain parameters is used to generate large number of random samples and their subsequent solution baalousha 2016 as per law of large numbers the mean value obtained from large number of realizations should approximate the expected value the generation for random samples for 1 d case was performed using the random number generator in matlab using their probability distribution for the 3 d case heterogeneous random soil field were generated using turning band method as discussed in sub section 3 6 4 results and discussion to test the ability of streamtube model to predict flow heterogeneous sandy soil was considered for this soil type vertical flow dominates under high recharge rate at the soil surface and the streamtube model is expected to be a good approximation of 3 d soil fields dagan and bresler 1983 in this study the μ l o g k s and μ l o g α for log normal distribution of k s and α and n for a sandy soil were obtained from schaap and leij 1998 and are 2 81 1 45 and 3 16 respectively the λ h λ v and σ 2 were varied between 1 and 5 m 0 1 0 6 m and 0 2 0 6 respectively for both k s and α θ s and θ r were taken to be 0 45 and 0 01 respectively further the θ s and θ r values were taken from rawls et al 1983 and a soil with these properties can be classified as a sandy soil k s and α are assumed to be cross correlated with a cross correlation λ cc of 0 3 the rainfall rate flux q at the surface was varied between 6 and 15 mm hr the results were analyzed for variation in horizontal correlation length scale λ h vertical correlation length scale λ v the rainfall or recharge rate flux q and standard deviation of van genuchten parameters k s and α at the surface for brevity only results for q 6 and 15 mm hr for λ h λ hk s λ h α 2 and 5 m λ v λ vk s λ v α 0 2 and 0 6 m λ cc 0 3 and σ 2 σ l o g k s 2 σ l o g α 2 0 2 and 0 6 are presented further the results have been shown till 1 5 m depth as deeper depths will be more affected by the bottom boundary condition 4 1 comparison of velocity fields to obtain insight into the difference in streamtube and 3 d numerical results mean horizontal and vertical darcy s velocity or flux were calculated and plotted as a function of vertical depth 4 1 1 comparison of vertical velocity in figs 4 and 5 mean vertical darcy s velocity e v z averaged over planes for numerical 3d is compared with the respective values obtained from streamtube models for both numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α at t 2 12 and 48 hr for q 6 mm hr and 15 mm hr respectively the negative values represent the downward movement of flux the absolute vertical velocity is highest near the surface and although there is some upward movement of flux near the bottom at initial time steps due to free drainage the flux direction reverses with time it was observed that the numerical 3d numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α closely resemble each other for all depths at the initial time steps however with increase in time the difference between numerical 3d with numerical 1d ks as well as with numerical 1d ks α increases with time as well as with increase in λ h and λ v with increase in heterogeneity σ 2 recharge rate q and time the difference between numerical 3d model and numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α increases further with increase in recharge rate the performance of the streamtube models does not improve the difference between numerical 3d model numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α can be due to the consideration of vertical heterogeneity for streamtube models vertical variation in k s was constant and despite inclusion of α no significant difference was observed between numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α the absolute vertical flux obtained using numerical 3d numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α model decreases with depth and increases with time the flux at surface increased with time as well as heterogeneity the increase in recharge rate led to increase in flux however the streamtube models were unable to predict velocity with enough accuracy for higher values of λ h and λ v for latter time steps the increase in heterogeneity also led to further decrease in prediction accuracy for streamtube models 4 1 2 comparison of horizontal velocity in fig 6 the variation in average darcy s velocity in y direction e v y obtained from the numerical 3d model was plotted as a function of depth and time the value of e v y was found to be very low order of 10 10 and mostly in negative y direction however with increase in q e v y did not decrease at shallow depths e v y is quite low and decreases with depth with time first increase in e v y and then decrease was observed as the steady state condition is approached it was observed that for shallow depths the horizontal velocity remains similar with increase in recharge rate from q 6 mm hr to 15 mm hr however at deeper ends e v y varied drastically with time increase in σ 2 lead to higher value of e v y for higher recharge rate in fig 7 the variation in e v x as a function of depth as well time was plotted for varying λ h λ v and σ 2 for q 6 and 15 mm hr it is observed that e v x was much higher as compared to e v y at all depths and time steps it is still in order of 10 4 it is observed that for shallow depths e v x remains similar with increase in recharge rate from q 6 mm hr to 15 mm hr as well as with increase in time increase in σ 2 led to higher values of e v x at all depths and time the mean horizontal velocity increases in magnitude with increase in variance the increase in e v x and e v y with increase in σ 2 indicates that with increase in heterogeneity cross flow increases and a streamtube based approach will not be suitable for modeling flow and transport in highly heterogeneous soils the variation of horizontal darcy s velocity with depth is similar to that observed by leij et al 2006 however their study was limited to 2 d field and effect of correlation length scale was not considered the low values of horizontal darcy s velocity indicate that flow is mostly vertical and it increases with time as well as heterogeneity 4 2 comparison of soil moisture to test the ability of streamtube model to predict flow in a heterogeneous soil the percentage difference in mean soil moisture values averaged over planes for numerical 3d to the respective values obtained from streamtube models for both numerical 1d ksand numerical 1d ks α at different depths and time intervals respectively are shown in figs 8 and 9 for q 6 and 15 mm hr respectively the percentage difference error is defined as 9 e r r o r e θ z t 1 d e θ z t 3 d e θ z t 3 d 100 where e θ z t 1 d is the mean soil moisture observed at any depth and time from 1 d numerical schemes numerical 1d ks or numerical 1d ks α and e θ z t 3 d is the mean soil moisture observed at any depth and time from numerical 3d scheme in figs 8 and 9 the variation of error is plotted with depth for different times for recharge rate 6 mm hr and 15 mm hr respectively fig 8 a c e g and fig 9 a c e g represent the error between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks while fig 8 b d f h and fig 9 b d f h represent that between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks α it is observed that numerical 1d ks under predicts numerical 3d model for shallow depths and vice versa for deeper regions however with increase in time the performance of numerical 1d ks model improves with increase in variance the error increases increase in λ h and λ v also leads to an increase in error however it is less prominent than that observed for increase in variance it is also observed that increase in recharge rate leads to decrease in error see fig 8 a c e g and fig 9 a c e g as the prediction ability of streamtube models increases with increase in recharge rate from fig 8 b d f h and fig 9 b d f h it can be observed that numerical 1d ks α closely approximates numerical 3d model resulting in much lower values of error the decrease in error is due to improvement in prediction ability of streamtube models caused by inclusion of variability in α similar to fig 8 a c e g and fig 9 a c e g error decreases with increase in time and the increase in heterogeneity did lead to increase in error however its magnitude is much lower increase in λ h and λ v also lead to increase in error the comparison of error results showed numerical 1d ks α is able to predict numerical 3d much better as compared to numerical 1d ks the results suggest that a streamtube model incorporating variability in ks and α can reliably predict the 3 d field response studies have recommended that streamtube model performs better at higher recharge rate however when only variability in k s is considered i e in numerical 1d ks model the difference between mean soil moisture for 3 d heterogeneous soil and 1 d streamtube model is high the variation in results might be due to the initial condition that has been considered in this study one of the assumptions in streamtube model is that the water content is initially deterministic and homogenous throughout the field in practicality homogeneous initial condition is rarely available in our study the initial condition was no longer homogenous results from this study also suggest that with increase in number of soil hydraulic parameters with significant spatial variability in an unsaturated soil a reliable prediction of flow and transport can be observed even by using streamtube based models however this requires incorporating spatial variability in a greater number of soil hydraulic parameters 4 3 development of regression model regression methods are often used to simplify a highly complex model with a simplified response surface helton et al 1991 in this study a simplified regression model was developed that can be used to predict mean soil moisture for 3 d heterogeneous sandy soil field the mean soil moisture values of numerical 3d e θ z t 3 d were considered as the dependent or the output parameter of the regression model while soil moisture values of numerical 1d e θ z t 1 d were considered as the independent variable regression analysis was performed for two cases case 1 in which mean soil moisture values of numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks were considered and case 2 in which mean soil moisture values of numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks α were considered while developing the regression model soil moisture values upto 1 5 m depth were considered the models were compared by their respective r2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse values nrmse was calculated as given below 10 n r m s e 1 v i 1 v y obs i y cal i 2 y obs m a x y obs m i n where y obs i is the observed value of error and y cal i is the error value obtained from the model y obs m a x y obs m i n and v are the maximum minimum value and total number of observed errors respectively it was also observed that the regression models performed better when the independent parameters were kept in their dimensional form different types of regression models were considered some of them being exponential and polynomial models of various degree in fig 10 a b the soil moisture e θ z t 3 d obtained from numerical 3d models has been compared against that obtained from streamtube model an exponential model was observed to be a better fit between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks while a linear model was observed to be better fit between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks α the resultant models along with their coefficients for case 1 and 2 are given by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 e θ z t 3 d 0 1706 e x p 0 7910 e θ z t 1 d 0 2473 e x p 30 21 e θ z t 1 d 12 e θ z t 3 d 0 9682 e θ z t 1 d 0 0026 for case 1 and case 2 r2 values were 0 80 and 0 99 respectively while the nrmse values were 0 11 and 0 024 respectively the linear regression model in case 2 performs much better than case 1 in fig 10 c d e θ z t values obtained from regression models were compared with the actual values for both case1 and case 2 it was observed that the scatter plot had higher variance for case 1 while lower variance for case 2 for the validation of the regression model k fold cross validation method is used in this method the subset dataset was further divided in k subsets and k 1 subsets were used as training data and the kth subset was used as testing data this process was repeated k time and average error across k was computed in our study 10 fold cross validation method was used to validate the linear regression model and nrmse values were compared it was observed that nrmse varied between 0 11 and 0 16 for case 1 and 0 02 to 0 03 for case 2 respectively overall the regression model reliably predicts the mean field soil moisture for sandy soils 5 conclusion in this study the average darcy s flux and mean soil moisture values predicted using streamtube models are compared against that of numerical solutions obtained for a 3d heterogeneous field with varying horizontal and vertical correlation length scale at different recharge rate for a sandy soil for the streamtube model the heterogeneity was considered either in saturated hydraulic conductivity k s or in both k s and van genuchten parameter α and both the parameters were assumed to follow a log normal distribution the prediction ability of streamtube model is affected by recharge rate hydraulic properties and correlation length scales of the soil field the prediction accuracy of streamtube models decreases with increase in variance increase in horizontal and vertical correlation length scales don t always lead to improvement in prediction capability inclusion of variability of α in the streamtube model leads to significant improvement in its prediction capability the respective error between numerical 1d ks α and numerical 3d are significantly lower than those of numerical 1d ks and numerical 3d numerical 1d ks α can predict mean soil moisture with greater accuracy at shallow depths however streamtube model was not able to predict vertical darcy s flux with sufficient accuracy the regression equations developed in this study can be used for prediction of average soil moisture in the field by using streamtube model the proposed equations require far less computational effort when compared to solving 3 d richards equation for heterogeneous soils for estimating surface soil moisture under transient flow conditions furthermore while this study is limited to sandy soil it can give some insight to modelers about the error they can expect when describing water movement using streamtube approach for any other soil type within the unsaturated zone credit authorship

5162,the streamtube approximation has been commonly used for upscaling of flow and transport in spatially heterogeneous unsaturated soils this study investigates the prediction ability of streamtube approach to model flow in heterogeneous unsaturated sandy soils under a rainfall event at a plot scale towards this aim a numerical model for solving 3 d richards s equation was developed and verified for 1 d and 3 d cases turning band method was used to generate the random field of soil hydraulic parameters the 3 d soil field heterogeneity was represented by considering variation in both van genuchten parameter α and k s for streamtube models two cases of heterogeneity were investigated i variability in k s only and ii variability in both k s and α both the parameters were assumed to follow a log normal distribution for different boundary conditions at the soil surface and varying soil heterogeneity the average darcy s flux and mean field scale soil moisture obtained using streamtube approach were compared with 3 d numerical solutions the results identify that for high recharge rate at the soil surface streamtube model is a good approximation of the 3 d heterogeneous soil field and the average difference in mean soil moisture obtained from 3 d model and streamtube based 1 d model was below 10 when variability in both k s and α was considered for all timesteps the inclusion of variability in α leads to improvement in prediction capability of streamtube model further regression equations were developed that can be utilized to predict the mean field soil moisture for heterogeneous 3 d sandy soil fields given the mean field soil moisture obtained from streamtube approach for both the cases the regressions equations follow exponential model for case 1 and linear model for case 2 with r 2 values 0 80 and 0 99 respectively the developed equations can be reliably used to predict mean field soil moisture for heterogeneous sandy soil fields keywords streamtube model unsaturated zone heterogeneous soils soil moisture richards equation 1 introduction unsaturated or vadose zone plays an important role in water resources management and understanding of hydrological processes dogan and motz 2005 even though it contains less than 0 01 of total water involved in the hydrologic cycle likos and lu 2004 the movement of water in this zone is significant as it facilitates the necessary transition between the atmosphere and the larger groundwater aquifers it also provides water and nutrients to the biosphere and is being extensively used for human purposes such as cultivation construction waste disposal etc the characterization of water movement in unsaturated zone is difficult due to the non linear and computationally demanding nature of richards equation šimůnek 2005 and it is further complicated by the soil spatial heterogeneity feyen et al 1998 for modeling water movement in heterogeneous soils deterministic and stochastic approaches are popularly used feyen et al 1998 in the deterministic approach either the heterogeneous soil is replaced by an equivalent homogenous soil or the soil heterogeneity is represented as it is this approach though gives reliable results is computationally intensive and time consuming as opposed to deterministic approach stochastic approach accounts for the variability in soil hydraulic properties by treating them as random variables and is simplistic in nature stochastic approaches such as streamtube approach are commonly used for modeling flow in heterogeneous soils in the streamtube approach the spatial heterogeneity in soil hydraulic properties is described by probability density functions and the heterogeneous flow field is assumed to be a collection of large number of non interacting vertical columns it is assumed that flow is in vertical direction only and within each tube the soil hydraulic properties are uniform but can vary between the tubes dagan and bresler 1983 butters and jury 1989 ellsworth and jury 1991 russo 1991 feyen et al 1998 zhu and mohanty 2002a b vertical heterogeneity of soil properties in the streamtube can also be incorporated by allowing random heterogeneity in the vertical direction the streamtube or parallel column approach has been used by several researchers to simulate flow and transport in heterogeneous soils bresler and dagan 1983 dagan and bresler 1983 coppola et al 2009 leij et al 2006 or and rubin 1993 protopapas and bras 1991 zhu et al 2006 as well as to determine effective soil hydraulic properties zhu and mohanty 2002ab 2003 2004 ahuja et al 2010 smith and diekkrüger 1996 zhu and sun 2012 ojha et al 2017 in these studies the flow within a column has been described either by 1 d richards equation or the green ampt model vereecken et al 2007 however it is worth noting that despite the extensive use of streamtube models to account for soil heterogeneity in flow and transport studies very less attention has been given to its limitations and applicability as streamtube model is an approximation for 3 d natural soil fields a detailed investigation of its ability to simulate water movement under various field conditions is essential before it can be reliably used for modeling only a few studies have investigated the applicability of streamtube model in heterogeneous soil fields most notable being protopapas and bras 1991 or and rubin 1993 chen et al 1994a b and leij et al 2006 protopapas and bras 1991 compared the 2 d approximate solutions obtained using streamtube approach with those obtained using exact 2 d analytical solutions considering variability in saturated hydraulic conductivity k s and linear relation between hydraulic conductivity k and moisture content θ it was observed that for uniform application of water at the surface the heterogeneous soil medium could be represented by a set of non interacting columns or and rubin 1993 investigated the ability of the parallel column model proposed in rubin and or 1999 to reconstruct 2 d steady flow solutions for heterogeneous media with variability in the hydraulic parameters k s and gardner russo parameter α g r and plant rooting depth they observed that parallel column models provide reliable estimates of pressure head h and saturation s chen et al 1994a b developed green ampt model based on streamtube approach for predicting field scale average water movement in spatially heterogeneous soils considering variability in k s in horizontal direction only and compared areal mean water saturation profiles with respective results from 3 d finite difference model the green ampt based model showed good agreement with the 3 d model the streamtube approach neglects the lateral flow between the soil columns which could become prominent if columns become longer and narrower or if they exhibit a greater contrast in hydraulic properties leij et al 2006 investigated the error caused by ignoring lateral movement in streamtube models they derived analytical expressions to describe flow in a medium of two parallel columns under infiltration for both 2 d vertical and horizontal flow and 1 d vertical flow conditions horizontal flux and the relative error between 1 d and 2 d solutions were computed for different soil types it was found that the relative error was highly affected by the differences in the k s between the columns while these studies have focused on investigating the ability of streamtube model for predicting water movement the studies conducted by protopapas and bras 1991 leij et al 2006 and or and rubin 1993 have been restricted to 2d flows further chen et al 1994a b and protopapas and bras 1991 have been restricted to spatial variation in k s moreover the effects of variation in correlation length scale and correlation between soil hydraulic properties have not been analysed real world situations involve complicated 3 d flow regimes originating from time dependent forcing conditions imposed at the soil surface therefore in this study the results for soil moisture obtained from streamtube model are compared with 3 d numerical model for heterogeneous soils to model flow in heterogeneous unsaturated soils accounting for spatial variability in all the soil hydraulic properties would be most comprehensive however it would increase the computational cost manifold earlier studies based on experimental and numerical investigations of soil fields have indicated that at field scale variability in k s and van genuchten parameter α dominates byers and stephens 1983 kavvas et al 1996 nielsen et al 1973 russo and bresler 1982 and the variability in these parameters has been used by many researchers to give reliable estimates of effective flow parameters e g bresler and dagan 1983 chen et al 1994a b dagan and bresler 1983 destouni 1992 russo 1995 zhu and mohanty 2002a b 2004 thus the variability in k s and α is only considered in this analysis other soil hydraulic parameters are assumed to be constant in this study the ability of streamtube model to predict soil moisture for a 3d unsaturated heterogeneous soil field is investigated the heterogeneity in 3 d soil field is represented by considering variation in both α and k s in the streamtube models two cases of heterogeneity are investigated i variability in k s only and ii variability in both k s and α the specific objectives of this study are 1 to investigate the ability of streamtube model to model flow in unsaturated heterogeneous soils and 2 to develop a simple regression model to predict the mean field soil moisture for heterogeneous 3 d sandy soil fields at different depth and time given the mean field soil moisture obtained from streamtube approach for spatially varying soil hydraulic properties for a rainfall event 2 methodology to meet the objective of this study the following approach will be followed 1 a finite difference model for solving 1 d and 3 d richards equation will be developed 2 random fields of auto and cross correlated hydraulic parameters of both k s and α will be generated 3 the numerical models and the random fields will be integrated to create three different numerical schemes two based on the streamtube model and one 3 d numerical model for heterogeneous soils 4 the flow field will be simulated using the three numerical schemes for different rainfall intensities and varying soil properties 5 the mean field scale soil moisture and velocity calculated using the three numerical schemes will be compared and 6 a regression model will be developed to describe mean field soil moisture for 3 d heterogeneous sandy soils the details of the developed 3 d and 1 d numerical model and random number generation of hydraulic parameters are provided in the sub sections to follow the numerical schemes utilized to investigate the prediction ability of streamtube approach are described in section 3 2 1 domain setup and mathematical framework 2 1 1 physical domain the purpose of our study is to model flow through heterogeneous soil field under a rainfall event for this a 3d heterogeneous field of size 15 m 15 m 2 m with spatial discretization of 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 1 m respectively was set up under the streamtube approximation the 3 d soil field is assumed to be a collection of homogeneous soil columns and each soil column is of 2 m depth root water uptake was ignored in this study 2 1 2 governing equation richards equation is the governing equation that describes the flow in variably saturated porous media richards 1931 the three dimensional continuity equation combined with darcy buckingham equation results in the modified form of richards s equation for a homogeneous and anisotropic system that also includes saturated zone component in its general form celia et al 1990 dogan and motz 2005 1 x k x h h x y k y h h y z k z h h z 1 q ext θ t s w s s h t where k x h k y h and k z h are hydraulic conductivities in the x y and z directions respectively and z is positive upwards q ext is volumetric source or sink term h is pressure head s w is saturation ratio s s is specific storage θ is the moisture content and t is time 2 1 3 mathematical formulation the numerical model for solving 1d and 3d richards equation was based on dogan 1999 and dogan and motz 2005 finite difference approximation with modified picard s iteration scheme was used to solve the modified richards equation the developed 1d and 3d code was validated against the example problems given in dogan and motz 2005 example no 1 which is 1d infiltration and redistribution problem and dogan 1999 example no 5 respectively 2 1 4 characterization of the flow parameters van genuchten and neilson relationship van genuchten 1980 was used to describe the unsaturated soil properties at local scale the soil water saturation pressure head and conductivity are related as 2 k r k h k s 1 β 5 m 2 1 β m β m if h 0 3 and k r k h k s 1 if h 0 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 β m if h 0 5 θ h θ s if h 0 where β h h s n m 1 1 n h s is the air entry or bubbling pressure head n is the fitting parameter in the moisture retention curve θ r is residual water content and θ s is the saturated moisture content 2 1 5 boundary and initial conditions bc and ic for the flow field initial and boundary conditions are given by 6 h h i a t t 0 h r 7 a t t o p b o u n d a r y q q 0 f o r t t p 8 a n d h h pond for t t p where h i is initial pressure head and q 0 is water flux applied at top boundary at the soil surface there is a prescribed time dependent flux q 0 till ponding occurs and after ponding fixed head condition where pressure head is equal to h pond where h pond depends upon the topography of cross section for the 3 d and 1 d field the initial condition must be consistent with the boundary conditions and the random fields of the hydraulic properties for each realization the steady state flow equation was solved using the k s and α fields and boundary conditions for an initial pressure head of 10 m and then the obtained pressure head at different grid points was used as the initial condition for the transient simulations the rainfall rate flux q at the surface was varied between 6 and 15 mm hr the maximum rate of rainfall rate was obtained from hourly rainfall records for a weather station located in iit kanpur for the period 2010 2013 indicating an intensity which is practically feasible at the soil surface flux boundary condition was applied till ponding occurred after ponding dirichlet boundary condition was applied at the surface with h 0 m at the bottom free drainage condition was applied for the 3d field no flow boundary condition was applied at left right front and back surfaces 2 2 generation of the flow parameters field several field studies have been conducted for determining spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties and they have been found to be vertically and horizontally correlated boggs et al 1992 bosch and west 1998 byers and stephens 1983 nielsen et al 1973 sudicky 1986 ünlüet al 1990 these studies indicate that k s α and n of the van genuchten model follow lognormal distribution while θ s follows a normal distribution and the variability in k s and α dominates greminger et al 1985 sudicky 1986 buchter et al 1991 russo and bouton 1992 further they have identified that horizontal correlation length scale λ h is much larger than the vertical correlation length scale λ v the vertical correlation values were usually found to be less than 0 5 m and the horizontal correlation length varied approximately between 0 and 5 m based on the findings of the aforementioned studies in this study at the field scale the soil hydraulic parameters k s and α were assumed to follow a lognormal distribution moreover for the 3 d heterogeneous model k s and α were considered auto and cross correlated a 3 d random field generator based on turning band method proposed by mantoglou and wilson 1982 was used to generate correlated random fields of soil hydraulic parameters turning band method can be used to generate 2d and 3d realizations of a stationary correlated multidimensional random field from a normal distribution with zero mean and a specified covariance structure tompson et al 1989 in this method a multidimensional simulation is transformed into the sum of a series of equivalent unidimensional simulations which preserve the statistics of true field and is computationally less intensive mantoglou and wilson 1982 in this study matlab program tbcosim developed by emery 2008 was utilized tbcosim is based on turning band method and can be used for co simulating a set of stationary or intrinsic gaussian random fields in a 3 d random field in which simple and cross covariance functions are fitted by a linear model of coregionalization for generating multivariate random field of l o g k s and l o g α using tbcosim 10 000 lines were used and l o g k s and l o g α were assumed to follow exponential and exponential sine variogram model 3 design of numerical scheme the 1 d and 3 d models were integrated with the generated random numbers to create three different numerical schemes fig 1 shows the details of the three numerical schemes and the steps followed for investigating the prediction ability of streamtube approach the different numerical schemes are described below a numerical 3d this scheme was implemented for monte carlo simulations of 3d heterogeneous field having hydraulic properties with different horizontal and vertical correlation length scales for 3d heterogeneous field of size 15 m 15 m 2 m with spatial discretization 0 3 m 0 3 m and 0 1 m respectively variability in both k s and α is assumed for an example fig 2 a and b show a 3 d heterogeneous soil field with variability in l o g k s and log α for λ h 2 m λ v 0 2 m and σ 2 0 2 λ h λ v a n d σ 2 a r e s a m e f o r b o t h k s a n d α the μ l o g k s and μ l o g α for log normal distribution of k s and α are 2 81 and 1 45 respectively earlier studies have suggested that when the study domain is sufficiently large to ensure ergodicity in the first moment statistics obtained from a single realization may be substituted for ensemble mean statistics without significant errors dagan 1989 however in this study since the domain size was not much larger than the horizontal correlation length scale 500 random fields for a specific set of parameters were generated monte carlo simulations were run for these random fields and the average values obtained for the flow fields were utilized for comparison of results fig 3 shows the effect of the number of realizations on estimates of mean soil moisture and darcy s velocity field for λ h 5 m λ v 0 6 m σ 2 0 6 and q 9 m m h r for all cases convergence in soil moisture and darcy s velocity fields were observed for n 300 random fields and therefore this number was selected it has been observed that no flow boundary condition exerts some influence on statistical structure of the 3 d random field fiori and russo 2007 therefore while computing mean statistics for the numerical 3d zones including 1 5 m from the no flow boundaries were not considered in the averaging domain a total of 10 800 36 different soil parameters and flux combinations 300 realizations 3 d simulations were carried out for t 50 hr b numerical 1d ks this scheme was implemented for monte carlo simulations i e to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the streamtube approximation assuming the variability in k s only in this scheme first a random value of k s was drawn from a prescribed lognormal distribution then for the k s numerical solution of the 1d richards equation was obtained similarly 1000 such monte carlo simulations were utilized to obtain the soil moisture at different depths e θ z t c numerical 1d ks α this scheme was implemented for monte carlo simulations i e to estimate mean soil moisture at different depths using the streamtube approximation assuming the variability in k s and α in this case random values of both k s and α were drawn from their respective log normal distributions and the richards equation was solved similarly n 1000 such monte carlo simulations were utilized to obtain the soil moisture at different depths e θ z t similar to numerical 3d the steady state flow equation was solved for both numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α and then this solution was used as the initial flow field for the transient simulation while solving both 3 d and1 d numerical schemes monte carlo simulation was used it is a stochastic method in which the probability distribution of uncertain parameters is used to generate large number of random samples and their subsequent solution baalousha 2016 as per law of large numbers the mean value obtained from large number of realizations should approximate the expected value the generation for random samples for 1 d case was performed using the random number generator in matlab using their probability distribution for the 3 d case heterogeneous random soil field were generated using turning band method as discussed in sub section 3 6 4 results and discussion to test the ability of streamtube model to predict flow heterogeneous sandy soil was considered for this soil type vertical flow dominates under high recharge rate at the soil surface and the streamtube model is expected to be a good approximation of 3 d soil fields dagan and bresler 1983 in this study the μ l o g k s and μ l o g α for log normal distribution of k s and α and n for a sandy soil were obtained from schaap and leij 1998 and are 2 81 1 45 and 3 16 respectively the λ h λ v and σ 2 were varied between 1 and 5 m 0 1 0 6 m and 0 2 0 6 respectively for both k s and α θ s and θ r were taken to be 0 45 and 0 01 respectively further the θ s and θ r values were taken from rawls et al 1983 and a soil with these properties can be classified as a sandy soil k s and α are assumed to be cross correlated with a cross correlation λ cc of 0 3 the rainfall rate flux q at the surface was varied between 6 and 15 mm hr the results were analyzed for variation in horizontal correlation length scale λ h vertical correlation length scale λ v the rainfall or recharge rate flux q and standard deviation of van genuchten parameters k s and α at the surface for brevity only results for q 6 and 15 mm hr for λ h λ hk s λ h α 2 and 5 m λ v λ vk s λ v α 0 2 and 0 6 m λ cc 0 3 and σ 2 σ l o g k s 2 σ l o g α 2 0 2 and 0 6 are presented further the results have been shown till 1 5 m depth as deeper depths will be more affected by the bottom boundary condition 4 1 comparison of velocity fields to obtain insight into the difference in streamtube and 3 d numerical results mean horizontal and vertical darcy s velocity or flux were calculated and plotted as a function of vertical depth 4 1 1 comparison of vertical velocity in figs 4 and 5 mean vertical darcy s velocity e v z averaged over planes for numerical 3d is compared with the respective values obtained from streamtube models for both numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α at t 2 12 and 48 hr for q 6 mm hr and 15 mm hr respectively the negative values represent the downward movement of flux the absolute vertical velocity is highest near the surface and although there is some upward movement of flux near the bottom at initial time steps due to free drainage the flux direction reverses with time it was observed that the numerical 3d numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α closely resemble each other for all depths at the initial time steps however with increase in time the difference between numerical 3d with numerical 1d ks as well as with numerical 1d ks α increases with time as well as with increase in λ h and λ v with increase in heterogeneity σ 2 recharge rate q and time the difference between numerical 3d model and numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α increases further with increase in recharge rate the performance of the streamtube models does not improve the difference between numerical 3d model numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α can be due to the consideration of vertical heterogeneity for streamtube models vertical variation in k s was constant and despite inclusion of α no significant difference was observed between numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α the absolute vertical flux obtained using numerical 3d numerical 1d ks and numerical 1d ks α model decreases with depth and increases with time the flux at surface increased with time as well as heterogeneity the increase in recharge rate led to increase in flux however the streamtube models were unable to predict velocity with enough accuracy for higher values of λ h and λ v for latter time steps the increase in heterogeneity also led to further decrease in prediction accuracy for streamtube models 4 1 2 comparison of horizontal velocity in fig 6 the variation in average darcy s velocity in y direction e v y obtained from the numerical 3d model was plotted as a function of depth and time the value of e v y was found to be very low order of 10 10 and mostly in negative y direction however with increase in q e v y did not decrease at shallow depths e v y is quite low and decreases with depth with time first increase in e v y and then decrease was observed as the steady state condition is approached it was observed that for shallow depths the horizontal velocity remains similar with increase in recharge rate from q 6 mm hr to 15 mm hr however at deeper ends e v y varied drastically with time increase in σ 2 lead to higher value of e v y for higher recharge rate in fig 7 the variation in e v x as a function of depth as well time was plotted for varying λ h λ v and σ 2 for q 6 and 15 mm hr it is observed that e v x was much higher as compared to e v y at all depths and time steps it is still in order of 10 4 it is observed that for shallow depths e v x remains similar with increase in recharge rate from q 6 mm hr to 15 mm hr as well as with increase in time increase in σ 2 led to higher values of e v x at all depths and time the mean horizontal velocity increases in magnitude with increase in variance the increase in e v x and e v y with increase in σ 2 indicates that with increase in heterogeneity cross flow increases and a streamtube based approach will not be suitable for modeling flow and transport in highly heterogeneous soils the variation of horizontal darcy s velocity with depth is similar to that observed by leij et al 2006 however their study was limited to 2 d field and effect of correlation length scale was not considered the low values of horizontal darcy s velocity indicate that flow is mostly vertical and it increases with time as well as heterogeneity 4 2 comparison of soil moisture to test the ability of streamtube model to predict flow in a heterogeneous soil the percentage difference in mean soil moisture values averaged over planes for numerical 3d to the respective values obtained from streamtube models for both numerical 1d ksand numerical 1d ks α at different depths and time intervals respectively are shown in figs 8 and 9 for q 6 and 15 mm hr respectively the percentage difference error is defined as 9 e r r o r e θ z t 1 d e θ z t 3 d e θ z t 3 d 100 where e θ z t 1 d is the mean soil moisture observed at any depth and time from 1 d numerical schemes numerical 1d ks or numerical 1d ks α and e θ z t 3 d is the mean soil moisture observed at any depth and time from numerical 3d scheme in figs 8 and 9 the variation of error is plotted with depth for different times for recharge rate 6 mm hr and 15 mm hr respectively fig 8 a c e g and fig 9 a c e g represent the error between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks while fig 8 b d f h and fig 9 b d f h represent that between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks α it is observed that numerical 1d ks under predicts numerical 3d model for shallow depths and vice versa for deeper regions however with increase in time the performance of numerical 1d ks model improves with increase in variance the error increases increase in λ h and λ v also leads to an increase in error however it is less prominent than that observed for increase in variance it is also observed that increase in recharge rate leads to decrease in error see fig 8 a c e g and fig 9 a c e g as the prediction ability of streamtube models increases with increase in recharge rate from fig 8 b d f h and fig 9 b d f h it can be observed that numerical 1d ks α closely approximates numerical 3d model resulting in much lower values of error the decrease in error is due to improvement in prediction ability of streamtube models caused by inclusion of variability in α similar to fig 8 a c e g and fig 9 a c e g error decreases with increase in time and the increase in heterogeneity did lead to increase in error however its magnitude is much lower increase in λ h and λ v also lead to increase in error the comparison of error results showed numerical 1d ks α is able to predict numerical 3d much better as compared to numerical 1d ks the results suggest that a streamtube model incorporating variability in ks and α can reliably predict the 3 d field response studies have recommended that streamtube model performs better at higher recharge rate however when only variability in k s is considered i e in numerical 1d ks model the difference between mean soil moisture for 3 d heterogeneous soil and 1 d streamtube model is high the variation in results might be due to the initial condition that has been considered in this study one of the assumptions in streamtube model is that the water content is initially deterministic and homogenous throughout the field in practicality homogeneous initial condition is rarely available in our study the initial condition was no longer homogenous results from this study also suggest that with increase in number of soil hydraulic parameters with significant spatial variability in an unsaturated soil a reliable prediction of flow and transport can be observed even by using streamtube based models however this requires incorporating spatial variability in a greater number of soil hydraulic parameters 4 3 development of regression model regression methods are often used to simplify a highly complex model with a simplified response surface helton et al 1991 in this study a simplified regression model was developed that can be used to predict mean soil moisture for 3 d heterogeneous sandy soil field the mean soil moisture values of numerical 3d e θ z t 3 d were considered as the dependent or the output parameter of the regression model while soil moisture values of numerical 1d e θ z t 1 d were considered as the independent variable regression analysis was performed for two cases case 1 in which mean soil moisture values of numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks were considered and case 2 in which mean soil moisture values of numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks α were considered while developing the regression model soil moisture values upto 1 5 m depth were considered the models were compared by their respective r2 and normalized root mean square error nrmse values nrmse was calculated as given below 10 n r m s e 1 v i 1 v y obs i y cal i 2 y obs m a x y obs m i n where y obs i is the observed value of error and y cal i is the error value obtained from the model y obs m a x y obs m i n and v are the maximum minimum value and total number of observed errors respectively it was also observed that the regression models performed better when the independent parameters were kept in their dimensional form different types of regression models were considered some of them being exponential and polynomial models of various degree in fig 10 a b the soil moisture e θ z t 3 d obtained from numerical 3d models has been compared against that obtained from streamtube model an exponential model was observed to be a better fit between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks while a linear model was observed to be better fit between numerical 3d and numerical 1d ks α the resultant models along with their coefficients for case 1 and 2 are given by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 11 e θ z t 3 d 0 1706 e x p 0 7910 e θ z t 1 d 0 2473 e x p 30 21 e θ z t 1 d 12 e θ z t 3 d 0 9682 e θ z t 1 d 0 0026 for case 1 and case 2 r2 values were 0 80 and 0 99 respectively while the nrmse values were 0 11 and 0 024 respectively the linear regression model in case 2 performs much better than case 1 in fig 10 c d e θ z t values obtained from regression models were compared with the actual values for both case1 and case 2 it was observed that the scatter plot had higher variance for case 1 while lower variance for case 2 for the validation of the regression model k fold cross validation method is used in this method the subset dataset was further divided in k subsets and k 1 subsets were used as training data and the kth subset was used as testing data this process was repeated k time and average error across k was computed in our study 10 fold cross validation method was used to validate the linear regression model and nrmse values were compared it was observed that nrmse varied between 0 11 and 0 16 for case 1 and 0 02 to 0 03 for case 2 respectively overall the regression model reliably predicts the mean field soil moisture for sandy soils 5 conclusion in this study the average darcy s flux and mean soil moisture values predicted using streamtube models are compared against that of numerical solutions obtained for a 3d heterogeneous field with varying horizontal and vertical correlation length scale at different recharge rate for a sandy soil for the streamtube model the heterogeneity was considered either in saturated hydraulic conductivity k s or in both k s and van genuchten parameter α and both the parameters were assumed to follow a log normal distribution the prediction ability of streamtube model is affected by recharge rate hydraulic properties and correlation length scales of the soil field the prediction accuracy of streamtube models decreases with increase in variance increase in horizontal and vertical correlation length scales don t always lead to improvement in prediction capability inclusion of variability of α in the streamtube model leads to significant improvement in its prediction capability the respective error between numerical 1d ks α and numerical 3d are significantly lower than those of numerical 1d ks and numerical 3d numerical 1d ks α can predict mean soil moisture with greater accuracy at shallow depths however streamtube model was not able to predict vertical darcy s flux with sufficient accuracy the regression equations developed in this study can be used for prediction of average soil moisture in the field by using streamtube model the proposed equations require far less computational effort when compared to solving 3 d richards equation for heterogeneous soils for estimating surface soil moisture under transient flow conditions furthermore while this study is limited to sandy soil it can give some insight to modelers about the error they can expect when describing water movement using streamtube approach for any other soil type within the unsaturated zone credit authorship

object of future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area and sample collection the study was conducted in jingtai county near the lanzhou university of technology experimental station in the middle of the western portion of china s gansu province on the east side of the hexi corridor at the junction of provinces of gansu ningxia and inner mongolia fig 1 brown desert soil and sierozem are the predominant soils in this area the climate is intermediate between continental monsoon and non monsoon zones with a mean annual temperature of 8 2 c fluctuating from 27 3 to 36 6 c from the winter to summer seasons the mean annual precipitation is 185 mm with a rainy season accounting for approximately 61 4 of the annual rainfall from july to september the mean annual evaporation is 3038 mm with an annual average evaporation precipitation ratio of 16 all the climatic parameters are obtained from local meteorological administration the experiment was performed to study the pattern of the spatial variation of swc in gravel mulched fields the fields were 32 32 m2 and consisted of a new gravel mulched field new planted 10 years ago a moderately aged gravel mulched field mod planted for 25 30 years an old gravel mulched field old planted for 45 60 years li 2003 and bare land no vegetation or sand as a control check swc was measured nearly weekly from may to august 2013 may to august 2014 july to october 2015 and june to september 2016 the surface sand was carefully removed soil samples were collected using a soil auger from 1 1 m2 quadrats from 0 to 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers at a total of 64 sampling locations established every 4 m along two perpendicular transects fig 2 each soil core weighed 60 70 g the soil depths and sampling locations were determined using generalized processor sharing gps the swc of all samples were determined by weighing before and after oven drying then the samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove roots stones and other debris rainfall was measured using a rain gauge texas electronics inc dallas tx usa the particle sizes were measured by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern instruments malvern england 2 2 analysis methods the analysis of temporal stability was based on the parametric test of relative differences vachaud et al 1985 which we briefly describe the relative difference δ ij at location i and time j is given by 1 δ ij θ ij θ j θ j where θ ij is the swc at location i i 1 n at time j j 1 m and θ j is the spatial mean for each sampling day 2 θ j 1 n i 1 n θ ij for each location i the mean δ i and standard deviation σ δ i of the temporal mean of relative differences were given by 3 δ i 1 m j 1 m δ ij 4 σ δ i 1 m 1 j 1 m δ ij δ i 2 a positive δ i for a sampling location indicates that the location is wetter than the mean whereas a negative δ i indicates that the location is drier than the mean σ δ i specifies the variability of an estimate to include both δ i and σ δ i thus providing a single indicator of the most temporally stable location of mean swc we used an index of temporal stability its zhao et al 2010 as 5 its i δ i 2 σ δ i 2 the sampling location with the lowest its is thus the most temporally stable whereas locations with a high its are the wettest and driest the coefficient of variation cv of each sampling day c v j was calculated as 6 c v j σ j θ j 1 n 1 i 1 n θ ij θ j 2 θ j where σ j is the standard deviation of the site on day j a c v j 10 indicates low variation 10 c v j 100 indicate moderate variation and a c v j 100 indicates high variation lei et al 1988 rmse i and the mean error me i were determined to further assess the predictive accuracy of the representative location and were calculated as 7 me i 1 m j 1 m θ ij θ j 8 rmse i j 1 m θ ij θ j 2 m rmse i ranges from 0 to 1 a low me i and a low rmse i indicate high predictive accuracy zhao et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 the spatiotemporal behavior of swc fig 3 shows the boxplots of the field swc data for 2013 the lower and upper limits of each box represent the lower and upper quartiles while the two whiskers indicated the minimum and maximum value in each data set and the horizontal line within the box marks the median the area of the box is known as the inter quartile range iqr points at a greater distance from the median than 1 5 times the iqr are plotted individually as asterisks these points represent potential outliers which are excluded before data analysis in most cases the field mean swc was strongly dependent on rainfall and increased sharply after a storm and decreased slowly in periods without rain fig 4 also because successive rainfalls were happened from july 6 2013 there s not enough time for all the rainfall to infiltrate into the soil as a result a considerable part of the rainfall is temporarily stored in the mulched gravel layer and then slowly released into the soil after rainfall events swc was strongly correlated with seasonal changes low during may and june but substantially higher in july and august swcs were much higher in the gravel mulched fields than the bare land fig 3 in different periods and at the various depths with a general trend of new mod old check consistent with the results reported by li 2003 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 and ma et al 2013 this trend may have been due to the disruption of the interface between the soil and gravel over time which would decrease the water storage capacity and degrade the gravel mulched fields wang et al 2012 2015 the swcs of new mod and check increased with depth i e 0 10 10 30 30 50 cm penna et al 2013 however reported that swc decreased with depth and that swc was less variable in the surface layer than in deeper layers this different law of swc variation may be due to the gravel mulch on the surface can conserve water and increase infiltration the swcs of old however had a trend of 0 10 30 50 10 30 cm which disagreed with all previously mentioned results likely because the gravel gradually mixed with the soil over time which impeded infiltration due to the decrease in gravel porosity and the compaction of the gravel layer the statistical analysis provided information for swc at various layers in the four study areas for improving the efficiency of water use efficiency and vegetation restoration in arid regions the swcs of new mod and old have larger dynamic ranges at all layers as the iqrs are generally larger than those of check indicating greater swc variability of gravel mulched fields spatial variability expressed as cvs was also similar among the layers swc variability was higher in the surface soil perhaps due to one or more environmental factors e g evaporation and rainfall and the variability of swc gradually decreased with depth in good accordance with most previous studies of swc spatial variability lannoy et al 2006 choi and jacobs 2007 sur et al 2013 zhong et al 2014 swc variability however was high in check in the 0 10 cm layer where the variability was higher only for new swc variability in the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers had trends of new mod old check perhaps because the shorter periods of mulching were more easily influenced by rainfall topography vegetation and human activity the surface layer of check without the protection of a gravel mulch was more sensitive to the effects of rainfall and the trample of human and livestock compared to gravel mulched fields but the deeper layers were less affected for limiting infiltration in 2013 the spatiotemporal mean swcs in 2013 in the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers were 11 7 12 9 and 14 0 with cvs of 20 68 16 45 and 12 70 respectively in new 10 6 11 5 and 12 5 with cvs of 14 70 13 44 and 11 83 respectively in mod 9 4 10 6 and 10 0 with cvs of 13 16 12 12 and 11 20 respectively in old and 4 7 6 8 and 9 4 with cvs of 15 60 10 58 and 9 56 respectively in check the cvs were 10 for most of the sampling campaigns indicating moderate variation in terms of a certain layer of each field cv is negatively correlated with its swc the higher the swcs the lower variability it has which suggests that when soil become wetter the more hydrologically homogeneous it is maps of the spatial distribution of swc in the 0 10 cm layers of the four fields were obtained using kriging interpolation for the most recent data i e from 26 september 2016 fig 5 the kriging maps of swc fig 5 showed the horizontal and vertical distributions in each layer at each scale swc was irregularly distributed with peaks and valleys in all four fields the distributions were strongly affected by the interactions and feedbacks between water soil retention characteristics mediated by soil texture organic content and macropores these different distributions have been attributed to the scale of topographic variability across each field differences in soils organic content and macropores swc was most variable in new followed by check and mod and old had fewer peaks and more uniform distributions the decrease in the number of peaks over time was in agreement with the cvs and boxplots this suggests that the influence of both mixing ratio of soil and gravel of the surface layer and terrain metrics can create distinct differences in swcs between fields with different period of gravel mulching despite extensive research on spatial patterns of swc across scales plot scale variability has received less attention we suggest that understanding how plot scale variability in swc changes across a field and across wetness states is critical to inform the management of land use 3 2 effect of period of gravel mulching on swc swcs were much higher in the gravel mulched fields than the bare land and decreased over time swc varied most in the 0 10 cm layer fig 6 the higher swcs of the gravel mulched fields compared to the bare land tended to decrease with depth the percentage increase in swc of the gravel mulched fields relative to the bare land tended to decrease with time and depth the percentage increases in the swcs of the gravel mulched fields relative to the bare land were calculated table 1 mean swcs for the 0 50 cm layers in the bare land were 7 5 9 10 7 7 0 and 6 1 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively mean swcs were 94 70 94 07 90 4 and 87 83 higher in new 75 43 74 4 65 87 and 63 5 higher in mod and 53 33 53 67 47 53 and 46 50 higher in old than the bare land in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the percentage increases in swcs relative to the bare land for the three gravel mulched fields decreased over time perhaps due to natural e g rainwater erosion or anthropogenic damage e g improper tillage fertilization or irrigation that disrupted the interface between the soil and gravel and thus the benefits of water retention structural changes over time would gradually degenerate gravel sand mulches and the accumulated small changes would eventually lead to the larger differences of swc among new mod old and check applying gravel mulches is time consuming and labor intensive and mechanized farming has not yet become universal in this region the degradation caused by various reasons decreases the sustainability of land use which is a serious threat to the survival and development of gravel mulched fields our analysis indicated that the swcs of gravel mulched fields tended to return to that of bare land over time fields eventually become exhausted and fail when too much of the gravel and sand layer becomes mixed with the soil so the effectiveness of water conservation decreases li 2003 the results and data presented here can be useful to determine the effectiveness of water conservation as a function of the degeneration of the gravel mulch thus this study identified the influence of the degradation of gravel mulch on the conservation of water and provided a theoretical reference for resolving the degeneration 3 3 temporal stability and representative sampling locations temporal stability was analyzed for all four fields by applying the concept of temporal stability expressed as δ i σ δ i vachaud et al 1985 and its fig 7 the analysis identified the locations most representative of the field mean swc where swc should be measured or a continuous sensor should be installed for estimating the field mean swc identifying representative locations will save both time and money temporal stability increased with depth in all four fields the range of variation of σ δ i and δ i decreased gradually with depth in agreement with the result of previous studies choi and jacobs 2007 pan et al 2009 hu et al 2009 bai and shao 2011 penna et al 2013 liu et al 2014 such behavior is presumably due to the amount of time that the water needs to percolate from surface to deeper layers so the temporal variation of swc is lower at depth than in the first centimeters of soil the agreement with previous studies suggests that these results should be applicable in other physiographic regions at least in principle swc measurements were lower and more variable in the 0 10 cm layer than the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers with the aim to reduce cost optimize time and increase sampling frequency several studies have successfully identified locations where swc is the most temporally stable for representing a given region brocca et al 2009 penna et al 2013 wang et al 2013a b zucco et al 2014 σ δ i δ i and its were used as indicators for identifying the most representative locations dari et al 2019 the best locations have σ δ i near zero the lowest δ i and the lowest its zhao et al 2010 accordingly the most temporally stable locations were identified with the lowest σ δ i δ i and its locations 53 35 and 15 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for check locations 1 44 and 44 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for new locations 7 42 and 15 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for mod and locations 4 54 and 35 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for old fig 7 δ i ranges were 0 0911 for location 53 0 0691 for location 35 and 0 0584 for location 15 in check 0 1291 for location 1 0 1072 for location 44 and 0 0749 for location 44 in new 0 0541 for location 7 0 0951 for location 42 and 0 0788 for location 15 in mod and 0 0780 for location 4 0 0823 for location 54 and 0 0791 for location 35 in old these locations can be used to capture the wetness states and to extrapolate point measurements to field scales plot scale variability tens of meters of soil water content could further be extrapolated point measures to larger areas also according to the negative correlation between swcs and cvs the author discussed earlier in the article representative locations should best predict soil water content in the wet preferred soil state and perform poorly in the dry soil state western and blöschl 1999 we also analyzed the effective errors using only the representative location for estimating the field mean swc we randomly selected measured field mean swcs for 2014 2015 and 2016 to test the accuracy of the estimation fig 8 shows the swcs of the representative locations against the field mean swcs as can be seen a very good agreement was obtained with the coefficients of determination r 2 were 0 926 the errors were also very limited with a maximum rmse of 0 308 a maximum me of 0 250 and relative errors ranging between 9 38 and 4 17 table 2 and table 3 the high r2 and low rmse and me for all fields indicated that the selected representative locations derived from the temporally stable locations therefore represented the fields well within an allowable error range martínez fernández and ceballos 2005 schneider et al 2008 our results provide valuable support for using swc measurements for managing swc and hydrological applications for example brocca et al 2013 2015 used swc observations in the upper tiber river valley to design an in situ network of swc sensors for improving our understanding of rainfall runoff transformation these findings can be further confirmed and extended for the implementation of similar procedures in other regions and climates the usefulness of a continuously operating swc sensor network and a more detailed analysis of gravel mulched fields are thus necessary to corroborate all the results we obtained particularly considering the effects of other factors such as the heterogeneity of vegetation 4 conclusions this study analyzed swc data collected from three fields mulched with gravel for different planting years and from bare land the control in three layers over four years with the following conclusions i swcs were much higher in the gravel mulched fields than the bare land with a general trend of new mod old check and were irregularly distributed with peaks and valleys in all four fields the swcs of new mod and check increased with depth i e 0 10 10 30 30 50 cm but the swcs of old had a trend of 0 10 30 50 10 30 cm swc was moderately variable and tended to decrease with depth swc was highly variable in check in the 0 10 cm layer where the variability was higher only for new the variabilities of the swcs in the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers had trends of new mod old check ii natural or anthropogenic damage may be disrupting the interface between the soil and the gravel and thus the benefits of water retention more gravel mixed with the soil over time resulting in structural changes and the gradual degeneration of the gravel mulch the percentage increases of the gravel mulched fields compared to the bare land tended to decrease with depth and with years of planting iii temporal stability increased with depth in all four fields the range of σ δ i and δ i decreased gradually with depth indicating that swc was lower and more variable in the 0 10 cm layer than the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers the representative locations representative of field mean swc in all four fields were identified the measured field mean swcs for 2014 2015 and 2016 were used to test the accuracy of the estimation with rmses 0 308 and r 2 0 926 we can then conclude that the representative locations are quite reliable for estimating the field mean swcs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

27 3 to 36 6 c from the winter to summer seasons the mean annual precipitation is 185 mm with a rainy season accounting for approximately 61 4 of the annual rainfall from july to september the mean annual evaporation is 3038 mm with an annual average evaporation precipitation ratio of 16 all the climatic parameters are obtained from local meteorological administration the experiment was performed to study the pattern of the spatial variation of swc in gravel mulched fields the fields were 32 32 m2 and consisted of a new gravel mulched field new planted 10 years ago a moderately aged gravel mulched field mod planted for 25 30 years an old gravel mulched field old planted for 45 60 years li 2003 and bare land no vegetation or sand as a control check swc was measured nearly weekly from may to august 2013 may to august 2014 july to october 2015 and june to september 2016 the surface sand was carefully removed soil samples were collected using a soil auger from 1 1 m2 quadrats from 0 to 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers at a total of 64 sampling locations established every 4 m along two perpendicular transects fig 2 each soil core weighed 60 70 g the soil depths and sampling locations were determined using generalized processor sharing gps the swc of all samples were determined by weighing before and after oven drying then the samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove roots stones and other debris rainfall was measured using a rain gauge texas electronics inc dallas tx usa the particle sizes were measured by a laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern instruments malvern england 2 2 analysis methods the analysis of temporal stability was based on the parametric test of relative differences vachaud et al 1985 which we briefly describe the relative difference δ ij at location i and time j is given by 1 δ ij θ ij θ j θ j where θ ij is the swc at location i i 1 n at time j j 1 m and θ j is the spatial mean for each sampling day 2 θ j 1 n i 1 n θ ij for each location i the mean δ i and standard deviation σ δ i of the temporal mean of relative differences were given by 3 δ i 1 m j 1 m δ ij 4 σ δ i 1 m 1 j 1 m δ ij δ i 2 a positive δ i for a sampling location indicates that the location is wetter than the mean whereas a negative δ i indicates that the location is drier than the mean σ δ i specifies the variability of an estimate to include both δ i and σ δ i thus providing a single indicator of the most temporally stable location of mean swc we used an index of temporal stability its zhao et al 2010 as 5 its i δ i 2 σ δ i 2 the sampling location with the lowest its is thus the most temporally stable whereas locations with a high its are the wettest and driest the coefficient of variation cv of each sampling day c v j was calculated as 6 c v j σ j θ j 1 n 1 i 1 n θ ij θ j 2 θ j where σ j is the standard deviation of the site on day j a c v j 10 indicates low variation 10 c v j 100 indicate moderate variation and a c v j 100 indicates high variation lei et al 1988 rmse i and the mean error me i were determined to further assess the predictive accuracy of the representative location and were calculated as 7 me i 1 m j 1 m θ ij θ j 8 rmse i j 1 m θ ij θ j 2 m rmse i ranges from 0 to 1 a low me i and a low rmse i indicate high predictive accuracy zhao et al 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 the spatiotemporal behavior of swc fig 3 shows the boxplots of the field swc data for 2013 the lower and upper limits of each box represent the lower and upper quartiles while the two whiskers indicated the minimum and maximum value in each data set and the horizontal line within the box marks the median the area of the box is known as the inter quartile range iqr points at a greater distance from the median than 1 5 times the iqr are plotted individually as asterisks these points represent potential outliers which are excluded before data analysis in most cases the field mean swc was strongly dependent on rainfall and increased sharply after a storm and decreased slowly in periods without rain fig 4 also because successive rainfalls were happened from july 6 2013 there s not enough time for all the rainfall to infiltrate into the soil as a result a considerable part of the rainfall is temporarily stored in the mulched gravel layer and then slowly released into the soil after rainfall events swc was strongly correlated with seasonal changes low during may and june but substantially higher in july and august swcs were much higher in the gravel mulched fields than the bare land fig 3 in different periods and at the various depths with a general trend of new mod old check consistent with the results reported by li 2003 wang et al 2010 wang et al 2012 and ma et al 2013 this trend may have been due to the disruption of the interface between the soil and gravel over time which would decrease the water storage capacity and degrade the gravel mulched fields wang et al 2012 2015 the swcs of new mod and check increased with depth i e 0 10 10 30 30 50 cm penna et al 2013 however reported that swc decreased with depth and that swc was less variable in the surface layer than in deeper layers this different law of swc variation may be due to the gravel mulch on the surface can conserve water and increase infiltration the swcs of old however had a trend of 0 10 30 50 10 30 cm which disagreed with all previously mentioned results likely because the gravel gradually mixed with the soil over time which impeded infiltration due to the decrease in gravel porosity and the compaction of the gravel layer the statistical analysis provided information for swc at various layers in the four study areas for improving the efficiency of water use efficiency and vegetation restoration in arid regions the swcs of new mod and old have larger dynamic ranges at all layers as the iqrs are generally larger than those of check indicating greater swc variability of gravel mulched fields spatial variability expressed as cvs was also similar among the layers swc variability was higher in the surface soil perhaps due to one or more environmental factors e g evaporation and rainfall and the variability of swc gradually decreased with depth in good accordance with most previous studies of swc spatial variability lannoy et al 2006 choi and jacobs 2007 sur et al 2013 zhong et al 2014 swc variability however was high in check in the 0 10 cm layer where the variability was higher only for new swc variability in the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers had trends of new mod old check perhaps because the shorter periods of mulching were more easily influenced by rainfall topography vegetation and human activity the surface layer of check without the protection of a gravel mulch was more sensitive to the effects of rainfall and the trample of human and livestock compared to gravel mulched fields but the deeper layers were less affected for limiting infiltration in 2013 the spatiotemporal mean swcs in 2013 in the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers were 11 7 12 9 and 14 0 with cvs of 20 68 16 45 and 12 70 respectively in new 10 6 11 5 and 12 5 with cvs of 14 70 13 44 and 11 83 respectively in mod 9 4 10 6 and 10 0 with cvs of 13 16 12 12 and 11 20 respectively in old and 4 7 6 8 and 9 4 with cvs of 15 60 10 58 and 9 56 respectively in check the cvs were 10 for most of the sampling campaigns indicating moderate variation in terms of a certain layer of each field cv is negatively correlated with its swc the higher the swcs the lower variability it has which suggests that when soil become wetter the more hydrologically homogeneous it is maps of the spatial distribution of swc in the 0 10 cm layers of the four fields were obtained using kriging interpolation for the most recent data i e from 26 september 2016 fig 5 the kriging maps of swc fig 5 showed the horizontal and vertical distributions in each layer at each scale swc was irregularly distributed with peaks and valleys in all four fields the distributions were strongly affected by the interactions and feedbacks between water soil retention characteristics mediated by soil texture organic content and macropores these different distributions have been attributed to the scale of topographic variability across each field differences in soils organic content and macropores swc was most variable in new followed by check and mod and old had fewer peaks and more uniform distributions the decrease in the number of peaks over time was in agreement with the cvs and boxplots this suggests that the influence of both mixing ratio of soil and gravel of the surface layer and terrain metrics can create distinct differences in swcs between fields with different period of gravel mulching despite extensive research on spatial patterns of swc across scales plot scale variability has received less attention we suggest that understanding how plot scale variability in swc changes across a field and across wetness states is critical to inform the management of land use 3 2 effect of period of gravel mulching on swc swcs were much higher in the gravel mulched fields than the bare land and decreased over time swc varied most in the 0 10 cm layer fig 6 the higher swcs of the gravel mulched fields compared to the bare land tended to decrease with depth the percentage increase in swc of the gravel mulched fields relative to the bare land tended to decrease with time and depth the percentage increases in the swcs of the gravel mulched fields relative to the bare land were calculated table 1 mean swcs for the 0 50 cm layers in the bare land were 7 5 9 10 7 7 0 and 6 1 in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively mean swcs were 94 70 94 07 90 4 and 87 83 higher in new 75 43 74 4 65 87 and 63 5 higher in mod and 53 33 53 67 47 53 and 46 50 higher in old than the bare land in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the percentage increases in swcs relative to the bare land for the three gravel mulched fields decreased over time perhaps due to natural e g rainwater erosion or anthropogenic damage e g improper tillage fertilization or irrigation that disrupted the interface between the soil and gravel and thus the benefits of water retention structural changes over time would gradually degenerate gravel sand mulches and the accumulated small changes would eventually lead to the larger differences of swc among new mod old and check applying gravel mulches is time consuming and labor intensive and mechanized farming has not yet become universal in this region the degradation caused by various reasons decreases the sustainability of land use which is a serious threat to the survival and development of gravel mulched fields our analysis indicated that the swcs of gravel mulched fields tended to return to that of bare land over time fields eventually become exhausted and fail when too much of the gravel and sand layer becomes mixed with the soil so the effectiveness of water conservation decreases li 2003 the results and data presented here can be useful to determine the effectiveness of water conservation as a function of the degeneration of the gravel mulch thus this study identified the influence of the degradation of gravel mulch on the conservation of water and provided a theoretical reference for resolving the degeneration 3 3 temporal stability and representative sampling locations temporal stability was analyzed for all four fields by applying the concept of temporal stability expressed as δ i σ δ i vachaud et al 1985 and its fig 7 the analysis identified the locations most representative of the field mean swc where swc should be measured or a continuous sensor should be installed for estimating the field mean swc identifying representative locations will save both time and money temporal stability increased with depth in all four fields the range of variation of σ δ i and δ i decreased gradually with depth in agreement with the result of previous studies choi and jacobs 2007 pan et al 2009 hu et al 2009 bai and shao 2011 penna et al 2013 liu et al 2014 such behavior is presumably due to the amount of time that the water needs to percolate from surface to deeper layers so the temporal variation of swc is lower at depth than in the first centimeters of soil the agreement with previous studies suggests that these results should be applicable in other physiographic regions at least in principle swc measurements were lower and more variable in the 0 10 cm layer than the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers with the aim to reduce cost optimize time and increase sampling frequency several studies have successfully identified locations where swc is the most temporally stable for representing a given region brocca et al 2009 penna et al 2013 wang et al 2013a b zucco et al 2014 σ δ i δ i and its were used as indicators for identifying the most representative locations dari et al 2019 the best locations have σ δ i near zero the lowest δ i and the lowest its zhao et al 2010 accordingly the most temporally stable locations were identified with the lowest σ δ i δ i and its locations 53 35 and 15 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for check locations 1 44 and 44 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for new locations 7 42 and 15 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for mod and locations 4 54 and 35 were respectively for the 0 10 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers for old fig 7 δ i ranges were 0 0911 for location 53 0 0691 for location 35 and 0 0584 for location 15 in check 0 1291 for location 1 0 1072 for location 44 and 0 0749 for location 44 in new 0 0541 for location 7 0 0951 for location 42 and 0 0788 for location 15 in mod and 0 0780 for location 4 0 0823 for location 54 and 0 0791 for location 35 in old these locations can be used to capture the wetness states and to extrapolate point measurements to field scales plot scale variability tens of meters of soil water content could further be extrapolated point measures to larger areas also according to the negative correlation between swcs and cvs the author discussed earlier in the article representative locations should best predict soil water content in the wet preferred soil state and perform poorly in the dry soil state western and blöschl 1999 we also analyzed the effective errors using only the representative location for estimating the field mean swc we randomly selected measured field mean swcs for 2014 2015 and 2016 to test the accuracy of the estimation fig 8 shows the swcs of the representative locations against the field mean swcs as can be seen a very good agreement was obtained with the coefficients of determination r 2 were 0 926 the errors were also very limited with a maximum rmse of 0 308 a maximum me of 0 250 and relative errors ranging between 9 38 and 4 17 table 2 and table 3 the high r2 and low rmse and me for all fields indicated that the selected representative locations derived from the temporally stable locations therefore represented the fields well within an allowable error range martínez fernández and ceballos 2005 schneider et al 2008 our results provide valuable support for using swc measurements for managing swc and hydrological applications for example brocca et al 2013 2015 used swc observations in the upper tiber river valley to design an in situ network of swc sensors for improving our understanding of rainfall runoff transformation these findings can be further confirmed and extended for the implementation of similar procedures in other regions and climates the usefulness of a continuously operating swc sensor network and a more detailed analysis of gravel mulched fields are thus necessary to corroborate all the results we obtained particularly considering the effects of other factors such as the heterogeneity of vegetation 4 conclusions this study analyzed swc data collected from three fields mulched with gravel for different planting years and from bare land the control in three layers over four years with the following conclusions i swcs were much higher in the gravel mulched fields than the bare land with a general trend of new mod old check and were irregularly distributed with peaks and valleys in all four fields the swcs of new mod and check increased with depth i e 0 10 10 30 30 50 cm but the swcs of old had a trend of 0 10 30 50 10 30 cm swc was moderately variable and tended to decrease with depth swc was highly variable in check in the 0 10 cm layer where the variability was higher only for new the variabilities of the swcs in the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers had trends of new mod old check ii natural or anthropogenic damage may be disrupting the interface between the soil and the gravel and thus the benefits of water retention more gravel mixed with the soil over time resulting in structural changes and the gradual degeneration of the gravel mulch the percentage increases of the gravel mulched fields compared to the bare land tended to decrease with depth and with years of planting iii temporal stability increased with depth in all four fields the range of σ δ i and δ i decreased gradually with depth indicating that swc was lower and more variable in the 0 10 cm layer than the 10 30 and 30 50 cm layers the representative locations representative of field mean swc in all four fields were identified the measured field mean swcs for 2014 2015 and 2016 were used to test the accuracy of the estimation with rmses 0 308 and r 2 0 926 we can then conclude that the representative locations are quite reliable for estimating the field mean swcs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5164,understanding of the characteristics of dam break flows moving along a sloping wet bed can help to timely issue flood warning and risk mitigation in this study laboratory experiments are carried out in a large flume for a wide range of upstream water depth bed slopes and tailwater depth the water level is recorded and processed to calculate the mean velocity and wave celerity results show that the increase of the bed slope will significantly accelerate the wave front celerity for the downstream dry bed while the negative wave celerity will decrease when water depth ratio α 0 3 defined as the ratio of initial downstream water depth over the upstream water depth of dam there are extra negative waves propagating towards the reservoir area after the flow has developed for a period of time when α 0 6 there are the favre waves propagating downstream the water level and the mean velocity fluctuate due to the influence of the extra negative waves and the favre waves such fluctuant frequency increases with the increase of the water depth ratio the empirical formulas are obtained for the celerity of the first extra negative wave and the first downstream wave the variation of wave front height is very similar under three bed slopes investigated in this study while the maximum wave front height occurs when α 0 2 the present study broadens the understanding of the effects of the bed slope and the tailwater level on the movement of the dam break flows furthermore experimental results are also compared with some analytical solutions the validity of the assumptions made during

seriously threaten the lives and properties downstream of the dam plate 2005 hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 wang et al 2020a it is therefore important to investigate the evolution characteristics of the dam break flood in order to mitigate flood risk and reduce losses previous studies showed that the dam break flow was affected by various factors miller and chaudhry 1989 feizi et al 2012 van emelen et al 2014 hooshyaripor and tahershamsi 2015 wood and wang 2015 juez et al 2017 wang et al 2016 2018 among them the bed slope and the downstream tailwater depth play important roles in the development of the dam break flows knowledge and understanding of the propagation characteristics of the dam break flow under the combined effect of the bed slope and the downstream tailwater depth can help issue timely flood warning and prepare appropriate mitigation measures extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of the bed slope on the evolution of the dam break flow in past decades dressler 1958 used the form of the second type of elliptic integrals to derive the analytical solution of the dam break flow under the condition of the dry sloped bed mungkasi and roberts 2011 applied the method of characteristics to derive the analytical solution in the case of the dry sloped bed they developed the mathematical equation to describe the water surface profile chanson 2009 considered the role of the wave front resistance and used the similar method to derive the analytical solution for the dry sloped bed in his solution the water depth in the wave front region was affected by the selection of the surface roughness height ks wang et al 2017 deduced the analytical solution of the dry sloped bed under arbitrary cross sectional shape by using the method of cross sectional shape parameter separation using different methods various analytical solutions are also obtained fernandez feria 2006 mangeney et al 2000 wang and pan 2014 the studies discussed above mainly focused on the effect of bed slope on the dam break flow however the downstream water depth i e tailwater depth also affects the propagation of the dam break flow the role of the tailwater was investigated by hunt 1983 who applied the dynamic wave approximation method to derive the analytical solution of the dam break flows along a wet sloped bed however this analytical solution was only accurate after the flow moved downstream for a certain distance which was affected by the upstream water depth this restricts the application of this analytical solution mungkasi and roberts 2012 adopt the solving method of stoker s 1957 shock discontinuity and used the method of characteristics to derive the analytical solution in the case of wet sloped bed wang et al 2020b also used a similar method to derive the analytical solution of shallow water equations along a wet sloped bed however these analytical solutions have not been systematically verified by experimental data and their capability to describe the actual dam break flow also remains to be studied the laboratory experiment is another method for investigating the dam break flow denlinger and o connell 2008 cochard and ancey 2008 marra et al 2011 wang et al 2019 lauber and hager 1998b carried out laboratory experiments in a smooth rectangular prismatic flume with downstream dry bed to investigate the water surface profiles flow velocity negative wave and wave front position from their experiments they proposed empirical formulas to describe the variation of these hydraulic parameters nsom et al 2000 conducted the experiment in downstream dry bed using the glucose syrup water solutions the dam break flow propagation was measured and recorded by using image processing technology and ultrasonic distance detection system the movement of the wave front was analyzed and compared with the derived theoretical solution the analysis of the hydraulic parameters such as the flow velocity and the negative wave celerity however was not sufficient chen et al 2014 studied the impact load on the downstream dam induced by the dam break flows three typical impact modes were observed and an empirical formula was proposed to describe the temporal variation of pressure load however the characteristic of dam break flow was not analyzed the above experimental studies have the characteristics of only considering the dry sloped bed further experimental studies for the wet sloped bed case are required in addition the sudden changes of the flow discharge may cause the periodic oscillations waves favre waves to propagate through the channel these waves may damage the structure in the channel and also affect the operation of the channel and the navigation of the ships favre 1935 conducted a systematic experimental measurement of the propagation characteristics of these waves in a rectangular channel treske 1994 performed a similar study in rectangular and trapezoidal channels and found that the frequencies of secondary waves in the rectangular channel are higher than that in the trapezoidal channel for the same froude numbers case peregrine 1966 invented a numerical model that can describe the propagation of an undular bore but the model cannot be calculated from the initial discontinuous free surface soares frazao and zech 2002 had improved the previous numerical model and proposed a stable finite volume scheme that can be calculated from a steep front to compute secondary waves however previous studies on favre waves rarely take into account the impact of the bed slope what effect does the gravity component have on the conformation and propagation of favre waves what is the difference between the propagation characteristics of favre waves on sloped channel and horizontal channel to answer the above questions further study should be carried out considering the bed slope there are little studies on the dam break flows or favre waves moving along the sloping wet bed which is often encountered in the real situation therefore the characteristic of the dam break flows or favre waves propagating along a sloping initially wet bed has not been fully understood in this paper laboratory experiments are carried out in a large flume for a wide range of upstream water depth bed slope and tailwater depth to investigate the propagation feature of the dam break flows or favre waves the water level is recorded by ccd cameras and is then obtained by image processing technology mean velocity and wave celerity are then calculated results obtained from this study can be used as a reference for issuing the actual flood warning and mitigation work and also for validating the new analytical solution or numerical model 2 experimental setup 2 1 water flume the experiment is carried out at the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering sichuan university china the flume has the dimension of 18 m in length 1 m in width and 1 09 m in height the flume is divided into two parts by using a 15 mm thick fiberglass board at 8 37 m from the inlet while the downstream water level is adjusted by changing the blocking height of the rigid fiberboard as shown in fig 1 in fig 1 hu hd is the initial water depth of the upstream and downstream respectively and s 0 is the bed slope the flume is made of transparent tempered glass and supported by steel pillars whose height can be adjusted independently the slope of the flume can be changed by adjusting the height of these pillars the gate is connected to the motor through the steel cable when the upstream water depth is 0 4 m the corresponding lifting time is 0 167 s which satisfies the transient collapse condition lauber and hager 1998a t 2hu g 1 2 0 286 s g is the gravitational acceleration eight ccd cameras are arranged in parallel at the side of the flume to record the evolution of flow these ccd cameras have a wide angle lens for shooting 48 frames per second with a resolution of 1920 1440 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 the cameras are simultaneously turned on by wireless remote control 2 2 image processing technology the collection of experimental data by image processing technology involves two key parts the first part is to use the calibration plate and the calibration function in matlab to individually calibrate each camera the parameter data obtained mainly the internal and external parameters of each camera are then used to regulate the distorted picture the size of the square lattice is 100 mm 100 mm in the calibration plate and the number of the grid is 11 on one side and 10 on the other side fifty millimeter margin is set around the calibration plate to facilitate the recognition of the corner points in order to obtain more accurate internal and external data for each camera 25 pictures are used to calibrate each camera in different orientations and angles the second part is to perform image analysis on the corrected image to obtain water depth data the main purpose is to use the scale above the flume to cut and combine the images and then to apply boundary recognition function to process the binarized image to obtain the variation of the water depth at each position the actual length represented by a pixel is about 1 8 mm in the experiment liu et al 2018 2019b wang et al 2019 2020c this study is to examine the combined effect of the tailwater and bed slope on the propagation of dam break flow to this end eleven downstream tailwater depths are tested for three different bed slopes the parameters tested are listed in table 1 in which α hd hu is the water depth ratio 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow parameters for the convenience the following hydraulic parameters are defined to facilitate the analysis 1 z z h u 2 t t h u g 3 u u g h u 4 u t w t δ t w t b h δ t 5 c c g h u where z t and u respectively represent the water level time and mean velocity z t and u are respectively the dimensionless water level time and mean velocity u t is the mean velocity at time t the volume w t is calculated using the method similar to that by cestero et al 2014 bento et al 2017 and melis et al 2019 w t and w t δ t is the water volume between a section and the upstream end of reservoir at the time t and t δt respectively δt is the time step taking as 1 48 s b is the flume width h is the water depth c is the average wave celerity calculated as c xs t xs is the distance traveled by the wave over time t 3 2 observation of flow evolution pattern figs 2 and 3 show the dam break flow evolution for various tailwater and bed conditions for flat fig 2 a 3 a mild fig 2 b 3 b and steep bed slopes fig 2 c 3 c fig 2 is the flow pattern at the time t 0 42 s with various water depth ratio for the downstream dry bed α 0 because the gravity component in the flow direction does not exist for s 0 0 and is very small for s 0 0 003 the flow is mainly affected by the resistance in the wave front therefore the water depth becomes higher in the wave front for the case of steep slope s 0 0 02 the gravity component along the flow direction significantly increases which accelerates the flow after being vector synthesized with the wave front resistance this makes water become thinner in the wave front zone for the case of downstream wet bed for all three bed slopes tested the flow released from the reservoir interacts with downstream tailwater producing an upwarp of water surface in the downstream the height of such water upwarping decreases with the increase of α as shown in fig 2 fig 3 shows the flow pattern at t 3 54 s in which different flow features occur after a period of evolution it is seen that for the case of dry bed the wave front spreads further and the water depth becomes smaller with the increase of bed slope both the rarefaction wave zone and steady zone are formed liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 when α 0 05 0 2 and the water level is almost horizontal in the steady zone for three different bed slopes the instantly opening of the gate leads to a sudden flow discharge change in the channel when the froude number is less than 1 7 favre waves will be formed in the channel treske 1994 the reservoir area also appears this periodic wave phenomenon at s 0 0 and 0 003 for α 0 3 by the instant opening of the gate in order to distinguish it from the favre wave which is formed downstream of the dam these periodic waves appearing in the reservoir area are called extra negative waves kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 in the case of steep bed slope e g s 0 0 02 it is difficult for the extra negative waves to propagate upstream when α 0 3 and there is no water surface fluctuation in the reservoir fig 4 shows the evolution pattern of the favre waves in which the water surface undulates in the wave front when α 0 4 the first downstream wave soares frazao and zech 2002 is observed to have a broken waveform when α 0 4 0 5 but a stable form when α 0 6 the difference between the bed slope s 0 0 and 0 003 with s 0 0 02 is that the water surface fluctuates in the wave front when α 0 3 and the first downstream wave is broken at α 0 3 0 4 the wave breaking condition is much weaker for α 0 4 than α 0 3 and in a stable form when α 0 5 it shows that not only the depth of tailwater affects the propagation pattern of favre waves but also the bed slope plays a role a generalized model is established to describe the evolution process of the dam break flow fig 5 is a sketch of the flow pattern and parameters used to describe the flow development in which cn and cw respectively represent the negative wave and the wave front celerity cen and ces respectively represent the celerities of the first extra negative wave and the first downstream wave ze represent the peak water level of the first extra negative wave zmax zm zmin respectively represent the maximum average and minimum water level of the favre waves h 2 is the average water depth in the region of the favre waves h 0 is the downstream water depth connected with the first downstream wave front 3 3 water level the variation of the water level for α 0 is shown in fig 6 where the measured data for s 0 0 have been published in wang et al 2020d there is little difference of the water level for hu 0 2 m and hu 0 4 m for all bed slope conditions indicating that the movement of dam break flows meets the gravity similarity criterion the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 are also plotted in fig 6 for comparison it is seen that the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 of the water surface profiles are in good agreement with the measurements for the ideal zone where the effect of resistance is ignored for s 0 0 the main difference between them is that the wave front zone is clearly affected by the resistance the analytical solution of chanson 2009 which considered the effect of wave front resistance ks 10 5 m in this experiment is in good agreement with the experimental results when s 0 0 and 0 003 the wave front velocity predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2011 who assumed that the channel was smooth i e no wave front resistance is significantly larger than experimental measurement as both the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 didn t consider the characteristic of the initial water depth in the reservoir decreasing gradually along the direction towards the end of the reservoir their predictions differ from the experimental results when s 0 0 02 in fact the dimensionless water depth of the negative wave front position continuously decreases from 1 after the dam break begins while it is always assumed to be 1 in the analytical nevertheless the analytical solution of chanson 2009 still has certain accuracy in capturing the position of the downstream wave front when s 0 0 02 when tailwater is present e g downstream wet bed the flow restores to stable state after the water upwarping at the initial time t 2 48 for α 0 1 as shown in fig 7 the rarefaction wave zone and steady zone can be seen at t 9 90 it is worth noting that the dimensionless water level of the steady zone is almost the same under the three different bed slopes the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 is in good agreement with the experimental result at the wave front position for t 2 48 9 90 under the three different bed slopes the water level in the steady zone calculated by mungkasi and roberts 2012 agrees well with the experimental result when the bed slope is small e g s 0 0 003 however large deviation between experiment and prediction of mungkasi and roberts 2012 exists for large bed slope i e s 0 0 02 this may be ascribed to the fact that the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 was obtained based on the assumption that the water surface of the upstream and downstream still water zones was parallel to the channel bed which was different from the horizontal water surface in the experiment fig 8 shows that the second water upwarping occurs at t 4 95 for α 0 3 the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 is plotted in fig 8 for comparison it is seen from fig 8 that the dimensionless water level also has little difference in the steady zone for three different bed slopes when α 0 5 because the first downstream wave is broken during the evolution process for s 0 0 and 0 003 the water level is lower than s 0 0 02 the first wave propagates in a stable form in this α the periodic waves appear both in the reservoir area and downstream of the dam when α increases to 0 7 the water level in the steady zone calculated by mungkasi and roberts 2012 is in good agreement with the measurements for α 0 3 when s 0 0 and 0 003 however when the water depth ratio increases to 0 5 0 7 the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 cannot capture the water surface fluctuations regardless of the bed slope this is because the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 was derived based on the shallow water assumption which is not suitable to describe the weak non hydrostatic flow phenomenon e g favre waves such flow phenomenon is better described by the theory proposed by soares frazao and zech 2002 fig 9 shows the stage hydrographs at the positions x hu 12 8 1 3 0 8 12 5 for downstream dry bed the stage hydrographs are almost the same in the reservoir area for s 0 0 and 0 003 but it is gradually separated from s 0 0 and 0 003 after t 5 at position x hu 1 3 for s 0 0 02 in which the water level decreases at the position x hu 12 8 water level for steep slope s 0 0 02 begins to fall later than that for flat and mild slopes e g s 0 0 and 0 003 the decline velocity of water level is further accelerated at t 28 when s 0 0 and 0 003 with hu 0 4 m this may be ascribed to the fact that the celerity of negative wave is faster when hu 0 4 m than that with hu 0 2 m and the decline of the water level at the end of the reservoir will further affect the variation process of the water level in the reservoir area therefore the phenomenon of stage hydrograph separation occurs at this time this phenomenon appears at t 32 for s 0 0 02 which shows that the increase of the bed slope not only delays the evolution of the negative wave but also delays the time when the water level is further declined in the reservoir area the water level variation in the reservoir area predicted by chanson 2009 is the same as that predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2011 in the case of s 0 0 and 0 003 they both can relatively accurately predict the variation of the water level in the reservoir area however in the case of s 0 0 02 the predicted water level at the position x hu 1 3 continues to rise in the later period i e t 12 which is different from the experimental results for the comparison of the water level downstream of the dam the analytical solution of chanson 2009 accurately captures the rising time of the water level at the downstream location as it considered the effect of wave front resistance the predicted variation of the water level is in good agreement with the experimental result when s 0 0 and 0 003 while the prediction deviates significantly from the experimental results when s 0 0 02 fig 10 shows the variation of the water level in both the reservoir area and downstream of the dam for α 0 1 the characteristics of the water level variation in the reservoir area is very similar to that for α 0 the water level at the downstream of the dam gradually becomes stable after a short time rising the analytical model of mungkasi and roberts 2012 can accurately predict the variation of the water level for s 0 0 and 0 003 however for s 0 0 02 the water level at x hu 0 8 predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2012 differs from the experimental measurement this deviation may be ascribed to the fact that the location x hu 0 8 gradually evolves from the steady zone to the rarefaction wave zone and the water level then continues to rise the situation at the position x hu 12 5 is similar with a longer transition time from the steady zone to rarefaction wave zone fig 11 shows the water level at each position for α 0 3 the water level at x hu 1 3 fluctuates significantly for s 0 0 and 0 003 and α 0 3 such water level fluctuation is very small for s 0 0 02 which is consistent with the characteristics observed in section 3 2 in which the extra negative waves are difficult to propagate towards the reservoir area when the water depth ratio further increases e g α 0 5 periodic water level fluctuations occur both in the reservoir area and downstream of the dam when the water depth ratio further increases to α 0 7 the frequency of fluctuations increases while the flow has the characteristics of favre waves soares frazao and zech 2002 fig 11 shows that the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 which was obtained based on the shallow water assumption is unable to capture the wave characteristics 3 4 mean velocity fig 12 shows the dimensionless mean velocity profiles where the measured data for s 0 0 have been published in wang et al 2020d the flow velocity increases continuously with time and the peak velocity appears in the wave front for downstream dry bed when there is downstream tailwater the situation is different it is seen that for α 0 1 and flat mild bed slope e g s 0 0 and 0 003 flow velocity approaches a steady value in the steady state region while for steep slope e g s 0 0 02 the flow velocity gradually decreases after reaching the peak when tailwater depth downstream increases to α 0 3 the position of the maximum flow velocity moves towards the reservoir area for a higher α e g 0 5 and 0 7 there is a wave variation for the velocity distribution in both upstream and downstream reaches fig 13 shows that the flow velocity at x hu 1 3 gradually decreases in the later stage for s 0 0 and 0 003 with downstream dry bed while for s 0 0 02 flow velocity still gradually increases for hu 0 4 m the flow velocity gradually decreases in the later stage at position x hu 12 8 since the celerity of negative wave is slower when hu 0 2 m the significant decline of the flow velocity appears later correspondingly the change characteristics for α 0 1 is similar to that of downstream dry bed for high downstream water depth e g α 0 3 flow velocity fluctuates at x hu 1 3 which is affected by the extra negative waves such fluctuation frequency gradually increases as α increases from the variation of flow velocity at position x hu 12 8 it can be seen that the impact of such fluctuation spreads faster to the reservoir area for α 0 7 than that for α 0 5 for the position downstream of the dam the flow velocity has a steep rise and then slowly declines in dry bed condition the flow velocity gradually recovers to a stable value after a sharp rise when α 0 1 0 3 but from the change of the flow velocity at position x hu 12 5 it can be seen that the stable value for s 0 0 02 is smaller than that for s 0 0 and 0 003 this could be explained as follows in the case of a downstream wet bed the water depth is relatively larger at position x hu 12 5 for s 0 0 02 the flow velocity gradually becomes stable after the fluctuation at x hu 0 8 when α 0 5 and 0 7 since the water depth at x hu 12 5 is larger for s 0 0 02 the energy is dissipated faster and thus the flow velocity begins to decrease earlier compared to that for s 0 0 and 0 003 3 5 wave celerity 3 5 1 negative wave and wave front fig 14 shows the variation of the average negative wave celerity with time it is seen that the negative wave celerity sharply decreases with time at the initial stage t 5 and then gradually decreases and approaches a steady state for s 0 0 due to the effect of the bed slope there is an added horizontal acceleration on the flow which is opposite to the negative wave propagation direction therefore the negative wave celerity will gradually decrease at the later stage under the situation of the bed slope s 0 0 003 and 0 02 the analytical solutions of dressler 1958 chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 have the same dimensionless negative wave celerity which is equal to 1 for a horizontal bed however for bed slope is larger than zero i e s 0 0 003 and 0 02 in this study the dimensionless negative wave celerity continuously decreases with time the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 solution and the mungkasi and roberts 2011 have exactly the same negative wave celerity for three different bed slope conditions the negative wave celerity predicted by dressler 1958 decreases slower than those predicted by chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 and it has a tendency to be close to the experimental results with the evolution of the dam break flow the negative wave celerity predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2012 deviates relatively small from the experimental results for s 0 0 003 and α 0 1 with the increase of the water depth ratio the predicted negative wave celerity improves for the steep bed slope s 0 0 02 with wet bed condition there exists relatively large difference between the analytical calculation and experimental measurements for all water depth ration investigated here fig 15 shows the variation of the average wave front celerity with time it is seen that the bed slope has a great effect on the wave front celerity owing to the still water in the downstream of the dam has greater resistance compared to the dry bed case it is shown that the wave front celerity in the dry bed case is significantly larger than that in wet bed case analytical solutions of dressler 1958 chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 2012 are plotted in fig 15 for comparison it shows that the wave front celerity predicted by dressler 1958 is similar to that predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2011 for three different bed slopes as the influence of the wave front resistance is not considered in both analytical solutions the wave front celerity continuously increases with time for the bed slope s 0 0 003 and 0 02 and the dimensionless celerity is much larger than the experimental measurement chanson 2009 considered the wave front resistance effect and the predicted wave front celerity is in good agreement with the measurements the wave front celerity of mungkasi and roberts 2012 does not change with time on the horizontal bed and it is in good agreement with the experimental results it is slowly increasing at s 0 0 003 and has little different with the experimental results but in the case of s 0 0 02 the wave front celerity rises faster which is coordinate with the experimental situation in the early stage almost t 15 but in the later stage the celerity is faster than the experimental situation it is analyzed that there will be more energy dissipation in the interaction between the wave front and the downstream still water in the experiment and the acceleration will change instead of keeping a fixed value like the analytical solution 3 5 2 first extra negative wave and first downstream wave experimental results show that the periodic waves will not only propagate downstream but also appear in the reservoir area for rivers channels with cascade regulation mechanism such periodic waves will propagate towards upstream when the gate is used to adjust the discharge this will have an adverse effect on upstream structures or the navigation of upstream vessels therefore it is also important to investigate the propagation of the extra negative waves figs 16 and 17 are respectively the variation of the dimensionless average celerity of the first extra negative wave and the first downstream wave with time for various α and bed slopes it is seen that the dimensionless celerity of the first extra negative wave has great consistency between hu 0 2 m and hu 0 4 m and the same for the dimensionless celerity of the first downstream wave the celerity of both the first extra negative wave and the first wave increases with time reaches a maximum and then decreases with time fig 16 also shows that the celerity of the first extra negative wave propagating along the steep slope s 0 0 02 is smaller than that along the flat and mild slope such difference increases with the increase of the evolution time while for the celerity of the first wave the situation is another way round the celerity of the first wave is larger along the steep slope s 0 0 02 than that along the flat and mild slope s 0 0 and 0 003 due to the promoting effect of gravity component in the horizontal direction the following empirical formulas are developed for the first extra negative wave celerity eq 6 and the first downstream wave celerity eq 7 6 c en 1 75 10 6 t 3 0 009 s 0 1 18 t 2 0 0135 t 0 67 α 0 38 7 c es 2 6 10 6 t 3 0 003 s 0 t 2 0 009 t 0 26 α 0 82 the correlation coefficient r 2 is applied to analyze the fitting results fig 18 shows the comparison of experimental measurements and the fitted data calculated using eqs 6 and 7 the good agreement between the calculated and measured data indicates that eqs 6 and 7 can be used to quickly estimate the wave celerity and provide a certain reference for engineers in actual design and operation 3 6 wave height 3 6 1 favre waves fr is a characteristic parameter for analyzing favre waves and can be calculated as treske 1994 8 fr ω c 0 c a u 0 c 0 where ω is the relative propagation speed to the base flow u 0 which is 0 in the present study c a is the absolute propagation speed of the first downstream wave front c 0 is the wave speed c 0 g h 0 h 0 is water depth immediately in the front of the first downstream wave soares frazao and zech 2002 obtained the formula fr h 2 2 h 0 2 h 2 h 0 which is the application of eq 8 for the case of horizontal bed for convenience of comparison of the results with different bed slopes the eq 8 is used for calculation treske 1994 fig 19 shows the calculated fr at water depth ratios α 0 3 and α 0 5 it can be seen that under horizontal bed condition fr has little variation with time and is greater than 1 28 for both water depth ratios investigated i e α 0 3 and α 0 5 the wave front shows a steep or broken form which is consistent with the description of soares frazao and zech 2002 for bed slope s 0 0 003 fr decreases with time for α 0 3 but it is also greater than 1 28 and the wave front is also steep which is consistent with the observation in fig 4 fr is very close to 1 28 at the late evolution for α 0 5 however fr significantly decreases at s 0 0 02 this is because the water depth of the downstream still water which is interacted with the wave front continues to increase indicating that more energy will be dissipated downstream fig 19 a also shows that fr is very close to 1 28 fr 1 297 at the late stage i e t 34 for s 0 0 02 and α 0 3 it is expected that if the flow continues to evolve limited by the length of the flume available for measurement downstream of the dam in this study which limits the maximum evolution time being approximately t 34 for hu 0 2 m it will also produce stable favre waves fig 20 shows the comparison of the measured parameters of favre wave under the horizontal bed with the previous results favre 1935 sandover and zienkiewcz 1957 treske 1994 marche et al 1995 soares frazao and zech 2002 bishnu and devkota 2009 it can be seen that zmax initially increases with the increase of fr and then decreases significantly after fr 1 28 due to the wave breaking the experimental result is in good agreement with that observed by treske 1994 the change of zm increases almost linearly with fr which is also well predicted by eq 8 it is also seen that zmin increases gradually with the increase of fr and has a sharp increase when fr is larger than 1 28 in addition the maximum value of the wave front height zmax determines the highest water level when the flood develops towards downstream fig 21 shows the wave front height for various test conditions the wave front height is calculated using the water level in the steady zone when α 0 4 it is seen that the variation of the wave front height with α has a double peak the maximum value of the wave front height appears at α 0 2 and the dimensionless height is approximately 0 31 the wave front height reaches the second peak at α 0 6 and decreases sharply with the increase of α it is shown that the bed slope and downstream water depth has an insignificant effect on the dimensionless wave front height particularly when α 0 6 which is influenced by favre waves the wave front height predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2012 solid line is the same for three different bed slopes and is in good agreement with the experimental measurement for 0 α 0 4 however the analytical model significantly under predict the wave front height when the favre wave occurs this indicates that the shallow water assumption is not suitable for describing the phenomenon of weak non hydrostatic flow when the water depth ratio is large as evidenced previously 3 6 2 first extra negative waves fig 22 shows that the peak water level of the first extra negative wave decreases with the time for flat and mild bed slope e g s 0 0 and 0 003 the peak water level remains almost constant for a period of time and then falls down for s 0 0 02 the peak water level is always falling and the change process of water level shows a gradual decrease followed by a sharp decline it is maybe due to the fall of the water level at the end of the reservoir which accelerates the peak water level of the first extra negative wave descending this means that the extra negative waves formed in the limited length reservoir will continue to dissipate during the propagation towards the reservoir area in a relatively large bed slope as such the impact on the upstream structure will gradually decrease with the evolution of the flow 4 conclusions in this paper the experiments are carried out in a large flume under different bed slopes and downstream tailwater depths the main conclusions are as follows 1 the experimental observation shows that the increase of the bed slope will change the evolution pattern of the dam break flow in the case of s 0 0 and 0 003 there are periodic waves i e the extra negative waves propagating towards the reservoir area when α 0 3 while favre waves stably evolve downstream when α 0 6 the stable favre waves can be formed in large water depth ration for steep slope i e α 0 5 s 0 0 02 in this study increase of the bed slope makes fr tend to decline with time 2 the wave front height shows a double peak property with the α increases the maximum wave front height appears roughly when α 0 2 for all three different bed slopes and the dimensionless height is approximately 0 31 the first downstream wave causes the second maximum value to occur when α 0 6 the wave front height gradually decreases with the α increases when α 0 6 since the wave front height calculated based on the shallow water assumption is significantly small for α 0 5 it is more appropriate to use the calculation method which assumes a weak non hydrostatic flow to descript the wave front height soares frazao and zech 2002 3 the appearance of extra negative waves leads to a significant undulation of the water surface profiles and mean velocity in the reservoir the frequency of the undulation gradually increases with the increase of α the peak water level of the first extra negative wave is gradually falling after maintaining a stability value for a period of time when s 0 0 and 0 003 while it is always falling when s 0 0 02 since the extra negative wave can affect the upstream channel it needs to be considered in the design of the structure of the channel 4 the comparison with the analytical solutions shows that the negative wave celerity is better predicted by dressler 1958 while the analytical solution of chanson 2009 can better capture the motion of the wave front for small bed slope and water depth ration i e s 0 0 003 0 α 0 3 the analytical model of mungkasi and roberts 2012 can provide the relatively good prediction for the motion of flow however it cannot describe the periodic wave phenomenon that occurs in the reservoir area or downstream of the dam when α 0 3 for large bed slope s 0 0 02 the initial conditions assumed in the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 are different from the experimental conditions therefore it is unable to use to predict the dam break flow with steep slope the current research expands the understanding of the effects of the bed slope and the tailwater level on the movement of dam break flows the tailwater level and bed slope both have a significant impact on the evolution pattern of the dam break flows the favre waves will apparently raise the downstream water level in flood control it is indicated that the water depth ratio is an important element when making flood emergency plans in real life declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5164,understanding of the characteristics of dam break flows moving along a sloping wet bed can help to timely issue flood warning and risk mitigation in this study laboratory experiments are carried out in a large flume for a wide range of upstream water depth bed slopes and tailwater depth the water level is recorded and processed to calculate the mean velocity and wave celerity results show that the increase of the bed slope will significantly accelerate the wave front celerity for the downstream dry bed while the negative wave celerity will decrease when water depth ratio α 0 3 defined as the ratio of initial downstream water depth over the upstream water depth of dam there are extra negative waves propagating towards the reservoir area after the flow has developed for a period of time when α 0 6 there are the favre waves propagating downstream the water level and the mean velocity fluctuate due to the influence of the extra negative waves and the favre waves such fluctuant frequency increases with the increase of the water depth ratio the empirical formulas are obtained for the celerity of the first extra negative wave and the first downstream wave the variation of wave front height is very similar under three bed slopes investigated in this study while the maximum wave front height occurs when α 0 2 the present study broadens the understanding of the effects of the bed slope and the tailwater level on the movement of the dam break flows furthermore experimental results are also compared with some analytical solutions the validity of the assumptions made during

seriously threaten the lives and properties downstream of the dam plate 2005 hamlet and lettenmaier 2007 wang et al 2020a it is therefore important to investigate the evolution characteristics of the dam break flood in order to mitigate flood risk and reduce losses previous studies showed that the dam break flow was affected by various factors miller and chaudhry 1989 feizi et al 2012 van emelen et al 2014 hooshyaripor and tahershamsi 2015 wood and wang 2015 juez et al 2017 wang et al 2016 2018 among them the bed slope and the downstream tailwater depth play important roles in the development of the dam break flows knowledge and understanding of the propagation characteristics of the dam break flow under the combined effect of the bed slope and the downstream tailwater depth can help issue timely flood warning and prepare appropriate mitigation measures extensive studies have been carried out to investigate the effect of the bed slope on the evolution of the dam break flow in past decades dressler 1958 used the form of the second type of elliptic integrals to derive the analytical solution of the dam break flow under the condition of the dry sloped bed mungkasi and roberts 2011 applied the method of characteristics to derive the analytical solution in the case of the dry sloped bed they developed the mathematical equation to describe the water surface profile chanson 2009 considered the role of the wave front resistance and used the similar method to derive the analytical solution for the dry sloped bed in his solution the water depth in the wave front region was affected by the selection of the surface roughness height ks wang et al 2017 deduced the analytical solution of the dry sloped bed under arbitrary cross sectional shape by using the method of cross sectional shape parameter separation using different methods various analytical solutions are also obtained fernandez feria 2006 mangeney et al 2000 wang and pan 2014 the studies discussed above mainly focused on the effect of bed slope on the dam break flow however the downstream water depth i e tailwater depth also affects the propagation of the dam break flow the role of the tailwater was investigated by hunt 1983 who applied the dynamic wave approximation method to derive the analytical solution of the dam break flows along a wet sloped bed however this analytical solution was only accurate after the flow moved downstream for a certain distance which was affected by the upstream water depth this restricts the application of this analytical solution mungkasi and roberts 2012 adopt the solving method of stoker s 1957 shock discontinuity and used the method of characteristics to derive the analytical solution in the case of wet sloped bed wang et al 2020b also used a similar method to derive the analytical solution of shallow water equations along a wet sloped bed however these analytical solutions have not been systematically verified by experimental data and their capability to describe the actual dam break flow also remains to be studied the laboratory experiment is another method for investigating the dam break flow denlinger and o connell 2008 cochard and ancey 2008 marra et al 2011 wang et al 2019 lauber and hager 1998b carried out laboratory experiments in a smooth rectangular prismatic flume with downstream dry bed to investigate the water surface profiles flow velocity negative wave and wave front position from their experiments they proposed empirical formulas to describe the variation of these hydraulic parameters nsom et al 2000 conducted the experiment in downstream dry bed using the glucose syrup water solutions the dam break flow propagation was measured and recorded by using image processing technology and ultrasonic distance detection system the movement of the wave front was analyzed and compared with the derived theoretical solution the analysis of the hydraulic parameters such as the flow velocity and the negative wave celerity however was not sufficient chen et al 2014 studied the impact load on the downstream dam induced by the dam break flows three typical impact modes were observed and an empirical formula was proposed to describe the temporal variation of pressure load however the characteristic of dam break flow was not analyzed the above experimental studies have the characteristics of only considering the dry sloped bed further experimental studies for the wet sloped bed case are required in addition the sudden changes of the flow discharge may cause the periodic oscillations waves favre waves to propagate through the channel these waves may damage the structure in the channel and also affect the operation of the channel and the navigation of the ships favre 1935 conducted a systematic experimental measurement of the propagation characteristics of these waves in a rectangular channel treske 1994 performed a similar study in rectangular and trapezoidal channels and found that the frequencies of secondary waves in the rectangular channel are higher than that in the trapezoidal channel for the same froude numbers case peregrine 1966 invented a numerical model that can describe the propagation of an undular bore but the model cannot be calculated from the initial discontinuous free surface soares frazao and zech 2002 had improved the previous numerical model and proposed a stable finite volume scheme that can be calculated from a steep front to compute secondary waves however previous studies on favre waves rarely take into account the impact of the bed slope what effect does the gravity component have on the conformation and propagation of favre waves what is the difference between the propagation characteristics of favre waves on sloped channel and horizontal channel to answer the above questions further study should be carried out considering the bed slope there are little studies on the dam break flows or favre waves moving along the sloping wet bed which is often encountered in the real situation therefore the characteristic of the dam break flows or favre waves propagating along a sloping initially wet bed has not been fully understood in this paper laboratory experiments are carried out in a large flume for a wide range of upstream water depth bed slope and tailwater depth to investigate the propagation feature of the dam break flows or favre waves the water level is recorded by ccd cameras and is then obtained by image processing technology mean velocity and wave celerity are then calculated results obtained from this study can be used as a reference for issuing the actual flood warning and mitigation work and also for validating the new analytical solution or numerical model 2 experimental setup 2 1 water flume the experiment is carried out at the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering sichuan university china the flume has the dimension of 18 m in length 1 m in width and 1 09 m in height the flume is divided into two parts by using a 15 mm thick fiberglass board at 8 37 m from the inlet while the downstream water level is adjusted by changing the blocking height of the rigid fiberboard as shown in fig 1 in fig 1 hu hd is the initial water depth of the upstream and downstream respectively and s 0 is the bed slope the flume is made of transparent tempered glass and supported by steel pillars whose height can be adjusted independently the slope of the flume can be changed by adjusting the height of these pillars the gate is connected to the motor through the steel cable when the upstream water depth is 0 4 m the corresponding lifting time is 0 167 s which satisfies the transient collapse condition lauber and hager 1998a t 2hu g 1 2 0 286 s g is the gravitational acceleration eight ccd cameras are arranged in parallel at the side of the flume to record the evolution of flow these ccd cameras have a wide angle lens for shooting 48 frames per second with a resolution of 1920 1440 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 the cameras are simultaneously turned on by wireless remote control 2 2 image processing technology the collection of experimental data by image processing technology involves two key parts the first part is to use the calibration plate and the calibration function in matlab to individually calibrate each camera the parameter data obtained mainly the internal and external parameters of each camera are then used to regulate the distorted picture the size of the square lattice is 100 mm 100 mm in the calibration plate and the number of the grid is 11 on one side and 10 on the other side fifty millimeter margin is set around the calibration plate to facilitate the recognition of the corner points in order to obtain more accurate internal and external data for each camera 25 pictures are used to calibrate each camera in different orientations and angles the second part is to perform image analysis on the corrected image to obtain water depth data the main purpose is to use the scale above the flume to cut and combine the images and then to apply boundary recognition function to process the binarized image to obtain the variation of the water depth at each position the actual length represented by a pixel is about 1 8 mm in the experiment liu et al 2018 2019b wang et al 2019 2020c this study is to examine the combined effect of the tailwater and bed slope on the propagation of dam break flow to this end eleven downstream tailwater depths are tested for three different bed slopes the parameters tested are listed in table 1 in which α hd hu is the water depth ratio 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow parameters for the convenience the following hydraulic parameters are defined to facilitate the analysis 1 z z h u 2 t t h u g 3 u u g h u 4 u t w t δ t w t b h δ t 5 c c g h u where z t and u respectively represent the water level time and mean velocity z t and u are respectively the dimensionless water level time and mean velocity u t is the mean velocity at time t the volume w t is calculated using the method similar to that by cestero et al 2014 bento et al 2017 and melis et al 2019 w t and w t δ t is the water volume between a section and the upstream end of reservoir at the time t and t δt respectively δt is the time step taking as 1 48 s b is the flume width h is the water depth c is the average wave celerity calculated as c xs t xs is the distance traveled by the wave over time t 3 2 observation of flow evolution pattern figs 2 and 3 show the dam break flow evolution for various tailwater and bed conditions for flat fig 2 a 3 a mild fig 2 b 3 b and steep bed slopes fig 2 c 3 c fig 2 is the flow pattern at the time t 0 42 s with various water depth ratio for the downstream dry bed α 0 because the gravity component in the flow direction does not exist for s 0 0 and is very small for s 0 0 003 the flow is mainly affected by the resistance in the wave front therefore the water depth becomes higher in the wave front for the case of steep slope s 0 0 02 the gravity component along the flow direction significantly increases which accelerates the flow after being vector synthesized with the wave front resistance this makes water become thinner in the wave front zone for the case of downstream wet bed for all three bed slopes tested the flow released from the reservoir interacts with downstream tailwater producing an upwarp of water surface in the downstream the height of such water upwarping decreases with the increase of α as shown in fig 2 fig 3 shows the flow pattern at t 3 54 s in which different flow features occur after a period of evolution it is seen that for the case of dry bed the wave front spreads further and the water depth becomes smaller with the increase of bed slope both the rarefaction wave zone and steady zone are formed liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 when α 0 05 0 2 and the water level is almost horizontal in the steady zone for three different bed slopes the instantly opening of the gate leads to a sudden flow discharge change in the channel when the froude number is less than 1 7 favre waves will be formed in the channel treske 1994 the reservoir area also appears this periodic wave phenomenon at s 0 0 and 0 003 for α 0 3 by the instant opening of the gate in order to distinguish it from the favre wave which is formed downstream of the dam these periodic waves appearing in the reservoir area are called extra negative waves kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 liu et al 2019a wang et al 2019 in the case of steep bed slope e g s 0 0 02 it is difficult for the extra negative waves to propagate upstream when α 0 3 and there is no water surface fluctuation in the reservoir fig 4 shows the evolution pattern of the favre waves in which the water surface undulates in the wave front when α 0 4 the first downstream wave soares frazao and zech 2002 is observed to have a broken waveform when α 0 4 0 5 but a stable form when α 0 6 the difference between the bed slope s 0 0 and 0 003 with s 0 0 02 is that the water surface fluctuates in the wave front when α 0 3 and the first downstream wave is broken at α 0 3 0 4 the wave breaking condition is much weaker for α 0 4 than α 0 3 and in a stable form when α 0 5 it shows that not only the depth of tailwater affects the propagation pattern of favre waves but also the bed slope plays a role a generalized model is established to describe the evolution process of the dam break flow fig 5 is a sketch of the flow pattern and parameters used to describe the flow development in which cn and cw respectively represent the negative wave and the wave front celerity cen and ces respectively represent the celerities of the first extra negative wave and the first downstream wave ze represent the peak water level of the first extra negative wave zmax zm zmin respectively represent the maximum average and minimum water level of the favre waves h 2 is the average water depth in the region of the favre waves h 0 is the downstream water depth connected with the first downstream wave front 3 3 water level the variation of the water level for α 0 is shown in fig 6 where the measured data for s 0 0 have been published in wang et al 2020d there is little difference of the water level for hu 0 2 m and hu 0 4 m for all bed slope conditions indicating that the movement of dam break flows meets the gravity similarity criterion the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 are also plotted in fig 6 for comparison it is seen that the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 of the water surface profiles are in good agreement with the measurements for the ideal zone where the effect of resistance is ignored for s 0 0 the main difference between them is that the wave front zone is clearly affected by the resistance the analytical solution of chanson 2009 which considered the effect of wave front resistance ks 10 5 m in this experiment is in good agreement with the experimental results when s 0 0 and 0 003 the wave front velocity predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2011 who assumed that the channel was smooth i e no wave front resistance is significantly larger than experimental measurement as both the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 didn t consider the characteristic of the initial water depth in the reservoir decreasing gradually along the direction towards the end of the reservoir their predictions differ from the experimental results when s 0 0 02 in fact the dimensionless water depth of the negative wave front position continuously decreases from 1 after the dam break begins while it is always assumed to be 1 in the analytical nevertheless the analytical solution of chanson 2009 still has certain accuracy in capturing the position of the downstream wave front when s 0 0 02 when tailwater is present e g downstream wet bed the flow restores to stable state after the water upwarping at the initial time t 2 48 for α 0 1 as shown in fig 7 the rarefaction wave zone and steady zone can be seen at t 9 90 it is worth noting that the dimensionless water level of the steady zone is almost the same under the three different bed slopes the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 is in good agreement with the experimental result at the wave front position for t 2 48 9 90 under the three different bed slopes the water level in the steady zone calculated by mungkasi and roberts 2012 agrees well with the experimental result when the bed slope is small e g s 0 0 003 however large deviation between experiment and prediction of mungkasi and roberts 2012 exists for large bed slope i e s 0 0 02 this may be ascribed to the fact that the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 was obtained based on the assumption that the water surface of the upstream and downstream still water zones was parallel to the channel bed which was different from the horizontal water surface in the experiment fig 8 shows that the second water upwarping occurs at t 4 95 for α 0 3 the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 is plotted in fig 8 for comparison it is seen from fig 8 that the dimensionless water level also has little difference in the steady zone for three different bed slopes when α 0 5 because the first downstream wave is broken during the evolution process for s 0 0 and 0 003 the water level is lower than s 0 0 02 the first wave propagates in a stable form in this α the periodic waves appear both in the reservoir area and downstream of the dam when α increases to 0 7 the water level in the steady zone calculated by mungkasi and roberts 2012 is in good agreement with the measurements for α 0 3 when s 0 0 and 0 003 however when the water depth ratio increases to 0 5 0 7 the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 cannot capture the water surface fluctuations regardless of the bed slope this is because the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 was derived based on the shallow water assumption which is not suitable to describe the weak non hydrostatic flow phenomenon e g favre waves such flow phenomenon is better described by the theory proposed by soares frazao and zech 2002 fig 9 shows the stage hydrographs at the positions x hu 12 8 1 3 0 8 12 5 for downstream dry bed the stage hydrographs are almost the same in the reservoir area for s 0 0 and 0 003 but it is gradually separated from s 0 0 and 0 003 after t 5 at position x hu 1 3 for s 0 0 02 in which the water level decreases at the position x hu 12 8 water level for steep slope s 0 0 02 begins to fall later than that for flat and mild slopes e g s 0 0 and 0 003 the decline velocity of water level is further accelerated at t 28 when s 0 0 and 0 003 with hu 0 4 m this may be ascribed to the fact that the celerity of negative wave is faster when hu 0 4 m than that with hu 0 2 m and the decline of the water level at the end of the reservoir will further affect the variation process of the water level in the reservoir area therefore the phenomenon of stage hydrograph separation occurs at this time this phenomenon appears at t 32 for s 0 0 02 which shows that the increase of the bed slope not only delays the evolution of the negative wave but also delays the time when the water level is further declined in the reservoir area the water level variation in the reservoir area predicted by chanson 2009 is the same as that predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2011 in the case of s 0 0 and 0 003 they both can relatively accurately predict the variation of the water level in the reservoir area however in the case of s 0 0 02 the predicted water level at the position x hu 1 3 continues to rise in the later period i e t 12 which is different from the experimental results for the comparison of the water level downstream of the dam the analytical solution of chanson 2009 accurately captures the rising time of the water level at the downstream location as it considered the effect of wave front resistance the predicted variation of the water level is in good agreement with the experimental result when s 0 0 and 0 003 while the prediction deviates significantly from the experimental results when s 0 0 02 fig 10 shows the variation of the water level in both the reservoir area and downstream of the dam for α 0 1 the characteristics of the water level variation in the reservoir area is very similar to that for α 0 the water level at the downstream of the dam gradually becomes stable after a short time rising the analytical model of mungkasi and roberts 2012 can accurately predict the variation of the water level for s 0 0 and 0 003 however for s 0 0 02 the water level at x hu 0 8 predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2012 differs from the experimental measurement this deviation may be ascribed to the fact that the location x hu 0 8 gradually evolves from the steady zone to the rarefaction wave zone and the water level then continues to rise the situation at the position x hu 12 5 is similar with a longer transition time from the steady zone to rarefaction wave zone fig 11 shows the water level at each position for α 0 3 the water level at x hu 1 3 fluctuates significantly for s 0 0 and 0 003 and α 0 3 such water level fluctuation is very small for s 0 0 02 which is consistent with the characteristics observed in section 3 2 in which the extra negative waves are difficult to propagate towards the reservoir area when the water depth ratio further increases e g α 0 5 periodic water level fluctuations occur both in the reservoir area and downstream of the dam when the water depth ratio further increases to α 0 7 the frequency of fluctuations increases while the flow has the characteristics of favre waves soares frazao and zech 2002 fig 11 shows that the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 which was obtained based on the shallow water assumption is unable to capture the wave characteristics 3 4 mean velocity fig 12 shows the dimensionless mean velocity profiles where the measured data for s 0 0 have been published in wang et al 2020d the flow velocity increases continuously with time and the peak velocity appears in the wave front for downstream dry bed when there is downstream tailwater the situation is different it is seen that for α 0 1 and flat mild bed slope e g s 0 0 and 0 003 flow velocity approaches a steady value in the steady state region while for steep slope e g s 0 0 02 the flow velocity gradually decreases after reaching the peak when tailwater depth downstream increases to α 0 3 the position of the maximum flow velocity moves towards the reservoir area for a higher α e g 0 5 and 0 7 there is a wave variation for the velocity distribution in both upstream and downstream reaches fig 13 shows that the flow velocity at x hu 1 3 gradually decreases in the later stage for s 0 0 and 0 003 with downstream dry bed while for s 0 0 02 flow velocity still gradually increases for hu 0 4 m the flow velocity gradually decreases in the later stage at position x hu 12 8 since the celerity of negative wave is slower when hu 0 2 m the significant decline of the flow velocity appears later correspondingly the change characteristics for α 0 1 is similar to that of downstream dry bed for high downstream water depth e g α 0 3 flow velocity fluctuates at x hu 1 3 which is affected by the extra negative waves such fluctuation frequency gradually increases as α increases from the variation of flow velocity at position x hu 12 8 it can be seen that the impact of such fluctuation spreads faster to the reservoir area for α 0 7 than that for α 0 5 for the position downstream of the dam the flow velocity has a steep rise and then slowly declines in dry bed condition the flow velocity gradually recovers to a stable value after a sharp rise when α 0 1 0 3 but from the change of the flow velocity at position x hu 12 5 it can be seen that the stable value for s 0 0 02 is smaller than that for s 0 0 and 0 003 this could be explained as follows in the case of a downstream wet bed the water depth is relatively larger at position x hu 12 5 for s 0 0 02 the flow velocity gradually becomes stable after the fluctuation at x hu 0 8 when α 0 5 and 0 7 since the water depth at x hu 12 5 is larger for s 0 0 02 the energy is dissipated faster and thus the flow velocity begins to decrease earlier compared to that for s 0 0 and 0 003 3 5 wave celerity 3 5 1 negative wave and wave front fig 14 shows the variation of the average negative wave celerity with time it is seen that the negative wave celerity sharply decreases with time at the initial stage t 5 and then gradually decreases and approaches a steady state for s 0 0 due to the effect of the bed slope there is an added horizontal acceleration on the flow which is opposite to the negative wave propagation direction therefore the negative wave celerity will gradually decrease at the later stage under the situation of the bed slope s 0 0 003 and 0 02 the analytical solutions of dressler 1958 chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 have the same dimensionless negative wave celerity which is equal to 1 for a horizontal bed however for bed slope is larger than zero i e s 0 0 003 and 0 02 in this study the dimensionless negative wave celerity continuously decreases with time the analytical solutions of chanson 2009 solution and the mungkasi and roberts 2011 have exactly the same negative wave celerity for three different bed slope conditions the negative wave celerity predicted by dressler 1958 decreases slower than those predicted by chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 and it has a tendency to be close to the experimental results with the evolution of the dam break flow the negative wave celerity predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2012 deviates relatively small from the experimental results for s 0 0 003 and α 0 1 with the increase of the water depth ratio the predicted negative wave celerity improves for the steep bed slope s 0 0 02 with wet bed condition there exists relatively large difference between the analytical calculation and experimental measurements for all water depth ration investigated here fig 15 shows the variation of the average wave front celerity with time it is seen that the bed slope has a great effect on the wave front celerity owing to the still water in the downstream of the dam has greater resistance compared to the dry bed case it is shown that the wave front celerity in the dry bed case is significantly larger than that in wet bed case analytical solutions of dressler 1958 chanson 2009 and mungkasi and roberts 2011 2012 are plotted in fig 15 for comparison it shows that the wave front celerity predicted by dressler 1958 is similar to that predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2011 for three different bed slopes as the influence of the wave front resistance is not considered in both analytical solutions the wave front celerity continuously increases with time for the bed slope s 0 0 003 and 0 02 and the dimensionless celerity is much larger than the experimental measurement chanson 2009 considered the wave front resistance effect and the predicted wave front celerity is in good agreement with the measurements the wave front celerity of mungkasi and roberts 2012 does not change with time on the horizontal bed and it is in good agreement with the experimental results it is slowly increasing at s 0 0 003 and has little different with the experimental results but in the case of s 0 0 02 the wave front celerity rises faster which is coordinate with the experimental situation in the early stage almost t 15 but in the later stage the celerity is faster than the experimental situation it is analyzed that there will be more energy dissipation in the interaction between the wave front and the downstream still water in the experiment and the acceleration will change instead of keeping a fixed value like the analytical solution 3 5 2 first extra negative wave and first downstream wave experimental results show that the periodic waves will not only propagate downstream but also appear in the reservoir area for rivers channels with cascade regulation mechanism such periodic waves will propagate towards upstream when the gate is used to adjust the discharge this will have an adverse effect on upstream structures or the navigation of upstream vessels therefore it is also important to investigate the propagation of the extra negative waves figs 16 and 17 are respectively the variation of the dimensionless average celerity of the first extra negative wave and the first downstream wave with time for various α and bed slopes it is seen that the dimensionless celerity of the first extra negative wave has great consistency between hu 0 2 m and hu 0 4 m and the same for the dimensionless celerity of the first downstream wave the celerity of both the first extra negative wave and the first wave increases with time reaches a maximum and then decreases with time fig 16 also shows that the celerity of the first extra negative wave propagating along the steep slope s 0 0 02 is smaller than that along the flat and mild slope such difference increases with the increase of the evolution time while for the celerity of the first wave the situation is another way round the celerity of the first wave is larger along the steep slope s 0 0 02 than that along the flat and mild slope s 0 0 and 0 003 due to the promoting effect of gravity component in the horizontal direction the following empirical formulas are developed for the first extra negative wave celerity eq 6 and the first downstream wave celerity eq 7 6 c en 1 75 10 6 t 3 0 009 s 0 1 18 t 2 0 0135 t 0 67 α 0 38 7 c es 2 6 10 6 t 3 0 003 s 0 t 2 0 009 t 0 26 α 0 82 the correlation coefficient r 2 is applied to analyze the fitting results fig 18 shows the comparison of experimental measurements and the fitted data calculated using eqs 6 and 7 the good agreement between the calculated and measured data indicates that eqs 6 and 7 can be used to quickly estimate the wave celerity and provide a certain reference for engineers in actual design and operation 3 6 wave height 3 6 1 favre waves fr is a characteristic parameter for analyzing favre waves and can be calculated as treske 1994 8 fr ω c 0 c a u 0 c 0 where ω is the relative propagation speed to the base flow u 0 which is 0 in the present study c a is the absolute propagation speed of the first downstream wave front c 0 is the wave speed c 0 g h 0 h 0 is water depth immediately in the front of the first downstream wave soares frazao and zech 2002 obtained the formula fr h 2 2 h 0 2 h 2 h 0 which is the application of eq 8 for the case of horizontal bed for convenience of comparison of the results with different bed slopes the eq 8 is used for calculation treske 1994 fig 19 shows the calculated fr at water depth ratios α 0 3 and α 0 5 it can be seen that under horizontal bed condition fr has little variation with time and is greater than 1 28 for both water depth ratios investigated i e α 0 3 and α 0 5 the wave front shows a steep or broken form which is consistent with the description of soares frazao and zech 2002 for bed slope s 0 0 003 fr decreases with time for α 0 3 but it is also greater than 1 28 and the wave front is also steep which is consistent with the observation in fig 4 fr is very close to 1 28 at the late evolution for α 0 5 however fr significantly decreases at s 0 0 02 this is because the water depth of the downstream still water which is interacted with the wave front continues to increase indicating that more energy will be dissipated downstream fig 19 a also shows that fr is very close to 1 28 fr 1 297 at the late stage i e t 34 for s 0 0 02 and α 0 3 it is expected that if the flow continues to evolve limited by the length of the flume available for measurement downstream of the dam in this study which limits the maximum evolution time being approximately t 34 for hu 0 2 m it will also produce stable favre waves fig 20 shows the comparison of the measured parameters of favre wave under the horizontal bed with the previous results favre 1935 sandover and zienkiewcz 1957 treske 1994 marche et al 1995 soares frazao and zech 2002 bishnu and devkota 2009 it can be seen that zmax initially increases with the increase of fr and then decreases significantly after fr 1 28 due to the wave breaking the experimental result is in good agreement with that observed by treske 1994 the change of zm increases almost linearly with fr which is also well predicted by eq 8 it is also seen that zmin increases gradually with the increase of fr and has a sharp increase when fr is larger than 1 28 in addition the maximum value of the wave front height zmax determines the highest water level when the flood develops towards downstream fig 21 shows the wave front height for various test conditions the wave front height is calculated using the water level in the steady zone when α 0 4 it is seen that the variation of the wave front height with α has a double peak the maximum value of the wave front height appears at α 0 2 and the dimensionless height is approximately 0 31 the wave front height reaches the second peak at α 0 6 and decreases sharply with the increase of α it is shown that the bed slope and downstream water depth has an insignificant effect on the dimensionless wave front height particularly when α 0 6 which is influenced by favre waves the wave front height predicted by mungkasi and roberts 2012 solid line is the same for three different bed slopes and is in good agreement with the experimental measurement for 0 α 0 4 however the analytical model significantly under predict the wave front height when the favre wave occurs this indicates that the shallow water assumption is not suitable for describing the phenomenon of weak non hydrostatic flow when the water depth ratio is large as evidenced previously 3 6 2 first extra negative waves fig 22 shows that the peak water level of the first extra negative wave decreases with the time for flat and mild bed slope e g s 0 0 and 0 003 the peak water level remains almost constant for a period of time and then falls down for s 0 0 02 the peak water level is always falling and the change process of water level shows a gradual decrease followed by a sharp decline it is maybe due to the fall of the water level at the end of the reservoir which accelerates the peak water level of the first extra negative wave descending this means that the extra negative waves formed in the limited length reservoir will continue to dissipate during the propagation towards the reservoir area in a relatively large bed slope as such the impact on the upstream structure will gradually decrease with the evolution of the flow 4 conclusions in this paper the experiments are carried out in a large flume under different bed slopes and downstream tailwater depths the main conclusions are as follows 1 the experimental observation shows that the increase of the bed slope will change the evolution pattern of the dam break flow in the case of s 0 0 and 0 003 there are periodic waves i e the extra negative waves propagating towards the reservoir area when α 0 3 while favre waves stably evolve downstream when α 0 6 the stable favre waves can be formed in large water depth ration for steep slope i e α 0 5 s 0 0 02 in this study increase of the bed slope makes fr tend to decline with time 2 the wave front height shows a double peak property with the α increases the maximum wave front height appears roughly when α 0 2 for all three different bed slopes and the dimensionless height is approximately 0 31 the first downstream wave causes the second maximum value to occur when α 0 6 the wave front height gradually decreases with the α increases when α 0 6 since the wave front height calculated based on the shallow water assumption is significantly small for α 0 5 it is more appropriate to use the calculation method which assumes a weak non hydrostatic flow to descript the wave front height soares frazao and zech 2002 3 the appearance of extra negative waves leads to a significant undulation of the water surface profiles and mean velocity in the reservoir the frequency of the undulation gradually increases with the increase of α the peak water level of the first extra negative wave is gradually falling after maintaining a stability value for a period of time when s 0 0 and 0 003 while it is always falling when s 0 0 02 since the extra negative wave can affect the upstream channel it needs to be considered in the design of the structure of the channel 4 the comparison with the analytical solutions shows that the negative wave celerity is better predicted by dressler 1958 while the analytical solution of chanson 2009 can better capture the motion of the wave front for small bed slope and water depth ration i e s 0 0 003 0 α 0 3 the analytical model of mungkasi and roberts 2012 can provide the relatively good prediction for the motion of flow however it cannot describe the periodic wave phenomenon that occurs in the reservoir area or downstream of the dam when α 0 3 for large bed slope s 0 0 02 the initial conditions assumed in the analytical solution of mungkasi and roberts 2012 are different from the experimental conditions therefore it is unable to use to predict the dam break flow with steep slope the current research expands the understanding of the effects of the bed slope and the tailwater level on the movement of dam break flows the tailwater level and bed slope both have a significant impact on the evolution pattern of the dam break flows the favre waves will apparently raise the downstream water level in flood control it is indicated that the water depth ratio is an important element when making flood emergency plans in real life declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
