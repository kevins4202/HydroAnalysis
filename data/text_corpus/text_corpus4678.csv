forces impacting on single side of the structure n 1 introduction the propagation of waves over an obstacle usually experiences complicated hydrodynamic behaviors including vortex generation and violent free surface flow which can dissipate the energy of incident waves and reduce the height of transmitted waves effectively many types of offshore structures have been studied to find the suitable breakwaters in ocean engineering among them submerged type structures attract numerous attentions in these years due to its environmental advantage and many studies on the interaction between waves and submerged structures have been carried out model experiment is still the dominating method for these studies although it has the limits of high cost and scale effect in most cases the numerical model being capable of providing comprehensive flow information and capturing strongly nonlinear phenomena accurately therefore is highly desirable for the design and construction of marine breakwaters earlier studies of wave transmission over submerged obstacles including partially and fully submerged structures mostly focused on periodical incident waves such as losada et al 1992 1993 however few of these studies considered the wave propagation over a submerged obstacle induced by a solitary wave it is well known that the solitary wave is a desirable alternative to simulate tsunami type wave many studies have employed solitary wave to investigate the interaction of extreme wave with marine structures considerable amount of these studies focused on transmission properties of solitary waves propagating over obstacles seabra santos et al 1987 studied the propagation of solitary wave over an obstacle by both numerical and experimental methods similar studies also include experimental and numerical works conducted by lynett et al 2000 chang et al 2001 and lin 2004 shao 2005 employed the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to examine the characteristics of solitary wave reflection and transmission after impacts on a partially immersed breakwater lately solitary wave impinging on porous breakwaters was numerically investigated to determine the wave transmission properties by lin and karunarathna 2007 most of these studies primarily focused on the effectiveness of breakwater with different structural forms and different wave conditions moreover vortex shedding and evolution induced by a solitary wave propagating over submerged obstacles have attracted considerable attentions in recent days due to improvement of measured facilities and numerical analysis tools chang et al 2001 conducted a series of numerical and experimental tests to investigate the vortex evolution induced by solitary waves passing over a submerged rectangular obstacle further studies on vortex shedding and evolution after solitary waves impinge on submerged obstacles were performed by huang and dong 2001 lin et al 2006 lin and huang 2010 more recently the vortex generation and evolution during a solitary wave propagating over a bottom mounted barrier were investigated both experimentally and numerically by wu et al 2012 zarruk et al 2015 conducted a variety of experimental and numerical investigations to examine the shedding and evolution of vortices induced by a solitary wave passing over a submerged cylindrical structure zaghian et al 2017 investigated experimentally the interaction of a solitary wave with a submerged thin plate with the consideration of installed angles in which the velocities and vortices near the submerged structure were measured using piv technique the majority of the above experimental and numerical studies mainly emphasized on the characteristics of velocity and vorticity fields near the targeted structure without the consideration of wave forces the constrained interpolation profile cip method was firstly proposed to solve the hyperbolic type equations by takewaki et al 1985 which was named as the cubic interpolated pseudo particle method originally this semi lagrangian scheme mainly applied in the fields of physics and electromagnetism was further developed by takewaki and yabe 1987 yabe and takei 1988 yabe and aoki 1991 yabe et al 1991 yabe et al 2001 then hu and kashiwagi 2004 2009 employed the cip method to predict violent free surface flow and strongly nonlinear wave structure interaction after that the cip method was extensively validated by a series of wave body interaction studies such as he et al 2011 zhao and hu 2012 he 2013 liao and hu 2013 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 ji et al 2017 in this study a submerged structure in form of vertical and thin obstacle height width ratio 1 was investigated using the cip based model such structure is easy to design and construct as an alternative of breakwater as well as it has a small influence on environment the primary goal of this study is to develop a cip based numerical model to investigate a solitary wave propagating over a submerged obstacle violent free surface motions and corresponding nonlinear phenomena were simulated and analyzed the wave forces acting on the submerged obstacle were calculated by integrating pressure along the structure surface in addition the velocity and vorticity fields were evaluated to determine the characteristics of vortex generation and evolution the numerical results including free surface profiles velocity distribution and vorticity fields were compared with the published experimental data in good agreement finally transmission properties of the solitary wave impinging on the structure with different widths and heights were systematically studied by this well validated model 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical methods a two dimensional computational model based on the cip method with non uniform and staggered cartesian grid was developed in the study the model solves an unsteady viscous and incompressible flow which is governed by the following continuity and navier stokes equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j 2 μ s i j f i where u i is the velocity component ρ and μ are density and dynamic viscosity respectively p is the pressure and f i denotes the body force including the gravity s ij u i x j u j x i 2 the multi phase flow was adopted in the model which includes the liquid phase water gas phase air and solid phase structure the interfaces between the different phases should be captured accurately in the computations more specially the free surface and solid boundary need to be determined in each time step we define a density function φ m m 1 2 3 denotes liquid gas solid phase respectively to recognize different phases which satisfies the following equation 3 φ m t u i φ m x i 0 in addition the density functions in each computational cell have the following relation 4 φ m 1 0 the structure in the study is assumed to be rigid and a direct method was used to calculate the φ 3 the φ 1 was obtained by solution of eq 3 then the density function for air phase φ 2 was calculated via algebraic relation of eq 4 once the density functions are determined physical information in each computational cell can be obtained 5 λ m 1 3 φ m λ m where λ is physical property such as the density and viscosity the cip scheme was employed to calculate the advection equations using both the function and its spatial derivatives as dependent variables a vof type method named tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc originally proposed by xiao et al 2005 was used to capture the free surface detailed information about the numerical implementation can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 2009 2 2 boundary conditions a piston type wavemaker was employed for the generation of solitary waves and the motion of the paddle was implemented the same as that in he and kashiwagi 2012 which can be derived from rayleigh s solution the free surface elevation can be expressed as following equation in the rayleigh boussinesq theory 6 ζ x a sech 2 k c t x where a is wave height k is outskirts decay coefficient and c is wave celerity according to rayleigh s solution k and c can be selected as follows 7 k 3 a 4 h 2 a h 8 c g h a where h is still water depth the duration τ of the paddle motion can be determined by the following equation 9 τ 2 c k tanh 1 0 999 a h finally the displacement and velocity of wavemaker are controlled by the following motion law 10 x t a k sinh 2 k c t h 2 a h cosh 2 k c t 11 x t 2 a c h 2 a cosh 2 k c t h h 2 a h cosh 2 k c t 2 during the numerical operation the displacement and velocity of piston type wavemaker were time marched in accordance to eqs 10 and 11 after the duration of the paddle motion the wavemaker arrived at its maximum stroke and was kept as fixed in the rest of numerical iteration an artificial damping was placed on the downstream region of the wave flume by adding an artificial damping force to navier stokes equations it should be noticed that turbulence model and surface tension were not included in the present cip based model for the structure of interest the rigid body assumption is reasonable and the no slip condition was applied a virtual particle method hu and kashiwagi 2009 was employed to determine the solid boundary and its density function the basic idea of this method is to map the geometry information of solid body in a fixed cartesian grid using a series of distributing particles along its surface after the structure boundary and pressure field are determined the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structure can be calculated by integrating the pressure and skin friction along the body surface 2 3 computational setup the schematic diagram of the present numerical model is shown in fig 1 where the origin was defined at the intersection of the still water level and the left boundary of wave flume the computational domain is 17 5 m 1 m in the x and y direction respectively to enhance the computational efficiency the non uniform grids were used to discretize the computational domain where the grid refinement was applied in the zone around the submerged structure free surface and wavemaker the relatively coarse grids were employed to discretize the computation regions that are far away from the free surface and submerged obstacle the total number of the present grids is 1334 530 with the minimum grid spacing of δx 1 mm and δy 0 5 mm in the x and y direction respectively the initial time step of the simulations was set as δt τ 2000 which would be automatically updated during the simulations to satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the total time of each simulation is 12 s to validate the model the setup of structure size and wave conditions in numerical simulations followed the experiment by wu et al 2012 a solitary wave with wave height of a 0 07 m in the water depth of h 0 14 m was generated the submerged breakwater was fixed on the water bottom with the central position of x 8 m the width and height of the breakwater are w 0 02 m and h 0 10 m respectively six wave gauges coincided with the experimental setup were placed and its detailed positions are listed in table 1 it should be noted that the distance between the structure and wavemaker in the present model is different from the experimental setup which is for the purpose of obtaining pure and steady solitary waves in simulations for easy comparison with measurements the time instant that the crest of the solitary wave arrives at the wg2 gauge was defined as t 0 s which is consistent with the definition of experiment in wu et al 2012 2 4 verification of solitary waves a series of numerical tests were firstly conducted without structure to verify the solitary waves generated by the model the wave elevation at the position of a submerged breakwater i e wg3 was illustrated and compared with theoretical solution of green naghdi g n equations by ertekin et al 1986 as follow 12 ζ x c t a sech 2 3 a 4 h 2 h a x c t fig 2 shows the comparison of time history of the free surface elevation between the present computations and theoretical solutions with solitary wave heights of a h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 35 and 0 5 these wave heights will be used for the following simulations a great agreement between present computations and g n predictions was observed for five different wave heights the maximum error of crest value is 3 21 and the average value for five cases is 2 62 3 results and discussion to demonstrate the capacity of the cip based model in solving strongly nonlinear interaction of solitary wave with structure numerical simulations of a solitary wave propagating over the submerged breakwater were conducted the numerical results including free surface motions wave forces and flow field distribution were presented and compared with published experimental data and computational results the propagation and deformation of solitary waves passing over the structure are of another interest therefore the wave reflection and transmission coefficients induced by a submerged breakwater with different sizes were computed and discussed to provide some effective implications for the design of submerged obstacle type breakwater 3 1 free surface motions the free surface of solitary wave propagating over submerged structure generally experiences a violent evolution due to induced hydrodynamic phenomena the evolution process of violent free surface flow is hard to capture for many numerical models because of its strong nonlinearity to demonstrate the performance of the developed model the free surface evolution of a solitary wave passing the structure was compared with the corresponding experiment fig 3 shows the comparison of free surface displacements between the numerical results and measured data by wu et al 2012 at five time instants a crest crest exchange process which was initially described by cooker et al 1990 for a solitary wave passing the submerged structure was recorded with a high accuracy and resolution by present cip based model more specifically numerical results show that the free surface motions roughly experienced six stages during the interaction between the solitary wave and the submerged obstacle there are the stages of 1 intact wave form 2 bulge generation 3 double wave crests 4 steep free surface 5 backward wave breaking and 6 air water mixing firstly the solitary wave propagates along the horizontal direction with an intact shape when the wave crest has a long distance to the structure as the wave crest approaches the structure a bulge is formed along the lee side of free surface fig 3 a after the incoming wave crest passing the breakwater the bulge develops into a new wave crest which leads to existence of double wave crests as shown in fig 3 b then the incoming wave crest gradually disappears and the weather side of the new crest grows into a sharp wave surface fig 3 c after the critical point wave breaking occurs and overturning wave impacts on the free surface as shown in fig 3 d the strong backward wave breaking happens some air is entrapped into the water and splitting appears during this stage which leads to the air water mixing and small fluctuations of free surface fig 3 e during the simulations a good agreement between present results and experimental data was observed in entire process of wave structure interaction even for the breaking stages at t 0 88 s and 1 02 s the agreement was deemed satisfactory which shows a great performance of the model in solving violent free surface flow it is worth to mention that complicated behaviors of the free surface including wave overturning fig 3 d and air water mixing fig 3 e were well captured by the cip based model but were not fully recorded by piv technique due to its limitation of treatment in aerated region wu et al 2012 the comparison of the free surface elevation at three wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 between present computations and experimental data was illustrated in fig 4 the wg2 wave gauge was set at the upstream of the structure the reflected wave due to the structure was recorded by wave gauge wg2 which can be obviously seen in fig 4 a within 0 6 s t 1 5 s another two wave gauges were placed on the middle wg3 and downstream wg4 of the structure respectively the time history of the free surface elevation at the location of wg4 shows a stronger nonlinear feature due to the occurrence of wave breaking and splitting near the location of x 8 2 m after the crest passed the breakwater the calculations by wu et al 2012 were also plotted in fig 4 for comparison which was conducted by cornell breaking and structure cobras model in general the present computations have a satisfactory agreement with other results in all three locations especially for the main wave form the free surface elevation by the piv system is only available at wg3 x 8 m because its view focused on the flow field around the structure it also can be observed that the free surface elevation estimated by piv images agrees fairly well with present computation at the wave gauge of wg3 however both numerical models slightly overestimate the wave crests at three locations and discrepancies exist between the computations and measurements at the tailing wave stage it should be noted that the tailing waves predicted by present numerical model are much closer to the measurements than the results from the cobras model especially for gauge located at x 8 347 m where the wave breaking occurs after the wave crest propagates over the submerged structure 3 2 wave forces and pressure distribution for further verifying the numerical model wave forces impacting on the breakwater were computed and compared with computations by wu et al 2012 for a vertical rigid breakwater the horizontal wave forces are of main interest and presented solely in this section the comparison of the horizontal wave force on the vertical obstacle between present model and cobras model wu et al 2012 was plotted in fig 5 the numerical results show that the time history of the horizontal force has a short duration impact force with a positive direction followed by a train of nonlinear oscillation fig 6 shows the comparison of time history of the horizontal forces impacting on the single side of the structure as shown in figs 5 and 6 the computations conducted by the cip based model agree fairly well with the results obtained by the cobras model especially for the maximum value of the wave forces acting on the breakwater although a discrepancy between two computations can be seen in the tailing stage of the time series both numerical models estimated a nonlinear trend for the time history of wave forces after the wave breaking occurs as can be seen in fig 6 the horizontal wave force acting on the weather side is much larger than that impacting on the lee side during the wave structure interaction the time history of the wave force acting on the weather side shows a smooth trend while the nonlinear oscillation can be observed for the wave force acting on the lee side in the tailing stage because lee side is closer to the location of wave breaking the maximum total horizontal force acting on the structure occurs at the time instant of t 1 0 40 s which follows the appearing time instant of the maximum total vertical force t 2 0 36 s the maximum horizontal forces impacting on the single sides occur later than the appearing time instant of maximum total wave forces which are t 3 0 44 s for the weather side and t 4 0 58 s for lee side respectively the corresponding pressure fields at four critical time instants t 0 40 0 36 0 44 and 0 58 s are presented in fig 7 it can be seen that the total horizontal and vertical forces acting on the breakwater achieve the maximum value as the wave crest approaches the weather side of the breakwater the maximum horizontal force acting on the weather side of the structure also appears before the wave crest propagating over the structure while the horizontal force impacting on the lee side of the breakwater reaches to the maximum value during the stage of double crests existing a spiral zone with relatively low pressure is formed due to generation of vortex near the top side of the structure which conforms to the fact that the flow field with high velocities has the low pressure distribution more detailed discussion of velocity fields and vortex evolution will be carried out in the following section fig 8 shows the time history of the horizontal forces acting on the structure under wave heights of a h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 35 and 0 5 the time history of the horizontal forces has nonlinear fluctuation after appearance of its maximum values in the cases of large wave heights a h 0 35 and 0 5 this behavior is mainly due to the complicated hydrodynamic phenomena including the wave breaking and air water mixing which become more violent for the cases with larger wave height fig 9 shows the comparison of the maximum horizontal forces between the present computations and the results by cobras model it can be seen that present computations correspond fairly well with the results calculated by cobras model for the maximum horizontal forces under different wave heights although a slight difference was observed between two numerical models with large wave heights a h 0 35 and 0 5 both the computations show a nearly linear increasing of the maximum horizontal forces as the wave height increases the finding of the nearly linear relationship between the maximum horizontal force and the wave height was also reported by liu and al banaa 2004 and detailed explanation and formulae were expressed in terms of incient wave height and the draught in general the cip based model shows a good performance in prediction of solitary waves interacting with a submerged structure 3 3 velocity and vorticity fields velocity fields of interaction between a solitary wave and the submerged barrier were calculated by wu et al 2012 with the cobras model in which the air was treated as numerical voids rather than real air such kind of single flow model was employed to study the wave structure interaction by many scholars such as grilli et al 1994 shao 2005 he and kashiwagi 2012 and so on it is known that the numerical model without consideration of real air is hard to record complicated hydrodynamic behaviors fully as well as reproduce real violent flow with a high reliability the multi phase flow was considered in the cip based model to simulate characteristics of the real flow field fig 10 shows the comparison of velocity fields between present numerical results and experimental data wu et al 2012 at five time instants it should be noted that the different origins were defined in simulation and experiment in fig 10 as well as fig 12 the origin of the present model was defined at the intersection of the still water level and the left boundary of wave flume while that of experiment was set at the bottom left corner of structure but the effectiveness of comparison can be guaranteed by the same range of selected zone and consistent reference standard of variables in both the present simulation and compared experiment distributions of both air velocity and water velocity were calculated by present model and the complicated velocity fields of air water mixing can be observed at t 0 88 s and 1 02 s in fig 10 d and e the more specific snapshot of velocity field during the air water mixing stage at t 1 02 s was shown in fig 11 where the vortices were captured by the cip based model in air zone free surface and water zone respectively overall a satisfactory agreement can be seen between the simulations and measurements for all five time instants shown in fig 10 including the velocity fields and free surface variation meanwhile the discrepancies between present results and experimental data can be seen from the vortex under the free surface when the wave breaking occurs the main deviation of velocity fields appears at the stages of overturning and air bubbles t 0 88 s and 1 02 s the discrepancy is partly because the numerical mesh around the structure is 1 mm 0 5 mm which has the difference with the resolution of piv measurements 1 5852 mm moreover the piv method cannot obtain the accurate and full velocity distribution in the highly aerated zone of flow field due to the poor scattering performance of laser light the piv inter correlation algorithm was mainly based on the micro foam structures and bubble displacements kimmoun and branger 2007 wu et al 2012 which leads to that the hydrodynamic behaviors of overturning jet and air water mixing cannot be recorded by the experiment however these phenomena were captured entirely by the cip based model other possible reason for the discrepancies is that strongly nonlinear interaction between the waves and structure involves some random behaviors and uncertainty chan and melville 1988 especially around wave breaking zone and highly bubbly flow vorticity fields were calculated by present model to show vortex generation and evolution which is one of great interests for the wave structure interaction the operation of v x u y which is consistent with the setup of experiment was employed to compute vorticity fields using the central differencing scheme fig 12 presents the comparison of vorticity fields between the numerical results and experimental data at seven evolutionary stages in these vorticity fields the negative values denote the clockwise vortices and the positive vorticity distributions indicate the anticlockwise vortices numerical results show that two clockwise vortices and an anticlockwise vortex with relatively small size are generated around the top and lee sides of the structure as the wave crest approaching the breakwater t 1 0 32 s then these vortices develop into a main clockwise vortex moving along the direction of wave propagation as show in fig 12 b with time instant of t 0 46 s when the wave crest passed over the structure the steep free surface appears a large anticlockwise vortex t 0 60 s due to the air velocity which was captured by the numerical model but not recorded by the physical experiment as propagation of the wave crest the anticlockwise vortex along the free surface grows in size and gradually moves to the air zone as well as the main clockwise vortex in fluid continues to move forward t 0 74 s after that the backward breaking wave impacts on the free surface then some air is entrapped into water which induced an anticlockwise vortex under the free surface and complicated vorticity distribution can be observed at the time instant of t 0 88 s subsequently the anticlockwise vortex and the main clockwise one begin to interact with each other because their motion directions are opposite the vorticity field of air water mixing zone becomes more chaotic as observed in stage of t 1 02 s finally the effect of diffusion and the interaction of different vortices gradually attenuate these vortices in size and strength as seen in time instant of t 1 30 s the similar behaviors of vortices generation and evolution under the free surface were obtained by wu et al 2012 expect for the vorticity distribution for air phase in general current numerical results fit well with the measurements wu et al 2012 for the vortices of water however some discrepancies between the computations and measured data can be observed in the stages of wave breaking and air water mixing t 1 02 s and 1 30 s especially for the strength of vorticity the resolution of simulation and experiment measurement plays an important role in calculating the vorticity fields according to wu et al 2012 the difference of resolution between the present model and measured facilities may be one of main reasons for these discrepancies other possible explanations for the deviation of vorticity are similar to the discussion of velocity fields such as the random behaviors of wave breaking 3 4 effect of structure size above validations show that the cip based model has a high reliability to simulate the interaction between a solitary wave and the submerged structure moreover a further study on the impacting process of a solitary wave with the submerged breakwater for different geometrical sizes was conducted in this section our great interest is the wave reflection and transmission coefficients for the application of submerged type breakwater in ocean engineering notice that the time instant that the crest of the solitary wave arrives at the wg1 gauge was defined as t 0 s in the following discussion the breakwaters with different widths and heights were investigated by the present study in order to obtain the general rule the width and height of structure were selected uniformly with an interval of 0 02 m the maximum width 0 06 m of obstacle was chose smaller than its minimum height 0 08 m to ensure the shape characteristic of thin obstacle the schematic view for the setup of structure sizes is presented in fig 13 where totally five types of structure were considered with three widths and three heights respectively the wave conditions correspond with the previous computations namely water depth of h 0 14 m and a solitary wave with its height of a h 0 5 were employed fig 14 shows the free surface profiles in three stages of interest for the interaction of a solitary wave with the x model 2 x model 3 y model 1 and y model 3 respectively from fig 14 it can be seen that the width of structure has a relatively minor effect on the backward wave breaking process almost the same volume of air is entrapped into the water for the breakwater with different widths while the location that backward breaking wave impacts on the free surface is closer to the structure as the width becomes larger as shown in fig 14 a and 14 b however the height of breakwater plays an important role in the backward wave breaking process when the height of structure is small only little air is entrapped into the water and the range of motion for the underwater air is limited fig 14 c for the breakwater with large height a steep free surface is formed when the wave crest approaches the weather side which leads to occurrence of the first time wave breaking as the wave crest passed over the structure the breaking wave impacts on the free surface the second time and much air is entrapped into the water with a relatively extensive range of motion which can be seen in fig 14 d the free surface elevation at wg1 x 6 m and wg5 x 10 m were calculated to determine the wave reflection and transmission coefficients the time history of the free surface elevation at wg1 and wg5 for five types of structures are presented in fig 15 where the first and second stages of data at x 6 m indicates the incident wave and reflected wave respectively the computed results at x 10 m denote the transmitted wave as can be seen in fig 15 the time history of the free surface elevation for the reflected and transmitted waves conforms to the feature of solitary wave therefore we can simply assume the reflection and transmission coefficients as the ratio of the reflected and transmitted wave height versus the height of incident wave the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients with different widths and heights of the breakwater is presented in fig 16 as shown in fig 16 the width of breakwater has little effect on the wave reflection and transmission a slight increase and decrease for the reflection and transmission coefficients can be observed with increasing of the breakwater width on the other hand the transmission coefficients show an obvious decrease with the increasing heights of structure while the reflection coefficients become larger as the heights of the breakwater increased losada et al 1992 reported an acceptable performance of wave dissipation by vertical thin barrier in regard to linear waves however the lowest transmission coefficient in the present five simulations is 0 81 which was obtained by the structure with the width of 0 02 m and the height of 0 12 m it is mainly because the motion trail of water particles near free surface is the arc line for solitary wave which means the water particles have an upward and forward displacement as the solitary wave crest approaching the structure therefore the submerged structure cannot break the solitary wave to a large extent and the main body of solitary wave can propagate over the structure without diffusion for the sea areas where tsunami type wave will appear we rationally argue that the submerged obstacle type breakwater should not be selected as the first choice due to its non ideal performance of wave dissipation for the solitary waves the effect of structure sizes on the wave forces is another interest since time history of the wave forces for cases with different structure sizes almost has very similar features the occurring time instants for the maximum wave forces in the cases with different widths and heights are listed in tables 2 and 3 the corresponding pressure fields for four types of structure at occurrence of the maximum horizontal wave forces are plotted in fig 17 the maximum horizontal force occurs as wave crest approached the structure in all cases as can be seen in fig 17 on the other hand the structure sizes have an obvious effect on the spiral low pressure zone generated near the top side of the structure the submerged breakwater with the narrow width and high height generates a distinct low pressure zone which due to generation of vortex around the top of such kind of structure it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the horizontal width of structure affects occurrence of the maximum wave forces to some extent while the vertical height of the structure has almost no effect on it the earlier maximum horizontal forces and later maximum vertical forces can be obtained with the increasing widths of structure it can be explained by that the wave crest needs less time to approach the weather side of structure as the width is large but it needs much time to run over the whole top of structure 4 conclusions the interaction of a solitary wave with the submerged breakwater was numerically investigated by a developed cip based numerical model which is capable of treating viscosity effect and strong nonlinearity the comprehensive validations and verifications were performed to assess the capability of the proposed model in simulating the impacting of solitary wave on the submerged structure the numerical results show satisfactory agreement with the experimental measurements in free surface profiles wave forces and velocity fields the violent free surface motion and its evolution during a solitary wave propagated over a submerged structure were captured well by present numerical model the hydrodynamic forces acting on the breakwater show an impulse type feature with a maximum value in the horizontal direction the current computations for the maximum horizontal wave forces agree fairly well with other results the vortices are generated firstly near the top and lee sides of structure as the wave crest approached the breakwater the main clockwise vortex moves along the direction of wave propagation until the occurrence of backward wave breaking which leads to the generation of anticlockwise vortex in the zone of entrapped air the satisfactory agreement for the vorticity fields was obtained between the current simulation and experiment the complicated vortex evolution and vorticity distribution for air phase near the free surface were also simulated by present study due to the consideration of real air in the cip based multi phase flow model effects of the structure size on the wave transmission coefficient were investigated it can be found that the width has little influence on the propagation characteristics of solitary waves passing over the submerged structure while the higher height of breakwater can reduce the wave height of transmitted wave effectively it may be a valuable implication for design of submerged breakwater in ocean engineering overall we can conclude that the cip based model is capable of simulating the extremely nonlinear hydrodynamic phenomena and providing the reliably accurate estimation of flow field for the solitary wave interacting with submerged breakwater declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work is gratefully supported by national natural science foundation of china 51579058 and shandong provincial natural science

forces impacting on single side of the structure n 1 introduction the propagation of waves over an obstacle usually experiences complicated hydrodynamic behaviors including vortex generation and violent free surface flow which can dissipate the energy of incident waves and reduce the height of transmitted waves effectively many types of offshore structures have been studied to find the suitable breakwaters in ocean engineering among them submerged type structures attract numerous attentions in these years due to its environmental advantage and many studies on the interaction between waves and submerged structures have been carried out model experiment is still the dominating method for these studies although it has the limits of high cost and scale effect in most cases the numerical model being capable of providing comprehensive flow information and capturing strongly nonlinear phenomena accurately therefore is highly desirable for the design and construction of marine breakwaters earlier studies of wave transmission over submerged obstacles including partially and fully submerged structures mostly focused on periodical incident waves such as losada et al 1992 1993 however few of these studies considered the wave propagation over a submerged obstacle induced by a solitary wave it is well known that the solitary wave is a desirable alternative to simulate tsunami type wave many studies have employed solitary wave to investigate the interaction of extreme wave with marine structures considerable amount of these studies focused on transmission properties of solitary waves propagating over obstacles seabra santos et al 1987 studied the propagation of solitary wave over an obstacle by both numerical and experimental methods similar studies also include experimental and numerical works conducted by lynett et al 2000 chang et al 2001 and lin 2004 shao 2005 employed the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method to examine the characteristics of solitary wave reflection and transmission after impacts on a partially immersed breakwater lately solitary wave impinging on porous breakwaters was numerically investigated to determine the wave transmission properties by lin and karunarathna 2007 most of these studies primarily focused on the effectiveness of breakwater with different structural forms and different wave conditions moreover vortex shedding and evolution induced by a solitary wave propagating over submerged obstacles have attracted considerable attentions in recent days due to improvement of measured facilities and numerical analysis tools chang et al 2001 conducted a series of numerical and experimental tests to investigate the vortex evolution induced by solitary waves passing over a submerged rectangular obstacle further studies on vortex shedding and evolution after solitary waves impinge on submerged obstacles were performed by huang and dong 2001 lin et al 2006 lin and huang 2010 more recently the vortex generation and evolution during a solitary wave propagating over a bottom mounted barrier were investigated both experimentally and numerically by wu et al 2012 zarruk et al 2015 conducted a variety of experimental and numerical investigations to examine the shedding and evolution of vortices induced by a solitary wave passing over a submerged cylindrical structure zaghian et al 2017 investigated experimentally the interaction of a solitary wave with a submerged thin plate with the consideration of installed angles in which the velocities and vortices near the submerged structure were measured using piv technique the majority of the above experimental and numerical studies mainly emphasized on the characteristics of velocity and vorticity fields near the targeted structure without the consideration of wave forces the constrained interpolation profile cip method was firstly proposed to solve the hyperbolic type equations by takewaki et al 1985 which was named as the cubic interpolated pseudo particle method originally this semi lagrangian scheme mainly applied in the fields of physics and electromagnetism was further developed by takewaki and yabe 1987 yabe and takei 1988 yabe and aoki 1991 yabe et al 1991 yabe et al 2001 then hu and kashiwagi 2004 2009 employed the cip method to predict violent free surface flow and strongly nonlinear wave structure interaction after that the cip method was extensively validated by a series of wave body interaction studies such as he et al 2011 zhao and hu 2012 he 2013 liao and hu 2013 zhao et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 ji et al 2017 in this study a submerged structure in form of vertical and thin obstacle height width ratio 1 was investigated using the cip based model such structure is easy to design and construct as an alternative of breakwater as well as it has a small influence on environment the primary goal of this study is to develop a cip based numerical model to investigate a solitary wave propagating over a submerged obstacle violent free surface motions and corresponding nonlinear phenomena were simulated and analyzed the wave forces acting on the submerged obstacle were calculated by integrating pressure along the structure surface in addition the velocity and vorticity fields were evaluated to determine the characteristics of vortex generation and evolution the numerical results including free surface profiles velocity distribution and vorticity fields were compared with the published experimental data in good agreement finally transmission properties of the solitary wave impinging on the structure with different widths and heights were systematically studied by this well validated model 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical methods a two dimensional computational model based on the cip method with non uniform and staggered cartesian grid was developed in the study the model solves an unsteady viscous and incompressible flow which is governed by the following continuity and navier stokes equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j 2 μ s i j f i where u i is the velocity component ρ and μ are density and dynamic viscosity respectively p is the pressure and f i denotes the body force including the gravity s ij u i x j u j x i 2 the multi phase flow was adopted in the model which includes the liquid phase water gas phase air and solid phase structure the interfaces between the different phases should be captured accurately in the computations more specially the free surface and solid boundary need to be determined in each time step we define a density function φ m m 1 2 3 denotes liquid gas solid phase respectively to recognize different phases which satisfies the following equation 3 φ m t u i φ m x i 0 in addition the density functions in each computational cell have the following relation 4 φ m 1 0 the structure in the study is assumed to be rigid and a direct method was used to calculate the φ 3 the φ 1 was obtained by solution of eq 3 then the density function for air phase φ 2 was calculated via algebraic relation of eq 4 once the density functions are determined physical information in each computational cell can be obtained 5 λ m 1 3 φ m λ m where λ is physical property such as the density and viscosity the cip scheme was employed to calculate the advection equations using both the function and its spatial derivatives as dependent variables a vof type method named tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing thinc originally proposed by xiao et al 2005 was used to capture the free surface detailed information about the numerical implementation can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 2009 2 2 boundary conditions a piston type wavemaker was employed for the generation of solitary waves and the motion of the paddle was implemented the same as that in he and kashiwagi 2012 which can be derived from rayleigh s solution the free surface elevation can be expressed as following equation in the rayleigh boussinesq theory 6 ζ x a sech 2 k c t x where a is wave height k is outskirts decay coefficient and c is wave celerity according to rayleigh s solution k and c can be selected as follows 7 k 3 a 4 h 2 a h 8 c g h a where h is still water depth the duration τ of the paddle motion can be determined by the following equation 9 τ 2 c k tanh 1 0 999 a h finally the displacement and velocity of wavemaker are controlled by the following motion law 10 x t a k sinh 2 k c t h 2 a h cosh 2 k c t 11 x t 2 a c h 2 a cosh 2 k c t h h 2 a h cosh 2 k c t 2 during the numerical operation the displacement and velocity of piston type wavemaker were time marched in accordance to eqs 10 and 11 after the duration of the paddle motion the wavemaker arrived at its maximum stroke and was kept as fixed in the rest of numerical iteration an artificial damping was placed on the downstream region of the wave flume by adding an artificial damping force to navier stokes equations it should be noticed that turbulence model and surface tension were not included in the present cip based model for the structure of interest the rigid body assumption is reasonable and the no slip condition was applied a virtual particle method hu and kashiwagi 2009 was employed to determine the solid boundary and its density function the basic idea of this method is to map the geometry information of solid body in a fixed cartesian grid using a series of distributing particles along its surface after the structure boundary and pressure field are determined the hydrodynamic forces acting on the structure can be calculated by integrating the pressure and skin friction along the body surface 2 3 computational setup the schematic diagram of the present numerical model is shown in fig 1 where the origin was defined at the intersection of the still water level and the left boundary of wave flume the computational domain is 17 5 m 1 m in the x and y direction respectively to enhance the computational efficiency the non uniform grids were used to discretize the computational domain where the grid refinement was applied in the zone around the submerged structure free surface and wavemaker the relatively coarse grids were employed to discretize the computation regions that are far away from the free surface and submerged obstacle the total number of the present grids is 1334 530 with the minimum grid spacing of δx 1 mm and δy 0 5 mm in the x and y direction respectively the initial time step of the simulations was set as δt τ 2000 which would be automatically updated during the simulations to satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the total time of each simulation is 12 s to validate the model the setup of structure size and wave conditions in numerical simulations followed the experiment by wu et al 2012 a solitary wave with wave height of a 0 07 m in the water depth of h 0 14 m was generated the submerged breakwater was fixed on the water bottom with the central position of x 8 m the width and height of the breakwater are w 0 02 m and h 0 10 m respectively six wave gauges coincided with the experimental setup were placed and its detailed positions are listed in table 1 it should be noted that the distance between the structure and wavemaker in the present model is different from the experimental setup which is for the purpose of obtaining pure and steady solitary waves in simulations for easy comparison with measurements the time instant that the crest of the solitary wave arrives at the wg2 gauge was defined as t 0 s which is consistent with the definition of experiment in wu et al 2012 2 4 verification of solitary waves a series of numerical tests were firstly conducted without structure to verify the solitary waves generated by the model the wave elevation at the position of a submerged breakwater i e wg3 was illustrated and compared with theoretical solution of green naghdi g n equations by ertekin et al 1986 as follow 12 ζ x c t a sech 2 3 a 4 h 2 h a x c t fig 2 shows the comparison of time history of the free surface elevation between the present computations and theoretical solutions with solitary wave heights of a h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 35 and 0 5 these wave heights will be used for the following simulations a great agreement between present computations and g n predictions was observed for five different wave heights the maximum error of crest value is 3 21 and the average value for five cases is 2 62 3 results and discussion to demonstrate the capacity of the cip based model in solving strongly nonlinear interaction of solitary wave with structure numerical simulations of a solitary wave propagating over the submerged breakwater were conducted the numerical results including free surface motions wave forces and flow field distribution were presented and compared with published experimental data and computational results the propagation and deformation of solitary waves passing over the structure are of another interest therefore the wave reflection and transmission coefficients induced by a submerged breakwater with different sizes were computed and discussed to provide some effective implications for the design of submerged obstacle type breakwater 3 1 free surface motions the free surface of solitary wave propagating over submerged structure generally experiences a violent evolution due to induced hydrodynamic phenomena the evolution process of violent free surface flow is hard to capture for many numerical models because of its strong nonlinearity to demonstrate the performance of the developed model the free surface evolution of a solitary wave passing the structure was compared with the corresponding experiment fig 3 shows the comparison of free surface displacements between the numerical results and measured data by wu et al 2012 at five time instants a crest crest exchange process which was initially described by cooker et al 1990 for a solitary wave passing the submerged structure was recorded with a high accuracy and resolution by present cip based model more specifically numerical results show that the free surface motions roughly experienced six stages during the interaction between the solitary wave and the submerged obstacle there are the stages of 1 intact wave form 2 bulge generation 3 double wave crests 4 steep free surface 5 backward wave breaking and 6 air water mixing firstly the solitary wave propagates along the horizontal direction with an intact shape when the wave crest has a long distance to the structure as the wave crest approaches the structure a bulge is formed along the lee side of free surface fig 3 a after the incoming wave crest passing the breakwater the bulge develops into a new wave crest which leads to existence of double wave crests as shown in fig 3 b then the incoming wave crest gradually disappears and the weather side of the new crest grows into a sharp wave surface fig 3 c after the critical point wave breaking occurs and overturning wave impacts on the free surface as shown in fig 3 d the strong backward wave breaking happens some air is entrapped into the water and splitting appears during this stage which leads to the air water mixing and small fluctuations of free surface fig 3 e during the simulations a good agreement between present results and experimental data was observed in entire process of wave structure interaction even for the breaking stages at t 0 88 s and 1 02 s the agreement was deemed satisfactory which shows a great performance of the model in solving violent free surface flow it is worth to mention that complicated behaviors of the free surface including wave overturning fig 3 d and air water mixing fig 3 e were well captured by the cip based model but were not fully recorded by piv technique due to its limitation of treatment in aerated region wu et al 2012 the comparison of the free surface elevation at three wave gauges wg2 wg3 and wg4 between present computations and experimental data was illustrated in fig 4 the wg2 wave gauge was set at the upstream of the structure the reflected wave due to the structure was recorded by wave gauge wg2 which can be obviously seen in fig 4 a within 0 6 s t 1 5 s another two wave gauges were placed on the middle wg3 and downstream wg4 of the structure respectively the time history of the free surface elevation at the location of wg4 shows a stronger nonlinear feature due to the occurrence of wave breaking and splitting near the location of x 8 2 m after the crest passed the breakwater the calculations by wu et al 2012 were also plotted in fig 4 for comparison which was conducted by cornell breaking and structure cobras model in general the present computations have a satisfactory agreement with other results in all three locations especially for the main wave form the free surface elevation by the piv system is only available at wg3 x 8 m because its view focused on the flow field around the structure it also can be observed that the free surface elevation estimated by piv images agrees fairly well with present computation at the wave gauge of wg3 however both numerical models slightly overestimate the wave crests at three locations and discrepancies exist between the computations and measurements at the tailing wave stage it should be noted that the tailing waves predicted by present numerical model are much closer to the measurements than the results from the cobras model especially for gauge located at x 8 347 m where the wave breaking occurs after the wave crest propagates over the submerged structure 3 2 wave forces and pressure distribution for further verifying the numerical model wave forces impacting on the breakwater were computed and compared with computations by wu et al 2012 for a vertical rigid breakwater the horizontal wave forces are of main interest and presented solely in this section the comparison of the horizontal wave force on the vertical obstacle between present model and cobras model wu et al 2012 was plotted in fig 5 the numerical results show that the time history of the horizontal force has a short duration impact force with a positive direction followed by a train of nonlinear oscillation fig 6 shows the comparison of time history of the horizontal forces impacting on the single side of the structure as shown in figs 5 and 6 the computations conducted by the cip based model agree fairly well with the results obtained by the cobras model especially for the maximum value of the wave forces acting on the breakwater although a discrepancy between two computations can be seen in the tailing stage of the time series both numerical models estimated a nonlinear trend for the time history of wave forces after the wave breaking occurs as can be seen in fig 6 the horizontal wave force acting on the weather side is much larger than that impacting on the lee side during the wave structure interaction the time history of the wave force acting on the weather side shows a smooth trend while the nonlinear oscillation can be observed for the wave force acting on the lee side in the tailing stage because lee side is closer to the location of wave breaking the maximum total horizontal force acting on the structure occurs at the time instant of t 1 0 40 s which follows the appearing time instant of the maximum total vertical force t 2 0 36 s the maximum horizontal forces impacting on the single sides occur later than the appearing time instant of maximum total wave forces which are t 3 0 44 s for the weather side and t 4 0 58 s for lee side respectively the corresponding pressure fields at four critical time instants t 0 40 0 36 0 44 and 0 58 s are presented in fig 7 it can be seen that the total horizontal and vertical forces acting on the breakwater achieve the maximum value as the wave crest approaches the weather side of the breakwater the maximum horizontal force acting on the weather side of the structure also appears before the wave crest propagating over the structure while the horizontal force impacting on the lee side of the breakwater reaches to the maximum value during the stage of double crests existing a spiral zone with relatively low pressure is formed due to generation of vortex near the top side of the structure which conforms to the fact that the flow field with high velocities has the low pressure distribution more detailed discussion of velocity fields and vortex evolution will be carried out in the following section fig 8 shows the time history of the horizontal forces acting on the structure under wave heights of a h 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 35 and 0 5 the time history of the horizontal forces has nonlinear fluctuation after appearance of its maximum values in the cases of large wave heights a h 0 35 and 0 5 this behavior is mainly due to the complicated hydrodynamic phenomena including the wave breaking and air water mixing which become more violent for the cases with larger wave height fig 9 shows the comparison of the maximum horizontal forces between the present computations and the results by cobras model it can be seen that present computations correspond fairly well with the results calculated by cobras model for the maximum horizontal forces under different wave heights although a slight difference was observed between two numerical models with large wave heights a h 0 35 and 0 5 both the computations show a nearly linear increasing of the maximum horizontal forces as the wave height increases the finding of the nearly linear relationship between the maximum horizontal force and the wave height was also reported by liu and al banaa 2004 and detailed explanation and formulae were expressed in terms of incient wave height and the draught in general the cip based model shows a good performance in prediction of solitary waves interacting with a submerged structure 3 3 velocity and vorticity fields velocity fields of interaction between a solitary wave and the submerged barrier were calculated by wu et al 2012 with the cobras model in which the air was treated as numerical voids rather than real air such kind of single flow model was employed to study the wave structure interaction by many scholars such as grilli et al 1994 shao 2005 he and kashiwagi 2012 and so on it is known that the numerical model without consideration of real air is hard to record complicated hydrodynamic behaviors fully as well as reproduce real violent flow with a high reliability the multi phase flow was considered in the cip based model to simulate characteristics of the real flow field fig 10 shows the comparison of velocity fields between present numerical results and experimental data wu et al 2012 at five time instants it should be noted that the different origins were defined in simulation and experiment in fig 10 as well as fig 12 the origin of the present model was defined at the intersection of the still water level and the left boundary of wave flume while that of experiment was set at the bottom left corner of structure but the effectiveness of comparison can be guaranteed by the same range of selected zone and consistent reference standard of variables in both the present simulation and compared experiment distributions of both air velocity and water velocity were calculated by present model and the complicated velocity fields of air water mixing can be observed at t 0 88 s and 1 02 s in fig 10 d and e the more specific snapshot of velocity field during the air water mixing stage at t 1 02 s was shown in fig 11 where the vortices were captured by the cip based model in air zone free surface and water zone respectively overall a satisfactory agreement can be seen between the simulations and measurements for all five time instants shown in fig 10 including the velocity fields and free surface variation meanwhile the discrepancies between present results and experimental data can be seen from the vortex under the free surface when the wave breaking occurs the main deviation of velocity fields appears at the stages of overturning and air bubbles t 0 88 s and 1 02 s the discrepancy is partly because the numerical mesh around the structure is 1 mm 0 5 mm which has the difference with the resolution of piv measurements 1 5852 mm moreover the piv method cannot obtain the accurate and full velocity distribution in the highly aerated zone of flow field due to the poor scattering performance of laser light the piv inter correlation algorithm was mainly based on the micro foam structures and bubble displacements kimmoun and branger 2007 wu et al 2012 which leads to that the hydrodynamic behaviors of overturning jet and air water mixing cannot be recorded by the experiment however these phenomena were captured entirely by the cip based model other possible reason for the discrepancies is that strongly nonlinear interaction between the waves and structure involves some random behaviors and uncertainty chan and melville 1988 especially around wave breaking zone and highly bubbly flow vorticity fields were calculated by present model to show vortex generation and evolution which is one of great interests for the wave structure interaction the operation of v x u y which is consistent with the setup of experiment was employed to compute vorticity fields using the central differencing scheme fig 12 presents the comparison of vorticity fields between the numerical results and experimental data at seven evolutionary stages in these vorticity fields the negative values denote the clockwise vortices and the positive vorticity distributions indicate the anticlockwise vortices numerical results show that two clockwise vortices and an anticlockwise vortex with relatively small size are generated around the top and lee sides of the structure as the wave crest approaching the breakwater t 1 0 32 s then these vortices develop into a main clockwise vortex moving along the direction of wave propagation as show in fig 12 b with time instant of t 0 46 s when the wave crest passed over the structure the steep free surface appears a large anticlockwise vortex t 0 60 s due to the air velocity which was captured by the numerical model but not recorded by the physical experiment as propagation of the wave crest the anticlockwise vortex along the free surface grows in size and gradually moves to the air zone as well as the main clockwise vortex in fluid continues to move forward t 0 74 s after that the backward breaking wave impacts on the free surface then some air is entrapped into water which induced an anticlockwise vortex under the free surface and complicated vorticity distribution can be observed at the time instant of t 0 88 s subsequently the anticlockwise vortex and the main clockwise one begin to interact with each other because their motion directions are opposite the vorticity field of air water mixing zone becomes more chaotic as observed in stage of t 1 02 s finally the effect of diffusion and the interaction of different vortices gradually attenuate these vortices in size and strength as seen in time instant of t 1 30 s the similar behaviors of vortices generation and evolution under the free surface were obtained by wu et al 2012 expect for the vorticity distribution for air phase in general current numerical results fit well with the measurements wu et al 2012 for the vortices of water however some discrepancies between the computations and measured data can be observed in the stages of wave breaking and air water mixing t 1 02 s and 1 30 s especially for the strength of vorticity the resolution of simulation and experiment measurement plays an important role in calculating the vorticity fields according to wu et al 2012 the difference of resolution between the present model and measured facilities may be one of main reasons for these discrepancies other possible explanations for the deviation of vorticity are similar to the discussion of velocity fields such as the random behaviors of wave breaking 3 4 effect of structure size above validations show that the cip based model has a high reliability to simulate the interaction between a solitary wave and the submerged structure moreover a further study on the impacting process of a solitary wave with the submerged breakwater for different geometrical sizes was conducted in this section our great interest is the wave reflection and transmission coefficients for the application of submerged type breakwater in ocean engineering notice that the time instant that the crest of the solitary wave arrives at the wg1 gauge was defined as t 0 s in the following discussion the breakwaters with different widths and heights were investigated by the present study in order to obtain the general rule the width and height of structure were selected uniformly with an interval of 0 02 m the maximum width 0 06 m of obstacle was chose smaller than its minimum height 0 08 m to ensure the shape characteristic of thin obstacle the schematic view for the setup of structure sizes is presented in fig 13 where totally five types of structure were considered with three widths and three heights respectively the wave conditions correspond with the previous computations namely water depth of h 0 14 m and a solitary wave with its height of a h 0 5 were employed fig 14 shows the free surface profiles in three stages of interest for the interaction of a solitary wave with the x model 2 x model 3 y model 1 and y model 3 respectively from fig 14 it can be seen that the width of structure has a relatively minor effect on the backward wave breaking process almost the same volume of air is entrapped into the water for the breakwater with different widths while the location that backward breaking wave impacts on the free surface is closer to the structure as the width becomes larger as shown in fig 14 a and 14 b however the height of breakwater plays an important role in the backward wave breaking process when the height of structure is small only little air is entrapped into the water and the range of motion for the underwater air is limited fig 14 c for the breakwater with large height a steep free surface is formed when the wave crest approaches the weather side which leads to occurrence of the first time wave breaking as the wave crest passed over the structure the breaking wave impacts on the free surface the second time and much air is entrapped into the water with a relatively extensive range of motion which can be seen in fig 14 d the free surface elevation at wg1 x 6 m and wg5 x 10 m were calculated to determine the wave reflection and transmission coefficients the time history of the free surface elevation at wg1 and wg5 for five types of structures are presented in fig 15 where the first and second stages of data at x 6 m indicates the incident wave and reflected wave respectively the computed results at x 10 m denote the transmitted wave as can be seen in fig 15 the time history of the free surface elevation for the reflected and transmitted waves conforms to the feature of solitary wave therefore we can simply assume the reflection and transmission coefficients as the ratio of the reflected and transmitted wave height versus the height of incident wave the variation of reflection and transmission coefficients with different widths and heights of the breakwater is presented in fig 16 as shown in fig 16 the width of breakwater has little effect on the wave reflection and transmission a slight increase and decrease for the reflection and transmission coefficients can be observed with increasing of the breakwater width on the other hand the transmission coefficients show an obvious decrease with the increasing heights of structure while the reflection coefficients become larger as the heights of the breakwater increased losada et al 1992 reported an acceptable performance of wave dissipation by vertical thin barrier in regard to linear waves however the lowest transmission coefficient in the present five simulations is 0 81 which was obtained by the structure with the width of 0 02 m and the height of 0 12 m it is mainly because the motion trail of water particles near free surface is the arc line for solitary wave which means the water particles have an upward and forward displacement as the solitary wave crest approaching the structure therefore the submerged structure cannot break the solitary wave to a large extent and the main body of solitary wave can propagate over the structure without diffusion for the sea areas where tsunami type wave will appear we rationally argue that the submerged obstacle type breakwater should not be selected as the first choice due to its non ideal performance of wave dissipation for the solitary waves the effect of structure sizes on the wave forces is another interest since time history of the wave forces for cases with different structure sizes almost has very similar features the occurring time instants for the maximum wave forces in the cases with different widths and heights are listed in tables 2 and 3 the corresponding pressure fields for four types of structure at occurrence of the maximum horizontal wave forces are plotted in fig 17 the maximum horizontal force occurs as wave crest approached the structure in all cases as can be seen in fig 17 on the other hand the structure sizes have an obvious effect on the spiral low pressure zone generated near the top side of the structure the submerged breakwater with the narrow width and high height generates a distinct low pressure zone which due to generation of vortex around the top of such kind of structure it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the horizontal width of structure affects occurrence of the maximum wave forces to some extent while the vertical height of the structure has almost no effect on it the earlier maximum horizontal forces and later maximum vertical forces can be obtained with the increasing widths of structure it can be explained by that the wave crest needs less time to approach the weather side of structure as the width is large but it needs much time to run over the whole top of structure 4 conclusions the interaction of a solitary wave with the submerged breakwater was numerically investigated by a developed cip based numerical model which is capable of treating viscosity effect and strong nonlinearity the comprehensive validations and verifications were performed to assess the capability of the proposed model in simulating the impacting of solitary wave on the submerged structure the numerical results show satisfactory agreement with the experimental measurements in free surface profiles wave forces and velocity fields the violent free surface motion and its evolution during a solitary wave propagated over a submerged structure were captured well by present numerical model the hydrodynamic forces acting on the breakwater show an impulse type feature with a maximum value in the horizontal direction the current computations for the maximum horizontal wave forces agree fairly well with other results the vortices are generated firstly near the top and lee sides of structure as the wave crest approached the breakwater the main clockwise vortex moves along the direction of wave propagation until the occurrence of backward wave breaking which leads to the generation of anticlockwise vortex in the zone of entrapped air the satisfactory agreement for the vorticity fields was obtained between the current simulation and experiment the complicated vortex evolution and vorticity distribution for air phase near the free surface were also simulated by present study due to the consideration of real air in the cip based multi phase flow model effects of the structure size on the wave transmission coefficient were investigated it can be found that the width has little influence on the propagation characteristics of solitary waves passing over the submerged structure while the higher height of breakwater can reduce the wave height of transmitted wave effectively it may be a valuable implication for design of submerged breakwater in ocean engineering overall we can conclude that the cip based model is capable of simulating the extremely nonlinear hydrodynamic phenomena and providing the reliably accurate estimation of flow field for the solitary wave interacting with submerged breakwater declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work is gratefully supported by national natural science foundation of china 51579058 and shandong provincial natural science

23391,the torsional vibratory response of large container carriers has been suspected to be the main source of fatigue damage to the hatch corner structure and has attracted considerable attention from ship designers in line with this this paper presents the results of the full scale measurement data analysis of a 13000teu container carrier voyaged between europe and china with particular focus on its torsional vibratory response first the torsional mode shapes were extracted using the acceleration data measured at five different locations along the ship length and the natural frequencies were estimated by taking a fourier transform of the modal magnitude time histories the modal damping ratios were estimated based on the extracted time histories of the torsional modal magnitude and the correlation between the natural frequencies and damping ratios was examined modern signal processing techniques such as the proper orthogonal decomposition and random decrement technique were used for data analysis finally a different level of contribution of the mode shapes to the total fatigue damage was investigated after decomposing the strain signal into different modal components the torsional response of the vessel was not significant during its measurement campaign period keywords hydroelasticity container carrier torsion damping ratio random decrement technique proper orthogonal decomposition fatigue 1 introduction hydroelasticity such as springing and whipping is considered the main cause of fatigue damage to large container carriers the relative high forward speed of a container carrier along with its low stiffness due to the large deck opening increases the likelihood of resonance between the hull girder vibration and the excitation from incoming waves moreover the large flare angles and flat stern of a container carrier also plays an important role in exciting the whipping vibration induced by the slamming impact load either on the flare or stern container carriers distinguish themselves from other type of ships in that it has large deck openings leading to a very low natural frequency of the torsional vibration modes the hatch corners of container carriers are typically prone to fatigue damage because of their structural characteristics particularly under a torsional load hence they should be designed carefully to avoid premature fatigue cracking due to the torsional vibration induced by springing and whipping from a numerical analysis point of view the hydroelastic response of container carriers has attracted more attention than other types of vessel because of its complicated structural behavior large deck openings makes the shear center of the cross section to stay far below the keel line hence horizontal bending always takes place together with torsion in a coupled way in addition the openings on deck allow the cross section to behave as a thin walled beam so that torsional distortion always entails warping deformation leading to warping induced axial stresses these have been handled successfully by numerical tools relying on some sophisticated beam theories or a 3d whole ship model senjanovic et al 2008 kim 2009 malenica and derbanne 2014 kim and kim 2014 a full scale measurement campaign has also been attempted to achieve a better understanding of the hydroelastic response of modern merchant ships low speed blunt ships such as bulk and ore carriers were studied and the influence of the springing effect on the fatigue damages were investigated storhaug et al 2003 2007 the majority of full scale measurement campaigns focused on the hydroelastic responses of container carriers storhaug and moe 2007 heggelund et al 2011 drummen et al 2006 andersen and jensen 2014 analyzed the full scale measurement data of a 9400teu container carrier and found that the wave induced vertical hogging bending moment exceeded the design value and the whipping induced response was almost comparable to that of the wave induced one in terms of its magnitude storhaug and moe 2007 analyzed a 294 m long container carrier during its operation in the north atlantic seaways and found that the global hull girder vibration induced by springing whipping was significant and should be taken into consideration in the design stage okada et al 2006 analyzed the full scale measurement data of a post panamax sized container carrier particularly focused on the deflection of cross decks they found that the fore aft deflection of a cross deck strip was generally much smaller than the design assumptions due to less severe actual stack load on the other hand modern signal processing technologies have evolved significantly over the past few decades and the combination of these techniques with full scale measurement data enables researchers to derive some important information from the measurement data so called operational modal analysis through which the unknown modal parameters can be estimated using the output data only has proven its versatility and is used popularly in many engineering fields among others proper orthogonal decomposition pod and random decrement technique rdt are popularly used signal processing techniques for the identification of modal parameters lumley 1970 first applied the method to analyze the spatial distribution characteristics of turbulence in a fluid field and later extended it to extracting the mode shapes of a vibrating structure feeny and kappagantu 1998 feeny 2002 rdt is another interesting technique that can be used to extract some modal parameters cole 1968 1971 originally developed the technique in the form of an auto random decrement to identify the dynamic characteristics and in service damage detection of the space structure from the measured response only later ibrahim and mikulcik 1977 introduced the concept of a cross random decrement that enabled the identification of the mode shapes of a multi dof system kim and park 2013 applied a rdt together with the wavelet transform to identify the modal parameters of a hydroelastically responding ship structure they reported that the derived natural frequencies did not show any significant discrepancy compared to those obtained by the still water wet hammering test results but the damping ratios under wet towing conditions were up to 20 higher than those obtained by the wet hammering test mariani and dessi 2012 estimated the mode shapes of a vibrating hull structure on a small scale model they applied the pod method to extract the mode shapes of a segmented hull model connected to a backbone structure running from bow to stern the first second and third vertical mode shapes were estimated by processing both the measured vbm and acceleration using the pod and determined that both matched each other well kim et al 2015 applied the pod method and cross rdt to extract the mode shapes of a segmented ship model of a 400 k ore carrier the vertical bending modes of 2 and 3 node vibration were clearly captured and the correspondence between the two results was very good this paper presents the full scale measurement data analysis results of a 13000teu container carrier voyaged between europe and china focusing particularly on its torsional vibratory response first the torsional mode shapes were extracted by the pod method using acceleration data measured at five different locations along the ship length based on the extracted time histories of the torsional modal magnitude the modal damping ratios were estimated by applying a rdt the correlations between the natural frequencies and damping ratios were also checked to determine the potential influence of the loading conditions on the damping ratio finally a different level of contribution of mode shapes to the total fatigue damage was investigated after decomposing the strain signal into different modal components 2 methodologies 2 1 band pass filter a band pass filter is a technique that filters out the signals of other frequency bands while leaving only the signals of a specific frequency band and had been applied widely to the filtering of signals fig 1 presents a diagram showing the shape and parameters of the band pass filter expressed in the frequency domain if there is an overlap of energy concentration between the neighboring vibration modes it is general to design the filter in such a way that a sloping region at both ends of the filter bank is arranged to properly decompose the energy within the overlapping frequency region the band pass filter is expressed in the frequency domain as eq 1 1 h w 0 to 1 ω c δ ω t δ ω s ω ω c δ ω t 1 ω c δ ω t ω ω c δ ω t 1 to 0 ω c δ ω t ω ω c δ ω t δ ω s to filter a given signal f t with the band pass filter of eq 1 the given signal f t is subjected to a fourier transform and windowed by the designed filter h ω as shown in eq 2 the filtered time series is obtained by the inverse fourier transform 2 f t f ω h ω e iωt dω where f ω is the fourier transform of given signal f t 2 2 proper orthogonal decomposition the pod starts with the spatial coherence matrix of a certain physical quantity such as rotational and vertical accelerations at different locations along the ship length in this particular case the ensemble matrix of the measured sectional loads at m different locations along the ship is defined in eq 3 3 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m where the column vector x i stands for the sectional load time history of n discrete time intervals the spatial coherence matrix post multiplied by the modal vector of the system v j gives 4 r v j 1 n x t x v j 1 n e 1 v 1 t e 2 v 2 t e m v m t t e 1 v 1 t e 2 v 2 t e m v m t v j where the matrix r is defined as a spatial coherence matrix i e 1 n x t x each entry of the coherence matrix r i j is the inner product of the two measured vbm time histories at locations i and j which indicates the correlation of the vbm of two locations taking advantage of the orthonormality of the eigenvectors eq 4 finally becomes 5 r v j e j t e j n v j λ v j eq 5 shows that the eigenvectors of the coherence matrix r which is called the proper orthogonal mode pom becomes the modal vector of the given system that the measurement was made on 2 3 random decrement technique the rdt is a simple but very powerful method for identifying a dynamic system and is used widely for modal parameter identification where prior information on excitation is unknown assuming that the signals x t and y t represent the vbm at two different locations along the ship length the auto and cross random decrement signature is defined as the expected value of a given signal x t under certain conditions which are denoted as t x t 6 d x x τ e x t τ t x t d x y τ e y t τ t x t d x x τ is the auto random decrement signature and d x y τ is the cross random decrement signature and they both become the free decay signal at two different locations x and y the idea behind eq 6 is to cancel out the particular solution of the dynamic response of a given system by taking the conditional average across a large number of ensembles leaving the homogeneous solution to be averaged while taking the average across the ensembles a certain condition is imposed so that the cancellation can be achieved using a finite number of ensembles assuming that the process is ergodic which means the stationarity of the process eq 6 can be rewritten as eq 7 therefore the conditional averaging across the ensembles can be made within a single sample realization 7 d x x τ 1 n i 1 n x t i τ t x t i d x y τ 1 n i 1 n y t i τ t x t i where n is the number of points in the random process that satisfy the condition t x t the condition t x t under which the mean values of x t and y t are taken is called the triggering condition and there are several different types such as level crossing triggering local extremum triggering positive point triggering and zero crossing triggering in this study the level crossing triggering condition was applied to extract the free decay signal from the measured one and can be rewritten in a general form as eq 8 8 t x t t a x t a δ a 0 x t where δ a is the triggering range which was set to be infinitesimally small 3 target ship and measurement system 3 1 main particulars the dynamic characteristics of the ship responding to the incoming wave were examined by analyzing the full scale measurement data of the magellan a container ship owned by cma cgm table 1 lists the main specifications of the magellan 3 2 acceleration measurement a total of twelve accelerometers were arranged on the magellan and the translational acceleration in the x y and z directions at each location were measured the measurement unit of the acceleration data was v and was stored in the data file in acceleration m s 2 after being multiplied by the corresponding sensitivity values m s 2 mv fig 2 shows the position of the accelerometer accelerometers were installed at the deck passage ways of both port and starboard fr 11 56 91 132 150 funnel fr 30 and wheelhouse fr 109 the local x axis of the accelerometer coincides with the x axis of the ship s fixed coordinate system which points from stern to bow table 2 summarizes the relative orientation of the accelerometer and locations 3 3 strain measurement a total of 18 long base strain gauges lbsg were attached to the magellan and the strain at each location was measured with a sampling frequency of 25 hz the measurement unit of the strain data was v and the data were stored in a data file in strain m m after being multiplied by the sensitivity value of 3 9176 m m v fig 3 shows the location of the lbsg four lbsgs were installed at the four corners of fr 56 76 84 and 117 respectively at fr 137 which is the fore part of the ship two lbsgs were installed at both sides of the deck table 3 lists the locations of lbsgs 4 time slot selection data analysis was conducted by selecting some time slots out of the entire measurement data during which the hydroelastic response of the hull was considered to be significant the acceleration time series measured at fr 91 near m s were used as references to select the time slots during which the torsional response of the ship were considerably large the logic behind the use of acceleration is described below to analyze the torsional vibration mode the rotational accelerations need to be extracted per frame the rotational angle may be defined as the tangent of the two vertical acceleration component and can be simplified further as the difference between the two vertical accelerations normalized by the half breadth of the ship as defined in eq 9 9 a θ tan a v p o r t a v s t a r b 2 2 a v p o r t a v s t a r b to select the time slots during which the vibration is considered to be significant the standard deviation of the vertical and torsional components of the acceleration signal were used as the reference value hence a θ of eq 9 were calculated using the accelerations at the deck of frame 91 which is a6 and a7 according to table 2 the acceleration time history was filtered before the analysis in such a way that only the vibration component between the frequency range of 0 4 3 hz was maintained the fft filter was used to filter the signal fig 4 shows the time evolution of the standard deviation of the torsional components of the acceleration signals the horizontal axis is the identification number of time slots that last for 1 h each the vertical axis is the standard deviation of the difference acceleration signal measured at m s of the ship the time slots whose standard deviations exceed 55 of the maximum case were selected as indicated by the red star marks in fig 4 the number of selected time slots was 105 5 estimation of the mode shapes and natural frequencies in this section the mode shapes of torsional modes are identified using pod as described previously the rotational accelerations measured at 5 different locations along the ship length were used to build up the ensemble matrix as eq 3 and then the spatial coherence matrix r was calculated as shown in eq 5 the eigenvector of this spatial coherence matrix was assumed to be the torsional modes of the ship the analyzed time slot starts at 23 51 of 2012 01 26 fig 5 shows the torsional acceleration mode shapes that were derived from the rotational acceleration time histories at five different sections along the ship length both horizontal and vertical axis are normalized quantities the rigid body mode shown in fig 5 a is the roll motion which should maintain an identical rotational acceleration throughout the entire ship length as is achieved fig 5 b clearly shows that the pure twist mode was captured with great accuracy followed by so called coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode as shown in fig 5 c in addition the other higher torsional modes were also captured successfully the interesting aspect of the torsional mode is the fact that the natural frequency of the twist mode is usually close to that of the 2 node torsional vibration mode which is the coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode therefore it is rather difficult to decompose these closely spaced vibration modes using a simple band pass filter method although this is the case it is expected that the pod can identify the natural frequencies of each mode successfully provided that the mode shapes are decomposed correctly fig 6 shows the fft results of the individual vibration mode given in fig 5 fig 6 b and c clearly shows that the pod successfully decomposes the two closely spaced torsion vibration modes i e twist and coupled horizontal bending and torsion modes the natural frequency of the twist mode was 0 49 hz and that of the coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode was 0 62 hz interestingly the frequency band of dominant coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode overlaps with that of roll motion which indicates the strong coupling in between these modes of motion deformation the frequency components of modes higher than the 2 node torsional mode were relatively widely spread over the entire frequency range a total of 105 time slots have been processed and the modal parameters derived such as the natural frequencies and damping ratios were analyzed statistically to check the variability of the quantities fig 7 shows the box and whisker plot of both the twist and torsional 2 node modes the top and bottom of each box indicate the mean of the upper and lower 50 of the data respectively the upper and lower whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum value out of the entire data set the scatter of the mode shapes is not significant which demonstrates the appropriateness of the analysis fig 8 shows the time evolution of the natural frequencies of both the twist and torsional 2 node modes the time slots of the horizontal axis are not continuous fig 8 a shows that the natural frequency of the twist mode varies between 0 43 and 0 55 hz depending on the time slot unlike the case of vertical bending the pattern of natural frequency fluctuations was unclear for both the twist and 2 node torsion modes for the 2 node torsion mode the natural frequency varies between approximately 0 53 to 0 66 hz 6 estimation of damping ratio the damping ratio is one of the most interesting dynamic modal parameters because it influences the absolute magnitude of vibration directly particularly near the resonance frequencies of the dominant vibration modes the rdt was employed to extract the damping ratio of the torsional mode the original modal magnitude of the twist mode was band pass filtered for the succeeding process using the rdt the other frequency contents were all removed but that of the twist vibration component for the succeeding process using the rdt the trapezoidal filter shown in fig 1 was used where the filter parameters were set to ω c 0 4924 δ ω t 0 15 and δ ω s 0 05 fig 9 a shows the filtered time series of the modal magnitude along with the triggering points used to select the ensembles for the conditional average the level used to select the ensembles was set to the standard deviation of the signal itself similarly the length of the ensemble was set to be n times of the natural period of the corresponding vibration mode in this particular case n was set to 5 so that 5 vibration cycles were included in the free decay signal fig 9 b shows the evolution of the ensemble averages as the number of sample increases the black solid lines are the interim free decay signal in the middle of ensemble average and the red solid line is the converged one which is considered to be the free decay signal of this particular vibration mode fig 9 c shows the local peaks along with its linear regression result and the damping ratio was derived by equating the slope of the straight line to ς ω n the identified damping ratio of the torsional twist mode in this particular time slot was 11 85 for the torsional 2 node mode the filter parameters were set to ω c 0 6154 δ ω t 0 2 and δ ω s 0 05 fig 10 a shows the filtered time series of the modal magnitude along with the triggering points which were used to select the ensembles for the conditional average fig 10 b shows the evolution of the ensemble averages as the number of samples increases fig 10 c shows the local peaks along with its linear regression result the identified damping ratio of the torsional 2 node mode in this particular time slot was 7 89 fig 11 shows the time evolution of the damping ratio of both the twist and torsional 2 node modes fig 11 a and b confirms that the damping ratio of the twist and torsional 2 node modes varies between 8 and 20 and 4 10 respectively unfortunately the correlation between the natural frequencies and corresponding damping ratio was not clearly visible for this torsional vibration case 7 fatigue damages 7 1 short term fatigue damages fig 12 shows the stress time histories at the deck of the mid ship one with the vibration component and the other one without vibration component the stress was calculated by simply multiplying the young s modulus by the measured strain the stress time histories without vibration were obtained by applying a low pass filter to the original signal with a cut off frequency of 0 35 hz the peak stresses tend to level out by some amount when the vibration component was removed from the original signal owing to the wide band nature of the response spectrum the direct rainflow counting method was used for cycle counting which is considered the standard cycle counting method once the probability distribution of the stress range is obtained using the direct cycle counting method it will be combined with the sn curve the fatigue damage is estimated under the assumption of linear accumulation theory which was realized by palmgrem miner s rule a certain virtual local geometry in which the structural discontinuity was assumed with its stress concentration factor of 2 0 was used to calculate the fatigue damage assuming that the scf transfers the measured stress at the deck into the local hot spot stress a unified sn curve based on the hot spot stress was used the sn curve was defined as shown in eq 10 10 l o g n l o g a m l o g δ σ n predicted number of cycles to failure for stress range δ σ δ σ stress range m negative inverse slope of s n curve log a intercept of logn axis by s n curve the hot spot stress based sn curve specified in dnv cn30 7 was used for the fatigue damage evaluation and table 4 lists the parameters of the sn curve the palmgren miner rule allows one to calculate accumulated fatigue damage caused by randomly fluctuating stress cycles the basic assumption behind it is that the total accumulated fatigue damage induced by irregular stress cycles can be obtained by a linear superposition of the fatigue damage caused by the constant amplitude stress cycles 11 d i 1 k n i n i where n i means the number of stress cycles estimated by the rainflow counting method and n i is the number of cycles that lead to fatigue failure under corresponding constant amplitude stress cycle k is the number of stress block of constant amplitude when the superimposed fatigue damage d reaches unity the fatigue failure is considered to be present in the structure the short term fatigue damage for the selected sea states were calculated using the assumed scf of 2 0 according to the above mentioned procedure fig 13 shows the time evolution of the short term fatigue damage at both the port and starboard side of the deck for all calculated cases the short term fatigue damage was leveled out by a certain amount when the vibration frequency component was removed in the fatigue damage calculation the relative portion of the wave frequency response from a fatigue damage point of view depends on the absolute magnitude of fatigue damage when the focus is given to the case of the largest short term fatigue damage which is time slot 69 the fatigue damage increase was approximately 50 of that without a vibration the relative portion of fatigue damage together with the damage itself depends on the assumed scf due to the cubic power relationship between the stress range and fatigue life in addition the short term fatigue damage at the port and starboard side showed a similar trend and fatigue damage at mid ship table 5 and table 6 summarize the increase in the rate of fatigue damage induced by the vibration component at both the port and starboard sides of the mid ship deck the damage increase rates remain between 10 and 80 in general sometimes reaching beyond 100 note that increase rate larger than 100 generally occurs when the absolute level of short term fatigue damage is very low hence it is not very influential to the total fatigue damage for the time slots with the largest short term fatigue damage the damage increase rates were approximately 40 50 7 2 modal contribution on high frequency fatigue damages fig 14 shows the strain at four corners of midship section of the vessel depending on its global deformation modes ε v ε h and ε w denote the strain induced by vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion deformation modes respectively the axial strain under the torsion mode is those induced by warping deformation of the cross section the axial deformation mode was not considered because of its negligible influence on the axial strains at four corners the strain at three corners i e ε 1 ε 2 and ε 4 may be represented by a linear superposition of the strain induced by each deformation modes as expressed in eq 12 ε 3 was excluded intentionally from the calculation because of the poor quality of the logged raw strain signal note that the relationship given in eq 12 holds only for the vibration component of the strains at the corners the strain of the wave frequency may be influenced by other local effects so that the strain may not be represented by the superposition of the global deformation modes shown in fig 14 12 ε 1 ε 2 ε 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 α 1 β ε v ε h ε w the strain can be decomposed into the components that correspond to the relevant deformation modes using eq 12 the parameters α and β which are related to the geometrical asymmetry of the cross section were estimated by dry eigenvalue analysis of a whole ship fe model fig 15 shows the whole ship fe model which was built by a combination of 3 and 4 node quadrilateral shell elements and 2 node beam elements the total number of elements was 102 329 and that of the nodes was 32 460 the containers were modeled with point mass elements arranged along the ship length direction and connected to the hull using multiple point constraints representing the fully loaded cargo condition linear eigenvalue analysis was performed to derive α and β which are the sectional parameters related to the vertical bending and torsion respectively these sectional parameters can be determined by the geometry of the cross section but they were derived numerically based on the dry eigenvalue analysis fig 16 shows the results of eigenvalue analysis for the whole ship fe model each of which contains vertical bending and torsion deformation modes the lowest mode was twist mode with a natural frequency of 0 428 hz whose mode shape is shown in fig 16 a fig 16 b shows the third lowest vibration mode which is the 2 node vertical bending mode with a natural frequency of 0 749 hz fig 17 shows modal strain distribution particularly for locations 1 and 4 for the above two particular mode shapes the sectional parameters α and β were derived based upon the strain values at the corner of 1 and 4 for the two mode shapes shown in fig 17 a and fig 17 b that α was 0 4492 and β was 0 8867 respectively using the derived parameter the modal strains can be derived by eq 13 hence the strain values measured at corners 1 2 and 3 may be decomposed into its modal contribution using eq 12 13 ε v ε h ε w 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 4569 1 0 8867 1 ε 1 ε 2 ε 4 fig 18 shows the decomposition of the stress time history at the deck of the mid ship the stress is calculated by simply multiplying the young s modulus by the measured strain assuming that the stress state at the deck is 1 dimensional fig 18 a clearly shows that the contribution of strain induced by 2 node vertical bending is dominant compared to those of the other modes fig 18 b and c presents the case when horizontal bending and torsion are removed indicating that horizontal bending makes a slightly larger contribution than torsion in addition the contribution of each mode varies with time fig 19 shows the 1 h high frequency fatigue damage with respect to the different mode combinations at the mid ship of the vessel for some selected time slots whose high frequency fatigue damages are relatively large for comparison the high frequency fatigue damage was calculated using the vibration induced stress only excluding the wave induced stress the damage was calculated under an assumed scf of 2 0 together with the two slope sn curve defined in table 4 as expected from the time series comparison fig 19 shows that the contribution from vertical bending is also dominant from a high frequency fatigue damage point of view regarding the contribution from horizontal bending and torsion horizontal bending makes a slightly larger contribution than torsion because the gap between the damage without horizontal bending vb t and the total damage is larger than that without torsion vb hb and total damage the contribution of horizontal bending and torsion varies with respect to the time slot 8 conclusions based upon the study carried out in this study the following conclusions were made closely spaced torsional vibration modes were decomposed successfully by pod using the acceleration measured along the vessel the corresponding natural frequencies were extracted by taking a fourier transform of the derived time series of the torsional modal magnitude the natural frequency of the twist mode during the measurement period fluctuated between 0 44 and 0 53 hz whereas that of the torsional 2 node mode ranged from 0 53 to 0 66 hz the fluctuation of the natural frequencies was considered to be induced by the different loading conditions that depend on the time slot the damping ratio of the twist mode varied from 9 to 20 for twist mode the damping ratio tended to increase with decreasing natural frequency which supports the premise that a damping increase can be attributed to friction between the cargo and container cell guide during the cargo condition the increase in fatigue damage induced by vibration was investigated and it was found that the increase in the rate of damage remained between 10 and 80 generally sometimes reaching beyond 100 a rate of increase larger than 100 is generally from the case that the absolute level of short term fatigue damage is very low hence not very influential to the total fatigue damage for time slots with the largest short term fatigue damage the damage increase rates were approximately 40 50 modal contribution on the high frequency fatigue damage was also explored after decomposing the measured high frequency strain signal into its modal components the contribution of damage from vertical bending was dominant and those from horizontal bending torsion were minor the contribution from horizontal bending was slightly larger than that from torsion acknowledgement authors

23391,the torsional vibratory response of large container carriers has been suspected to be the main source of fatigue damage to the hatch corner structure and has attracted considerable attention from ship designers in line with this this paper presents the results of the full scale measurement data analysis of a 13000teu container carrier voyaged between europe and china with particular focus on its torsional vibratory response first the torsional mode shapes were extracted using the acceleration data measured at five different locations along the ship length and the natural frequencies were estimated by taking a fourier transform of the modal magnitude time histories the modal damping ratios were estimated based on the extracted time histories of the torsional modal magnitude and the correlation between the natural frequencies and damping ratios was examined modern signal processing techniques such as the proper orthogonal decomposition and random decrement technique were used for data analysis finally a different level of contribution of the mode shapes to the total fatigue damage was investigated after decomposing the strain signal into different modal components the torsional response of the vessel was not significant during its measurement campaign period keywords hydroelasticity container carrier torsion damping ratio random decrement technique proper orthogonal decomposition fatigue 1 introduction hydroelasticity such as springing and whipping is considered the main cause of fatigue damage to large container carriers the relative high forward speed of a container carrier along with its low stiffness due to the large deck opening increases the likelihood of resonance between the hull girder vibration and the excitation from incoming waves moreover the large flare angles and flat stern of a container carrier also plays an important role in exciting the whipping vibration induced by the slamming impact load either on the flare or stern container carriers distinguish themselves from other type of ships in that it has large deck openings leading to a very low natural frequency of the torsional vibration modes the hatch corners of container carriers are typically prone to fatigue damage because of their structural characteristics particularly under a torsional load hence they should be designed carefully to avoid premature fatigue cracking due to the torsional vibration induced by springing and whipping from a numerical analysis point of view the hydroelastic response of container carriers has attracted more attention than other types of vessel because of its complicated structural behavior large deck openings makes the shear center of the cross section to stay far below the keel line hence horizontal bending always takes place together with torsion in a coupled way in addition the openings on deck allow the cross section to behave as a thin walled beam so that torsional distortion always entails warping deformation leading to warping induced axial stresses these have been handled successfully by numerical tools relying on some sophisticated beam theories or a 3d whole ship model senjanovic et al 2008 kim 2009 malenica and derbanne 2014 kim and kim 2014 a full scale measurement campaign has also been attempted to achieve a better understanding of the hydroelastic response of modern merchant ships low speed blunt ships such as bulk and ore carriers were studied and the influence of the springing effect on the fatigue damages were investigated storhaug et al 2003 2007 the majority of full scale measurement campaigns focused on the hydroelastic responses of container carriers storhaug and moe 2007 heggelund et al 2011 drummen et al 2006 andersen and jensen 2014 analyzed the full scale measurement data of a 9400teu container carrier and found that the wave induced vertical hogging bending moment exceeded the design value and the whipping induced response was almost comparable to that of the wave induced one in terms of its magnitude storhaug and moe 2007 analyzed a 294 m long container carrier during its operation in the north atlantic seaways and found that the global hull girder vibration induced by springing whipping was significant and should be taken into consideration in the design stage okada et al 2006 analyzed the full scale measurement data of a post panamax sized container carrier particularly focused on the deflection of cross decks they found that the fore aft deflection of a cross deck strip was generally much smaller than the design assumptions due to less severe actual stack load on the other hand modern signal processing technologies have evolved significantly over the past few decades and the combination of these techniques with full scale measurement data enables researchers to derive some important information from the measurement data so called operational modal analysis through which the unknown modal parameters can be estimated

applied a rdt together with the wavelet transform to identify the modal parameters of a hydroelastically responding ship structure they reported that the derived natural frequencies did not show any

hammering test mariani and dessi 2012 estimated the mode shapes of a vibrating hull structure on a small scale model they applied the pod method to extract the mode shapes of a segmented hull model connected to a backbone structure running from bow to stern the first second and third vertical mode shapes were estimated by processing both the measured vbm and acceleration using the pod and determined that both matched each other well kim et al 2015 applied the pod method and cross rdt to extract the mode shapes of a segmented ship model of a 400 k ore carrier the vertical bending modes of 2 and 3 node vibration were clearly captured and the correspondence between the two results was very good this paper presents the full scale measurement data analysis results of a 13000teu

correlations between the natural frequencies and damping ratios were also checked to determine the potential influence of the loading conditions on the damping ratio finally a different level of contribution of mode shapes to the total fatigue damage was investigated after decomposing the strain signal into different modal components 2 methodologies 2 1 band pass filter a band pass filter is a technique that filters out the signals of other frequency bands while leaving only the signals of a specific frequency band and had been applied widely to the filtering of signals fig 1 presents a diagram showing the shape and parameters of the band pass filter expressed in the frequency domain if there is an overlap of energy concentration between the neighboring vibration modes it is general to design the filter in such a way that a sloping region at both ends of the filter bank is arranged to properly decompose the energy within the overlapping frequency region the band pass filter is expressed in the frequency domain as eq 1 1 h w 0 to 1 ω c δ ω t δ ω s ω ω c δ ω t 1 ω c δ ω t ω ω c δ ω t 1 to 0 ω c δ ω t ω ω c δ ω t δ ω s to filter a given signal f t with the band pass filter of

ω e iωt dω where f ω is the fourier transform of given signal f t 2 2 proper orthogonal decomposition the pod starts with the spatial coherence matrix of a certain physical quantity such as rotational and vertical accelerations at different locations along the ship length in this particular case the ensemble matrix of the measured sectional loads at m different locations along the ship is defined in eq 3 3 x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m where the column vector x i stands for the sectional load time history of n discrete time intervals the spatial coherence matrix post multiplied by the modal vector of the system v j gives 4 r v j 1 n x t x v j 1 n e 1 v 1 t e 2 v 2 t e m v m t t e 1 v 1 t e 2 v 2 t e m v m t v j where the matrix r is defined as a spatial coherence matrix i e 1 n x t x each entry of the coherence matrix r i j is the inner product of the two measured vbm time histories at locations i and j which indicates the correlation of the vbm of two locations taking advantage of the orthonormality of the eigenvectors eq 4 finally becomes 5 r v j e j t e j n v j λ v j eq 5 shows that the eigenvectors of the coherence matrix r which is called the proper orthogonal mode pom becomes the modal vector of the given system that the measurement was made on 2 3 random decrement technique the rdt is a simple but very powerful method for identifying a dynamic system and is used widely for modal parameter identification where prior information on excitation is unknown assuming that the signals x t and y t represent the vbm at two different locations along the ship length the auto and cross random decrement signature is defined as the expected value of a given signal x t under certain conditions which are denoted as t x t 6 d x x τ e x t τ t x t d x y τ e y t τ t x t d x x τ is the auto random decrement signature and d x y τ is the cross random decrement signature and they both become the free decay signal at two different locations x and y the idea behind eq 6 is to cancel out the particular solution of the dynamic response of a given system by taking the conditional average across a large number of ensembles leaving the homogeneous solution to be averaged while taking the average across the ensembles a certain condition is imposed so that the cancellation can be achieved using a finite number of ensembles assuming that the process is ergodic which means the stationarity of the process eq 6 can be rewritten as eq 7 therefore the conditional averaging across the ensembles can be made within a single sample realization 7 d x x τ 1 n i 1 n x t i τ t x t i d x y τ 1 n i 1 n y t i τ t x t i where n is the number of points in the random process that satisfy the condition t x t the condition t x t under which the mean values of x t and y t are taken is called the triggering condition and there are several different types such as level crossing triggering local extremum triggering positive point triggering and zero crossing triggering in this study the level crossing triggering condition was applied to extract the free decay signal from the measured one and can be rewritten in a general form as eq 8 8 t x t t a x t a δ a 0 x t where δ a is the triggering range which was set to be infinitesimally small 3 target ship and measurement system 3 1 main particulars the dynamic characteristics of the ship responding to the incoming wave were examined by analyzing the full scale measurement data of the magellan a container ship owned by cma cgm table 1 lists the main specifications of the magellan 3 2 acceleration measurement a total of twelve accelerometers were arranged on the magellan and the translational acceleration in the x y and z directions at each location were measured the measurement unit of the acceleration data was v and was stored in the data file in acceleration m s 2 after being multiplied by the corresponding sensitivity values m s 2 mv fig 2 shows the position of the accelerometer accelerometers were installed at the deck passage ways of both port and starboard fr 11 56 91 132 150 funnel fr 30 and wheelhouse fr 109 the local x axis of the accelerometer coincides with the x axis of the ship s fixed coordinate system which points from stern to bow table 2 summarizes the relative orientation of the accelerometer and locations 3 3 strain measurement a total of 18 long base strain gauges lbsg were attached to the magellan and the strain at each location was measured with a sampling frequency of 25 hz the measurement unit of the strain data was v and the data were stored in a data file in strain m m after being multiplied by the sensitivity value of 3 9176 m m v fig 3 shows the location of the lbsg four lbsgs were installed at the four corners of fr 56 76 84 and 117 respectively at fr 137 which is the fore part of the ship two lbsgs were installed at both sides of the deck table 3 lists the locations of lbsgs 4 time slot selection data analysis was conducted by selecting some time slots out of the entire measurement data during which the hydroelastic response of the hull was considered to be significant the acceleration time series measured at fr 91 near m s were used as references to select the time slots during which the torsional response of the ship were considerably large the logic behind the use of acceleration is described below to analyze the torsional vibration mode the rotational accelerations need to be extracted per frame the rotational angle may be defined as the tangent of the two vertical acceleration component and can be simplified further as the difference between the two vertical accelerations normalized by the half breadth of the ship as defined in eq 9 9 a θ tan a v p o r t a v s t a r b 2 2 a v p o r t a v s t a r b to select the time slots during which the vibration is considered to be significant the standard deviation of the vertical and torsional components of the acceleration signal were used as the reference value hence a θ of eq 9 were calculated using the accelerations at the deck of frame 91 which is a6 and a7 according to table 2 the acceleration time history was filtered before the analysis in such a way that only the vibration component between the frequency range of 0 4 3 hz was maintained the fft filter was used to filter the signal fig 4 shows the time evolution of the standard deviation of the torsional components of the acceleration signals the horizontal axis is the identification number of time slots that last for 1 h each the vertical axis is the standard deviation of the difference acceleration signal measured at m s of the ship the time slots whose standard deviations exceed 55 of the maximum case were selected as indicated by the red star marks in fig 4 the number of selected time slots was 105 5 estimation of the mode shapes and natural frequencies in this section the mode shapes of torsional modes are identified using pod as described previously the rotational accelerations measured at 5 different locations along the ship length were used to build up the ensemble matrix as eq 3 and then the spatial coherence matrix r was calculated as shown in eq 5 the eigenvector of this spatial coherence matrix was assumed to be the torsional modes of the ship the analyzed time slot starts at 23 51 of 2012 01 26 fig 5 shows the torsional acceleration mode shapes that were derived from the rotational acceleration time histories at five different sections along the ship length both horizontal and vertical axis are normalized quantities the rigid body mode shown in fig 5 a is the roll motion which should maintain an identical rotational acceleration throughout the entire ship length as is achieved fig 5 b clearly shows that the pure twist mode was captured with great accuracy followed by so called coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode as shown in fig 5 c in addition the other higher torsional modes were also captured successfully the interesting aspect of the torsional mode is the fact that the natural frequency of the twist mode is usually close to that of the 2 node torsional vibration mode which is the coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode therefore it is rather difficult to decompose these closely spaced vibration modes using a simple band pass filter method although this is the case it is expected that the pod can identify the natural frequencies of each mode successfully provided that the mode shapes are decomposed correctly fig 6 shows the fft results of the individual vibration mode given in fig 5 fig 6 b and c clearly shows that the pod successfully decomposes the two closely spaced torsion vibration modes i e twist and coupled horizontal bending and torsion modes the natural frequency of the twist mode was 0 49 hz and that of the coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode was 0 62 hz interestingly the frequency band of dominant coupled horizontal bending and torsion mode overlaps with that of roll motion which indicates the strong coupling in between these modes of motion deformation the frequency components of modes higher than the 2 node torsional mode were relatively widely spread over the entire frequency range a total of 105 time slots have been processed and the modal parameters derived such as the natural frequencies and damping ratios were analyzed statistically to check the variability of the quantities fig 7 shows the box and whisker plot of both the twist and torsional 2 node modes the top and bottom of each box indicate the mean of the upper and lower 50 of the data respectively the upper and lower whiskers indicate the maximum and minimum value out of the entire data set the scatter of the mode shapes is not significant which demonstrates the appropriateness of the analysis fig 8 shows the time evolution of the natural frequencies of both the twist and torsional 2 node modes the time slots of the horizontal axis are not continuous fig 8 a shows that the natural frequency of the twist mode varies between 0 43 and 0 55 hz depending on the time slot unlike the case of vertical bending the pattern of natural frequency fluctuations was unclear for both the twist and 2 node torsion modes for the 2 node torsion mode the natural frequency varies between approximately 0 53 to 0 66 hz 6 estimation of damping ratio the damping ratio is one of the most interesting dynamic modal parameters because it influences the absolute magnitude of vibration directly particularly near the resonance frequencies of the dominant vibration modes the rdt was employed to extract the damping ratio of the torsional mode the original modal magnitude of the twist mode was band pass filtered for the succeeding process using the rdt the other frequency contents were all removed but that of the twist vibration component for the succeeding process using the rdt the trapezoidal filter shown in fig 1 was used where the filter parameters were set to ω c 0 4924 δ ω t 0 15 and δ ω s 0 05 fig 9 a shows the filtered time series of the modal magnitude along with the triggering points used to select the ensembles for the conditional average the level used to select the ensembles was set to the standard deviation of the signal itself similarly the length of the ensemble was set to be n times of the natural period of the corresponding vibration mode in this particular case n was set to 5 so that 5 vibration cycles were included in the free decay signal fig 9 b shows the evolution of the ensemble averages as the number of sample increases the black solid lines are the interim free decay signal in the middle of ensemble average and the red solid line is the converged one which is considered to be the free decay signal of this particular vibration mode fig 9 c shows the local peaks along with its linear regression result and the damping ratio was derived by equating the slope of the straight line to ς ω n the identified damping ratio of the torsional twist mode in this particular time slot was 11 85 for the torsional 2 node mode the filter parameters were set to ω c 0 6154 δ ω t 0 2 and δ ω s 0 05 fig 10 a shows the filtered time series of the modal magnitude along with the triggering points which were used to select the ensembles for the conditional average fig 10 b shows the evolution of the ensemble averages as the number of samples increases fig 10 c shows the local peaks along with its linear regression result the identified damping ratio of the torsional 2 node mode in this particular time slot was 7 89 fig 11 shows the time evolution of the damping ratio of both the twist and torsional 2 node modes fig 11 a and b confirms that the damping ratio of the twist and torsional 2 node modes varies between 8 and 20 and 4 10 respectively unfortunately the correlation between the natural frequencies and corresponding damping ratio was not clearly visible for this torsional vibration case 7 fatigue damages 7 1 short term fatigue damages fig 12 shows the stress time histories at the deck of the mid ship one with the vibration component and the other one without vibration component the stress was calculated by simply multiplying the young s modulus by the measured strain the stress time histories without vibration were obtained by applying a low pass filter to the original signal with a cut off frequency of 0 35 hz the peak stresses tend to level out by some amount when the vibration component was removed from the original signal owing to the wide band nature of the response spectrum the direct rainflow counting method was used for cycle counting which is considered the standard cycle counting method once the probability distribution of the stress range is obtained using the direct cycle counting method it will be combined with the sn curve the fatigue damage is estimated under the assumption of linear accumulation theory which was realized by palmgrem miner s rule a certain virtual local geometry in which the structural discontinuity was assumed with its stress concentration factor of 2 0 was used to calculate the fatigue damage assuming that the scf transfers the measured stress at the deck into the local hot spot stress a unified sn curve based on the hot spot stress was used the sn curve was defined as shown in eq 10 10 l o g n l o g a m l o g δ σ n predicted number of cycles to failure for stress range δ σ δ σ stress range m negative inverse slope of s n curve log a intercept of logn axis by s n curve the hot spot stress based sn curve specified in dnv cn30 7 was used for the fatigue damage evaluation and table 4 lists the parameters of the sn curve the palmgren miner rule allows one to calculate accumulated fatigue damage caused by randomly fluctuating stress cycles the basic assumption behind it is that the total accumulated fatigue damage induced by irregular stress cycles can be obtained by a linear superposition of the fatigue damage caused by the constant amplitude stress cycles 11 d i 1 k n i n i where n i means the number of stress cycles estimated by the rainflow counting method and n i is the number of cycles that lead to fatigue failure under corresponding constant amplitude stress cycle k is the number of stress block of constant amplitude when the superimposed fatigue damage d reaches unity the fatigue failure is considered to be present in the structure the short term fatigue damage for the selected sea states were calculated using the assumed scf of 2 0 according to the above mentioned procedure fig 13 shows the time evolution of the short term fatigue damage at both the port and starboard side of the deck for all calculated cases the short term fatigue damage was leveled out by a certain amount when the vibration frequency component was removed in the fatigue damage calculation the relative portion of the wave frequency response from a fatigue damage point of view depends on the absolute magnitude of fatigue damage when the focus is given to the case of the largest short term fatigue damage which is time slot 69 the fatigue damage increase was approximately 50 of that without a vibration the relative portion of fatigue damage together with the damage itself depends on the assumed scf due to the cubic power relationship between the stress range and fatigue life in addition the short term fatigue damage at the port and starboard side showed a similar trend and fatigue damage at mid ship table 5 and table 6 summarize the increase in the rate of fatigue damage induced by the vibration component at both the port and starboard sides of the mid ship deck the damage increase rates remain between 10 and 80 in general sometimes reaching beyond 100 note that increase rate larger than 100 generally occurs when the absolute level of short term fatigue damage is very low hence it is not very influential to the total fatigue damage for the time slots with the largest short term fatigue damage the damage increase rates were approximately 40 50 7 2 modal contribution on high frequency fatigue damages fig 14 shows the strain at four corners of midship section of the vessel depending on its global deformation modes ε v ε h and ε w denote the strain induced by vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion deformation modes respectively the axial strain under the torsion mode is those induced by warping deformation of the cross section the axial deformation mode was not considered because of its negligible influence on the axial strains at four corners the strain at three corners i e ε 1 ε 2 and ε 4 may be represented by a linear superposition of the strain induced by each deformation modes as expressed in eq 12 ε 3 was excluded intentionally from the calculation because of the poor quality of the logged raw strain signal note that the relationship given in eq 12 holds only for the vibration component of the strains at the corners the strain of the wave frequency may be influenced by other local effects so that the strain may not be represented by the superposition of the global deformation modes shown in fig 14 12 ε 1 ε 2 ε 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 α 1 β ε v ε h ε w the strain can be decomposed into the components that correspond to the relevant deformation modes using eq 12 the parameters α and β which are related to the geometrical asymmetry of the cross section were estimated by dry eigenvalue analysis of a whole ship fe model fig 15 shows the whole ship fe model which was built by a combination of 3 and 4 node quadrilateral shell elements and 2 node beam elements the total number of elements was 102 329 and that of the nodes was 32 460 the containers were modeled with point mass elements arranged along the ship length direction and connected to the hull using multiple point constraints representing the fully loaded cargo condition linear eigenvalue analysis was performed to derive α and β which are the sectional parameters related to the vertical bending and torsion respectively these sectional parameters can be determined by the geometry of the cross section but they were derived numerically based on the dry eigenvalue analysis fig 16 shows the results of eigenvalue analysis for the whole ship fe model each of which contains vertical bending and torsion deformation modes the lowest mode was twist mode with a natural frequency of 0 428 hz whose mode shape is shown in fig 16 a fig 16 b shows the third lowest vibration mode which is the 2 node vertical bending mode with a natural frequency of 0 749 hz fig 17 shows modal strain distribution particularly for locations 1 and 4 for the above two particular mode shapes the sectional parameters α and β were derived based upon the strain values at the corner of 1 and 4 for the two mode shapes shown in fig 17 a and fig 17 b that α was 0 4492 and β was 0 8867 respectively using the derived parameter the modal strains can be derived by eq 13 hence the strain values measured at corners 1 2 and 3 may be decomposed into its modal contribution using eq 12 13 ε v ε h ε w 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 4569 1 0 8867 1 ε 1 ε 2 ε 4 fig 18 shows the decomposition of the stress time history at the deck of the mid ship the stress is calculated by simply multiplying the young s modulus by the measured strain assuming that the stress state at the deck is 1 dimensional fig 18 a clearly shows that the contribution of strain induced by 2 node vertical bending is dominant compared to those of the other modes fig 18 b and c presents the case when horizontal bending and torsion are removed indicating that horizontal bending makes a slightly larger contribution than torsion in addition the contribution of each mode varies with time fig 19 shows the 1 h high frequency fatigue damage with respect to the different mode combinations at the mid ship of the vessel for some selected time slots whose high frequency fatigue damages are relatively large for comparison the high frequency fatigue damage was calculated using the vibration induced stress only excluding the wave induced stress the damage was calculated under an assumed scf of 2 0 together with the two slope sn curve defined in table 4 as expected from the time series comparison fig 19 shows that the contribution from vertical bending is also dominant from a high frequency fatigue damage point of view regarding the contribution from horizontal bending and torsion horizontal bending makes a slightly larger contribution than torsion because the gap between the damage without horizontal bending vb t and the total damage is larger than that without torsion vb hb and total damage the contribution of horizontal bending and torsion varies with respect to the time slot 8 conclusions based upon the study carried out in this study the following conclusions were made closely spaced torsional vibration modes were decomposed successfully by pod using the acceleration measured along the vessel the corresponding natural frequencies were extracted by taking a fourier transform of the derived time series of the torsional modal magnitude the natural frequency of the twist mode during the measurement period fluctuated between 0 44 and 0 53 hz whereas that of the torsional 2 node mode ranged from 0 53 to 0 66 hz the fluctuation of the natural frequencies was considered to be induced by the different loading conditions that depend on the time slot the damping ratio of the twist mode varied from 9 to 20 for twist mode the damping ratio tended to increase with decreasing natural frequency which supports the premise that a damping increase can be attributed to friction between the cargo and container cell guide during the cargo condition the increase in fatigue damage induced by vibration was investigated and it was found that the increase in the rate of damage remained between 10 and 80 generally sometimes reaching beyond 100 a rate of increase larger than 100 is generally from the case that the absolute level of short term fatigue damage is very low hence not very influential to the total fatigue damage for time slots with the largest short term fatigue damage the damage increase rates were approximately 40 50 modal contribution on the high frequency fatigue damage was also explored after decomposing the measured high frequency strain signal into its modal components the contribution of damage from vertical bending was dominant and those from horizontal bending torsion were minor the contribution from horizontal bending was slightly larger than that from torsion acknowledgement authors

23392,waves were generated in a numerical wave tank nwt using a piston type wave maker firstly the performance of a 1 8 m diameter savonius rotor was tested at a mean wave height h and a mean wave period t of 2 00 m and 12 68 s respectively the savonius rotor performed the best at a submergence depth of 1 0 d when compared to greater depths the power produced by the rotor decreased by 37 at 1 25 d compared to 1 0 d in addition to this the blade entry angle also affected the rotor performance the 20 rotor at 42 5 rpm was found to have the best performance the maximum power and efficiency at the mean sea state were 15 01 kw and 16 7 respectively secondly simulations were performed at the minimum sea state h 1 37 m t 10 00 s and the maximum sea state h 2 34 m t 14 39 s it is observed that the peak power at the maximum sea state is lower than the peak power at the mean sea state the maximum power that the rotor produced was 15 01 kw at 42 5 rpm which gave an efficiency of 16 7 at the mean sea state keywords wave energy savonius rotor computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical wave tank 1 introduction the vast improvement in the computational capabilities of modern computers has enabled researchers in the field of wave energy to simulate a variety of sea conditions and study the performance of wave energy converters powerful computers and computer networks have led to the emergence of numerical wave tanks nwts to study wave characteristics and aid in the designing of wave energy converters wec a computational fluid dynamics cfd software is used in the present work to model a nwt a nwt is simply a numerical representation of a physical wave tank or wave flume a major advantage of nwt is that wave generation capabilities are limitless unlike its physical counterparts furthermore the physical wave tanks have a definite dimension hence limiting the model size that can be used to test the performance of wecs accurately this problem is not present in nwt and appropriate computational domain can be used to simulate the wave climate and test the performance in addition to this design modifications and optimizations takes less time for numerical work a review of the literature highlights the use of nwt to study fluid phenomena lal and elangovan 2008 simulated and validated a flap type wave maker using commercial cfd software ansys cfx different wave profiles were studied by varying parameters such as the stroke length wave period and water depth the results were verified against flap type wave maker theory for accuracy elangovan 2011 used similar cfd scheme to simulate irregular waves in a nwt choi et al 2010 investigated both experimentally and numerically the performance of a cross flow turbine that would be built into the caisson for a wave power plant the efficiency at the best operating point was 48 6 the authors highlighted that the efficiency can be improved by optimizing the design of the front nozzle and the turbine flow passage chiu et al 2015 studied a caisson based oscillating water column owc and reported that the results agreed well with experimental data prasad et al 2009 investigated the effect of augmentation channel geometry and front guide nozzle divergence angle on the primary energy conversion at a fixed wave height of 0 23 m and a wave period of 2 5 s the results showed the spiral wall augmentation channel having a front guide nozzle divergence angle of 7 gave the highest energy conversion of 45 prasad and lee 2012 numerically investigated the influence of front guide nozzle shape and rear chamber geometry on the primary energy conversion in an augmentation channel of a direct drive turbine the focus of the study was to maximize the primary energy conversion the wave height and the wave period were 0 23 m and 2 5 s respectively in that work the higher the conversion the greater the energy available to the turbine and ultimately higher turbine power the authors proposed the use of cross flow turbine for energy extraction the best model identified in the study recorded maximum primary energy conversion of 0 6 indicating 60 of the energy from the incoming waves is available to the turbine prasad et al 2012 numerically investigated the performance of a cross flow turbine by varying the turbine speed at a fixed wave height of 0 2 m and a wave period of 2 0 s the authors reported a peak efficiency of 44 73 at a turbine speed of 35 rpm the performance of the cross flow turbine at varying wave conditions and varying turbine speeds can be found in the work of prasad et al 2014 kim et al 2015 experimentally and numerically studied the power take off pto system of a novel floating wec the novel device consists of double hull water column chamber an augmentation channel and a cross flow turbine the experimental results showed better performance at wave period of 3 s the peak efficiency was between 35 and 45 the full scale model was tested at a water depth of 30 m with incident waves having a period of 4 5 s and a wavelength of 30 m zullah et al 2009 numerically investigated the performance of full scale helical savonius turbine for wave energy conversion the work highlighted that the turbine with 30 helical blade angle performed the best with turbine power of 6 12 kw and efficiency of 12 64 in another work zullah et al 2010 numerically studied the effect of savonius rotor blade angle two blade angle of 40 and 60 was tested and superior performance of 40 blade angle savonius rotor was reported the power and efficiency recorded was 6 81 kw and 14 14 respectively zullah and lee 2013 later conducted extensive investigation of effect of blade angle on the performance of the savonius rotor for zullah et al 2009 2010 and zullah and lee 2013 the diameter and the length of the rotor were 2 0 m and 3 0 m respectively the sea state was 1 5 m and the wave period was 6 5 s seibt et al 2014 numerically tested performance on some common wec the device was coupled in the nwt and finite volume method fvm and vof model were adopted the work highlighted the device s operating principle can be studied numerically and highlighted the potential of computational fluid dynamics cfd in modeling such systems a thorough review of numerical work can be found in the work of prasad et al 2017 apart from numerical studies experimental investigation into the performance of savonius rotor for wave energy extraction can be found in the works of bikas et al 2014 hindasageri et al 2012 and tutar and veci 2016 in the present work the performance of a savonius rotor at varying rotor speed is tested at mean sea state three different blade entry angles and three submergence depths were tested the mean sea state tested is from the works of ram et al 2014 the mean sea state h and the mean wave period t used in the simulation is 2 00 m and 12 68 s respectively initially only the nwt was simulated to obtain the desired wave condition grid independence is also studied the characteristics of the waves generated in the nwt are compared with linear wave theory lwt and theoretical model furthermore study on reflected waves in the nwt is conducted by varying the beach slope it is important to dampen the reflected waves in order to predict the performance of the savonius rotor accurately commercial cfd code ansys cfx is used for numerical simulation the waves are generated in the nwt using a piston type wave maker the air water free surface is captured using volume of fluid vof method the current numerical code used was previously validated against real sea data by the authors prasad et al 2017 secondly after identifying the best submergence depth and the best rotor geometry simulation at the minimum sea state h 1 37 m and t 10 00 s and the maximum sea state h 2 34 m and t 14 39 s were also carried out rotor power rotor efficiency and flow characteristics are presented and discussed in the paper 2 methodology nx 6 software was used for solid modeling the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 1 the wave maker and the back wall of the nwt are located 350 m away from the savonius rotor lakshmynarayanan et al 2016 suggested that the inlet and the back wall can be located 1 5 λ and 2 λ respectively from the model where λ is the wavelength the results obtained in their simulation were accurate therefore for the present simulation the inlet and the back wall are located 2 25 λ from the savonius rotor the length of the wave maker region and the wave damping zone was 100 m the width of the nwt was 3 m the water depth h was 18 m and d is the submergence depth of the rotor from its centre to the mean water level the details of the savonius rotor are given in fig 2 the diameter of the rotor and the length are 1 8 m and 3 m respectively this dimension was chosen because of ease of manufacturing and transportation to a possible deployment site the current rotor design is modular in nature and it can be easily used to make wave farms modular approach also eases the burden of designing units of different sizes to meet specific energy demand in addition to this the size of the current rotor is comparable to that reported in the work of zullah and lee 2013 three different blade entry angles α of 20 30 and 40 were tested to address the issue of wave reflection from the back wall two additional beach slope configurations were tested as shown in fig 3 the discretization of the model was done using hexahedral meshing in icem cfd software this grid generation scheme allows for user defined meshing which is of high mesh quality the meshing for the nwt and the savonius rotor is shown in fig 4 the mesh was refined near the mean water level region to capture the air water interface accurately commercial cfd code ansys cfx was used for the simulations it solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation ranse the governing equations solved are mass continuity and momentum conservation and are given by equations 1 and 2 lal and elangovan 2008 details of the numerical method used in the current work can be found in the work of prasad et al 2017 1 ρ t ρ v 0 2 t ρ v ρ v p τ 0 the air water free surface was captured using vof method the dynamic boundary condition and the kinematic free surface boundary condition are given in equations 3 and 4 respectively maguire 2011 falnes 2002 in equations 3 and 4 η is the water surface displacement and ϕ is the velocity potential 3 g η ϕ t z η 0 4 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ z z 0 0 the entire computational domain was divided into three regions these are wave maker region tank and rotor as shown in fig 5 the wave maker region was the moving mesh region the plate was assigned a specific displacement along the x axis x dis using user defined expression as given by equation 5 the top side of the wave maker region was assigned a boundary type of opening the volume fraction for both water and air was specified along with relative pressure of 0 pa the side walls of this domain were modeled as a wall with free slip condition this prevented the formation of boundary layer which otherwise could have affected the results finally the bottom wall was assigned no slip condition the top side of the tank domain was modeled as opening and similar boundary conditions were assigned as in the wave maker region for the opening the side walls of the tank were assigned free slip conditions the rest of the domain was modeled as a wall with no slip boundary condition for the rotor domain it was treated as a rotating domain and the speed of the savonius rotor was specified the side walls of the rotor were modeled as wall with free slip condition the rotor blades were assigned as wall with no slip condition finally appropriate interface models were chosen to associate the domains 5 x d i s a sin ω t the simulations were performed on a parallel computer network the processer was intel r xeon r cpu 5650 in total there were 12 cores and ram size was 16 gb since formation of waves is time dependent and unsteady therefore a transient simulation was performed using k ε turbulence model ansys inc 2011 the time discertization of the equations was achieved with the implicit second order backward euler scheme for advection scheme and turbulence numerics high resolution option was chosen in order to produce waves accurately following initial numerical over prediction a simulation time of 120 s was selected the time step between each iteration was chosen as 0 05 s and the coefficient loop was selected as 7 3 results and discussion it is very important to study the influence of grid size on the simulated results as such three different grid sizes of 200000 350000 and 425000 nodes were generated and the free surface captured at the air water interface was monitored with the help of wave elevation as shown in fig 6 for the mean sea state the wave elevation is under predicted with 200000 nodes when comparing the results for 350000 nodes and 425000 nodes the difference in the wave elevation and the wave profile is very little using higher number of nodes only increases the simulation time therefore for all the simulations without the rotor 350000 nodes were used the formation of waves in the nwt at the mean sea state is compared with the linear wave theory lwt and stokes second order wave theory as shown in fig 7 the pressure in the nwt at the mean sea state is compared with theoretical pressure as shown in fig 8 the wave elevation using lwt stokes second order sorensen 1993 and theoretical pressure awt are given by equations 6 8

k x ω t 8 p ρ g z ρ g η cosh k z h cosh k h reflection from the back wall of the nwt can considerably affect the results in order to dampen the reflected waves different slope configurations were tested the results are shown in fig 9 the mean wave height simulated in the nwt is 2 00 m and for the normal case there is wave amplification for 1 3 slope there is significant wave damping compared to the normal case as well as 1 5 slope due to wave breaking similar results were obtained in the work of elangovan 2011 the wave profile near the back wall at the same instant for the mean sea state is shown in fig 10 with the help of volume fraction the waves are propagating from right to left the velocity contours in the horizontal x and in the vertical y directions for the mean sea state are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the movement of water particles is more in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction this is a characteristic of waves propagating in intermediate water depths furthermore high energy flow is concentrated near the surface on this basis the initial simulations were performed to find the best location of the rotor from the free surface three different submergence depths d 1 0d d 1 125d and d 1 25d where d is the diameter of the rotor were selected table 1 shows the variation of rotor power and efficiency with submergence depth for savonius rotor with blade entry angle of 30 and at a speed of 30 rpm for the mean sea condition grid independence study was conducted using 400000 800000 and 1200000 nodes for this case the rotor powers recorded for 400000 800000 and 1200000 nodes were 3 28 kw 3 34 kw and 3 35 kw respectively therefore grid size of 800000 nodes was used for all the simulation that included the rotor rotor power and efficiency were calculated using equations 9 13 in the following equations c p and c g are phase velocity and group velocity respectively 9 c p g λ 2 π tanh 2 π h λ 10 c g 1 2 c p 1 4 π h λ

are shown in fig 12 higher velocity is noticed around the savonius rotor at 1 0d compared to 1 25d and as a result the power produced by the rotor at 1 0d is higher the power produced by the rotor decreased by 37 at 1 25d when compared to 1 0d faizal et al 2010 from their experiments reported superior performance of savonius rotor at 1 06d bikas et al 2014 also stated that submerging the rotor below the mean water level improved its performance however they only tested the rotor placed at the mean water level and submerged half the diameter from the mean water level the performance of the three different savonius rotors at varying rotational speeds for the mean sea state is shown in fig 13 the rotor power increased linearly from 30 rpm to 37 5 rpm then there is a rapid increase in power the peak output is at 42 5 rpm and the power produced by the rotor decreases from here onwards the flow is constant and the only variable is the rotor speed if the rotor is rotating too fast then the incoming flow is not able to impart all the energy it possesses on the other hand if the rotor rotates too slowly then the flow moves quickly past the rotor and again imparts very little energy it can be observed from fig 13 that at lower speed the rotor produces lesser power therefore the peak obtained at 42 5 rpm indicates that the interaction between the rotor and the incoming flow is optimum and hence the rotor produces maximum power at this speed the energy extraction is maximum this represents the optimum operating point of the savonius rotor in addition to this the blade entry angle also affects the rotor performance the rotor with α 20 performed the best at all the speeds as the blade entry angle increases the rotor becomes straighter the 20 rotor has higher curvature when compared to the other two rotors and hence it is more effective in capturing the energy of the incoming flow the fact that the 20 is well aligned to receive energy from the incoming waves causes it to produce more power the flow fields around the 20 and the 40 rotors for the mean sea state are shown in fig 14 for the same instant even though the wave condition is same the flow around the 20 rotor shows flow acceleration as well as smaller vortices between the rotor blades when compared to the 40 rotor the peak powers produced by the 20 30 and 40 rotors at 42 5 rpm are 15 01 kw 14 38 kw and 13 57 kw respectively there is an increase of 10 6 in the peak power produced by the 20 rotor when compared to the 40 rotor the efficiency at the mean sea state is given in table 2 the peak efficiency obtained is 16 7 for α 20 at 42 5 rpm zullah and lee 2013 also reported superior performance of savonius rotor with the blade entry angle of 20 furthermore the peak efficiency they obtained was 18 58 the rotor in their study was employed in an owc however the efficiency compares well with the current results finally the best performing rotor savonius rotor with the blade entry angle of 20 at the submergence depth of 1 0d was further studied at minimum and maximum sea states the performance of the 20 savonius rotor at different sea states is shown in fig 15 the rotor power at the minimum sea state was very low when compared to the mean sea state for the maximum sea state higher rotor power was recorded up to 40 rpm which then dropped from this point onwards when compared to the rotor power recorded at the mean sea state it is interesting to observe that the peak power at the maximum sea state is lower than the peak power at the mean sea state this highlights that though the wave power at the maximum sea condition is higher it is the interaction between the rotor and the wave which ultimately determines the performance of the rotor therefore the maximum power produced by the rotor is 15 01 kw at 42 5 rpm which corresponds to an efficiency of 16 7 at the mean sea state 4 conclusions a numerical wave tank was used to generate waves and the performance of savonius rotors was studied in it the main findings from current work are 1 it is important to control the reflected waves from the far boundary back wall in this case in order to correctly predict the performance of any wave energy device this can be achieved by proper domain size incorporated with a suitable wave dampening mechanism the positioning of the wave maker and the back wall at 1 5 λ and 2 λ respectively from the savonius rotor in the current study combined with the 1 3 beach slope provided maximum wave dampening to control the reflected waves 2 for a savonius rotor operating near the free surface the submergence depth from the surface is a critical parameter in determining its performance the best submergence depth for the savonius rotor in the present study was found to be 1 0d this is expected because high energy flow is concentrated near the free surface as the rotor was submerged further below the free surface its performance dropped the power produced by the rotor decreased by 37 at 1 25d when compared to 1 0d 3 looking at the performance of the rotor at mean sea state a the rotor power increased from 30 rpm and peaked at 42 5 rpm and then the power produced by the rotor decreased the peak obtained at 42 5 rpm indicates that the interaction between the rotor and the incoming flow is optimum and hence the rotor produces maximum power at this speed the energy extraction is maximum b in addition to this the blade entry angle also affected the rotor performance the rotor with α 20 performed the best at all the speeds the fact that the 20 is well aligned to receive energy from the incoming waves causes it to produce more power the 20 rotor at 42 5 rpm performed the best the maximum power and efficiency obtained were 15 01 kw and 16 7 respectively 4 finally the performance of the 20 rotor at the submergence depth of 1 0d revealed that the rotor power at the minimum sea state was very low for the maximum sea state higher rotor power was recorded up to 40 rpm which then dropped from this point onwards when compared to the rotor power recorded at the mean sea state it is interesting to observe that the peak power of 13 14 kw at the maximum sea state is lower than the peak power of 15 01 kw at the mean sea state therefore the maximum power that the rotor produced was 15 01 kw at 42 5 rpm which corresponds to an efficiency of 16 7 at the mean sea state this highlights that though wave power at maximum sea condition is higher it is the interaction between the rotor and the wave which ultimately determines the performance of the rotor 
23392,waves were generated in a numerical wave tank nwt using a piston type wave maker firstly the performance of a 1 8 m diameter savonius rotor was tested at a mean wave height h and a mean wave period t of 2 00 m and 12 68 s respectively the savonius rotor performed the best at a submergence depth of 1 0 d when compared to greater depths the power produced by the rotor decreased by 37 at 1 25 d compared to 1 0 d in addition to this the blade entry angle also affected the rotor performance the 20 rotor at 42 5 rpm was found to have the best performance the maximum power and efficiency at the mean sea state were 15 01 kw and 16 7 respectively secondly simulations were performed at the minimum sea state h 1 37 m t 10 00 s and the maximum sea state h 2 34 m t 14 39 s it is observed that the peak power at the maximum sea state is lower than the peak power at the mean sea state the maximum power that the rotor produced was 15 01 kw at 42 5 rpm which gave an efficiency of 16 7 at the mean sea state keywords wave energy savonius rotor computational fluid dynamics cfd numerical wave tank 1 introduction the vast improvement in the computational capabilities of modern computers has enabled researchers in the field of wave energy to simulate a variety of sea conditions and study the performance of wave energy converters powerful computers and computer networks have led to the emergence of numerical wave tanks nwts to study wave characteristics and aid in the designing of wave energy converters wec a computational fluid dynamics cfd software is used in the present work to model a nwt a nwt is simply a numerical representation of a physical wave tank or wave flume a major advantage of nwt is that wave generation capabilities are limitless unlike its physical counterparts furthermore the physical wave tanks have a definite dimension hence limiting the model size that can be used to test the performance of wecs accurately this problem is not present in nwt and appropriate computational domain can be used to simulate the wave climate and test the performance in addition to this design modifications and optimizations takes less time for numerical work a review of the literature highlights the use of nwt to study fluid phenomena lal and elangovan 2008 simulated and validated a flap type wave maker using commercial cfd software ansys cfx different wave profiles were studied by varying parameters such as the stroke length wave period and water depth the results were verified against flap type wave maker theory for accuracy elangovan 2011 used similar cfd scheme to simulate irregular waves in a nwt choi et al 2010 investigated both experimentally and numerically the performance of a cross flow turbine that would be built into the caisson for a wave power plant the efficiency at the best operating point was 48 6 the authors highlighted that the efficiency can be improved by optimizing the design of the front nozzle and the turbine flow passage chiu et al 2015 studied a caisson based oscillating water column owc and reported that the results agreed well with experimental data prasad et al 2009 investigated the effect of augmentation channel geometry and front guide nozzle divergence angle on the primary energy conversion at a fixed wave height of 0 23 m and a wave period of 2 5 s the results showed the spiral wall augmentation channel having a front guide nozzle divergence angle of 7 gave the highest energy conversion of 45 prasad and lee 2012 numerically investigated the influence of front guide nozzle shape and rear chamber geometry on the primary energy conversion in an augmentation channel of a direct drive turbine the focus of the study was to maximize the primary energy conversion the wave height and the wave period were 0 23 m and 2 5 s respectively in that work the higher the conversion the greater the energy available to the turbine and ultimately higher turbine power the authors proposed the use of cross flow turbine for energy extraction the best model identified in the study recorded maximum primary energy conversion of 0 6 indicating 60 of the energy from the incoming waves is available to the turbine prasad et al 2012 numerically investigated the performance of a cross flow turbine by varying the turbine speed at a fixed wave height of 0 2 m and a wave period of 2 0 s the authors reported a peak efficiency of 44 73 at a turbine speed of 35 rpm the performance of the cross flow turbine at varying wave conditions and varying turbine speeds can be found in the work of prasad et al 2014 kim et al 2015 experimentally and numerically studied the power take off pto system of a novel floating wec the novel device consists of double hull water column chamber an augmentation channel and a cross flow turbine the experimental results showed better performance at wave period of 3 s the peak efficiency was between 35 and 45 the full scale model was tested at a water depth of 30 m with incident waves having a period of 4 5 s and a wavelength of 30 m zullah et al 2009 numerically investigated the performance of full scale helical savonius turbine for wave energy conversion the work highlighted that the turbine with 30 helical blade angle performed the best with turbine power of 6 12 kw and efficiency of 12 64 in another work zullah et al 2010 numerically studied the effect of savonius rotor blade angle two blade angle of 40 and 60 was tested and superior performance of 40 blade angle savonius rotor was reported the power and efficiency recorded was 6 81 kw and 14 14 respectively zullah and lee 2013 later conducted extensive investigation of effect of blade angle on the performance of the savonius rotor for zullah et al 2009 2010 and zullah and lee 2013 the diameter and the length of the rotor were 2 0 m and 3 0 m respectively the sea state was 1 5 m and the wave period was 6 5 s seibt et al 2014 numerically tested performance on some common wec the device was coupled in the nwt and finite volume method fvm and vof model were adopted the work highlighted the device s operating principle can be studied numerically and highlighted the potential of computational fluid dynamics cfd in modeling such systems a thorough review of numerical work can be found in the work of prasad et al 2017 apart from numerical studies experimental investigation into the performance of savonius rotor for wave energy extraction can be found in the works of bikas et al 2014 hindasageri et al 2012 and tutar and veci 2016 in the present work the performance of a savonius rotor at varying rotor speed is tested at mean sea state three different blade entry angles and three submergence depths were tested the mean sea state tested is from the works of ram et al 2014 the mean sea state h and the mean wave period t used in the simulation is 2 00 m and 12 68 s respectively initially only the nwt was simulated to obtain the desired wave condition grid independence is also studied the characteristics of the waves generated in the nwt are compared with linear wave theory lwt and theoretical model furthermore study on reflected waves in the nwt is conducted by varying the beach slope it is important to dampen the reflected waves in order to predict the performance of the savonius rotor accurately commercial cfd code ansys cfx is used for numerical simulation the waves are generated in the nwt using a piston type wave maker the air water free surface is captured using volume of fluid vof method the current numerical code used was previously validated against real sea data by the authors prasad et al 2017 secondly after identifying the best submergence depth and the best rotor geometry simulation at the minimum sea state h 1 37 m and t 10 00 s and the maximum sea state h 2 34 m and t 14 39 s were also carried out rotor power rotor efficiency and flow characteristics are presented and discussed in the paper 2 methodology nx 6 software was used for solid modeling the schematic of the computational domain is shown in fig 1 the wave maker and the back wall of the nwt are located 350 m away from the savonius rotor lakshmynarayanan et al 2016 suggested that the inlet and the back wall can be located 1 5 λ and 2 λ respectively from the model where λ is the wavelength the results obtained in their simulation were accurate therefore for the present simulation the inlet and the back wall are located 2 25 λ from the savonius rotor the length of the wave maker region and the wave damping zone was 100 m the width of the nwt was 3 m the water depth h was 18 m and d is the submergence depth of the rotor from its centre to the mean water level the details of the savonius rotor are given in fig 2 the diameter of the rotor and the length are 1 8 m and 3 m respectively this dimension was chosen because of ease of manufacturing and transportation to a possible deployment site the current rotor design is modular in nature and it can be easily used to make wave farms modular approach also eases the burden of designing units of different sizes to meet specific energy demand in addition to this the size of the current rotor is comparable to that reported in the work of zullah and lee 2013 three different blade entry angles α of 20 30 and 40 were tested to address the issue of wave reflection from the back wall two additional beach slope configurations were tested as shown in fig 3 the discretization of the model was done using hexahedral meshing in icem cfd software this grid generation scheme allows for user defined meshing which is of high mesh quality the meshing for the nwt and the savonius rotor is shown in fig 4 the mesh was refined near the mean water level region to capture the air water interface accurately commercial cfd code ansys cfx was used for the simulations it solves the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation ranse the governing equations solved are mass continuity and momentum conservation and are given by equations 1 and 2 lal and elangovan 2008 details of the numerical method used in the current work can be found in the work of prasad et al 2017 1 ρ t ρ v 0 2 t ρ v ρ v p τ 0 the air water free surface was captured using vof method the dynamic boundary condition and the kinematic free surface boundary condition are given in equations 3 and 4 respectively maguire 2011 falnes 2002 in equations 3 and 4 η is the water surface displacement and ϕ is the velocity potential 3 g η ϕ t z η 0 4 2 ϕ t 2 g ϕ z z 0 0 the entire computational domain was divided into three regions these are wave maker region tank and rotor as shown in fig 5 the wave maker region was the moving mesh region the plate was assigned a specific displacement along the x axis x dis using user defined expression as given by equation 5 the top side of the wave maker region was assigned a boundary type of opening the volume fraction for both water and air was specified along with relative pressure of 0 pa the side walls of this domain were modeled as a wall with free slip condition this prevented the formation of boundary layer which otherwise could have affected the results finally the bottom wall was assigned no slip condition the top side of the tank domain was modeled as opening and similar boundary conditions were assigned as in the wave maker region for the opening the side walls of the tank were assigned free slip conditions the rest of the domain was modeled as a wall with no slip boundary condition for the rotor domain it was treated as a rotating domain and the speed of the savonius rotor was specified the side walls of the rotor were modeled as wall with free slip condition the rotor blades were assigned as wall with no slip condition finally appropriate interface models were chosen to associate the domains 5 x d i s a sin ω t the simulations were performed on a parallel computer network the processer was intel r xeon r cpu 5650 in total there were 12 cores and ram size was 16 gb since formation of waves is time dependent and unsteady therefore a transient simulation was performed using k ε turbulence model ansys inc 2011 the time discertization of the equations was achieved with the implicit second order backward euler scheme for advection scheme and turbulence numerics high resolution option was chosen in order to produce waves accurately following initial numerical over prediction a simulation time of 120 s was selected the time step between each iteration was chosen as 0 05 s and the coefficient loop was selected as 7 3 results and discussion it is very important to study the influence of grid size on the simulated results as such three different grid sizes of 200000 350000 and 425000 nodes were generated and the free surface captured at the air water interface was monitored with the help of wave elevation as shown in fig 6 for the mean sea state the wave elevation is under predicted with 200000 nodes when comparing the results for 350000 nodes and 425000 nodes the difference in the wave elevation and the wave profile is very little using higher number of nodes only increases the simulation time therefore for all the simulations without the rotor 350000 nodes were used the formation of waves in the nwt at the mean sea state is compared with the linear wave theory lwt and stokes second order wave theory as shown in fig 7 the pressure in the nwt at the mean sea state is compared with theoretical pressure as shown in fig 8 the wave elevation using lwt stokes second order sorensen 1993 and theoretical pressure awt are given by equations 6 8

to the normal case as well as 1 5 slope due to wave breaking similar results were obtained in the work of elangovan 2011 the wave profile near the back wall at the same instant for the mean sea state is shown in fig 10 with the help of volume fraction the waves are propagating from right to left the velocity contours in the horizontal x and in the vertical y directions for the mean sea state are shown in fig 11 it is observed that the movement of water particles is more in the horizontal direction than in the vertical direction this is a characteristic of waves propagating in intermediate water depths furthermore high energy flow is concentrated near the surface on this basis the initial simulations were performed to find the best location of the rotor from the free surface three different submergence depths d 1 0d d 1 125d and d 1 25d where d is the diameter of the rotor were selected table 1 shows the variation of rotor power and efficiency with submergence depth for savonius rotor with blade entry angle of 30 and at a speed of 30 rpm for the mean sea condition grid independence study was conducted using 400000 800000 and 1200000 nodes for this case the rotor powers recorded for 400000 800000 and 1200000 nodes were 3 28 kw 3 34 kw and 3 35 kw respectively therefore grid size of 800000 nodes was used for all the simulation that included the rotor rotor

are shown in fig 12 higher velocity is noticed around the savonius rotor at 1 0d compared to 1 25d and as a result the power produced by the rotor at 1 0d is higher the power produced by the rotor decreased by 37 at 1 25d when compared to 1 0d faizal et al 2010 from their experiments reported superior performance of savonius rotor at 1 06d bikas et al 2014 also stated that submerging the rotor below the mean water level improved its performance however they only tested the rotor placed at the mean water level and submerged half the diameter from the mean water level the performance of the three different savonius rotors at varying rotational speeds for the mean sea state is shown in fig 13 the rotor power increased linearly from 30 rpm to 37 5 rpm then there is a rapid increase in power the peak output is at 42 5 rpm and the power produced by the rotor decreases from here onwards the flow is constant and the only variable is the rotor speed if the rotor is rotating too fast then the incoming flow is not able to impart all the energy it possesses on the other hand if the rotor rotates too slowly then the flow moves quickly past the rotor and again imparts very little

entry angle also affects the rotor performance the rotor with α 20 performed the best at all the speeds as the blade entry angle increases the rotor becomes straighter the 20 rotor has higher curvature when compared to the other two rotors and hence it is more effective in capturing the energy of the incoming flow the fact that the 20 is well aligned to receive energy from the incoming

angle of 20 at the submergence depth of 1 0d was further studied at minimum and maximum sea states the performance of the 20 savonius rotor at different sea states is shown in fig 15 the rotor power at the minimum sea state was very low when compared to the mean sea state for the maximum sea state higher rotor power was recorded up to 40 rpm which then dropped from this point onwards when compared to the rotor power recorded at the mean sea state it is interesting to observe that the peak power at the maximum sea state is lower than the peak power at the mean sea state this highlights that though the wave power at the maximum sea condition is higher it is the interaction between the rotor and the wave which ultimately determines the performance of the rotor therefore the maximum power produced by the rotor is 15 01 kw at 42 5 rpm which corresponds to an efficiency of 16 7 at the mean sea state 4 conclusions a numerical wave tank was used to generate waves and the performance

23393,the plate shaped gravity installed anchor gia provides a potential alternative to deepwater mooring systems as its dynamic installation and diving behavior however the anchor final penetration depth in seabed soils especially in soils with high strength gradient is relatively shallow due to the limited impact velocity and large contact area between the anchor and the surrounding soil an innovative booster concept is put forward in this study to increase the anchor final penetration depth by increasing the kinetic energy during free fall in water and gravitational energy during dynamic penetration within seabed the booster is attached to the rear of the anchor during installation and can be retrieved after installation for reuse the present study performed model tests with the aim of investigating the working efficiency of booster on the impact velocity of the gia during free fall in the water column a mini motion tracing device mtd is developed to record the anchor free fall history in water the hydrodynamic characteristics including the terminal velocity drag coefficient and directional stability for the gia were studied a series of experimental cases were subsequently conducted to study the effects of the adding booster on the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia the testing results demonstrated that both the directional stability and the release height can be improved for the gia with a booster thus the anchor impact velocity is increased the anchor kinetic energy is significantly increased due to the additional mass and increased impact velocity by the booster which ensures the anchor to be embedded deeper within seabed keywords gravity installed anchor impact velocity booster directional stability hydrodynamic characteristics

is released from a predetermined height above the soil surface i e h e in fig 1 a allowing it to gain velocity during free fall in the water column before impacting into the seabed the anchor velocity at the mudline is termed the impact velocity v 0 subsequently the anchor penetrates within the seabed by its kinetic energy gained through free fall in water and the gravitational energy a higher anchor final penetration depth i e the embedment depth from anchor tip to the mudline z e in fig 1 a mobilizes higher capacity as typical seabed soils are characterized by increasing soil strength with depth richardson et al 2009 torpedo anchors and deep penetrating anchors dpas are the most common gias which feature an ellipsoidal or conical tip and three or four rear fins fig 1 b the omni max anchor is another gia design which features three pairs of flukes and a loading arm fig 1 c each pair of flukes is comprised of a larger top fluke and a smaller tip one the loading arm which can rotate freely around the anchor shaft is located towards the anchor tip compared to torpedo anchors or dpas the omni max anchor is a plate shaped gia and has large surface area shelton et al 2011 the large surface area provides a large contact area between the anchor and its surrounding soil hence the capacity efficiency is relatively high however the large surface area of the anchor will result in a low impact velocity and low penetration depth within the seabed for instance field testing results indicate that the impact velocity of the omni max anchor is usually limited to 19 m s with a released height of 30 m zimmerman et al 2009 whereas the impact velocity of dpas could reach 24 5 27 m s lieng et al 2010 a low impact velocity and hence a low kinetic energy results in a reduction in anchor final penetration depth furthermore the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor is confined due to the large contact area between the anchor and the surrounding soil during dynamic installation zimmerman et al 2009 reported that the average penetration depth ratio i e the ratio of anchor final penetration depth to anchor length z e h a was 1 77 for 54 field tests in the gulf of mexico in addition the anchor final penetration depth reduces drastically in strong soils with high strength gradient numerical simulations indicated the anchor penetration depth ratio was 0 87 1 14 with soil strength gradient k 3 kpa m and impact velocity v 0 15 25 m s kim and hossain 2015 liu et al 2016 liu and zhang 2017a centrifuge testing results indicated the anchor penetration depth ratio was 1 14 1 46 with k 3 3 kpa m and v 0 20 53 29 39 m s however for torpedo anchors and dpas the anchor penetration depth ratio is relatively high and it ranged 1 5 2 9 in kaolin clay from centrifuge results o loughlin et al 2004 2009 richardson et al 2009 hossain et al 2014 and 1 5 2 6 from field results de araujo et al 2004 lieng et al 2010 o beirne et al 2014 generally the final penetration depth of a plate shaped gia is relatively low compared to that of a torpedo shaped gia therefore this study put forward an innovative booster concept which aims at improving the impact velocity and directional stability of the plate shaped gia in water and increasing the anchor final penetration depth embedded within seabed to investigate the booster working efficiency model tests simulating the anchor free fall process in water were performed in the model tests a plate shaped gia which has the profile similar to the omni max anchor was used the effects of the booster on both the directional stability and impact velocity of the gia were systematically studied the testing results are beneficial in design and engineering application furthermore the booster concept may provide a reference for the installation of plate anchors 2 booster concept 2 1 anchor installation process with a booster the booster concept is mainly generated from the launching of satellites into space using a rocket the similar method has been used to install suction embedded plate anchors seplas and dynamically embedded plate anchors deplas with a suction caisson and a slender cylindrical shaft respectively dove et al 1998 o loughlin et al 2014 the booster is designed with the aim of improving the impact velocity and directional stability in water and the final penetration depth within seabed for the plate shaped gia the booster is attached to the rear of the gia during dynamic installation and can be retrieved after installation for reuse the installation cost is increased due to the transportation and retrieve of the booster whereas the benefit of the booster on the anchor impact velocity and thus final penetration depth in soils can outweigh the considerable increased cost the installation process of the gia with a booster is depicted in fig 2 the dynamic installation process including the free fall stage in water and the dynamic penetration stage in soils is similar to the installation process of gias after installation the booster is pulled out by tensing the retrieval line at the booster rear a shear pin is adopted to connect the cylindrical bar located at the rear of the anchor and the reserved slot at the booster tip permitting the anchor shaft center in line with the booster shaft center the shear pin is failure when the pullout load is in excess of its limited load causing the booster to be pulled out and the anchor to be remained in soils 2 2 booster design details similar to the geometry of a dpa or torpedo anchor the booster is comprised with a slender shaft and three rear fins which are separated by 120 in plane fig 2 the torpedo shaped booster is capable of reducing the water drag force as previous studies have demonstrated that a torpedo anchor has a lower drag coefficient compared to that of a plate shaped gia freeman et al 1984 øye 2000 o loughlin et al 2013 cenac 2011 liu and zhang 2017 moreover the pullout capacity of booster is relatively low as its capacity is primarily provided by the frictional resistance at the booster soil interface some design details associated with the booster are emphasized in the following the booster is designed with an ellipsoidal tip to ensure smooth transitions of the water streamlines from the anchor rear to the booster the booster shaft is a slender cylinder the booster shaft can be manufactured with a hollow sleeve in which ballasted weight such as lead can be filled to reduce the location of the gravity center gc about the booster tip numerous investigations have demonstrated that reducing the position of gc relative to anchor tip could improve the directional stability for torpedo anchors and dpas to some extent fernandes et al 2005 2011 hasanloo et al 2012 li et al 2014 the booster is designed with a truncated cone shaped rear which is similar to the rear of the projectile in freeman et al 1984 the retracted rear can restrict the trailing vortex within a relative narrow region landau and lifshitz 1987 young et al 2010 leading to a reduction in drag force and thus an increase in impact velocity to improve the directional stability of the hybrid anchor i e gia with a booster the booster rear can be set with three rear fins triantafyllou and hover 2003 2 3 effect of rear fins on directional stability to maintain directional stability gc should be ahead of the hydrodynamic center hc about the tip for slender bodies triantafyllou and hover 2003 if the location of hc is lower than gc relative to the object tip as shown in fig 3 the moment m generated by the submerged weight w and water drag force f d forces the object to rotate even further once the object is tilt hence the object is instable however if the location of gc is lower than hc relative to the object tip the object is stable and the moment m will force the object to rotate to the vertical direction once the object is tilt the rear fins can enlarge the distance from hc to the tip of a slender object i e the hc location moves towards the object rear according to eq 1 triantafyllou and hover 2003 1 x ch c n x ch c l cos δ x f a fin a r c n c l cos δ a fin a r where x ch and x ch are the distances from hc to the object tip for objects without and with rear fins respectively c n is the drag coefficient in the transverse direction i e perpendicular to the vertical direction c l is the lift coefficient based on the fin planform area δ is the tilt angle from the object shaft to the vertical direction x f is the distance from the fin center to the object tip a fin is the fin planform area and a r is the reference area which is usually selected as the frontal area of the object the lift coefficient can be expressed as eq 2 triantafyllou and hover 2003 2 c l π 2 λ sin δ where λ is the fin aspect ratio which is usually expressed as λ w f 2 a fin where w f is the fin width of the object caution must be exercised that eqs 1 and 2 are justly suitable for slender objects and have been used to estimate the directional stability of torpedo anchors and dpas fernandes et al 2005 2011 hasanloo et al 2012 li et al 2014 for the gia and hybrid anchors with much complex geometries in this study the above equations may be inappropriate however eqs 1 and 2 still have references to the design of the booster equation 1 indicates that x ch is increased with increasing c l x f and a fin therefore enlarging the fin size and thus a fin is a direct approach to improve the directional stability in addition for fins with the same planform area it is more efficient to increase the fin aspect ratio λ and thus an increase in c l to improve the directional stability recently fernandes et al 2005 and li et al 2014 have reported that a symmetrical ring around the rear fins can improve the directional stability for torpedo anchors to a great extent this is consistent with the estimations by the theoretical formula in eq 1 as the fin planform area a fin is significantly increased by adding a symmetrical ring it can be summarized from the literature above that the anchor directional stability is improved by 1 enlarging the rear fin size 2 enlarging the fin aspect ratio and 3 adding a symmetrical ring around the rear fins 3 experimental tests details 3 1 experimental program the model tests were performed in a cylindrical plexiglass tank which has internal dimensions of 8 height 0 78 inner diameter m the tank was filled with fresh water two groups of model tests were performed the first group was used to investigate the terminal velocity and drag coefficient of the gia and hybrid anchors and the second one was used to investigate the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors the anchor terminal velocity in the first group was recorded by a high speed camera the directional stability of a gia is affected by many parameters such as weight center of gravity hydrodynamic center and its structural style previous studies indicate that a gia may deviate from the vertical direction during free fall in water hasanloo et al 2012 o loughlin et al 2016 liu and zhang 2017 the anchor will be subjected to water transverse force in the horizontal direction once there exists an included angle i e δ in fig 3 between the anchor shaft and the vertical direction resulting in a reduction in anchor terminal velocity for instance liu and zhang 2017 conducted numerical simulations of omni max anchor free fall in water for the omni max anchor see fig 1 c with a length of 9 2 m fluke width of 2 0 m fluke thickness of 0 2 m and weight of 60 5 t at the free fall distance of 60 m the tilt angle was 2 2 when the loading arm was in line with one pair of flukes and 5 9 when the loading arm was between two paris of flukes to avoid anchor deviation a guiding line was used to restrict the anchor motion trajectory in the vertical direction fig 4 the 0 8 mm diameter guiding line was made of smooth wire with its one end fixed to the center of the tank base and the other end connected to the fixed bar located right above the tank center the guiding wire was pretensioned to 500 n to avoid large deflection when a transverse force which is caused by the anchor deviation during free fall in water was acting on the wire a load cell was in series with the guiding wire to monitor the tension on the wire as shown in fig 4 two small rings parallel to the anchor shaft were glued to the anchor surface the guiding wire was threaded through the holes of the rings thus the anchor is forced to fall vertically to study the directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors the guiding wire was removed and the anchor fall history in water was recorded by a motion tracing device mtd the anchor acceleration velocity fall distance together with the anchor tilt angle in water could be determined simultaneously 3 2 model anchors fig 5 shows the anchor models in the present study all the anchor models were made of stainless steel the gia in fig 5 a has a profile that is similar to the omni max anchor shelton 2007 however the fluke thickness was lager relative to other dimensions of the anchor due to the size of the model anchor hence the gia in this study may exhibit different hydrodynamic characteristics from that of the prototype of omni max anchor the primary dimensions of the gia are listed in table 1 fig 5 b shows the booster model in this study the booster model is comprised with three parts the booster rear the middle sleeve and the shaft the booster rear features three slots separated 120 in plane such that rear fins with different sizes could be inserted into the slots a symmetrical ring could be added to the outside of the fins as depicted in fig 5 b the booster sleeve which connected the booster rear and shaft together was used to house the mtd three booster shafts with different aspect ratios were designed to investigate the effect of booster weight on the impact velocity of hybrid anchors the three boosters are termed as b0 5 b1 0 and b1 5 respectively for instance b0 5 represents the booster weight is approximately 0 5 times the weight of the gia 3 3 velocity measurement techniques 3 3 1 high speed camera the anchor motion history in the water column was measured by two approaches the high speed camera and the mtd the high speed camera eosens mini2 was placed 1 4 m in front of the water tank see fig 4 and near the bottom of the water tank to measure the anchor terminal velocity but 0 9 m above the bottom to avoid bottom boundary effect the frame frequency of the camera was set as 670 hz which may be enough high to obtain adequate accuracy given that the anchor fall velocity was 3 5 m s in model tests the fall distance between two recorded photos with the time interval of 1 5 ms was 5 25 mm which was only 3 of the anchor length h a 181 mm as listed in table 1 3 3 2 motion tracing device the anchor whole falling history and the anchor tilt angle could not be determined by the high speed camera therefore the mtd which is capable of measuring accelerations and regular velocities in three orthogonal axes was used to record the anchor motion history in water the mtd shown in fig 6 is comprised of a circuit board and a 3 v lithium battery a microcontroller a memory card and a six degree inertial senor icm 20602 by invensense are integrated on the circuit board the sensor icm 20602 which is sealed in a small 3 3 0 75 mm package includes a three axis gyroscope and a three axis accelerometer with full scale ranges of 2000 dps and 16g respectively the mtd battery included has dimensions of 42 length 20 width 3 thickness mm and weighs only 5 g due to its low cost small size and light weight the mtd can be widely applied to model tests associated with dynamic problems such as the anchor free fall in water and dynamic penetration within the soil in the present model tests the mtd was housed in the booster sleeve as shown in fig 5 b and the sampling frequency was set as 1000 hz after tests the data was outputted by the outputting device as shown in fig 6 b the inertial sensor sealed in the mtd is based on the principle of microelectromechanical systems mems and has been used to measure the dynamic penetration processes for torpedo anchors deplas and free fall penetrometers blake et al 2016 chow et al 2017 hossain et al 2015 o loughlin et al 2016 the working principle of the inertial sensor has been explained by blake et al 2016 if the anchor moves in the vertical direction i e z axis in fig 6 c the anchor fall velocity and fall distance are obtained by integrating the measured vertical acceleration once and twice respectively to simplify the expression in the present study two frames are established the body frame based on the mtd which moves together with the anchor model i e x b y b z b frame and the inertial frame which is fixed in space i e x y z frame if the anchor deviates from the vertical direction as shown in fig 6 c the transformation matrices should be used to transform the acceleration and regular velocity components from the body frame to the inertial frame the transformed procedures can be referred to fossen 2011 and blake et al 2016 and are not repeated herein the body frame is coincident with the inertial frame before releasing the anchor after release the anchor falls freely in water and the anchor shaft gradually deviates from the vertical direction during which the body frame exhibits translation and rotation simultaneously with the anchor given that any point in the body frame has the coordinates x b y b z b the corresponding coordinates in the inertial frame x y z can be derived by eq 3 3 x y z cos θ b cos ψ b cos θ b sin ψ b sin θ b cos ϕ b sin ψ b sin ϕ b sin θ b cos ψ b cos ϕ b cos ψ b sin ϕ b sin θ b sin ψ b sin ϕ b cos θ b sin ϕ b sin ψ b cos ϕ b sin θ b cos ψ b sin ϕ b cos ψ b cos ϕ b sin θ b sin ψ b cos ϕ b cos θ b x b y b z b x o b y o b z o b where ϕ b θ b and ψ b are anchor rotation angles about the body frame axes of x b y b and z b respectively x o b y o b z o b are the coordinates of point o b in the inertial frame the rotation angles of ϕ b θ b and ψ b can be obtained by integrating the angular velocities recorded by the mtd as mentioned previously the tilt angle from the anchor shaft to the vertical orientation δ can be used to characterize the anchor directional stability with the same fall distance a large tilt angle denotes a poor directional stability the anchor tilt angle δ is the included angle between z b axis and z axis i e the induced angle between vector o a and vector o b a b as shown in fig 6 c which can be expressed by eq 4 4 δ cos 1 o a o b a b o a o b a b where o a is the vector from point o to point a and o b a b is the vector from point o b to point a b the coordinates of point a b can be transformed from the body frame to the inertial frame by using eq 3 to simplification the point a b and point a are usually selected as the anchor tip point as depicted in fig 6 c in summary the anchor terminal velocity and hence the drag coefficient were determined by the high speed camera due to the easy operation and the directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors was measured by the mtd 4 testing results 4 1 experimental cases a total of 15 model tests were carried out in the water tank as listed in table 2 the anchor models are identified by anchor type booster shaft and booster rear see fig 5 b the anchor types are a for gia and h for hybrid anchor i e gia with a booster the numbers attached to h represent the three boosters shafts of b0 5 b1 0 and b1 5 weighing 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 times of the gia the booster rears include two shapes f for rear fin and r for rear ring and the numbers attached to the booster rear are the ratio of the fin width to the anchor fluke width and the ratio of the ring diameter to the anchor fluke width the extra lower case letters at the end of the term indicate a for gia loading arm in line with one pair of flukes b for gia loading arm in the middle of two pairs of flukes c for anchor with an attached chain and h for booster with a high ring as the plate shaped gia is primarily comprised of three thin plates it is difficult for the mtd to be directly sealed within the gia without altering the plate thickness therefore to study the free fall characteristics of the gia a larger gia i e gial for case 3 in table 2 was manufactured that is 1 67 times larger in all dimensions than the gia model used in other tests see table 1 thus the volume and weight of the gial is 4 6 times of the normal gia the mtd was sealed on the small booster of b0 5 and attached to the gial since the small booster has a weight of 0 5 times of the normal gia model the small booster only has 10 of the total weight of the gial b0 5 with small booster the small portion of the booster size and weight in this combination can ensure that the booster effect is limited hence the mtd data largely represent the performance of the gia as a base case a0 except for case a0 all the other tests were performed by using the normal gia model with dimensions as shown in table 1 and its matching boosters the anchors in the cases 3 to 8 2 in table 2 were tested using two measurement techniques first the high speed camera was used to determine the anchor terminal velocity when the anchor was falling vertically guided by a vertical guiding wire then the guiding wire was removed and the mtd was used to record the anchor velocity and anchor tilt angle when the anchor was free fall in water 4 2 typical experimental results the case h1 0 f1 0 c in group i was performed to mutually validate the data measured from the high speed camera and the mtd five photographs capturing the anchor locations in water are illustrated in fig 7 the fall velocities could be obtained by the anchor fall distances and the corresponding time intervals fig 8 depicts the whole free fall history for case h1 0 f1 0 c by the mtd the hybrid anchor was initially hanging in the water when time t 0 the anchor was released and started to accelerate in water the maximum acceleration of 8 5 m s2 9 81 m s2 is due to the buoyancy force of anchor and the added mass the anchor acceleration decreases monotonically after release due to the drag force which is proportional to the squared velocity when a z 0 it denotes that the drag force is equal to the anchor submerged weight after that the anchor maintains a constant velocity which is termed as the terminal velocity however the anchor velocity decreases reversely after reaching peak as shown in fig 8 a this is caused by the attached chains which will be discussed later fig 8 b illustrates the relationship of the anchor vertical velocity against fall distance the fall velocities derived from the high speed camera consist well with that obtained from the mtd which indicates the two approaches are both practicable note that each case was carried out twice and the repeated one matched well with the first one therefore only one test result in each case was depicted in the present study for simplification 5 free fall process of the gia in water 5 1 terminal velocity and drag coefficient of the gia the terminal velocities for case a0 a for the gia with its loading arm in line with one pair of flukes and a0 b for the gia anchor with its loading arm placed between two pairs of flukes are 3 48 and 3 34 m s respectively the maximum velocity for case a0 a 3 48 m s is lower than that for case h1 0 f1 0 c 4 18 m s indicating that the terminal velocity of the gia is indeed increased by adding a booster the water drag force acting on the anchor f d can be expressed as eq 5 5 f d 1 2 c d ρ w a f v z 2 where c d is the drag coefficient ρ w is the water density a f is the anchor frontal area i e the anchor projected area in the plane perpendicular to anchor shaft v z is the anchor vertical velocity when f d is equal to the anchor submerged weight wʹ the anchor velocity reaches the terminal velocity v t therefore the drag coefficient can be derived by eq 6 6 c d w 0 5 ρ w a f v t 2 the drag coefficients of case a0 a and a0 b are 0 87 and 0 81 respectively based on eq 6 relative to the case a0 a the lower drag coefficient for case a0 b with a lower terminal velocity is due to the increased frontal area by the in between location of the loading arm the drag coefficient of the gia against reynolds number re as expressed by eq 7 is illustrated in fig 9 a 7 re v z d eff ρ w μ where d eff 4a f π is the anchor equivalent diameter and μ is the water dynamic viscosity 5 2 terminal velocity and drag coefficient of hybrid anchors as shown in fig 9 b the terminal velocity of the gia increases with increased anchor mass due to the additional mass of the booster for instance the terminal velocity of the gia i e without a booster is 3 48 m s and the terminal velocity is increased to 3 98 m s 4 41 m s and 4 84 m s for hybrid anchors h0 5 r2 h1 0 r2 and h1 5 r2 respectively at the same time the anchor terminal velocity decreases with increasing fin width and ring diameter of the booster this can be explained by the plot of anchor drag coefficients in fig 9 c that are determined by eq 6 from fig 9 c it can be seen that the drag coefficient increases with increasing fin width and ring diameter height thus fig 9 shows that a booster with lower fin width and ring diameter can provide lower drag coefficient hence higher terminal velocity however since the drag coefficients of all model anchors i e a and h are within a fairly narrow range of 0 87 1 08 the increase in the terminal velocity by adding a booster is significant for all booster 5 3 theoretical prediction of the gia free fall in water the equilibrium equation characterizing the anchor free fall in water can be expressed as eq 8 8 w m m a z 1 2 c d ρ w v z 2 a f where m is the anchor mass and m is the added mass the added mass is the inertia added to a system due to the accelerating body moving through a fluid for slender projectiles in water such as torpedo anchors and omni max anchors the added mass can be very small o beirne et al 2014 shelton et al 2011 thus it can be approximated as m 0 as such the anchor drag coefficient can be calculated by eq 8 based on the anchor acceleration measured by the mtd for the case a0 see table 2 the anchor drag coefficient and the anchor acceleration against the anchor free fall time and distance in water and the corresponding reynolds number are plotted in fig 10 a it can be seen that the anchor acceleration increases sharply at the beginning and then decreases with its free fall time and distance to zero where the anchor reaches its terminal velocity during this free fall process the anchor velocity increases with time hence its reynolds number at the same time the anchor s drag coefficient decreases with increasing reynolds number when re 1 4 105 and then it remains constant c d 0 87 with further increase of the reynolds number when re 1 4 105 however over the entire anchor free fall process in water the anchor drag coefficient varies in a narrow range i e c d 1 4 0 87 within the initial short time t 0 16 s and short distance s z 0 11 m thus the constant drag coefficient based on the terminal velocity by eq 6 should be able to provide reasonable estimate on the anchor velocity the added mass term in eq 8 can be expressed as m c m ρ w v where c m is the added mass coefficient and v is the anchor volume given that c m 0 02 which is quite low value the corresponding anchor drag coefficient can also be determined by eq 8 and the result is also plotted in fig 10 a it can be seen that the drag coefficient is much lower during the initial free fall process compared with the constant drag coefficient of 0 87 the low drag coefficient during the anchor initial free fall stage is caused from the high overestimation of the added mass term in eq 8 this also demonstrates that the added mass term is rather small and hence it can be ignored fig 10 b displays the comparison between the measured anchor velocity and the estimated one by eq 8 under the assumptions of m 0 and c d constant during its free fall in water it can be seen that the estimated anchor velocity matches the measured one very well this demonstrates that the two assumptions of m 0 and c d constant are reasonable for eq 8 6 working efficiency of booster 6 1 directional stability of the gia the anchor deviation from anchor shaft to the vertical direction may be caused from both internal and external factors the internal factors primarily include the anchor structure and the errors in manufacturing and the external factors include the location of the attached chain the disturbance in releasing the anchor the sea currents and other uncertain factors caused by the sea environment therefore in practical applications it is with difficulty to avoid the anchor from deviating from the vertical direction in the present model tests the anchor directional stability is evaluated by the anchor tilt angle from the anchor shaft to the vertical direction i e δ in fig 3 the anchor with poor directional stability results in a larger tilt angle corresponding to the same fall distance fernandes et al 2011 recommended that the tilt angle should be within 3 for torpedo anchors to penetrate into the seabed effectively hence in the present study δ 3 is selected as the critical angle for stable gia and hybrid anchors however in practical applications a small tilt angle may be difficult to monitor and maintain due to many uncontrolled factors the anchor entrance angle to the seabed could be a better measure the fall velocity with δ 3 is adopted as the impact velocity v 0 similarly the anchor fall distance with δ 3 is considered as the release height h e it can be seen from fig 11 a that anchor tilt angle increases gradually with increasing fall velocity for a large tilt angle the gia cannot be dynamically embedded within the seabed or the final penetration depth may be significantly decreased fig 11 a shows that the anchor velocity continuously increases with δ 3 indicating the anchor still accelerates in water the impact velocity of the gia is approximately 4 16 m s however the terminal velocity of the gia back calculated from eq 6 is 4 87 m s indicating the anchor has not reached the terminal velocity with δ 3 the dimensionless fall distance s z h a in fig 11 b indicates s z h a 6 29 with δ 3 fig 11 c depicts the fall trajectory of the gia the anchor trajectory is not confined in a certain plane whereas it is a complex three dimensional 3 d curve as mentioned previously the anchor structure plays a significant role on the directional stability the location of the hc may be lower than gc relative to the anchor tip thus the moment m forces the anchor to further deviate with increasing fall distance see fig 11 c 6 2 effect of booster fin width on the anchor directional stability fig 12 shows the fall histories of hybrid anchors of cases h0 5 f1 0 h1 0 f1 0 and h1 5 f1 0 from group ii in table 2 in these three cases the fin width of the booster is approximately equal to the fluke width of the gia i e w b w a the impact velocities are 2 72 3 31 and 4 14 m s and the fall distance ratios are 3 05 4 70 and 7 93 for hybrid anchors of h0 5 h1 0 and h1 5 respectively with δ 3 the fall distance ratio of h0 5 s z h a 3 05 is lower than that of gia in case a0 s z h a 6 29 indicating the anchor directional stability is deteriorated by adding booster b0 5 however for hybrid anchor h1 5 the velocity and fall distance ratio are both increased compared to that of the gia therefore a booster with long aspect ratio and large weight is more efficient in increasing the anchor impact velocity and the release height to improve the directional stability of hybrid anchors the booster fin width was increased to 1 5 times the anchor fluke width the effect of fin width on the fall history of hybrid anchor h1 0 is shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that the anchor impact velocity is increased from 3 31 to 3 61 m s and the fall distance ratio is increased from 4 70 to 6 22 by enlarging the fin width from 1 0 to 1 5 times the fluke width of the gia although the directional stability of the hybrid anchor h1 0 is improved to a certain extent with wider rear fins the hybrid anchor is still instable 6 3 effect of ring on anchor directional stability to further improve the anchor directional stability a symmetrical ring can be added to the outside of the rear fins of the booster fig 13 also illustrates the motion history of h1 0 with a symmetrical ring ring diameter d r 2w a ring height h r h r the anchor impact velocity is significantly increased from 3 31 to 3 89 m s and the fall distance ratio is increased from 4 70 to 9 70 for hybrid anchor h1 0 with a symmetrical ring indicating that the directional stability exhibits a remarkable improved with a ring though the frontal area for h1 0 is increased by adding a symmetrical ring as shown in fig 13 b the impact velocity is still increased this is attributed to the improved stability and thus increased release height fig 14 shows the motion histories of hybrid anchors with a symmetrical ring around the rear fins of the booster i e cases h0 5 r2 h1 0 r2 and h1 5 r2 from group ii in table 2 with ring diameter d r 2w a and ring height h r h r the comparison between figs 12 and 14 indicates that the anchor impact velocity is increased from 2 72 to 3 48 m s and the fall distance ratio is increased from 3 05 to 7 55 for hybrid anchor h0 5 with a symmetrical ring therefore the anchor directional stability is improved notably with a symmetrical ring around the booster rear fins as shown in fig 14 b all the release distance ratios for the hybrid anchors are larger than that of the gia indicating the added booster is beneficial in improving the anchor directional stability the following studies aim at investigating the ring height and diameter on the directional stability of hybrid anchors the influences of the ring height on the impact velocity and fall distance are illustrated in fig 15 it can be seen from fig 15 that the fall distance ratio increases from 9 70 to 12 41 by using a higher ring ring height h r 50 mm 1 5h r for h1 0 whereas the fall distance ratios for h1 5 with different ring heights show minor discrepancy in the overall level increasing the ring height has limited influence in improving the directional stability the above model tests indicate that the gia and hybrid anchors are instable since the tilt angle exhibits an infinite increasing trend moreover the anchor still accelerates with δ 3 because the anchor velocity increases continuously with δ 3 the ring diameter was enlarged to three times the fluke width of the gia i e d r 3w a cases h1 0 r3 and h1 5 r3 from group ii in table 2 to investigate the effects of ring diameter on the impact velocity and directional stability of hybrid anchors as shown in fig 16 fig 16 a shows that the anchor impact velocity with δ 3 has reached the terminal velocity which is due to the increased fall distance as shown in fig 16 b it can be seen from fig 16 b that the fall distance ratio increases from 9 70 to 20 97 for h1 0 and 12 10 to 25 07 for h1 5 by using a wider ring with diameter d r 3w a the kinetic energy 1 2 m v 0 2 for a hybrid anchor is increased due to two factors the additional mass and the increased impact velocity by adding a booster the additional energy ensures the anchor to penetrate deeper within seabed preliminary studies in relation to the working efficiency of the booster on the final penetration depth of the gia anchor has been reported by liu and zhang 2017a by numerical simulations based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach in their numerical simulations the anchor soil interface was modeled as fully rough i e the frictional adhesion was set as 1 0 and the soil undrained shear strength s u 2 4 3z kpa the penetration depth ratio i e z e h a was 1 0 for the gia with an impact velocity of 20 m s for the same impact velocity of 20 m s the penetration depth ratio was increased from 1 0 to 1 3 with booster b1 0 indicating the additional weight of the booster can help the anchor to be embedded deeper into soils moreover the impact velocity is also increased attributed to the booster as illustrated in fig 16 a with an increased impact velocity of 25 m s the penetration depth ratio could reach 1 5 for hybrid anchor h1 0 the additional penetration depth is caused from both the additional kinetic and potential energies with the aid of a booster fig 16 c shows the trajectory of h1 5 with a wider ring diameter d r 3w a the anchor horizontal distance is within 0 2 m corresponding to a vertical distance of approximately 7 5 m indicating the anchor directional stability is greatly improved if the anchor is stable the hc location is higher than gc about the anchor tip when the anchor is tilt the moment m will force the anchor to turn back to the vertical direction see fig 16 c fig 16 b shows that the variation trend of the tilt angle with the fall distance becomes gentle with δ 3 for hybrid anchors with a wider ring d r 3w a whereas the tilt angle increases approximately linearly with the fall distance with δ 3 for hybrid anchors with a smaller ring d r 2w a however more details in relation to the anchor motion history could not be derived due to the height limitation of the water tank to systematically investigate the directional stability of the hybrid anchors further numerical simulations based on the cfd approach are planned from the current physical testing it is found that enlarging the fin width and ring diameter of the booster is beneficial in improving the directional stability of the hybrid anchor however at the same time the anchor terminal velocity experiences a reduction with larger fin width and ring diameter as shown in fig 9 b therefore further numerical simulations are needed to optimize the booster shape and size to ensure the directional stability of the hybrid anchor and to maintain a high terminal velocity as well 7 effect of attached chains on anchor impact velocity 7 1 chain drag coefficient the anchor fall velocity is reduced due to the drag force acting on the attached chains cenac 2011 fernandes et al 2005 o beirne et al 2017 however the chain drag force and thus the drag coefficient have not been systematically studied in the present study drag coefficients for both linked chain and rope were investigated the model chain has a nominal diameter the diameter of the bar from which the chain is fabricated of d bar 1 5 mm and the rope diameter is d 3 0 mm as depicted in fig 17 a the chain and rope weigh 37 and 9 g m respectively the chain rope was dragged behind the anchor fig 17 b and the anchor was released by burning out the fishing line connected to the chain rear allowing the anchor and chain to fall freely in the water tank the resistances acting on the anchor and chain are illustrated in fig 17 c the relationships of the chain submerged weight w c the chain drag force f dc the anchor submerged weight wʹ and the anchor drag force f d can be expressed as eq 9 9 m m c a z w w c f d f dc where m and m c are the anchor mass and chain mass respectively the chain drag force can be determined based on eq 9 and the chain drag coefficient can be derived by eq 10 10 c dc f dc 1 2 ρ w a fc v z 2 f dc 1 2 ρ w π d c eff l c v z 2 the drag force acting on the chain is dominated by the frictional resistance as opposed to the pressure resistance due to the large aspect ratio l c d bar or l c d 1 l c is the chain length of the chain following the study by o beirne et al 2017 the chain was modeled as an equivalent chain diameter d c eff calculated by considering a unit cylindrical length with the same volume as the same unit of chain for the rope the equivalent chain diameter is equal to the rope diameter i e d c eff d based on the chain dimensions as shown in fig 17 a the chain equivalent diameter is d c eff 2 4 mm therefore the chain characteristic area is defined as a fc πd c eff l c for the chain and a fc πdl c for the rope in which the chain length is taken into consideration to determine the drag coefficients for chain and rope four case studies were conducted by using different chain types and different chain lengths table 3 the booster b1 5f1 0 was adopted herein the booster weighs 673 5 g and its drag coefficient c d 0 297 which was predetermined based on the recorded data from the mtd based on eqs 9 and 10 the drag coefficients for chain and rope are 0 02 and 0 01 respectively table 3 shows that the chain drag coefficient is independent on the chain length as the chain length has been divided in eq 10 this also indicates that the chain drag force increases linearly with chain length 7 2 chain effective length in practical implementation the attached chains are usually not released from the installation vehicle above the seawater surface to avoid excessive drag force acting on the chain brandão et al 2006 instead a segment of chain is pre released to the seabed surface as shown in figs 1 a and 2 this method has been applied to torpedo anchors dpas and omni max anchors brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2009 omni max brochure 2011 therefore the hanging chain from the padeye to the dip down point where the chain profile is between lying on the mudline and hanging in water may move together with the anchor during free fall in water the photographs in fig 7 show that a segment of chain from padeye to the demarcation point i e the highest point on the chain is dragged behind the anchor moving with the same velocity as the anchor the other segment of chain from the demarcation point to the ddp exhibits slack profiles the chain effective length l eff is defined as the distance from the padeye to the demarcation point in which the chain moves with the same speed as the anchor to investigate the chain effective length case h1 0 f1 0 c was conducted and the results have been depicted in figs 7 8 fig 8 shows that the anchor firstly accelerates in water nevertheless the anchor acceleration becomes negative and the velocity reduces reversely after reaching the peak velocity this is caused by the increase in the chain effective length and thus the chain drag force the effective chain length can be determined from the equilibrium equation in eq 9 which is rewritten as eq 11 where the m c per is the chain mass in per length 11 l eff w w c m a z f d m c per a z 1 2 c dc ρ w v z 2 π d bar the chain effective length against the anchor fall distance is illustrated in fig 18 the chain effective length can be expressed as l eff 0 614s z by using linearly empirical formula and l eff 0 34 s z 1 35 by using power typed empirical formula enlarging the anchor release height is the precondition to gain a high impact velocity whereas it may lead to a large chain drag force which inversely reduces the anchor impact velocity therefore it is reasonable to be assumed that a critical release height is required for the anchor to obtain a maximum impact velocity 7 3 case study a case study was conducted in this section to investigate the chain effect on anchor velocity the hybrid anchor h1 0 with ring diameter of d r 3w a i e h1 0 r3 was used herein it can be seen from fig 16 that a distance ratio of s z h a 20 was needed for the hybrid anchor to reach terminal velocity v t 4 02 m s the drag coefficient of h1 0 r3 is 1 04 as shown in fig 9 c determined based on the terminal velocity from the high speed camera four different chain nominal diameters d bar 0 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 mm respectively were adopted to study the chain effect on the anchor fall velocity as shown in fig 19 based on eq 11 in eq 11 the chain mass was calculated by m c m c per l eff and the chain drag force was calculated by f dc 1 2 c d ρ w v z 2 π d bar l eff where the chain effective length l eff 0 34 s z 1 35 based on the fitting formula in fig 18 the maximum velocity and its corresponding fall distance ratio are also depicted in fig 19 and both of them decrease with increasing chain diameters when the anchor moves further the anchor velocity starts to reduce as the chain drag force increases with increasing release height as shown in fig 19 therefore the release height should be accurately estimated to ensure the anchor to obtain the maximum impact velocity for instance with chain diameter d c 2 5 mm the release height ratio for the hybrid anchor h1 0 should be within 14 5 8 conclusions the present work put forward an innovative booster concept with the aim of increasing the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia free fall tests were conducted to investigate the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors the primary conclusions are summarized following 1 the anchor tilt angle from the anchor shaft to the vertical orientation is deduced in this study i e eq 4 based on the measured data from the mtd the anchor tilt angle combined with the anchor trajectory can be used to characterize the anchor directional stability 2 the terminal velocities are 3 48 and 3 34 m s for gias with loading arm in line with one pair of flukes and between two pairs of flukes respectively thus in practical applications the loading arm should be in line with one pair of flukes to increase the anchor impact velocity 3 both impact velocity and directional stability of the gia are improved by adding booster the booster with a rear ring provides more significant improvement on the anchor directional stability when adding boosters of b1 0 and b1 5 with a large rear fin r3 the anchor impact velocity can be improved by 16 and 26 respectively at the same time the anchor stable fall distances were increased to 21h a and 25h a for hybrid anchors h1 0 and h1 5 respectively 4 the anchor velocity is reduced by the attached chains the drag coefficients for the chain and rope are 0 02 and 0 01 respectively with reynolds number ranging 1 32 105 1 6 105 when estimating the anchor impact velocity it is necessary to take the chain effect into consideration 5 the anchor free fall velocity in water can be predicted by using the theoretical model based on the second newton s law i e eqs 8 and 9 which provides an efficient approach to predict the anchor impact velocity for a given release height moreover the booster concept may provide a reference for the installation of plate anchors in the future further investigations such as the optimization of the booster shape the effect of the attached chains on anchor directional stability the booster working efficiency on the anchor final penetration depth within the seabed and so forth are conducted and will be published in the future acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51479027 51539008 and the national key research

23393,the plate shaped gravity installed anchor gia provides a potential alternative to deepwater mooring systems as its dynamic installation and diving behavior however the anchor final penetration depth in seabed soils especially in soils with high strength gradient is relatively shallow due to the limited impact velocity and large contact area between the anchor and the surrounding soil an innovative booster concept is put forward in this study to increase the anchor final penetration depth by increasing the kinetic energy during free fall in water and gravitational energy during dynamic penetration within seabed the booster is attached to the rear of the anchor during installation and can be retrieved after installation for reuse the present study performed model tests with the aim of investigating the working efficiency of booster on the impact velocity of the gia during free fall in the water column a mini motion tracing device mtd is developed to record the anchor free fall history in water the hydrodynamic characteristics including the terminal velocity drag coefficient and directional stability for the gia were studied a series of experimental cases were subsequently conducted to study the effects of the adding booster on the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia the testing results demonstrated that both the directional stability and the release height can be improved for the gia with a booster thus the anchor impact velocity is increased the anchor kinetic energy is significantly increased due to the additional mass and increased impact velocity by the booster which ensures the anchor to be embedded deeper within seabed keywords gravity installed anchor impact velocity booster directional stability hydrodynamic characteristics

is released from a predetermined height above the soil surface i e h e in fig 1 a allowing it to gain velocity during free fall in the water column before impacting into the seabed the anchor velocity at the mudline is termed the impact velocity v 0 subsequently the anchor penetrates within the seabed by its kinetic energy gained through free fall in water and the gravitational energy a higher anchor final penetration depth i e the embedment depth from anchor tip to the mudline z e in fig 1 a mobilizes higher capacity as typical seabed soils are characterized by increasing soil strength with depth richardson et al 2009 torpedo anchors and deep penetrating anchors dpas are the most common gias which feature an ellipsoidal or conical tip and three or four rear fins fig 1 b the omni max anchor is another gia design which features three pairs of flukes and a loading arm fig 1 c each pair of flukes is comprised of a larger top fluke and a smaller tip one the loading arm which can rotate freely around the anchor shaft is located towards the anchor tip compared to torpedo anchors or dpas the omni max anchor is a plate shaped gia and has large surface area shelton et al 2011 the large surface area provides a large contact area between the anchor and its surrounding soil hence the capacity efficiency is relatively high however the large surface area of the anchor will result in a low impact velocity and low penetration depth within the seabed for instance field testing results indicate that the impact velocity of the omni max anchor is usually limited to 19 m s with a released height of 30 m zimmerman et al 2009 whereas the impact velocity of dpas could reach 24 5 27 m s lieng et al 2010 a low impact velocity and hence a low kinetic energy results in a reduction in anchor final penetration depth furthermore the final penetration depth of the omni max anchor is confined due to the large contact area between the anchor and the surrounding soil during dynamic installation zimmerman et al 2009 reported that the average penetration depth ratio i e the ratio of anchor final penetration depth to anchor length z e h a was 1 77 for 54 field tests in the gulf of mexico in addition the anchor final penetration depth reduces drastically in strong soils with high strength gradient numerical simulations indicated the anchor penetration depth ratio was 0 87 1 14 with soil strength gradient k 3 kpa m and impact velocity v 0 15 25 m s kim and hossain 2015 liu et al 2016 liu and zhang 2017a centrifuge testing results indicated the anchor penetration depth ratio was 1 14 1 46 with k 3 3 kpa m and v 0 20 53 29 39 m s however for torpedo anchors and dpas the anchor penetration depth ratio is relatively high and it ranged 1 5 2 9 in kaolin clay from centrifuge results o loughlin et al 2004 2009 richardson et al 2009 hossain et al 2014 and 1 5 2 6 from field results de araujo et al 2004 lieng et al 2010 o beirne et al 2014 generally the final penetration depth of a plate shaped gia is relatively low compared to that of a torpedo shaped gia therefore this study put forward an innovative booster concept which aims at improving the impact velocity and directional stability of the plate shaped gia in water and increasing the anchor final penetration depth embedded within seabed to investigate the booster working efficiency model tests simulating the anchor free fall process in water were performed in the model tests a plate shaped gia which has the profile similar to the omni max anchor was used the effects of the booster on both the directional stability and impact velocity of the gia were systematically studied the testing results are beneficial in design and engineering application furthermore the booster concept may provide a reference for the installation of plate anchors 2 booster concept 2 1 anchor installation process with a booster the booster concept is mainly generated from the launching of satellites into space using a rocket the similar method has been used to install suction embedded plate anchors seplas and dynamically embedded plate anchors deplas with a suction caisson and a slender cylindrical shaft respectively dove et al 1998 o loughlin et al 2014 the booster is designed with the aim of improving the impact velocity and directional stability in water and the final penetration depth within seabed for the plate shaped gia the booster is attached to the rear of the gia during dynamic installation and can be retrieved after installation for reuse the installation cost is increased due to the transportation and retrieve of the booster whereas the benefit of the booster on the anchor impact velocity and thus final penetration depth in soils can outweigh the considerable increased cost the installation process of the gia with a booster is depicted in fig 2 the dynamic installation process including the free fall stage in water and the dynamic penetration stage in soils is similar to the installation process of gias after installation the booster is pulled out by tensing the retrieval line at the booster rear a shear pin is adopted to connect the cylindrical bar located at the rear of the anchor and the reserved slot at the booster tip permitting the anchor shaft center in line with the booster shaft center the shear pin is failure when the pullout load is in excess of its limited load causing the booster to be pulled out and the anchor to be remained in soils 2 2 booster design details similar to the geometry of a dpa or torpedo anchor the booster is comprised with a slender shaft and three rear fins which are separated by 120 in plane fig 2 the torpedo shaped booster is capable of reducing the water drag force as previous studies have demonstrated that a torpedo anchor has a lower drag coefficient compared to that of a plate shaped gia freeman et al 1984 øye 2000 o loughlin et al 2013 cenac 2011 liu and zhang 2017 moreover the pullout capacity of booster is relatively low as its capacity is primarily provided by the frictional resistance at the booster soil interface some design details associated with the booster are emphasized in the following the booster is designed with an ellipsoidal tip to ensure smooth transitions of the water streamlines from the anchor rear to the booster the booster shaft is a slender cylinder the booster shaft can be manufactured with a hollow sleeve in which ballasted weight such as lead can be filled to reduce the location of the gravity center gc about the booster tip numerous investigations have demonstrated that reducing the position of gc relative to anchor tip could improve the directional stability for torpedo anchors and dpas to some extent fernandes et al 2005 2011 hasanloo et al 2012 li et al 2014 the booster is designed with a truncated cone shaped rear which is similar to the rear of the projectile in freeman et al 1984 the retracted rear can restrict the trailing vortex within a relative narrow region landau and lifshitz 1987 young et al 2010 leading to a reduction in drag force and thus an increase in impact velocity to improve the directional stability of the hybrid anchor i e gia with a booster the booster rear can be set with three rear fins triantafyllou and hover 2003 2 3 effect of rear fins on directional stability to maintain directional stability gc should be ahead of the hydrodynamic center hc about the tip for slender bodies triantafyllou and hover 2003 if the location of hc is lower than gc relative to the object tip as shown in fig 3 the moment m generated by the submerged weight w and water drag force f d forces the object to rotate even further once the object is tilt hence the object is instable however if the location of gc is lower than hc relative to the object tip the object is stable and the moment m will force the object to rotate to the vertical direction once the object is tilt the rear fins can enlarge the distance from hc to the tip of a slender object i e the hc location moves towards the object rear according to eq 1 triantafyllou and hover 2003 1 x ch c n x ch c l cos δ x f a fin a r c n c l cos δ a fin a r where x ch and x ch are the distances from hc to the object tip for objects without and with rear fins respectively c n is the drag coefficient in the transverse direction i e perpendicular to the vertical direction c l is the lift coefficient based on the fin planform area δ is the tilt angle from the object shaft to the vertical direction x f is the distance from the fin center to the object tip a fin is the fin planform area and a r is the reference area which is usually selected as the frontal area of the object the lift coefficient can be expressed as eq 2 triantafyllou and hover 2003 2 c l π 2 λ sin δ where λ is the fin aspect ratio which is usually expressed as λ w f 2 a fin where w f is the fin width of the object caution must be exercised that eqs 1 and 2 are justly suitable for slender objects and have been used to estimate the directional stability of torpedo anchors and dpas fernandes et al 2005 2011 hasanloo et al 2012 li et al 2014 for the gia and hybrid anchors with much complex geometries in this study the above equations may be inappropriate however eqs 1 and 2 still have references to the design of the booster equation 1 indicates that x ch is increased with increasing c l x f and a fin therefore enlarging the fin size and thus a fin is a direct approach to improve the directional stability in addition for fins with the same planform area it is more efficient to increase the fin aspect ratio λ and thus an increase in c l to improve the directional stability recently fernandes et al 2005 and li et al 2014 have reported that a symmetrical ring around the rear fins can improve the directional stability for torpedo anchors to a great extent this is consistent with the estimations by the theoretical formula in eq 1 as the fin planform area a fin is significantly increased by adding a symmetrical ring it can be summarized from the literature above that the anchor directional stability is improved by 1 enlarging the rear fin size 2 enlarging the fin aspect ratio and 3 adding a symmetrical ring around the rear fins 3 experimental tests details 3 1 experimental program the model tests were performed in a cylindrical plexiglass tank which has internal dimensions of 8 height 0 78 inner diameter m the tank was filled with fresh water two groups of model tests were performed the first group was used to investigate the terminal velocity and drag coefficient of the gia and hybrid anchors and the second one was used to investigate the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors the anchor terminal velocity in the first group was recorded by a high speed camera the directional stability of a gia is affected by many parameters such as weight center of gravity hydrodynamic center and its structural style previous studies indicate that a gia may deviate from the vertical direction during free fall in water hasanloo et al 2012 o loughlin et al 2016 liu and zhang 2017 the anchor will be subjected to water transverse force in the horizontal direction once there exists an included angle i e δ in fig 3 between the anchor shaft and the vertical direction resulting in a reduction in anchor terminal velocity for instance liu and zhang 2017 conducted numerical simulations of omni max anchor free fall in water for the omni max anchor see fig 1 c with a length of 9 2 m fluke width of 2 0 m fluke thickness of 0 2 m and weight of 60 5 t at the free fall distance of 60 m the tilt angle was 2 2 when the loading arm was in line with one pair of flukes and 5 9 when the loading arm was between two paris of flukes to avoid anchor deviation a guiding line was used to restrict the anchor motion trajectory in the vertical direction fig 4 the 0 8 mm diameter guiding line was made of smooth wire with its one end fixed to the center of the tank base and the other end connected to the fixed bar located right above the tank center the guiding wire was pretensioned to 500 n to avoid large deflection when a transverse force which is caused by the anchor deviation during free fall in water was acting on the wire a load cell was in series with the guiding wire to monitor the tension on the wire as shown in fig 4 two small rings parallel to the anchor shaft were glued to the anchor surface the guiding wire was threaded through the holes of the rings thus the anchor is forced to fall vertically to study the directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors the guiding wire was removed and the anchor fall history in water was recorded by a motion tracing device mtd the anchor acceleration velocity fall distance together with the anchor tilt angle in water could be determined simultaneously 3 2 model anchors fig 5 shows the anchor models in the present study all the anchor models were made of stainless steel the gia in fig 5 a has a profile that is similar to the omni max anchor shelton 2007 however the fluke thickness was lager relative to other dimensions of the anchor due to the size of the model anchor hence the gia in this study may exhibit different hydrodynamic characteristics from that of the prototype of omni max anchor the primary dimensions of the gia are listed in table 1 fig 5 b shows the booster model in this study the booster model is comprised with three parts the booster rear the middle sleeve and the shaft the booster rear features three slots separated 120 in plane such that rear fins with different sizes could be inserted into the slots a symmetrical ring could be added to the outside of the fins as depicted in fig 5 b the booster sleeve which connected the booster rear and shaft together was used to house the mtd three booster shafts with different aspect ratios were designed to investigate the effect of booster weight on the impact velocity of hybrid anchors the three boosters are termed as b0 5 b1 0 and b1 5 respectively for instance b0 5 represents the booster weight is approximately 0 5 times the weight of the gia 3 3 velocity measurement techniques 3 3 1 high speed camera the anchor motion history in the water column was measured by two approaches the high speed camera and the mtd the high speed camera eosens mini2 was placed 1 4 m in front of the water tank see fig 4 and near the bottom of the water tank to measure the anchor terminal velocity but 0 9 m above the bottom to avoid bottom boundary effect the frame frequency of the camera was set as 670 hz which may be enough high to obtain adequate accuracy given that the anchor fall velocity was 3 5 m s in model tests the fall distance between two recorded photos with the time interval of 1 5 ms was 5 25 mm which was only 3 of the anchor length h a 181 mm as listed in table 1 3 3 2 motion tracing device the anchor whole falling history and the anchor tilt angle could not be determined by the high speed camera therefore the mtd which is capable of measuring accelerations and regular velocities in three orthogonal axes was used to record the anchor motion history in water the mtd shown in fig 6 is comprised of a circuit board and a 3 v lithium battery a microcontroller a memory card and a six degree inertial senor icm 20602 by invensense are integrated on the circuit board the sensor icm 20602 which is sealed in a small 3 3 0 75 mm package includes a three axis gyroscope and a three axis accelerometer with full scale ranges of 2000 dps and 16g respectively the mtd battery included has dimensions of 42 length 20 width 3 thickness mm and weighs only 5 g due to its low cost small size and light weight the mtd can be widely applied to model tests associated with dynamic problems such as the anchor free fall in water and dynamic penetration within the soil in the present model tests the mtd was housed in the booster sleeve as shown in fig 5 b and the sampling frequency was set as 1000 hz after tests the data was outputted by the outputting device as shown in fig 6 b the inertial sensor sealed in the mtd is based on the principle of microelectromechanical systems mems and has been used to measure the dynamic penetration processes for torpedo anchors deplas and free fall penetrometers blake et al 2016 chow et al 2017 hossain et al 2015 o loughlin et al 2016 the working principle of the inertial sensor has been explained by blake et al 2016 if the anchor moves in the vertical direction i e z axis in fig 6 c the anchor fall velocity and fall distance are obtained by integrating the measured vertical acceleration once and twice respectively to simplify the expression in the present study two frames are established the body frame based on the mtd which moves together with the anchor model i e x b y b z b frame and the inertial frame which is fixed in space i e x y z frame if the anchor deviates from the vertical direction as shown in fig 6 c the transformation matrices should be used to transform the acceleration and regular velocity components from the body frame to the inertial frame the transformed procedures can be referred to fossen 2011 and blake et al 2016 and are not repeated herein the body frame is coincident with the inertial frame before releasing the anchor after release the anchor falls freely in water and the anchor shaft gradually deviates from the vertical direction during which the body frame exhibits translation and rotation simultaneously with the anchor given that any point in the body frame has the coordinates x b y b z b the corresponding coordinates in the inertial frame x y z can be derived by eq 3 3 x y z cos θ b cos ψ b cos θ b sin ψ b sin θ b cos ϕ b sin ψ b sin ϕ b sin θ b cos ψ b cos ϕ b cos ψ b sin ϕ b sin θ b sin ψ b sin ϕ b cos θ b sin ϕ b sin ψ b cos ϕ b sin θ b cos ψ b sin ϕ b cos ψ b cos ϕ b sin θ b sin ψ b cos ϕ b cos θ b x b y b z b x o b y o b z o b where ϕ b θ b and ψ b are anchor rotation angles about the body frame axes of x b y b and z b respectively x o b y o b z o b are the coordinates of point o b in the inertial frame the rotation angles of ϕ b θ b and ψ b can be obtained by integrating the angular velocities recorded by the mtd as mentioned previously the tilt angle from the anchor shaft to the vertical orientation δ can be used to characterize the anchor directional stability with the same fall distance a large tilt angle denotes a poor directional stability the anchor tilt angle δ is the included angle between z b axis and z axis i e the induced angle between vector o a and vector o b a b as shown in fig 6 c which can be expressed by eq 4 4 δ cos 1 o a o b a b o a o b a b where o a is the vector from point o to point a and o b a b is the vector from point o b to point a b the coordinates of point a b can be transformed from the body frame to the inertial frame by using eq 3 to simplification the point a b and point a are usually selected as the anchor tip point as depicted in fig 6 c in summary the anchor terminal velocity and hence the drag coefficient were determined by the high speed camera due to the easy operation and the directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors was measured by the mtd 4 testing results 4 1 experimental cases a total of 15 model tests were carried out in the water tank as listed in table 2 the anchor models are identified by anchor type booster shaft and booster rear see fig 5 b the anchor types are a for gia and h for hybrid anchor i e gia with a booster the numbers attached to h represent the three boosters shafts of b0 5 b1 0 and b1 5 weighing 0 5 1 0 and 1 5 times of the gia the booster rears include two shapes f for rear fin and r for rear ring and the numbers attached to the booster rear are the ratio of the fin width to the anchor fluke width and the ratio of the ring diameter to the anchor fluke width the extra lower case letters at the end of the term indicate a for gia loading arm in line with one pair of flukes b for gia loading arm in the middle of two pairs of flukes c for anchor with an attached chain and h for booster with a high ring as the plate shaped gia is primarily comprised of three thin plates it is difficult for the mtd to be directly sealed within the gia without altering the plate thickness therefore to study the free fall characteristics of the gia a larger gia i e gial for case 3 in table 2 was manufactured that is 1 67 times larger in all dimensions than the gia model used in other tests see table 1 thus the volume and weight of the gial is 4 6 times of the normal gia the mtd was sealed on the small booster of b0 5 and attached to the gial since the small booster has a weight of 0 5 times of the normal gia model the small booster only has 10 of the total weight of the gial b0 5 with small booster the small portion of the booster size and weight in this combination can ensure that the booster effect is limited hence the mtd data largely represent the performance of the gia as a base case a0 except for case a0 all the other tests were performed by using the normal gia model with dimensions as shown in table 1 and its matching boosters the anchors in the cases 3 to 8 2 in table 2 were tested using two measurement techniques first the high speed camera was used to determine the anchor terminal velocity when the anchor was falling vertically guided by a vertical guiding wire then the guiding wire was removed and the mtd was used to record the anchor velocity and anchor tilt angle when the anchor was free fall in water 4 2 typical experimental results the case h1 0 f1 0 c in group i was performed to mutually validate the data measured from the high speed camera and the mtd five photographs capturing the anchor locations in water are illustrated in fig 7 the fall velocities could be obtained by the anchor fall distances and the corresponding time intervals fig 8 depicts the whole free fall history for case h1 0 f1 0 c by the mtd the hybrid anchor was initially hanging in the water when time t 0 the anchor was released and started to accelerate in water the maximum acceleration of 8 5 m s2 9 81 m s2 is due to the buoyancy force of anchor and the added mass the anchor acceleration decreases monotonically after release due to the drag force which is proportional to the squared velocity when a z 0 it denotes that the drag force is equal to the anchor submerged weight after that the anchor maintains a constant velocity which is termed as the terminal velocity however the anchor velocity decreases reversely after reaching peak as shown in fig 8 a this is caused by the attached chains which will be discussed later fig 8 b illustrates the relationship of the anchor vertical velocity against fall distance the fall velocities derived from the high speed camera consist well with that obtained from the mtd which indicates the two approaches are both practicable note that each case was carried out twice and the repeated one matched well with the first one therefore only one test result in each case was depicted in the present study for simplification 5 free fall process of the gia in water 5 1 terminal velocity and drag coefficient of the gia the terminal velocities for case a0 a for the gia with its loading arm in line with one pair of flukes and a0 b for the gia anchor with its loading arm placed between two pairs of flukes are 3 48 and 3 34 m s respectively the maximum velocity for case a0 a 3 48 m s is lower than that for case h1 0 f1 0 c 4 18 m s indicating that the terminal velocity of the gia is indeed increased by adding a booster the water drag force acting on the anchor f d can be expressed as eq 5 5 f d 1 2 c d ρ w a f v z 2 where c d is the drag coefficient ρ w is the water density a f is the anchor frontal area i e the anchor projected area in the plane perpendicular to anchor shaft v z is the anchor vertical velocity when f d is equal to the anchor submerged weight wʹ the anchor velocity reaches the terminal velocity v t therefore the drag coefficient can be derived by eq 6 6 c d w 0 5 ρ w a f v t 2 the drag coefficients of case a0 a and a0 b are 0 87 and 0 81 respectively based on eq 6 relative to the case a0 a the lower drag coefficient for case a0 b with a lower terminal velocity is due to the increased frontal area by the in between location of the loading arm the drag coefficient of the gia against reynolds number re as expressed by eq 7 is illustrated in fig 9 a 7 re v z d eff ρ w μ where d eff 4a f π is the anchor equivalent diameter and μ is the water dynamic viscosity 5 2 terminal velocity and drag coefficient of hybrid anchors as shown in fig 9 b the terminal velocity of the gia increases with increased anchor mass due to the additional mass of the booster for instance the terminal velocity of the gia i e without a booster is 3 48 m s and the terminal velocity is increased to 3 98 m s 4 41 m s and 4 84 m s for hybrid anchors h0 5 r2 h1 0 r2 and h1 5 r2 respectively at the same time the anchor terminal velocity decreases with increasing fin width and ring diameter of the booster this can be explained by the plot of anchor drag coefficients in fig 9 c that are determined by eq 6 from fig 9 c it can be seen that the drag coefficient increases with increasing fin width and ring diameter height thus fig 9 shows that a booster with lower fin width and ring diameter can provide lower drag coefficient hence higher terminal velocity however since the drag coefficients of all model anchors i e a and h are within a fairly narrow range of 0 87 1 08 the increase in the terminal velocity by adding a booster is significant for all booster 5 3 theoretical prediction of the gia free fall in water the equilibrium equation characterizing the anchor free fall in water can be expressed as eq 8 8 w m m a z 1 2 c d ρ w v z 2 a f where m is the anchor mass and m is the added mass the added mass is the inertia added to a system due to the accelerating body moving through a fluid for slender projectiles in water such as torpedo anchors and omni max anchors the added mass can be very small o beirne et al 2014 shelton et al 2011 thus it can be approximated as m 0 as such the anchor drag coefficient can be calculated by eq 8 based on the anchor acceleration measured by the mtd for the case a0 see table 2 the anchor drag coefficient and the anchor acceleration against the anchor free fall time and distance in water and the corresponding reynolds number are plotted in fig 10 a it can be seen that the anchor acceleration increases sharply at the beginning and then decreases with its free fall time and distance to zero where the anchor reaches its terminal velocity during this free fall process the anchor velocity increases with time hence its reynolds number at the same time the anchor s drag coefficient decreases with increasing reynolds number when re 1 4 105 and then it remains constant c d 0 87 with further increase of the reynolds number when re 1 4 105 however over the entire anchor free fall process in water the anchor drag coefficient varies in a narrow range i e c d 1 4 0 87 within the initial short time t 0 16 s and short distance s z 0 11 m thus the constant drag coefficient based on the terminal velocity by eq 6 should be able to provide reasonable estimate on the anchor velocity the added mass term in eq 8 can be expressed as m c m ρ w v where c m is the added mass coefficient and v is the anchor volume given that c m 0 02 which is quite low value the corresponding anchor drag coefficient can also be determined by eq 8 and the result is also plotted in fig 10 a it can be seen that the drag coefficient is much lower during the initial free fall process compared with the constant drag coefficient of 0 87 the low drag coefficient during the anchor initial free fall stage is caused from the high overestimation of the added mass term in eq 8 this also demonstrates that the added mass term is rather small and hence it can be ignored fig 10 b displays the comparison between the measured anchor velocity and the estimated one by eq 8 under the assumptions of m 0 and c d constant during its free fall in water it can be seen that the estimated anchor velocity matches the measured one very well this demonstrates that the two assumptions of m 0 and c d constant are reasonable for eq 8 6 working efficiency of booster 6 1 directional stability of the gia the anchor deviation from anchor shaft to the vertical direction may be caused from both internal and external factors the internal factors primarily include the anchor structure and the errors in manufacturing and the external factors include the location of the attached chain the disturbance in releasing the anchor the sea currents and other uncertain factors caused by the sea environment therefore in practical applications it is with difficulty to avoid the anchor from deviating from the vertical direction in the present model tests the anchor directional stability is evaluated by the anchor tilt angle from the anchor shaft to the vertical direction i e δ in fig 3 the anchor with poor directional stability results in a larger tilt angle corresponding to the same fall distance fernandes et al 2011 recommended that the tilt angle should be within 3 for torpedo anchors to penetrate into the seabed effectively hence in the present study δ 3 is selected as the critical angle for stable gia and hybrid anchors however in practical applications a small tilt angle may be difficult to monitor and maintain due to many uncontrolled factors the anchor entrance angle to the seabed could be a better measure the fall velocity with δ 3 is adopted as the impact velocity v 0 similarly the anchor fall distance with δ 3 is considered as the release height h e it can be seen from fig 11 a that anchor tilt angle increases gradually with increasing fall velocity for a large tilt angle the gia cannot be dynamically embedded within the seabed or the final penetration depth may be significantly decreased fig 11 a shows that the anchor velocity continuously increases with δ 3 indicating the anchor still accelerates in water the impact velocity of the gia is approximately 4 16 m s however the terminal velocity of the gia back calculated from eq 6 is 4 87 m s indicating the anchor has not reached the terminal velocity with δ 3 the dimensionless fall distance s z h a in fig 11 b indicates s z h a 6 29 with δ 3 fig 11 c depicts the fall trajectory of the gia the anchor trajectory is not confined in a certain plane whereas it is a complex three dimensional 3 d curve as mentioned previously the anchor structure plays a significant role on the directional stability the location of the hc may be lower than gc relative to the anchor tip thus the moment m forces the anchor to further deviate with increasing fall distance see fig 11 c 6 2 effect of booster fin width on the anchor directional stability fig 12 shows the fall histories of hybrid anchors of cases h0 5 f1 0 h1 0 f1 0 and h1 5 f1 0 from group ii in table 2 in these three cases the fin width of the booster is approximately equal to the fluke width of the gia i e w b w a the impact velocities are 2 72 3 31 and 4 14 m s and the fall distance ratios are 3 05 4 70 and 7 93 for hybrid anchors of h0 5 h1 0 and h1 5 respectively with δ 3 the fall distance ratio of h0 5 s z h a 3 05 is lower than that of gia in case a0 s z h a 6 29 indicating the anchor directional stability is deteriorated by adding booster b0 5 however for hybrid anchor h1 5 the velocity and fall distance ratio are both increased compared to that of the gia therefore a booster with long aspect ratio and large weight is more efficient in increasing the anchor impact velocity and the release height to improve the directional stability of hybrid anchors the booster fin width was increased to 1 5 times the anchor fluke width the effect of fin width on the fall history of hybrid anchor h1 0 is shown in fig 13 it can be seen from fig 13 that the anchor impact velocity is increased from 3 31 to 3 61 m s and the fall distance ratio is increased from 4 70 to 6 22 by enlarging the fin width from 1 0 to 1 5 times the fluke width of the gia although the directional stability of the hybrid anchor h1 0 is improved to a certain extent with wider rear fins the hybrid anchor is still instable 6 3 effect of ring on anchor directional stability to further improve the anchor directional stability a symmetrical ring can be added to the outside of the rear fins of the booster fig 13 also illustrates the motion history of h1 0 with a symmetrical ring ring diameter d r 2w a ring height h r h r the anchor impact velocity is significantly increased from 3 31 to 3 89 m s and the fall distance ratio is increased from 4 70 to 9 70 for hybrid anchor h1 0 with a symmetrical ring indicating that the directional stability exhibits a remarkable improved with a ring though the frontal area for h1 0 is increased by adding a symmetrical ring as shown in fig 13 b the impact velocity is still increased this is attributed to the improved stability and thus increased release height fig 14 shows the motion histories of hybrid anchors with a symmetrical ring around the rear fins of the booster i e cases h0 5 r2 h1 0 r2 and h1 5 r2 from group ii in table 2 with ring diameter d r 2w a and ring height h r h r the comparison between figs 12 and 14 indicates that the anchor impact velocity is increased from 2 72 to 3 48 m s and the fall distance ratio is increased from 3 05 to 7 55 for hybrid anchor h0 5 with a symmetrical ring therefore the anchor directional stability is improved notably with a symmetrical ring around the booster rear fins as shown in fig 14 b all the release distance ratios for the hybrid anchors are larger than that of the gia indicating the added booster is beneficial in improving the anchor directional stability the following studies aim at investigating the ring height and diameter on the directional stability of hybrid anchors the influences of the ring height on the impact velocity and fall distance are illustrated in fig 15 it can be seen from fig 15 that the fall distance ratio increases from 9 70 to 12 41 by using a higher ring ring height h r 50 mm 1 5h r for h1 0 whereas the fall distance ratios for h1 5 with different ring heights show minor discrepancy in the overall level increasing the ring height has limited influence in improving the directional stability the above model tests indicate that the gia and hybrid anchors are instable since the tilt angle exhibits an infinite increasing trend moreover the anchor still accelerates with δ 3 because the anchor velocity increases continuously with δ 3 the ring diameter was enlarged to three times the fluke width of the gia i e d r 3w a cases h1 0 r3 and h1 5 r3 from group ii in table 2 to investigate the effects of ring diameter on the impact velocity and directional stability of hybrid anchors as shown in fig 16 fig 16 a shows that the anchor impact velocity with δ 3 has reached the terminal velocity which is due to the increased fall distance as shown in fig 16 b it can be seen from fig 16 b that the fall distance ratio increases from 9 70 to 20 97 for h1 0 and 12 10 to 25 07 for h1 5 by using a wider ring with diameter d r 3w a the kinetic energy 1 2 m v 0 2 for a hybrid anchor is increased due to two factors the additional mass and the increased impact velocity by adding a booster the additional energy ensures the anchor to penetrate deeper within seabed preliminary studies in relation to the working efficiency of the booster on the final penetration depth of the gia anchor has been reported by liu and zhang 2017a by numerical simulations based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach in their numerical simulations the anchor soil interface was modeled as fully rough i e the frictional adhesion was set as 1 0 and the soil undrained shear strength s u 2 4 3z kpa the penetration depth ratio i e z e h a was 1 0 for the gia with an impact velocity of 20 m s for the same impact velocity of 20 m s the penetration depth ratio was increased from 1 0 to 1 3 with booster b1 0 indicating the additional weight of the booster can help the anchor to be embedded deeper into soils moreover the impact velocity is also increased attributed to the booster as illustrated in fig 16 a with an increased impact velocity of 25 m s the penetration depth ratio could reach 1 5 for hybrid anchor h1 0 the additional penetration depth is caused from both the additional kinetic and potential energies with the aid of a booster fig 16 c shows the trajectory of h1 5 with a wider ring diameter d r 3w a the anchor horizontal distance is within 0 2 m corresponding to a vertical distance of approximately 7 5 m indicating the anchor directional stability is greatly improved if the anchor is stable the hc location is higher than gc about the anchor tip when the anchor is tilt the moment m will force the anchor to turn back to the vertical direction see fig 16 c fig 16 b shows that the variation trend of the tilt angle with the fall distance becomes gentle with δ 3 for hybrid anchors with a wider ring d r 3w a whereas the tilt angle increases approximately linearly with the fall distance with δ 3 for hybrid anchors with a smaller ring d r 2w a however more details in relation to the anchor motion history could not be derived due to the height limitation of the water tank to systematically investigate the directional stability of the hybrid anchors further numerical simulations based on the cfd approach are planned from the current physical testing it is found that enlarging the fin width and ring diameter of the booster is beneficial in improving the directional stability of the hybrid anchor however at the same time the anchor terminal velocity experiences a reduction with larger fin width and ring diameter as shown in fig 9 b therefore further numerical simulations are needed to optimize the booster shape and size to ensure the directional stability of the hybrid anchor and to maintain a high terminal velocity as well 7 effect of attached chains on anchor impact velocity 7 1 chain drag coefficient the anchor fall velocity is reduced due to the drag force acting on the attached chains cenac 2011 fernandes et al 2005 o beirne et al 2017 however the chain drag force and thus the drag coefficient have not been systematically studied in the present study drag coefficients for both linked chain and rope were investigated the model chain has a nominal diameter the diameter of the bar from which the chain is fabricated of d bar 1 5 mm and the rope diameter is d 3 0 mm as depicted in fig 17 a the chain and rope weigh 37 and 9 g m respectively the chain rope was dragged behind the anchor fig 17 b and the anchor was released by burning out the fishing line connected to the chain rear allowing the anchor and chain to fall freely in the water tank the resistances acting on the anchor and chain are illustrated in fig 17 c the relationships of the chain submerged weight w c the chain drag force f dc the anchor submerged weight wʹ and the anchor drag force f d can be expressed as eq 9 9 m m c a z w w c f d f dc where m and m c are the anchor mass and chain mass respectively the chain drag force can be determined based on eq 9 and the chain drag coefficient can be derived by eq 10 10 c dc f dc 1 2 ρ w a fc v z 2 f dc 1 2 ρ w π d c eff l c v z 2 the drag force acting on the chain is dominated by the frictional resistance as opposed to the pressure resistance due to the large aspect ratio l c d bar or l c d 1 l c is the chain length of the chain following the study by o beirne et al 2017 the chain was modeled as an equivalent chain diameter d c eff calculated by considering a unit cylindrical length with the same volume as the same unit of chain for the rope the equivalent chain diameter is equal to the rope diameter i e d c eff d based on the chain dimensions as shown in fig 17 a the chain equivalent diameter is d c eff 2 4 mm therefore the chain characteristic area is defined as a fc πd c eff l c for the chain and a fc πdl c for the rope in which the chain length is taken into consideration to determine the drag coefficients for chain and rope four case studies were conducted by using different chain types and different chain lengths table 3 the booster b1 5f1 0 was adopted herein the booster weighs 673 5 g and its drag coefficient c d 0 297 which was predetermined based on the recorded data from the mtd based on eqs 9 and 10 the drag coefficients for chain and rope are 0 02 and 0 01 respectively table 3 shows that the chain drag coefficient is independent on the chain length as the chain length has been divided in eq 10 this also indicates that the chain drag force increases linearly with chain length 7 2 chain effective length in practical implementation the attached chains are usually not released from the installation vehicle above the seawater surface to avoid excessive drag force acting on the chain brandão et al 2006 instead a segment of chain is pre released to the seabed surface as shown in figs 1 a and 2 this method has been applied to torpedo anchors dpas and omni max anchors brandão et al 2006 lieng et al 2009 omni max brochure 2011 therefore the hanging chain from the padeye to the dip down point where the chain profile is between lying on the mudline and hanging in water may move together with the anchor during free fall in water the photographs in fig 7 show that a segment of chain from padeye to the demarcation point i e the highest point on the chain is dragged behind the anchor moving with the same velocity as the anchor the other segment of chain from the demarcation point to the ddp exhibits slack profiles the chain effective length l eff is defined as the distance from the padeye to the demarcation point in which the chain moves with the same speed as the anchor to investigate the chain effective length case h1 0 f1 0 c was conducted and the results have been depicted in figs 7 8 fig 8 shows that the anchor firstly accelerates in water nevertheless the anchor acceleration becomes negative and the velocity reduces reversely after reaching the peak velocity this is caused by the increase in the chain effective length and thus the chain drag force the effective chain length can be determined from the equilibrium equation in eq 9 which is rewritten as eq 11 where the m c per is the chain mass in per length 11 l eff w w c m a z f d m c per a z 1 2 c dc ρ w v z 2 π d bar the chain effective length against the anchor fall distance is illustrated in fig 18 the chain effective length can be expressed as l eff 0 614s z by using linearly empirical formula and l eff 0 34 s z 1 35 by using power typed empirical formula enlarging the anchor release height is the precondition to gain a high impact velocity whereas it may lead to a large chain drag force which inversely reduces the anchor impact velocity therefore it is reasonable to be assumed that a critical release height is required for the anchor to obtain a maximum impact velocity 7 3 case study a case study was conducted in this section to investigate the chain effect on anchor velocity the hybrid anchor h1 0 with ring diameter of d r 3w a i e h1 0 r3 was used herein it can be seen from fig 16 that a distance ratio of s z h a 20 was needed for the hybrid anchor to reach terminal velocity v t 4 02 m s the drag coefficient of h1 0 r3 is 1 04 as shown in fig 9 c determined based on the terminal velocity from the high speed camera four different chain nominal diameters d bar 0 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 mm respectively were adopted to study the chain effect on the anchor fall velocity as shown in fig 19 based on eq 11 in eq 11 the chain mass was calculated by m c m c per l eff and the chain drag force was calculated by f dc 1 2 c d ρ w v z 2 π d bar l eff where the chain effective length l eff 0 34 s z 1 35 based on the fitting formula in fig 18 the maximum velocity and its corresponding fall distance ratio are also depicted in fig 19 and both of them decrease with increasing chain diameters when the anchor moves further the anchor velocity starts to reduce as the chain drag force increases with increasing release height as shown in fig 19 therefore the release height should be accurately estimated to ensure the anchor to obtain the maximum impact velocity for instance with chain diameter d c 2 5 mm the release height ratio for the hybrid anchor h1 0 should be within 14 5 8 conclusions the present work put forward an innovative booster concept with the aim of increasing the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia free fall tests were conducted to investigate the impact velocity and directional stability of the gia and hybrid anchors the primary conclusions are summarized following 1 the anchor tilt angle from the anchor shaft to the vertical orientation is deduced in this study i e eq 4 based on the measured data from the mtd the anchor tilt angle combined with the anchor trajectory can be used to characterize the anchor directional stability 2 the terminal velocities are 3 48 and 3 34 m s for gias with loading arm in line with one pair of flukes and between two pairs of flukes respectively thus in practical applications the loading arm should be in line with one pair of flukes to increase the anchor impact velocity 3 both impact velocity and directional stability of the gia are improved by adding booster the booster with a rear ring provides more significant improvement on the anchor directional stability when adding boosters of b1 0 and b1 5 with a large rear fin r3 the anchor impact velocity can be improved by 16 and 26 respectively at the same time the anchor stable fall distances were increased to 21h a and 25h a for hybrid anchors h1 0 and h1 5 respectively 4 the anchor velocity is reduced by the attached chains the drag coefficients for the chain and rope are 0 02 and 0 01 respectively with reynolds number ranging 1 32 105 1 6 105 when estimating the anchor impact velocity it is necessary to take the chain effect into consideration 5 the anchor free fall velocity in water can be predicted by using the theoretical model based on the second newton s law i e eqs 8 and 9 which provides an efficient approach to predict the anchor impact velocity for a given release height moreover the booster concept may provide a reference for the installation of plate anchors in the future further investigations such as the optimization of the booster shape the effect of the attached chains on anchor directional stability the booster working efficiency on the anchor final penetration depth within the seabed and so forth are conducted and will be published in the future acknowledgements this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51479027 51539008 and the national key research

23394,effect of wind loads on marine structures and ships has to be considered during design static and dynamic effects of wind forces and moments are incorporated into the rules and regulations of governing authorities by various means the weather criterion of imo part of the mandatory requirements of 2008 is code considers the effect of wind and waves on stability of ships and has been in use for a long time the criterion is simply based on static heel angle due to pre defined wind pressure and moment balance concept with respective roll motion there has been a lot of criticism about the assumptions and therefore validity of the criterion especially for the standard wind pressure of 504 pa and linear distribution of heeling arms curve irrespective of heel angles this paper deals with these questionable issues of the weather criterion cfd analyses have been conducted on several different type of vessels in order to predict the wind forces the results are then compared with those mandated by various criteria keywords wind loads cfd analysis heeling moment heeling arm weather criterion 1 introduction wind forces and moments are important for all types of structures on land and on ships at sea during design over the years many calculation methods have been developed to estimate these forces in the literature myers 1969 ocimf 1994 haddara and soares 1999 sigtto 2007 most of the stability criteria are based on the statical aspects of ship behavior at sea which may be considered as an unrealistic approach some of the criteria have been adopted and are still in use incorporating the dynamic effect of wind and waves in a quasi dynamical fashion through empirical formulas the weather criterion adopted by the imo assembly resolution a 562 in 1985 somewhat addresses dynamic aspects of ship stability problem in severe weather conditions specifically in beam seas imo 2008 chronological development and the details of the criterion are very well documented by kobylinski and kastner 2003 there are similar criteria that exist for the same purpose which have been set up by navies of various countries such as the us dds 079 germany bv1030 1 and the uk nes 109 japan has also adopted its own weather criterion for its own fleet navigating along coastal waters of japan slf 51 4 1 in the japanese criterion wind pressure is reduced considerably for coastal going vessels in two different categories depending upon the area of operation for ocean going vessels 504 pa wind pressure is accepted as in the case of the weather criterion of imo the problem of wind loads on structures on land or stationary structures in the sea need to be dealt with differently than that of the ships experiencing 6 dof motions at sea apart from wind loads associated wave excitation complicates the problem leading to excessive roll amplitudes and a possible capsize the weather criterion of imo has drawn a lot of criticism because of the assumptions and limitations it bears kobylinski and kastner 2003 syprou 2011 especially the wind pressure of 504 pa is found to be extremely high by some experts and researchers and unlikely to be come across in most parts of the world vassalos et al 2003 thus compliance with the mandatory criteria may become more difficult especially for certain small ship types such as those having low freeboard and large superstructure imo has issued msc 1 circ 1200 interim guidelines for the alternative assessment of the weather criterion in 2006 which contains guidelines to determine relevant parameters of the weather criterion experimentally bulian et al 2010 have conducted series of experiments using 3 geosim models to measure roll motion in beam waves in this paper wind forces and wind moments on ships have been considered cfd applications in wind pressure calculations have intensified in the last 40 years the existing evaluation methods assumptions and criteria are examined thoroughly by owens and palo 1982 blendermann 1996 mca 2007 slf 46 6 8 brizzolara and rizzuto 2006 cfd method has been used frequently in recent years by many researchers janssen et al 2017 janssen et al 2017 studied 3d steady rans cfd simulations of wind loads on a container ship validation with wind tunnel measurements and an analysis of the impact of geometrical simplifications some of the research has focused on the comparison between cfd simulations and wind tunnel measurements wnek and soarez 2015 dealt with wind loads on an lng carrier with a very specific geometrical shape they found that there is a difference in the magnitude of the forces with the experimental measurements over predicting the numerical results they further concluded that the most probable cause of difference in the magnitude of the results was the error associated with the low wind speed which creates too small forces andersen 2013 has performed wind tunnel tests on container ships bertaglia et al 2004 have conducted systematic experimental tests in wind tunnel and in model basin for the imo weather criterion requirements at the vienna model basin calculation methods for wind loads are outlined in details three sample ships having different geometries were selected for cfd calculations the results from cfd analysis were then compared with those from other criteria 2 review of existing criteria 2 1 imo weather criterion the stability standard known as the weather criterion adopted by imo as resolution a 562 is based on a number of simplifying assumptions as described below imo 2008 a the ship attains a stationary angle of heel θ0 due to side wind loading represented by a lever lw1 which is the result of a 26 m s wind b around this angle the ship is assumed to perform resonant rolling motion due to side wave action as a result of which it reaches a momentary maximum angle θ1 on the weather side c as at this position the ship is most vulnerable in terms of weather side excitations it is further assumed that the ship is acted upon by a gust wind represented by a lever lw2 1 5 lw1 this is translated into an increase of the wind velocity assumed to affect the ship for a short period of time but at least equal to half of the natural roll period under the assumption of resonant ship response d the requirement for stability is formulated as follows should the ship roll freely from the off equilibrium position θ1 with zero angular velocity the limiting angle θ2 to the lee side calculated on the basis of the condition b a fig 1 should not be exceeded during the ensuing half cycle this limiting angle is either the angle where significant openings are down flooded the vanishing angle θv or the angle of 50 which can be assumed as an explicit safety limit whichever is the lowest expressed as an energy balance the work done by the wind excitation as the ship rolls from the weather side to the lee side should not exceed the potential energy at the limiting angle θ2 the heeling lever lw1 is calculated from the following formula 1 l w 1 p a z 1000 g δ where p steady wind pressure 504 n m2 a projected lateral area of the ship and deck cargo above the waterline m2 z

heeling arm due to wind properly favors the smaller ships which normally would be the most affected by the velocity gradient and would also be somewhat sheltered from the wind by the accompanying waves in dds 079 criterion the heeling moments due to wind may also be obtained from table 2 6 wind heeling factors that has been prepared for 100 knots of nominal wind when this procedure is utilized the so called sail area is split into 5 feet layers each area is assumed to contribute to the heeling moment with factors related to the height of the area then the total heeling moment obtained for 100 knots of wind is converted to the heeling moment at the wind speed being considered on most ships a first approximation using the above formula for hawind to estimate the heeling arm without allowance for wind gradient will establish whether or not wind heel will be a governing criterion and whether or not any further calculations will be required the most accurate method of determining wind pressure effects would be to conduct wind tunnel tests for each design 3 sample ships in order to conduct the cfd calculations various ship types have been considered as the main objective was to cover a range of size and superstructure area while investigating different ship types subject to the weather criteria a research vessel a container vessel and a frigate have been chosen for the

details of the vessel the container vessel has a capacity of 1000 teu s it has been analyzed in the fully loaded condition with deck cargo the 3 d model that has been prepared for the analysis is given in fig 4 the frigate model utilized in this study is a fictitious vessel that has been developed from the profile and layout of oliver hazard perry class frigate maintaining the main dimensions of the class the 3 d model of the frigate is given in fig 5 4 methodology of cfd analysis the main purpose of the cfd study is to investigate the effect of atmospheric boundary layer and heel angle on the wind pressure experienced by ships in various sizes and superstructure types viscous cfd analysis have been conducted by ansys cfx v14 0 for turbulence modeling k w sst model has been utilized analyses have been conducted at ship s scale and second order solver and turbulence modeling have been used as the problem is approached by a numerical technique it is essential to assess the validity of the utilized technique in order to ensure its applicability therefore andersen s 2013 wind tunnel test results on post panamax containership has been utilized for comparison fig 6 shows the agreement between the wind tunnel tests and the cfd study there is good agreement in terms of the transverse force coefficient cy in ship axis between the results for the 45 and 135 cases the trend of the variation of transverse force coefficient by wind angle is also captured by cfd the lateral force coefficient is slightly underpredicted by cfd at 90 as a result the cfd technique with the current setup is considered to be applicable to the problem of investigating the wind pressure on different ships types ensuring that the grid independence study is conducted for each ship prior to the analysis of sample ships grid sensitivity study has been conducted for each vessel ittc s uncertainty analysis procedure has been used for the purpose ittc 2002 at least three different grids with a refinement ratio of 2 were assumed to be sufficient to obtain a grid independent solution for each case the grid independence study results for the research vessel is given in fig 7 in a representative manner results are shown as the normal force in y axis direction versus the number of cells in the computational field it should be noted that only the cell sizes on the ship s surface have been varied during the analysis having completed the grid sensitivity analysis effect of the wind gradient near the sea surface has been investigated the investigation was conducted for all vessels utilized in the study modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer for cfd was achieved by incorporating the below equation into the inlet velocity profile myers et al cited in owens and palo 1982 6 v v r h h r 1 n where v v r normalized wind velocity at height h h height above free surface hr constant reference height n arbitrary exponent taken as n 7 the wind gradient analysis has been conducted for the upright case only analysis with the wind gradient modeling for the research vessel indicated that the normal force in y direction reduced by 43 when compared to the analysis without the wind gradient modeling for the container vessel having the largest planform the analysis with the wind gradient modeling resulted in a 27 reduction in the normal force when compared with the analysis without the wind gradient modeling in the case of the frigate the reduction in the force was at the order of 34 it is evident that the effect should be more pronounced for smaller ships with air drafts similar to that of the research vessel however the reduction in the normal force in y direction for the smallest and largest ships lies between the range of 27 43 will definitely be evaluated for further investigations for convenience all further analyses were conducted with wind gradient modeling a typical computational grid consists of two regions as depicted in fig 8 the sub domain containing the hull has a refined volume cell size in order to maintain the wind speed gradient towards the ships without any dissipation the conformal nature of the grid is maintained for all the cases considered the inlet of the domain has been placed at 1 ship s length away from the starboard side of the ship the outlet modeled as an opening is 1 5 l away from the ship there is also 1 l space between the fore and aft ends of the ship and the sides of the domain which are also modeled as opening type boundary the domain height is approximately chosen as 6 times the air draught of the ship in consideration top and bottom of the domain are modeled as walls with free slip condition the close up view of the refined hull and superstructure mesh for the research vessel is depicted in fig 9 the mesh and the computational domain is renewed with varying heel angle for every case three different ships have been analyzed with viscous cfd at ship s scale the test matrix is comprised of analyses with 35 and 70 knots of wind speeds at the upright condition and at heel angles of 15 30 45 and 60 however due to geometrical limitations the container vessel could have been analyzed up to 35 degrees of heel 5 results and discussion 5 1 effect of wind gradient the results of the wind gradient analyses with respect to normal force in the y direction have been reported in the previous section it has been seen that the normal force experienced by the ship due to the wind action is reduced when the effect of the atmospheric boundary layer is incorporated to the velocity profile in the computational domain smaller ships with air drafts lower then assumed boundary layer height of approximately 12 m are influenced more from the phenomenon in other words a reduction of 43 in the normal force in y direction has been estimated for the research vessel large vessels are also prone to the effect for the container vessel a reduction of 27 in the normal force has been estimated in this section the pressure distributions on the windward sides of the ships will be depicted and compared for the cases with and without wind gradient modeling in fig 10 a and b contours of positive pressure are plotted for the research vessel without and with wind gradient modeling respectively for the upright condition at 30 knots wind speed the pressure contour range has been kept identical for each plot i e the maximum pressure value experienced for the no wind gradient case has been used it is evident from the pressure contours that the pressure along the hull area is overestimated without wind gradient modeling also the pressure peaks experienced in the superstructure area are not seen in the case with wind gradient modeling in the 30 knot wind speed case the average pressure along the profile of the vessel is reduced from 169 pa to 95 pa with the accounting of the wind gradient a reduction of 43 is achieved the reduction in the induced pressure and hence the normal force in the y direction also influence the heeling moment experienced by the ship the heeling moment is reduced from 171 kn to 100 kn with a reduction of 42 the variation in the pressure distribution also influences the position of the center of pressure even though the variation is not as drastic as in the force and moment the center of pressure rises approximately 5 with the wind gradient in fig 11 a and b the positive pressure contours for the frigate are given without and with wind gradient modeling for 35 knots of wind speed as almost all the superstructure except the bridge lies within the range of the atmospheric boundary layer the frigate is influenced from the wind gradient the substantial difference in the pressure contours induced a drop in heel force at the order of 34 the average pressure is also reduced from 268 pa to 178 pa due to the wind gradient the center of pressure rises approximately 2 all these variations lead to a reduction of heeling moment from 2347 kn to 1599 kn a reduction of 32 is experienced fig 11n fig 12 a and b pressure plots for the upright condition at 35 knots of wind speed are given for the container vessel without and with wind gradient modeling respectively results are almost identical to that of the research vessel however owing to the higher air draft of the containership it can be clearly seen that the pressure distribution along the superstructure is identical for both cases above the atmospheric boundary layer model since there is a substantial amount of superstructure area outside the atmospheric boundary layer the reduction in the normal force in y direction and average pressure is at the order of 27 for the container vessel the center of pressure rises from 14 m to 15 4 m with an increase of 13 when the wind gradient is taken into account combination of these effects result in a reduction of 21 in heeling moment from 9411 kn to 7466 kn 5 2 evaluation of wind induced pressure on ship hulls and superstructures the flow structure induced by the wind on vessels with different superstructure areas and profile designs is investigated in this section fig 13 shows the variation of projected area above water for all ships with heel angle in the graph the normalized projected areas which were calculated by diving the areas with the upright projected planform area for each vessel have been used the actual projected areas have been calculated in cad platform from the 3 d models the projected areas above water of the containership and the frigate increase with heel angle the maximum increase is at the order of 15 for both vessels and the variation is identical over the entire heel angle range although the variation of planform area with heel for the research vessel is identical to the other two vessels for small heel angles up to approximately 15 the projected planform area above water tends to reduce after this point onwards maximum increase of planform area for this vessel is about 12 the wind pressures calculated by dividing the normal force with the projected planform area above water for the respective heel angle are given in figs 14 and 15 for 35 and 70 knots of wind speeds it may be seen from the figures that the variation of wind pressure is similar for the containership and frigate however for the research vessel the tendency differs and there is a constant increase in average wind induced pressure with heel angle as the planform area decreases with heel angle for the research vessel it is expected that the induced pressure will be larger considering the possibility that the wind induced pressures on ships may be calculated by alternative means rather then the criteria it is worthwhile to analyze the pressures induced by the wind on ships in terms of coefficients for this purpose the pressure coefficient cp is calculated as 7 c p p 1 2 ρ v 2 the flow regime around ships may be said to be identical for the analyzed speed range as the pressure coefficients are constant with varying wind speed for the frigate and the container ship the pressure coefficients are larger than that of the research vessel this may be attributed to the fact that the depth of this vessel is smaller compared to the other vessels and the majority of the planform area above water lies within the atmospheric boundary layer the variation of cp is between 0 65 and 0 90 for the research vessel 0 94 1 07 for the container ship and 0 84 0 95 for the frigate the variation of pressure coefficients is plotted in fig 16 5 3 variation of center of pressure with heel angle as the height of the lateral aerodynamic force centroid in other words the center of pressure is directly influential on the magnitude of the heeling moment its position may be considered as one of the major parameters influencing the stability of a ship along with the magnitude of wind induced pressure loads the stability criteria mentioned in the previous chapters hold varying assumptions with respect to the variation of this centroid with heel as the distance between the center of pressure and the half of the draft is assumed to be the moment lever during heel due to the wind any conservative assumption within these criteria would demand ships to be stiffer in terms of stability and maintain a higher area under the gz curve the variation of heeling moment lever with heel angle has been calculated with various techniques and have been plotted for all ships in figs 17 19 the calculation methods are as follows cfd method the vertical center of lateral force has been obtained from respective cfd analysis and half of the draft has been added this process has been repeated for each heel angle geometric method the center of the projected lateral area has been assumed to be the center of lateral force this center has been calculated from the cad model half of the draft has been added to the obtained value this process has been repeated for each heel angle by rotating the cad model and obtaining the center of the projected area cos2 the geometric heeling arm obtained for the upright condition has been modified by calculating it with the square of the cosine of the heel angle cos0 5 the geometric heeling arm obtained for the upright condition has been modified by calculating it with the square root of the cosine of the heel angle this is not evident in the heeling lever magnitudes that are obtained from cfd analysis for all ships the magnitude of the heeling lever reduces with heel angle therefore an assumption of a constant heeling arm may be said to be an over conservative approach in majority of the stability criteria the variation of the magnitude of the heeling arm with heel angle is associated to be in proportion to a certain power of the cosine of the heel angle for representation purposes the variation of heeling lever calculated by multiplying the upright heeling lever with the square of the cosine of the heel angle has been plotted in the above figures the squaring approach tends to underestimate the heeling lever at high heels angles the square root of the cosine of the heel angle is found to be a more compliant multiplier for the various ship types analyzed within this study 5 4 comparison with the current criteria following the post process of the cfd it has been deemed beneficial to compare the obtained results with the current criteria initially wind pressure assumptions within the criteria have been compared with the results fig 20 shows the wind pressure assumption of the imo criteria and the corresponding wind pressures for each vessel calculated from the coefficients obtained from the cfd analysis as mentioned before imo criteria assumes a wind speed of 26 m s and hence the pressure coefficients obtained from the cfd data are dimensionalized with the same speed it is evident that the pressure assumption of imo criteria is well above the cfd predictions the over prediction becomes more pronounced as ships gets smaller which can easily be attributed to the variation of wind speed along the atmospheric boundary layer in fig 21 the wind pressure for the frigate obtained from cfd predictions is compared with the pressure values from imo bv 1030 and dds 079 criteria for comparison purposes either 26 m s or 50 knot assumption has been assumed within the different criteria it is seen that all the three criteria reveal similar magnitudes of wind pressure for the assumed wind condition however the computed wind pressure magnitude is less when compared to the values from the criteria indicating the over predictive tendency of the criteria this is easily attributed to the atmospheric boundary layer assumption and the differences between the criteria values and the computed values are at similar order of magnitude to what has been calculated and reported in chapter 5 1 the magnitude of the heeling moments obtained from relevant wind pressure and heeling arm calculations of the criteria have also been compared with the magnitude of the moments obtained from cfd analysis it is seen in figs 22 and 23 that the commercial ships that are obliged to comply with the imo weather criteria have to be overdesigned against the effect of beam winds the differences between the moments assumed by the criteria and predicted by cfd tend to increase with heel angle this requires the ships to be stiffer at high heel angles and possess higher potential energy than that required in fig 24 the heeling moment obtained from the cfd predictions for the frigate has been compared to the heeling moments calculated from imo bv 1030 and dds 079 criteria in dds 079 criteria the calculations are also performed with the wind heel factor approach although the naval criteria may account for the reduction of heel moment with increasing heel angle the order of magnitude does not match the cfd predictions across the heel range the standard naval criteria tend to over predict the heeling moment at small heel angles while the moments at high heel angles are under predicted in fig 25 the heeling moments obtained from cfd predictions are compared with dds 079 values with the accounting of wind heel factors originally the moment value obtained from the dds 079 wind heel factor method is multiplied by the square of the cosine of the heel angle and plotted with the title cos sq however as given in fig 24 the wind heel factor assumption that may be considered in dds 079 by slicing the superstructure and accounting for each slice with respective moment factors from tables 2 and 3 is multiplied by the square root of the cosine of the heel angle it shows the most reasonable agreement with the obtained cfd results in terms of magnitude and behavior at high heel angles 6 conclusions the aerodynamic flow around a research vessel a container ship and a frigate has been investigated with viscous cfd the ships were analyzed for the beam wind condition at 35 and 70 knots of wind speed for varying heel angles the pressure distributions force and moment data have been processed and compared to the assumptions in the current stability criteria for both commercial and naval vessels for ships which have critical stability reserves according to the relevant wind criteria cfd calculations or wind tunnel tests should be considered for inclusion in the stability assessment it is recommended that benchmark data for certain ship types may be produced from wind tunnel tests for cfd validation in this study the atmospheric boundary layer has been incorporated to the analysis as variation of wind velocity with height from the water surface it is seen that the stability criteria for commercial and naval ships fail to account for this effect resulting in over prediction of wind induced pressure smaller ships are more prone to the effect only the wind heel factor consideration in dds 079 1 may favorably account for the effect amongst the tested criteria when the effect of heel is incorporated to the heel moment magnitude by the square root of the cosine of the heel angle rather than the square of the cosine of the heel angle finally it has been observed that all weather criteria examined over estimate wind heeling moments due to unrealistic assumptions such as wind pressure and variation over heel angles only the wind heel factor consideration in dds 079 1 criteria may produce reasonable results still over predicting when compared to the current analysis this study has shown that cfd analysis may be a viable tool in determining wind forces and moments on ships towards more realistic stability criteria as a follow up study the implications of the results on the weather criterion will be considered for different hull forms loading conditions and above water geometries 
23394,effect of wind loads on marine structures and ships has to be considered during design static and dynamic effects of wind forces and moments are incorporated into the rules and regulations of governing authorities by various means the weather criterion of imo part of the mandatory requirements of 2008 is code considers the effect of wind and waves on stability of ships and has been in use for a long time the criterion is simply based on static heel angle due to pre defined wind pressure and moment balance concept with respective roll motion there has been a lot of criticism about the assumptions and therefore validity of the criterion especially for the standard wind pressure of 504 pa and linear distribution of heeling arms curve irrespective of heel angles this paper deals with these questionable issues of the weather criterion cfd analyses have been conducted on several different type of vessels in order to predict the wind forces the results are then compared with those mandated by various criteria keywords wind loads cfd analysis heeling moment heeling arm weather criterion 1 introduction wind forces and moments are important for all types of structures on land and on ships at sea during design over the years many calculation methods have been developed to estimate these forces in the literature myers 1969 ocimf 1994 haddara and soares 1999 sigtto 2007 most of the stability criteria are based on the statical aspects of ship behavior at sea which may be considered as an unrealistic approach some of the criteria have been adopted and are still in use incorporating the dynamic effect of wind and waves in a quasi dynamical fashion through empirical formulas the weather criterion adopted by the imo assembly resolution a 562 in 1985 somewhat addresses dynamic aspects of ship stability problem in severe weather conditions specifically in beam seas imo 2008 chronological development and the details of the criterion are very well documented by kobylinski and kastner 2003 there are similar criteria that exist for the same purpose which have been set up by navies of various countries such as the us dds 079 germany bv1030 1 and the uk nes 109 japan has also adopted its own weather criterion for its own fleet navigating along coastal waters of japan slf 51 4 1 in the japanese criterion wind pressure is reduced considerably for coastal going vessels in two different categories depending upon the area of operation for ocean going vessels 504 pa wind pressure is accepted as in the case of the weather criterion of imo the problem of wind loads on structures on land or stationary structures in the sea need to be dealt with differently than that of the ships experiencing 6 dof motions at sea apart from wind loads associated wave excitation complicates the problem leading to excessive roll amplitudes and a possible capsize the weather criterion of imo has drawn a lot of criticism because of the assumptions and limitations it bears kobylinski and kastner 2003 syprou 2011 especially the wind pressure of 504 pa is found to be extremely high by some experts and researchers and unlikely to be come across in most parts of the world vassalos et al 2003 thus compliance with the mandatory criteria may become more difficult especially for certain small ship types such as those having low freeboard and large superstructure imo has issued msc 1 circ 1200 interim guidelines for the alternative assessment of the weather criterion in 2006 which contains guidelines to determine relevant parameters of the weather criterion experimentally bulian et al 2010 have conducted series of experiments using 3 geosim models to measure roll motion in beam waves in this paper wind forces and wind moments on ships have been considered cfd applications in wind pressure calculations have intensified in the last 40 years the existing evaluation methods assumptions and criteria are examined thoroughly by owens and palo 1982 blendermann 1996 mca 2007 slf 46 6 8 brizzolara and rizzuto 2006 cfd method has been used frequently in recent years by many researchers janssen et al 2017 janssen et al 2017 studied 3d steady rans cfd simulations of wind loads on a container ship validation with wind tunnel measurements and an analysis of the impact of geometrical simplifications some of the research has focused on the comparison between cfd simulations and wind tunnel measurements wnek and soarez 2015 dealt with wind loads on an lng carrier with a very specific geometrical shape they found that there is a difference in the magnitude of the forces with the experimental measurements over predicting the numerical results they further concluded that the most probable cause of difference in the magnitude of the results was the error associated with the low wind speed which creates too small forces andersen 2013 has performed wind tunnel tests on container ships bertaglia et al 2004 have conducted systematic experimental tests in wind tunnel and in model basin for the imo weather criterion requirements at the vienna model basin calculation methods for wind loads are outlined in details three sample ships having different geometries were selected for cfd calculations the results from cfd analysis were then compared with those from other criteria 2 review of existing criteria 2 1 imo weather criterion the stability standard known as the weather criterion adopted by imo as resolution a 562 is based on a number of simplifying assumptions as described below imo 2008 a the ship attains a stationary angle of heel θ0 due to side wind loading represented by a lever lw1 which is the result of a 26 m s wind b around this angle the ship is assumed to perform resonant rolling motion due to side wave action as a result of which it reaches a momentary maximum angle θ1 on the weather side c as at this position the ship is most vulnerable in terms of weather side excitations it is further assumed that the ship is acted upon by a gust wind represented by a lever lw2 1 5 lw1 this is translated into an increase of the wind velocity assumed to affect the ship for a short period of time but at least equal to half of the natural roll period under the assumption of resonant ship response d the requirement for stability is formulated as follows should the ship roll freely from the off equilibrium position θ1 with zero angular velocity the limiting angle θ2 to the lee side calculated on the basis of the condition b a fig 1 should not be exceeded during the ensuing half cycle this limiting angle is either the angle where significant openings are down flooded the vanishing angle θv or the angle of 50 which can be assumed as an explicit safety limit whichever is the lowest expressed as an energy balance the work done by the wind excitation as the ship rolls from the weather side to the lee side should not exceed the potential energy at the limiting angle θ2 the

evaluated for further investigations for convenience all further analyses were conducted with wind gradient modeling a typical computational grid consists of two regions as depicted in fig 8 the sub domain containing the hull has a refined volume cell size in order to maintain the wind speed gradient towards the ships without any dissipation the conformal nature of the grid is maintained for all the cases considered the inlet of the domain has been placed at 1 ship s length away from the starboard side of the ship the outlet modeled as an opening is 1 5 l away from the ship there is also 1 l space between the fore and aft ends of the ship and the sides of the domain which are also modeled as opening type boundary the domain height is approximately chosen as 6 times the air draught of the ship in consideration top and bottom of the domain are modeled as walls with free slip condition the close up view of the refined hull and superstructure mesh for the research vessel is depicted in fig 9 the mesh and the computational domain is renewed with varying heel angle for every case three different ships have been analyzed with viscous cfd at ship s scale the test matrix is comprised of analyses with 35 and 70 knots of wind speeds at the upright condition and at heel angles of 15 30 45 and 60 however due to geometrical limitations the container vessel could have been analyzed up to 35 degrees of heel 5 results and discussion 5 1 effect of wind gradient the results of the wind gradient analyses with respect to normal force in the y direction have been reported in the previous section it has been seen that the normal force experienced by the ship due to the wind action is reduced when the effect of the atmospheric boundary layer is incorporated to the velocity profile in the computational domain smaller ships with air drafts lower then assumed boundary layer height of approximately 12 m are influenced more from the phenomenon in other words a reduction of 43 in the normal force in y direction has been estimated for the research vessel large vessels are also prone to the effect for the container vessel a reduction of 27 in the normal force has been estimated in this section the pressure distributions on the windward sides of the ships will be depicted and compared for the cases with and without wind gradient modeling in fig 10 a and b contours of positive pressure are plotted for the research vessel without and with wind gradient modeling respectively for the upright condition at 30 knots wind speed the pressure contour range has been kept identical for each plot i e the maximum pressure value experienced for the no wind gradient case has been used it is evident from the pressure contours that the pressure along the hull area is overestimated without wind gradient modeling also the pressure peaks experienced in the superstructure area are not seen in the case with wind gradient modeling in the 30 knot wind speed case the average pressure along the profile of the vessel is reduced from 169 pa to 95 pa with the accounting of the wind gradient a reduction of 43 is achieved the reduction in the induced pressure and hence the normal force in the y direction also influence the heeling moment experienced by the ship the heeling moment is reduced from 171 kn to 100 kn with a reduction of 42 the variation in the pressure distribution also influences the position of the center of pressure even though the variation is not as drastic as in the force and moment the center of pressure rises approximately 5 with the wind gradient in fig 11 a and b the positive pressure contours for the frigate are given without and with wind gradient modeling for 35 knots of wind speed as almost all the superstructure except the bridge lies within the range of the atmospheric boundary layer the frigate is influenced from the wind gradient the substantial difference in the pressure contours induced a drop in heel force at the order of 34 the average pressure is also reduced from 268 pa to 178 pa due to the wind gradient the center of pressure rises approximately 2 all these variations lead to a reduction of heeling moment from 2347 kn to 1599 kn a reduction of 32 is experienced fig 11n fig 12 a and b pressure plots for the upright condition at 35 knots of wind speed are given for the container vessel without and with wind gradient modeling respectively results are almost identical to that of the research vessel however owing to the higher air draft of the containership it can be clearly seen that the pressure distribution along the superstructure is identical for both cases above the atmospheric boundary layer model since there is a substantial amount of superstructure area outside the atmospheric boundary layer the reduction in the normal force in y direction and average pressure is at the order of 27 for the container vessel the center of pressure rises from 14 m to 15 4 m with an increase of 13 when the wind gradient is taken into account combination of these effects result in a reduction of 21 in heeling moment from 9411 kn to 7466 kn 5 2 evaluation of wind induced pressure on ship hulls and superstructures the flow structure induced by the wind on vessels with different superstructure areas and profile designs is investigated in this section fig 13 shows the variation of projected area above water for all ships with heel angle in the graph the normalized projected areas which were calculated by diving the areas with the upright projected planform area for each vessel have been used the actual projected areas have been calculated in cad platform from the 3 d models the projected areas above water of the containership and the frigate increase with heel angle the maximum increase is at the order of 15 for both vessels and the variation is identical over the entire heel angle range although the variation of planform area with heel for the research vessel is identical to the other two vessels for small heel angles up to approximately 15 the projected planform area above water tends to reduce after this point onwards maximum increase of planform area for this vessel is about 12 the wind pressures calculated by dividing the normal force with the projected planform area above water for the respective heel angle are given in figs 14 and 15 for 35 and 70 knots of wind speeds it may be seen from the figures that the variation of wind pressure is similar for the containership and frigate however for the research vessel the tendency differs and there is a constant increase in average wind induced pressure with heel angle as the planform area decreases with heel angle for the research vessel it is expected that the induced pressure will be larger considering the possibility that the wind induced pressures on ships may be calculated by alternative means rather then the criteria it is worthwhile to analyze the pressures induced by the wind on ships in terms of coefficients for this purpose the pressure coefficient cp is calculated as 7 c p p 1 2 ρ v 2 the flow regime around ships may be said to be identical for the analyzed speed range as the pressure coefficients are constant with varying wind speed for the frigate and the container ship the pressure coefficients are larger than that of the research vessel this may be attributed to the fact that the depth of this vessel is smaller compared to the other vessels and the majority of the planform area above water lies within the atmospheric boundary layer the variation of cp is between 0 65 and 0 90 for the research vessel 0 94 1 07 for the container ship and 0 84 0 95 for the frigate the variation of pressure coefficients is plotted in fig 16 5 3 variation of center of pressure with heel angle as the height of the lateral aerodynamic force centroid in other words the center of pressure is directly influential on the magnitude of the heeling moment its position may be considered as one of the major parameters influencing the stability of a ship along with the magnitude of wind induced pressure loads the stability criteria mentioned in the previous chapters hold varying assumptions with respect to the variation of this centroid with heel as the distance between the center of pressure and the half of the draft is assumed to be the moment lever during heel due to the wind any conservative assumption within these criteria would demand ships to be stiffer in terms of stability and maintain a higher area under the gz curve the variation of heeling moment lever with heel angle has been calculated with various techniques and have been plotted for all ships in figs 17 19 the calculation methods are as follows cfd method the vertical center of lateral force has been obtained from respective cfd analysis and half of the draft has been added this process has been repeated for each heel angle geometric method the center of the projected lateral area has been assumed to be the center of lateral force this center has been calculated from the cad model half of the draft has been added to the obtained value this process has been repeated for each heel angle by rotating the cad model and obtaining the center of the projected area cos2 the geometric heeling arm obtained for the upright condition has been modified by calculating it with the square of the cosine of the heel angle cos0 5 the geometric heeling arm obtained for the upright condition has been modified by calculating it with the square root of the cosine of the heel angle this is not evident in the heeling lever magnitudes that are obtained from cfd analysis for all ships the magnitude of the heeling lever reduces with heel angle therefore an assumption of a constant heeling arm may be said to be an over conservative approach in majority of the stability criteria the variation of the magnitude of the heeling arm with heel angle is associated to be in proportion to a certain power of the cosine of the heel angle for representation purposes the variation of heeling lever calculated by multiplying the upright heeling lever with the square of the cosine of the heel angle has been plotted in the above figures the squaring approach tends to underestimate the heeling lever at high heels angles the square root of the cosine of the heel angle is found to be a more compliant multiplier for the various ship types analyzed within this study 5 4 comparison with the current criteria following the post process of the cfd it has been deemed beneficial to compare the obtained results with the current criteria initially wind pressure assumptions within the criteria have been compared with the results fig 20 shows the wind pressure assumption of the imo criteria and the corresponding wind pressures for each vessel calculated from the coefficients obtained from the cfd analysis as mentioned before imo criteria assumes a wind speed of 26 m s and hence the pressure coefficients obtained from the cfd data are dimensionalized with the same speed it is evident that the pressure assumption of imo criteria is well above the cfd predictions the over prediction becomes more pronounced as ships gets smaller which can easily be attributed to the variation of wind speed along the atmospheric boundary layer in fig 21 the wind pressure for the frigate obtained from cfd predictions is compared with the pressure values from imo bv 1030 and dds 079 criteria for comparison purposes either 26 m s or 50 knot assumption has been assumed within the different criteria it is seen that all the three criteria reveal similar magnitudes of wind pressure for the assumed wind condition however the computed wind pressure magnitude is less when compared to the values from the criteria indicating the over predictive tendency of the criteria this is easily attributed to the atmospheric boundary layer assumption and the differences between the criteria values and the computed values are at similar order of magnitude to what has been calculated and reported in chapter 5 1 the magnitude of the heeling moments obtained from relevant wind pressure and heeling arm calculations of the criteria have also been compared with the magnitude of the moments obtained from cfd analysis it is seen in figs 22 and 23 that the commercial ships that are obliged to comply with the imo weather criteria have to be overdesigned against the effect of beam winds the differences between the moments assumed by the criteria and predicted by cfd tend to increase with heel angle this requires the ships to be stiffer at high heel angles and possess higher potential energy than that required in fig 24 the heeling moment obtained from the cfd predictions for the frigate has been compared to the heeling moments calculated from imo bv 1030 and dds 079 criteria in dds 079 criteria the calculations are also performed with the wind heel factor approach although the naval criteria may account for the reduction of heel moment with increasing heel angle the order of magnitude does not match the cfd predictions across the heel range the standard naval criteria tend to over predict the heeling moment at small heel angles while the moments at high heel angles are under predicted in fig 25 the heeling moments obtained from cfd predictions are compared with dds 079 values with the accounting of wind heel factors originally the moment value obtained from the dds 079 wind heel factor method is multiplied by the square of the cosine of the heel angle and plotted with the title cos sq however as given in fig 24 the wind heel factor assumption that may be considered in dds 079 by slicing the superstructure and accounting for each slice with respective moment factors from tables 2 and 3 is multiplied by the square root of the cosine of the heel angle it shows the most reasonable agreement with the obtained cfd results in terms of magnitude and behavior at high heel angles 6 conclusions the aerodynamic flow around a research vessel a container ship and a frigate has been investigated with viscous cfd the ships were analyzed for the beam wind condition at 35 and 70 knots of wind speed for varying heel angles the pressure distributions force and moment data have been processed and compared to the assumptions in the current stability criteria for both commercial and naval vessels for ships which have critical stability reserves according to the relevant wind criteria cfd calculations or wind tunnel tests should be considered for inclusion in the stability assessment it is recommended that benchmark data for certain ship types may be produced from wind tunnel tests for cfd validation in this study the atmospheric boundary layer has been incorporated to the analysis as variation of wind velocity with height from the water surface it is seen that the stability criteria for commercial and naval ships fail to account for this effect resulting in over prediction of wind induced pressure smaller ships are more prone to the effect only the wind heel factor consideration in dds 079 1 may favorably account for the effect amongst the tested criteria when the effect of heel is incorporated to the heel moment magnitude by the square root of the cosine of the heel angle rather than the square of the cosine of the heel angle finally it has been observed that all weather criteria examined over estimate wind heeling moments due to unrealistic assumptions such as wind pressure and variation over heel angles only the wind heel factor consideration in dds 079 1 criteria may produce reasonable results still over predicting when compared to the current analysis this study has shown that cfd analysis may be a viable tool in determining wind forces and moments on ships towards more realistic stability criteria as a follow up study the implications of the results on the weather criterion will be considered for different hull forms loading conditions and above water geometries
