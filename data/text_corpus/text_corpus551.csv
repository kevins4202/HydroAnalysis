this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief quantifying and reducing the errors and uncertainties in high resolution gridded precipitation products are essential for hydrological modelling to generate realistic parameter estimates and accurate model predictions formal bayesian inference provides a powerful tool to quantify rainfall uncertainty and other uncertainty factors in hydrological modelling an efficient way to reduce rainfall uncertainty in hydrological modelling is to merge precipitation estimates from multiple sources prior to their real world applications however it remains a challenging task to optimally determine the weightings of different precipitation estimates based on the predictive ability of a hydrological model especially from a probabilistic perspective this study addresses this issue by evaluating and merging six gridded precipitation products using formal bayesian inference schemes including the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach and bayesian total error analysis batea mcmc describes the total predictive uncertainty using residual error models in contrast batea utilizes the storm depth multiplier approach to separately account for rainfall uncertainty in probabilistic uncertainty quantification a novel signature of model predictability that combines the reliability and precision of probabilistic model predictions is developed to quantify the predictive ability of a hydrological model from precipitation estimates using the proposed predictability signature we examined the benefit of optimally merging multi source precipitation estimates in improving the accuracy of hydrologic simulations by applying the method to the danjiangkou reservoir region drr between 1998 and 2007 the analysis demonstrates that 1 batea compared to mcmc can provide more realistic estimates of model parameters and tighter predictive intervals of daily streamflow when using rain gauge observations as well as gridded precipitation products and 2 the proposed predictability signature is efficient for optimally merging precipitation measurements as it can produce tighter uncertainty bands and better streamflow simulations than individual precipitation estimates this study provides insights into improved quantification and reduction of uncertainty in multi source precipitation products for hydrological modelling keywords precipitation mcmc batea model predictability merging sac sma data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction model and data related uncertainties constitute the two key sources of hydrological modelling uncertainty the model related uncertainty mainly arises from the equifinality of model parameters beven 2006 and inadequate model structure data related uncertainty includes the errors and uncertainties in model input data e g precipitation and temperature which sometimes contributes more to the total predictive uncertainty compared to model related uncertainty refsgaard et al 1983 storm et al 1988 krzysztofowicz 1999 andreassian et al 2001 however in contrast to substantial advances in estimating parameter uncertainty current progress made on separate consideration of input data uncertainty in hydrological modelling is rather limited kavetski et al 2006a kavetski et al 2006b ajami et al 2007 a shift in model calibration paradigm scheme is needed to properly characterize and mitigate the errors and uncertainties in model input for realistic parameter estimates and accurate model predictions our focus in the present study is on a more detailed calibration paradigm that explicitly accounts for input uncertainty while quantifying the total predictive uncertainty using residual error models precipitation is one of the most important input variables for hydrological modelling it is essential then that the precipitation data possess a sufficient spatiotemporal resolution and the highest degree of accuracy possible when used in hydro meteorological models and other water related studies nguyen et al 2018 the current widely used precipitation data for driving hydrological models are from ground based instruments and gridded precipitation products including multi satellite precipitation retrievals hsu et al 1997 joyce et al 2004 huffman et al 2007 hou et al 2014 numerical model based reanalysis products saha et al 2010 and ground based precipitation analysis xie et al 2007 yatagai et al 2012 each of these precipitation datasets has its own advantages and disadvantages villarini and krajewski 2009 mcmillan et al 2012 maggioni et al 2016 nevertheless previous studies have primarily focused on the evaluation and validation of multi source high resolution precipitation products against in situ rain gauge network that encompass multiple temporal and spatial scales hong et al 2007 nikolopoulos et al 2010 behrangi et al 2011 wu et al 2012 li et al 2013 duan et al 2016 camici et al 2018 ma et al 2019 however few studies have been devoted to error modelling and correcting for precipitation estimates some attempts have been undertaken to analyze the error characteristics of multi source precipitation products examples are given in hong et al 2006 hossain and anagnostou 2006 maggioni et al 2014 and wright et al 2017 all of these satellite precipitation error models require an independent sufficiently long accurate reference dataset for reliable and stable calibration in addition to the progress made in satellite hydrology kavetski et al 2006a proposed a rainfall multiplier approach which uses a multiplicative error model for converting rainfall measurements to true rainfall input for each storm event to account for rainfall uncertainty in a formal bayesian inference framework the rainfall multiplier approach is now well established as the basis of the bayesian total error analysis batea methodology kavetski et al 2006a kavetski et al 2006b it allows the modeler to directly and explicitly consider all sources of uncertainty in hydrological modelling including both input and output uncertainties though criticized for unrealistic description of rainfall uncertainties high dimensional calibration issues and limitations on correcting zero valued rainfall vrugt et al 2008 del giudice et al 2016 the batea methodology has been successfully applied to identify rainfall errors in multi source gridded precipitation products huang et al 2018 and rainfall estimates in general e g kuczera et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 thyer et al 2009 renard et al 2011 although the benefits of explicitly accounting for rainfall uncertainty in a bayesian uncertainty analysis framework has been demonstrated for in situ rain gauge networks the advantage of batea over classical markov chain monte carlo mcmc approaches for indirect measurements of precipitation including satellite retrievals reanalysis dataset and ground based precipitation products remains unclear huang et al 2018 provides a preliminary investigation about the effectiveness of batea to reduce the predictive uncertainty in crop modelling for multiple gridded precipitation products however the adoption of a single multiplier factor may be insufficient when longer records of observational data are available this study expands on this approach by examining the efficiency of batea to reduce the hydrological modelling uncertainties from a wider range of gridded precipitation products where traditional mcmc approaches are used as a reference uncertainty quantification scheme along with uncertainty quantification of quantitative precipitation estimate comes the reduction of the errors and uncertainties in precipitation estimates which is achieved through the merging of multi source precipitation products by merging multi source precipitation products the strengths and weaknesses of each precipitation product are maximized or reduced respectively to produce an optimally merged dataset containing less errors than individual products ma et al 2018 the idea of assigning the weights based on precipitation properties helps to acquire better precipitation estimation when evaluated against rain gauge observations but indicates limitations when used for hydrological modelling due to the interaction between rainfall uncertainty and model related uncertainty a better precipitation product does not necessarily guarantee better model predictions qi et al 2016 therefore an alternative for merging multi source precipitation products is to directly link the weights to a priori signatures of hydrological model predictability i e the predictive ability of hydrological models this approach has been demonstrated to be more efficient in improving the accuracy of hydrologic simulations gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 yilmaz et al 2010 initially assigned relative weights to individual precipitation estimate based on the hydrological responses of the land surface model using an auto calibration procedure where the weights were optimized by minimizing the modelling errors a similar procedure was applied by hazra et al 2019 for merging different precipitation estimates within a monte carlo based multi objective calibration framework instead of calibrating the weights on the predictive ability of hydrological model gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 computed the weights as a function of model predictability signatures prior to the application of merged precipitation estimates this method has significantly lower computation costs and is easier to implement in practical applications the majority of studies on this topic can only provide point estimates of model parameters and deterministic predictions rather than predictive uncertainty intervals given the demand for uncertainty quantification and reduction in hydrological model calibration this is an important limitation this study fills the gap by developing a novel probabilistically based model predictability signature which is subsequently used for optimally merging multi source precipitation estimates specifically two desired properties in probabilistic uncertainty quantification the reliability and precision of probabilistic model predictions are considered while deriving the hydrologic predictability signature this study undertakes a comprehensive evaluation and optimal merging of multi source precipitation products in the context of daily watershed scale hydrological modelling our specific aims were to 1 analyze the errors in multi source precipitation estimates through an improved error component analysis procedure using rain gauge observations as a reference dataset 2 quantify the uncertainties in multi source precipitation estimates using formal bayesian inference while achieving aim 2 we explored the question as to whether batea consistently perform better than mcmc for not only gauge observations but also gridded precipitation products and 3 reduce the errors and uncertainties in precipitation estimates by optimally merging multi source precipitation products with respect to aim 3 this study questions whether the proposed model predictability signature helps to improve the accuracy of hydrological predictions 2 methods the proposed methodological framework for quantifying and reducing the uncertainty in multi source precipitation products is shown in fig 1 2 1 hydrological model and model validation we here used the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma burnash et al 1973 burnash 1995 hydrological model to assess the performance of a precipitation dataset through the simulation of daily streamflow in the drr the sac sma model is a continuous conceptual rainfall runoff model with spatially lumped parameters that represents the soil column as thin upper and thicker lower layers of multiple storages and has been used by the national weather service river forecast centers nwsrfcs for flood forecasting throughout the united states a brief introduction of sac sma is presented in appendix a the model involves 16 parameters to be determined wherein the parameters riva riparian vegetation area side the ratio of deep recharge to channel base flow and rserv the fraction of lower zone free water not transferable to lower zone tension water are fixed at standard values based on literature gupta et al 1998 the remaining 13 parameters are retained for model calibration and the ranges of the parameters used in the process of calibration are listed in table 1 several frequently used deterministic and probabilistic validation criteria were utilized to comprehensively assess the model performance deterministic validation metrics included the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 ns computed for log transformed flows lns and modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mns probabilistic validation metrics used to quantify the reliability and precision of probabilistic predictions included the containing ratio cr and average relative interval width aril which were also adopted as objective functions to calculate the weights of precipitation products to be merged an additional performance metric namely the averaged relative deviation amplitude rd xiong et al 2009 was included to quantify the long term water balance error between the observed flows and the mean values of the predictive uncertainty intervals a probabilistic prediction with a larger value of cr and lower values of aril and rd was the goal detailed explanations and equations of the validation methods are provided in the validation metrics for probabilistic streamflow predictions of supplementary methods 2 2 formal bayesian inference 2 2 1 uncertainty quantification framework consider a hydrological model h 1 y h x θ where x y θ represent the vectors of model inputs model outputs and model parameters respectively with the knowledge of the true inputs x and true hydrological processes the true outputs y can be theoretically determined however in real world applications we are essentially limited to inaccurate measurements x and y and imperfect characterization of the true processes inherent in the model h the idealized uncertainty framework proposed by huard and mailhot 2006 considers three different types of errors input errors structural errors and output errors for each type of error affecting the modelling process an additive or multiplicative form of error model is assumed to relate errors and data the additive form of input errors ε 1 structural errors ε 2 and output errors ε 3 is expressed as 2 x x ε 1 y h x θ ε 2 y y ε 3 the common practice in hydrological modeling is to lump output and structural errors by specifying a generalized output error model expressed as 3 y h x θ ε 2 ε 3 depending on how the input errors were handled two types of bayesian inference schemes were applied in the present work mcmc assuming that the input data is error free and batea assuming a multiplicative form of input errors the efficiency of batea in adjusting the errors in both in situ gauge observations and gridded precipitation products is highlighted by comparing it to the mcmc methods 2 2 2 markov chain monte carlo scheme for traditional mcmc method lumping all sources of uncertainties into parametric uncertainty rainfall measurement x is treated as error free i e x x in this case the posterior distribution for all parameters of interest for the measurements x and y is given by 4 p θ β y x y l y x θ β y p θ p β y where the development of heteroscedastic residual error model for deriving the likelihood l y x θ β y is detailed in the development of heteroscedastic residual error model of supplementary methods the priors for hydrological model parameters p θ and output error model parameters p β y are both assumed to follow non informative uniform distribution bounded by lower and upper limits 2 2 3 bayesian total error analysis scheme significant errors and uncertainties in measured input data mcmillan et al 2012 need to be addressed to produce robust parameter inference and realistic model predictions a common approach is to use formal bayesian inference that considers both input and output uncertainty kavetski et al 2002 kavetski et al 2006a kavetski et al 2006b and vrugt et al 2008 contributed significantly to the approach by introducing additional latent variables to rainfall events the true input x is computed by correcting the measured input x via a function g as 5 x g x φ where φ is a vector of rainfall depth multipliers φ φ i i 1 2 n with n being the number of rainfall events the number of rainfall events multipliers is closely related to the accuracy of error correction and also the expected computation costs a higher number of multipliers suggests better error correction and also larger number of parameters to be inferred and larger computation costs here the optimal value of n plotted as a function of rainfall threshold is determined by striking a fine balance between these two competing criteria typically a multiplicative form of rainfall multiplier was assumed kuczera et al 2006 6 x t φ i t x t with log φ i t n μ r σ r 2 where i t is the index of the storm multiplier operating on time step t here φ i t was assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with mean μ r and variance σ r 2 in the batea framework the posterior distribution for all parameters of interest for the measurements x and y is given by 7 p θ φ β x β y x y l y x θ β y p φ μ r σ r 2 p θ p β x p β y where the prior distribution p β x is computed by assigning vague input error models on the hyperparameters β x μ r σ r 2 8 μ r n 0 1 v 2 σ r 2 i g v s where i g v s represents the inverse gamma distribution with shape parameter v and scale parameter s the prior mean is set to zero giving unbiased approximation to the true values the parameter v represents the prior precision of the information content contained in the prior while the parameter s 2 encompasses the expectation of σ r 2 huard and mailhot 2006 the values of v and s are determined based on a priori estimation an adaptive mcmc sampler namely dream zs laloy and vrugt 2012 was adopted to sample from the posterior distributions see eq 4 for the mcmc method and eq 7 for the batea method dream zs uses multiple try mcmc sampling from an external archive of past states to generate candidate samples in parallel chains making it excellent for solving high dimensional and multi modal search problems after chain convergence statistics for all inferred parameters dropped below 1 20 gelman and rubin 1992 a total of 3000 parameter samples randomly sampled from the chains were retained to generate ensemble realizations of model simulations 2 3 merging multi source precipitation products based on the work of gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 a comprehensive measure of model predictability denoted by s was developed in this paper the signature s combines the reliability quantified by cr and sharpness quantified by aril of probabilistic forecasts to facilitate optimal merging of precipitation estimates in the probabilistic context by directly linking the weights to the accuracy of probabilistic model predictions we are interested in we have more straightforward access to the merged precipitation estimate that results in more reliable and precise model predictions s was defined as 9 s i cr i 1 p aril i 1 p 1 p i 1 2 n s cr min 1 cr c r 0 aril max 1 aril ari l 0 where n s is the number of precipitation products to be merged the reliability of probabilistic forecasts was quantitatively measured by cr whereas the sharpness was measured by aril cr 0 and aril 0 are the reference cr and aril values computed from gauge observations respectively p is an adjustable parameter that was used to define the relative weights of the better and worse precipitation products a discussion on how to determine the value of p and its influence on the weights is presented in section 4 2 and section 5 3 the cr and aril metrics are firstly normalized by the reference values to make it feasible to add the two metrics together a lower value of s i indicates better model predictability the merged precipitation product for the whole catchment was determined as a linear weighted combination of the products per eq 11 such that 10 w i 1 s i i 1 n s 1 s i 11 p mgd i 1 n s w i p i where w i is the weight assigned to precipitation product p i and p mgd is the merged precipitation product note that this merging approach was explored at basin scale considering that a lumped rainfall runoff model was applied in this study 3 case study area and dataset 3 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir region drr located in the upper hanjiang river in china fig 2 was selected as a case study area for statistical and hydrological evaluation of multi source precipitation products the hanjiang river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river covering a total drainage area of 159000 km2 with a river length of 1577 km the mean annual streamflow is 1710 m3 s the hanjiang river basin is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate hot and more rain in summer while mild and less rain in winter the mean annual temperature is 14 6 c the average annual precipitation varies between 700 mm and 1800 mm with precipitation between may and october accounting for 75 of the whole year yang et al 2017 the danjiangkou reservoir has a drainage area of approximately 94740 km2 with mean annual reservoir inflow of 3 67 1010 m3 the flooding season ranges from may to october accounting for 77 4 of the annual inflows the reservoir was built in 1973 and it is mainly used for flood control power generation irrigation water supply and tourism purposes the danjiangkou reservoir has served as the water source of the middle route of south to north water diversion project in china since 2014 3 2 multi source precipitation products this study aims to evaluate four satellite precipitation products a reanalysis precipitation product and a ground based precipitation product see supplementary case study area and dataset for details all of the precipitation products were aggregated into mean areal precipitation estimates in the drr using the arithmetic averaging method we choose the simple arithmetic mean technique as a the drr is large enough so that the number of grids overlapped is relatively high 93 overlapping grids for cfsr and 157 overlapping grids for the other five products and b the grids can be treated as approximately uniformly distributed across the drr a summary of these precipitation products is presented in table 2 3 3 gauge observations daily rain gauge data from operational station network are collected from 1998 to 2007 serving as the reference dataset against which multi source precipitation products were compared the total number of accessible rain gauges is 30 with a density of 3158 km2 per gauge these gauges have already been subject to rigorous quality control procedures all of the rain records are collected from the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn en or provided by the danjiangkou reservoir dispatching center of china that is responsible for quality control of the rain gauge dataset including e g the gap filling of missed records and the removal of unreliable records other relevant daily meteorological forcing data including daily maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity solar hours daily average wind speed and daily average atmospheric pressure from 1998 to 2007 were obtained to compute the potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the mean areal climatic variable estimate over the drr was acquired using the thiessen polygon weighting method the daily reservoir inflow records from 1998 to 2007 were also collected from hydrological services at the danjiangkou reservoir in this study all of the forcing data and evaluation data used in this study range from 1973 when the reservoir was built to 2014 when the water diversion project came into effect hence the influence of dam on the inflows was assumed to be consistent the study period extends from 1998 to 2007 by setting the first two years as the warm up period with 2000 2004 for model calibration and 2005 2007 for model validation 4 results 4 1 evaluation of individual precipitation estimate using the dream zs calibration scheme two parameter inference scenarios were investigated for evaluating the hydrologic utility of six precipitation products in driving daily streamflow simulations in the drr during the period of 1998 2007 in scenario i errors and uncertainties in rainfall estimates were ignored and traditional mcmc method was implemented for solving the parameter inference problem in scenario ii errors in rainfall measurements were described through the storm depth multiplier approach and the batea framework was adopted for solving the parameter inference problem for mcmc the total number of parameters to be calibrated was 15 including 13 sac sma model parameters table 1 and 2 output error model parameters β y for batea the dimension of the model calibration problem is dominated by the number of the storm depth multipliers the number of multipliers equivalent to the storm events with rainfall exceeding a specified rainfall threshold i e 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm is plotted in fig 3 for gridded rainfall dataset and gauge observations as the rainfall threshold decreased the number of multipliers increased consistently a relatively large rainfall threshold 10 mm day was selected to lower computation burden and make the calibration problem computationally feasible in this case apart from two hyperparameters β x involved in input error model the total number of calibrated parameters ranged from 94 aphrodite to 119 cmorph adj 4 1 1 evaluation of 95 predictive uncertainty bands the comparison of 95 uncertainty bands between the two scenarios suggests that batea performed consistently better than mcmc for whatever rainfall dataset was used during both the calibration and validation period fig 4 the observed flow duration curve fdc was well enveloped by the 95 predictive uncertainty bands for all satellite datasets indicating that the sac sma model was appropriate for streamflow simulation in the drr however the model performed poorly for simulations of extremely high and extremely low flows especially in the validation period in addition the simulation accuracies for the validation period were generally worse than those for the calibration period for all datasets quantitative assessment of probabilistic predictions by mcmc and batea was further conducted by utilizing a series of uncertainty indicators including cr aril and rd in the calibration period fig 5 a batea showed a slightly larger cr value compared to mcmc for all precipitation datasets except aphrodite on the other hand the aril and rd values of batea were much smaller than those of mcmc for all the precipitation datasets indicating that batea performed better than mcmc similar results can also be observed in the validation period fig 5 b with the exception that the performance of batea as indicated by cr and rd was worse than that of mcmc we also evaluated the performance of various precipitation datasets when mcmc and batea methods were used in the calibration period aphroite and gauge observations produced the largest values of cr among all individual precipitation estimates indicating better reliability of interval predictions in the validation period aphrodite performed consistently better than gauge observations in terms of cr cfsr produced the worst scores for cr aphrodite exhibited the lowest values of aril and rd among all gridded precipitation products and performed similar to gauge observations in both the calibration and validation period persiann cdr and chirps produced the worst scores for aril and rd on the whole aphrodite leads to better overall performance in daily streamflow simulations among all six gridded precipitation products this finding is consistent with the statistical evaluation results of precipitation products in supplementary results which show that aphrodite provided the best estimation of precipitation compared to the other rainfall observations 4 1 2 evaluation of parameter inference the impact of separately accounting for rainfall uncertainty in the batea framework on parameter inference was assessed by using gauge observations as an instance based on the work of gan et al 2014 five highly sensitive sac sma parameters i e uztwm lztwm pfree pctim and adimp in addition to output error model parameters β y α σ were considered the histograms of these seven parameters derived by mcmc and batea respectively are presented in fig 6 and the statistics mean and standard deviation calculated from the histograms are shown in table 3 while some parameters e g uztwm and adimp follow a truncated distribution with high probability mass at the lower bound other parameters particularly pfree show considerable uncertainty with wide posterior ranges the impact of batea on parameter inference was emphasized for uztwm and lztwm the mean value declines from 4 98 to 1 97 for uztwm and from 49 3 to 41 3 for lztwm respectively in addition there was a significant left shift of the histogram for lztwm the output error model parameters β y were among the most sensitive to uncertainty in rainfall measurements a left shift of probability was observed for both parameters quantitatively the mean values of α and σ declined from 0 78 and 1 17 for mcmc to 0 74 and 1 14 for batea respectively table 3 further shows that batea consistently resulted in a lower standard deviation than mcmc for all the parameters analyzed indicating a lower magnitude of parameter uncertainty moreover a left shift in the probability of output error model parameters was observed for the reference dataset as well as other precipitation estimates this confirms that taking rainfall uncertainty into account in the manner of rainfall multipliers leads to parameter estimates that are physically more reasonable 4 1 3 evaluation of mean values of ensemble simulations to provide more insights into the abilities of various precipitation datasets in driving daily streamflow simulations in the drr two independent time windows one during the calibration period 2004 5 1 2004 10 31 and the other during the validation period 2007 5 1 2007 10 31 were chosen and analyzed the mean values of ensemble streamflow simulations generated by different rainfall estimates using the batea framework were assessed fig 7 shows that all the individual precipitation estimates produced daily streamflow simulations that generally agree with observed flows in the drr simulations derived from gauge observations best fit flow records followed by aphrodite persiann cdr and chirps underestimated flows for most timesteps while cfsr clearly overestimated the flows especially during the validation period all the precipitation estimates failed to accurately reproduce extremely high flows suggesting evident underestimation during both time windows this may be due to 1 the use of catchment mean areal precipitation estimate in driving sac sma resulting in the loss of extreme values in precipitation estimates and 2 the inadequacy of sac sma model structure in characterizing rainfall runoff relationship during extreme events however no evident difference occurred in the recession curves for any precipitation products table 4 gives quantitative comparison of hydrologic simulations derived by various rainfall estimates all goodness of fit measures were computed for mean values of probabilistic forecasts given by batea regarding individual precipitation estimates gauge observations resulted in the highest values of ns lns and mns for the calibration periods and the highest values of ns and lns for the validation period followed by aphrodite the best score of mns for the validation period was observed for cmorph adj and aphrodite the best performance was obtained by aphrodite followed by cmorph adj tmpa 3b42v7 cfsr chirps and persiann cdr 4 2 evaluation of merged precipitation estimate in the present study a merging of six gridded precipitation products was conducted using the developed comprehensive signature of model predictability given in section 2 3 this novel predictability signature involves the definition of an adjustable factor p eq 9 which is subjectively determined and not known as a prior to examine how the weights vary with formal bayesian inference mcmc and batea and the settings of the adjustable parameter p we employed a simple sensitivity analysis with p values varying from 1 6 to 3 fig 8 overall aphrodite was assigned the highest weight whereas persiann cdr and cfsr which were the least satisfactory have the lowest weight close to zero for both mcmc and batea regardless of different levels of p values for mcmc the value of p dominated the relative weightings of precipitation products to be merged as p decreased the weight of aphrodite significantly increased accompanied by a decline in the weights for other precipitation products however as p increased from 1 to 3 the weightings of precipitation products tended to stabilize for batea the weight of aphrodite fluctuated around 0 78 the highest among all the precipitation products in contrast to mcmc the p value exerted no significant influence on weight distribution the comparison between mcmc and batea shows that batea tended to assign higher weight to aphrodite while the weights of other precipitation products were largely reduced the linear weights of precipitation products were distributed more unevenly compared to mcmc on the basis of the above mentioned results a p value of 1 was used for the subsequent merging procedure the 95 predictive intervals of the fdcs produced by various precipitation estimates using the mcmc and batea framework are presented in fig 4 a for the calibration period and in fig 4 b for the validation period like individual precipitation products underestimation of peak flows and overestimation of low flows were observed for the merged precipitation product for both calibration and validation periods batea produced significantly tighter uncertainty bounds than mcmc indicated by the improvements in the lower bound across all magnitudes of flows and upper bound of low flows in the drr a comparison of 95 predictive uncertainty intervals derived by various precipitation datasets shows that the merged rainfall estimate obtained better performance than individual rainfall product and comparable performance with gauge observations when batea was implemented the improvement in tightening predictive uncertainty bounds was more evident this was confirmed by fig 5 which gives quantitative evaluation of probabilistic streamflow simulations in terms of cr aril and rd for mcmc the merged rainfall estimate exhibits lower aril and rd values than the best individual rainfall product aphrodite accompanied by a minor decrease of cr compared to gauge observations the merged rainfall estimate decreased the performance on aril and rd but increased the performance of cr especially in the validation period for batea the merged rainfall estimate provided tighter uncertainty bounds as suggested by lower values of aril and rd similar to mcmc there is a reduction in cr when compared with individual precipitation products with respect to the merged rainfall estimate better overall probabilistic forecasts in the drr were obtained for batea on the whole a merging of six gridded precipitation products based on the model predictability signature s has advantages on tightening predictive uncertainty intervals while not significantly deteriorating the reliability metric fig 7 shows the mean values of ensemble streamflow simulations driven by merged precipitation estimate during two independent time windows in the drr for both calibration and validation periods simulations driven by the merged rainfall estimate using the batea framework closely reproduced the key flow patterns e g the peaks and hydrograph in high and low flow periods during the selected time windows no apparent difference between gauge observations and aphrodite is observed during both time windows moreover simulations produced by the merged precipitation estimate clearly outperformed other satellite and reanalysis precipitation products except for a minor reduction of ns in the calibration period the merged rainfall estimate resulted in consistently better performance than individual rainfall products as suggested by increased values of lns and mns in both calibration and validation periods table 4 while gauge observations produced the best score in terms of ns among all of the compared rainfall input the merged rainfall estimate tended to provide improved simulation of low flows as characterized by lns and mns the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed merging technique was validated against the simple average method the performance of probabilistic predictions driven by the associated merged precipitation estimates is presented in table 5 the simple average method is defined as the arithmetic mean of all six individual precipitation products the results show that except for lns the proposed merging technique generated comparable or better scores for all validation metrics this implies that the proposed merging technique based on model predictability signature provided an optimally merged precipitation estimate that yields more reliable and precise probabilistic model predictions 5 discussions 5 1 comparison of gridded precipitation products against rain gauge observations direct comparison of quantitative rainfall estimates supplementary figure s1 shows that ground based interpolated precipitation product aphrodite obtains best overall performance across all error components including hit bias and missed and false precipitation making it attractive as a validation reference dataset for regions where a dense rain gauge network is inaccessible gebregiorgis and hossain 2015 baudouin et al 2020 closer inspection into rain gauge contribution for aphrodite revealed that daily records from 12 rain gauges which accounts for 40 of the total number of accessible rain gauges used as reference precipitation in the case study were included in the process of interpolating the aphrodite product yatagai et al 2012 this controlled the performance of aphrodite when comparing against rain gauge observations the common precipitation information contained in aphrodite and rain gauge network resulted in overall better performance than any satellite retrieval and reanalysis dataset and the discrepancy between rain gauge network and aphrodite can arise from extra precipitation information contained in additional rain gauges not utilized in aphrodite and to interpolation errors 5 2 formal bayesian inference approaches batea vs mcmc two parameter inference scenarios implemented in the formal bayesian inference framework are evaluated mcmc which lumps all sources of uncertainties and batea which separately accounts for rainfall uncertainty a comprehensive comparison of probabilistic simulations generated by mcmc and batea demonstrates the value of the rainfall multiplier approach in reducing predictive uncertainty not only for classical rain gauge measurements but also for multi source high resolution gridded rainfall products in this paper a threshold of 10 mm day was selected to identify rainfall storms resulting in the number of multipliers ranging from 77 aphrodite to 102 cmorph adj this is merely the consequence of striking a balance between enhanced error adjustment operating over longer rainfall records and the overparameterization arising from too many multipliers to be inferred vrugt et al 2008 increasing the number of multipliers had only marginal benefits we acknowledge the possible limitations of the batea framework which include 1 its inability in dealing with missed precipitation and false precipitation and 2 the derivation of realistic multiplier values in the validation period the former arises from the multiplicative form of rainfall multipliers while multiplicative error models have appealing advantages on the simulations and predictions of true error characteristics tian et al 2013 they fail to incorporate missed and false rainfall which can be dominant in satellite retrievals see supplementary figure s1 the benefits from the multiplier approach are largely attributed to the reduction of hit bias the latter drawback lies in the dependency of multipliers on the rainfall events when it comes to the multipliers in the validation period limited information is provided in practical the multipliers for the validation period are randomly sampled from common log normal distribution thus it is not surprising that batea compared to mcmc shows a larger reduction of model performance from the calibration period to the validation period kavetski et al 2006a also pointed out the inadequacy of storm depth multiplier approach in addressing timing errors in rainfall and argued that a more realistic input error model is needed although a variety of satellite rainfall error models that provides spatiotemporal estimates of each precipitation no precipitation scenario has been developed hong et al 2006 hossain and anagnostou 2006 maggioni et al 2014 more work is needed to incorporate it into uncertainty quantification framework in a straightforward manner to promote the application of satellite precipitation products in hydrological modelling 5 3 on the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed merging technique another contribution of this work lies in the optimal merging of six gridded precipitation products based on model predictability signatures compared to gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 where the merging of precipitation estimates was explored in a grid by grid manner a merging of multi source rainfall datasets was conducted herein at basin scale this method maintains the benefits of merging different rainfall estimates to be compatible with probabilistic forecasts two crucial aspects of predictive uncertainty intervals the reliability and sharpness were taken into account to derive a comprehensive measure of model predictability see eq 9 for details the signature was defined as the minkowski distance between cr aril and the ideal point 1 1 with p as an adjustable parameter this distance metric reduces to the euclidean distance when p 2 the manhattan distance when p 1 and the chebyshev distance when p approaches infinity the flexibility of p gives end users more choices on computing the distance to ideal signature values as the p value increases the weights of multiple precipitation products are distributed more evenly fig 8 in addition it allows any quantitative probabilistic validation metric relevant to the objective of the application or preferred by end users to be incorporated into the formulation the simultaneous consideration of reliability and sharpness was previously utilized by shafii et al 2015 for identification of behavioral solutions in multi criteria glue based model calibration the effectiveness of the proposed merging technique for probabilistic model predictions was validated by comparing it with individual precipitation products in addition to the simple average method considering that the best product aphrodite obtained comparable performances to rain gauge observations only limited additional hydrologically relevant information could be provided by the other precipitation products this resulted in only slight improvements for the merged precipitation estimate when compared against aphrodite however we still recommend that merged precipitation estimates be employed to fully utilize hydrologically relevant information of multi source precipitation dataset this is supported by the improved performances of the proposed merging technique in comparison to the simple average method for both probabilistic and deterministic validation metrics inappropriate merging procedures can incorrectly estimate the value of hydrological information in precipitation products for hydrological modelling by either underestimating or overestimating the weights for blending the products from hydrologists perspective optimally merging multi source precipitation estimates based directly on the predictive skills rather than solely on precipitation properties has greater applicational benefits for improved use of precipitation products in data scarce regions a major challenge is to formulate a comprehensive measure of the predictive ability of a hydrological model from precipitation estimates this paper provides a preliminary solution to this issue by combining the reliability and precision of probabilistic predictions however compared to the progress made on the merging based on precipitation properties the advances that have been made on optimal merging based on model predictability remain limited we believe that the approach outlined herein should increase the potential use of precompiled precipitation products in hydrological modelling 6 conclusions confronted with a plethora of multi source precipitation products researchers need to properly characterize the errors and uncertainties in various precipitation estimates and optimally merge multi source precipitation products to provide more accurate estimates than individual precipitation product this paper provides one such example through uncertainty quantification and reduction of a variety of satellite based reanalysis and ground based rainfall products over the drr during the period of 1998 2007 the comparison of various precipitation estimates reveals that aphrodite constructed purely on point scale rain gauge measurements obtains the best scores regarding precipitation detection capabilities and its utility in probabilistic streamflow simulations cmorph adj and tmpa 3b42v7 are among the best satellite based precipitation products comparable performance to satellite retrievals was acquired for model reanalysis dataset cfsr persiann cdr and chirps were least suitable to the drr batea compared to mcmc can provide more realistic estimates of hydrological model parameters and tighter predictive intervals for both rain gauge observations and gridded precipitation products a merging of six gridded precipitation products based on the proposed model predictability signature helps in further improving probabilistic forecasts in terms of predictive uncertainty bounds and mean values compared to individual precipitation product despite the progress made the limitation of the batea framework for indirect rainfall measurements is illustrated for its inability in handling missed and false precipitation future work is needed to develop more realistic rainfall error models relevant to hydrologic applications in addition more studies are needed to investigate the advantages of the model predictability based merging technique over other popular merging techniques on synthesizing various precipitation estimates to advance the predictive abilities of hydrological models credit authorship contribution

this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief quantifying and reducing the errors and uncertainties in high resolution gridded precipitation products are essential for hydrological modelling to generate realistic parameter estimates and accurate model predictions formal bayesian inference provides a powerful tool to quantify rainfall uncertainty and other uncertainty factors in hydrological modelling an efficient way to reduce rainfall uncertainty in hydrological modelling is to merge precipitation estimates from multiple sources prior to their real world applications however it remains a challenging task to optimally determine the weightings of different precipitation estimates based on the predictive ability of a hydrological model especially from a probabilistic perspective this study addresses this issue by evaluating and merging six gridded precipitation products using formal bayesian inference schemes including the markov chain monte carlo mcmc approach and bayesian total error analysis batea mcmc describes the total predictive uncertainty using residual error models in contrast batea utilizes the storm depth multiplier approach to separately account for rainfall uncertainty in probabilistic uncertainty quantification a novel signature of model predictability that combines the reliability and precision of probabilistic model predictions is developed to quantify the predictive ability of a hydrological model from precipitation estimates using the proposed predictability signature we examined the benefit of optimally merging multi source precipitation estimates in improving the accuracy of hydrologic simulations by applying the method to the danjiangkou reservoir region drr between 1998 and 2007 the analysis demonstrates that 1 batea compared to mcmc can provide more realistic estimates of model parameters and tighter predictive intervals of daily streamflow when using rain gauge observations as well as gridded precipitation products and 2 the proposed predictability signature is efficient for optimally merging precipitation measurements as it can produce tighter uncertainty bands and better streamflow simulations than individual precipitation estimates this study provides insights into improved quantification and reduction of uncertainty in multi source precipitation products for hydrological modelling keywords precipitation mcmc batea model predictability merging sac sma data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction model and data related uncertainties constitute the two key sources of hydrological modelling uncertainty the model related uncertainty mainly arises from the equifinality of model parameters beven 2006 and inadequate model structure data related uncertainty includes the errors and uncertainties in model input data e g precipitation and temperature which sometimes contributes more to the total predictive uncertainty compared to model related uncertainty refsgaard et al 1983 storm et al 1988 krzysztofowicz 1999 andreassian et al 2001 however in contrast to substantial advances in estimating parameter uncertainty current progress made on separate consideration of input data uncertainty in hydrological modelling is rather limited kavetski et al 2006a kavetski et al 2006b ajami et al 2007 a shift in model calibration paradigm scheme is needed to properly characterize and mitigate the errors and uncertainties in model input for realistic parameter estimates and accurate model predictions our focus in the present study is on a more detailed calibration paradigm that explicitly accounts for input uncertainty while quantifying the total predictive uncertainty using residual error models precipitation is one of the most important input variables for hydrological modelling it is essential then that the precipitation data possess a sufficient spatiotemporal resolution and the highest degree of accuracy possible when used in hydro meteorological models and other water related studies nguyen et al 2018 the current widely used precipitation data for driving hydrological models are from ground based instruments and gridded precipitation products including multi satellite precipitation retrievals hsu et al 1997 joyce et al 2004 huffman et al 2007 hou et al 2014 numerical model based reanalysis products saha et al 2010 and ground based precipitation analysis xie et al 2007 yatagai et al 2012 each of these precipitation datasets has its own advantages and disadvantages villarini and krajewski 2009 mcmillan et al 2012 maggioni et al 2016 nevertheless previous studies have primarily focused on the evaluation and validation of multi source high resolution precipitation products against in situ rain gauge network that encompass multiple temporal and spatial scales hong et al 2007 nikolopoulos et al 2010 behrangi et al 2011 wu et al 2012 li et al 2013 duan et al 2016 camici et al 2018 ma et al 2019 however few studies have been devoted to error modelling and correcting for precipitation estimates some attempts have been undertaken to analyze the error characteristics of multi source precipitation products examples are given in hong et al 2006 hossain and anagnostou 2006 maggioni et al 2014 and wright et al 2017 all of these satellite precipitation error models require an independent sufficiently long accurate reference dataset for reliable and stable calibration in addition to the progress made in satellite hydrology kavetski et al 2006a proposed a rainfall multiplier approach which uses a multiplicative error model for converting rainfall measurements to true rainfall input for each storm event to account for rainfall uncertainty in a formal bayesian inference framework the rainfall multiplier approach is now well established as the basis of the bayesian total error analysis batea methodology kavetski et al 2006a kavetski et al 2006b it allows the modeler to directly and explicitly consider all sources of uncertainty in hydrological modelling including both input and output uncertainties though criticized for unrealistic description of rainfall uncertainties high dimensional calibration issues and limitations on correcting zero valued rainfall vrugt et al 2008 del giudice et al 2016 the batea methodology has been successfully applied to identify rainfall errors in multi source gridded precipitation products huang et al 2018 and rainfall estimates in general e g kuczera et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 thyer et al 2009 renard et al 2011 although the benefits of explicitly accounting for rainfall uncertainty in a bayesian uncertainty analysis framework has been demonstrated for in situ rain gauge networks the advantage of batea over classical markov chain monte carlo mcmc approaches for indirect measurements of precipitation including satellite retrievals reanalysis dataset and ground based precipitation products remains unclear huang et al 2018 provides a preliminary investigation about the effectiveness of batea to reduce the predictive uncertainty in crop modelling for multiple gridded precipitation products however the adoption of a single multiplier factor may be insufficient when longer records of observational data are available this study expands on this approach by examining the efficiency of batea to reduce the hydrological modelling uncertainties from a wider range of gridded precipitation products where traditional mcmc approaches are used as a reference uncertainty quantification scheme along with uncertainty quantification of quantitative precipitation estimate comes the reduction of the errors and uncertainties in precipitation estimates which is achieved through the merging of multi source precipitation products by merging multi source precipitation products the strengths and weaknesses of each precipitation product are maximized or reduced respectively to produce an optimally merged dataset containing less errors than individual products ma et al 2018 the idea of assigning the weights based on precipitation properties helps to acquire better precipitation estimation when evaluated against rain gauge observations but indicates limitations when used for hydrological modelling due to the interaction between rainfall uncertainty and model related uncertainty a better precipitation product does not necessarily guarantee better model predictions qi et al 2016 therefore an alternative for merging multi source precipitation products is to directly link the weights to a priori signatures of hydrological model predictability i e the predictive ability of hydrological models this approach has been demonstrated to be more efficient in improving the accuracy of hydrologic simulations gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 gebregiorgis and hossain 2013 yilmaz et al 2010 initially assigned relative weights to individual precipitation estimate based on the hydrological responses of the land surface model using an auto calibration procedure where the weights were optimized by minimizing the modelling errors a similar procedure was applied by hazra et al 2019 for merging different precipitation estimates within a monte carlo based multi objective calibration framework instead of calibrating the weights on the predictive ability of hydrological model gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 computed the weights as a function of model predictability signatures prior to the application of merged precipitation estimates this method has significantly lower computation costs and is easier to implement in practical applications the majority of studies on this topic can only provide point estimates of model parameters and deterministic predictions rather than predictive uncertainty intervals given the demand for uncertainty quantification and reduction in hydrological model calibration this is an important limitation this study fills the gap by developing a novel probabilistically based model predictability signature which is subsequently used for optimally merging multi source precipitation estimates specifically two desired properties in probabilistic uncertainty quantification the reliability and precision of probabilistic model predictions are considered while deriving the hydrologic predictability signature this study undertakes a comprehensive evaluation and optimal merging of multi source precipitation products in the context of daily watershed scale hydrological modelling our specific aims were to 1 analyze the errors in multi source precipitation estimates through an improved error component analysis procedure using rain gauge observations as a reference dataset 2 quantify the uncertainties in multi source precipitation estimates using formal bayesian inference while achieving aim 2 we explored the question as to whether batea consistently perform better than mcmc for not only gauge observations but also gridded precipitation products and 3 reduce the errors and uncertainties in precipitation estimates by optimally merging multi source precipitation products with respect to aim 3 this study questions whether the proposed model predictability signature helps to improve the accuracy of hydrological predictions 2 methods the proposed methodological framework for quantifying and reducing the uncertainty in multi source precipitation products is shown in fig 1 2 1 hydrological model and model validation we here used the sacramento soil moisture accounting sac sma burnash et al 1973 burnash 1995 hydrological model to assess the performance of a precipitation dataset through the simulation of daily streamflow in the drr the sac sma model is a continuous conceptual rainfall runoff model with spatially lumped parameters that represents the soil column as thin upper and thicker lower layers of multiple storages and has been used by the national weather service river forecast centers nwsrfcs for flood forecasting throughout the united states a brief introduction of sac sma is presented in appendix a the model involves 16 parameters to be determined wherein the parameters riva riparian vegetation area side the ratio of deep recharge to channel base flow and rserv the fraction of lower zone free water not transferable to lower zone tension water are fixed at standard values based on literature gupta et al 1998 the remaining 13 parameters are retained for model calibration and the ranges of the parameters used in the process of calibration are listed in table 1 several frequently used deterministic and probabilistic validation criteria were utilized to comprehensively assess the model performance deterministic validation metrics included the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 ns computed for log transformed flows lns and modified nash sutcliffe efficiency mns probabilistic validation metrics used to quantify the reliability and precision of probabilistic predictions included the containing ratio cr and average relative interval width aril which were also adopted as objective functions to calculate the weights of precipitation products to be merged an additional performance metric namely the averaged relative deviation amplitude rd xiong et al 2009 was included to quantify the long term water balance error between the observed flows and the mean values of the predictive uncertainty intervals a probabilistic prediction with a larger value of cr and lower values of aril and rd was the goal detailed explanations and equations of the validation methods are provided in the validation metrics for probabilistic streamflow predictions of supplementary methods 2 2 formal bayesian inference 2 2 1 uncertainty quantification framework consider a hydrological model h 1 y h x θ where x y θ represent the vectors of model inputs model outputs and model parameters respectively with the knowledge of the true inputs x and true hydrological processes the true outputs y can be theoretically determined however in real world applications we are essentially limited to inaccurate measurements x and y and imperfect characterization of the true processes inherent in the model h the idealized uncertainty framework proposed by huard and mailhot 2006 considers three different types of errors input errors structural errors and output errors for each type of error affecting the modelling process an additive or multiplicative form of error model is assumed to relate errors and data the additive form of input errors ε 1 structural errors ε 2 and output errors ε 3 is expressed as 2 x x ε 1 y h x θ ε 2 y y ε 3 the common practice in hydrological modeling is to lump output and structural errors by specifying a generalized output error model expressed as 3 y h x θ ε 2 ε 3 depending on how the input errors were handled two types of bayesian inference schemes were applied in the present work mcmc assuming that the input data is error free and batea assuming a multiplicative form of input errors the efficiency of batea in adjusting the errors in both in situ gauge observations and gridded precipitation products is highlighted by comparing it to the mcmc methods 2 2 2 markov chain monte carlo scheme for traditional mcmc method lumping all sources of uncertainties into parametric uncertainty rainfall measurement x is treated as error free i e x x in this case the posterior distribution for all parameters of interest for the measurements x and y is given by 4 p θ β y x y l y x θ β y p θ p β y where the development of heteroscedastic residual error model for deriving the likelihood l y x θ β y is detailed in the development of heteroscedastic residual error model of supplementary methods the priors for hydrological model parameters p θ and output error model parameters p β y are both assumed to follow non informative uniform distribution bounded by lower and upper limits 2 2 3 bayesian total error analysis scheme significant errors and uncertainties in measured input data mcmillan et al 2012 need to be addressed to produce robust parameter inference and realistic model predictions a common approach is to use formal bayesian inference that considers both input and output uncertainty kavetski et al 2002 kavetski et al 2006a kavetski et al 2006b and vrugt et al 2008 contributed significantly to the approach by introducing additional latent variables to rainfall events the true input x is computed by correcting the measured input x via a function g as 5 x g x φ where φ is a vector of rainfall depth multipliers φ φ i i 1 2 n with n being the number of rainfall events the number of rainfall events multipliers is closely related to the accuracy of error correction and also the expected computation costs a higher number of multipliers suggests better error correction and also larger number of parameters to be inferred and larger computation costs here the optimal value of n plotted as a function of rainfall threshold is determined by striking a fine balance between these two competing criteria typically a multiplicative form of rainfall multiplier was assumed kuczera et al 2006 6 x t φ i t x t with log φ i t n μ r σ r 2 where i t is the index of the storm multiplier operating on time step t here φ i t was assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with mean μ r and variance σ r 2 in the batea framework the posterior distribution for all parameters of interest for the measurements x and y is given by 7 p θ φ β x β y x y l y x θ β y p φ μ r σ r 2 p θ p β x p β y where the prior distribution p β x is computed by assigning vague input error models on the hyperparameters β x μ r σ r 2 8 μ r n 0 1 v 2 σ r 2 i g v s where i g v s represents the inverse gamma distribution with shape parameter v and scale parameter s the prior mean is set to zero giving unbiased approximation to the true values the parameter v represents the prior precision of the information content contained in the prior while the parameter s 2 encompasses the expectation of σ r 2 huard and mailhot 2006 the values of v and s are determined based on a priori estimation an adaptive mcmc sampler namely dream zs laloy and vrugt 2012 was adopted to sample from the posterior distributions see eq 4 for the mcmc method and eq 7 for the batea method dream zs uses multiple try mcmc sampling from an external archive of past states to generate candidate samples in parallel chains making it excellent for solving high dimensional and multi modal search problems after chain convergence statistics for all inferred parameters dropped below 1 20 gelman and rubin 1992 a total of 3000 parameter samples randomly sampled from the chains were retained to generate ensemble realizations of model simulations 2 3 merging multi source precipitation products based on the work of gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 a comprehensive measure of model predictability denoted by s was developed in this paper the signature s combines the reliability quantified by cr and sharpness quantified by aril of probabilistic forecasts to facilitate optimal merging of precipitation estimates in the probabilistic context by directly linking the weights to the accuracy of probabilistic model predictions we are interested in we have more straightforward access to the merged precipitation estimate that results in more reliable and precise model predictions s was defined as 9 s i cr i 1 p aril i 1 p 1 p i 1 2 n s cr min 1 cr c r 0 aril max 1 aril ari l 0 where n s is the number of precipitation products to be merged the reliability of probabilistic forecasts was quantitatively measured by cr whereas the sharpness was measured by aril cr 0 and aril 0 are the reference cr and aril values computed from gauge observations respectively p is an adjustable parameter that was used to define the relative weights of the better and worse precipitation products a discussion on how to determine the value of p and its influence on the weights is presented in section 4 2 and section 5 3 the cr and aril metrics are firstly normalized by the reference values to make it feasible to add the two metrics together a lower value of s i indicates better model predictability the merged precipitation product for the whole catchment was determined as a linear weighted combination of the products per eq 11 such that 10 w i 1 s i i 1 n s 1 s i 11 p mgd i 1 n s w i p i where w i is the weight assigned to precipitation product p i and p mgd is the merged precipitation product note that this merging approach was explored at basin scale considering that a lumped rainfall runoff model was applied in this study 3 case study area and dataset 3 1 study area the danjiangkou reservoir region drr located in the upper hanjiang river in china fig 2 was selected as a case study area for statistical and hydrological evaluation of multi source precipitation products the hanjiang river is the largest tributary of the yangtze river covering a total drainage area of 159000 km2 with a river length of 1577 km the mean annual streamflow is 1710 m3 s the hanjiang river basin is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate hot and more rain in summer while mild and less rain in winter the mean annual temperature is 14 6 c the average annual precipitation varies between 700 mm and 1800 mm with precipitation between may and october accounting for 75 of the whole year yang et al 2017 the danjiangkou reservoir has a drainage area of approximately 94740 km2 with mean annual reservoir inflow of 3 67 1010 m3 the flooding season ranges from may to october accounting for 77 4 of the annual inflows the reservoir was built in 1973 and it is mainly used for flood control power generation irrigation water supply and tourism purposes the danjiangkou reservoir has served as the water source of the middle route of south to north water diversion project in china since 2014 3 2 multi source precipitation products this study aims to evaluate four satellite precipitation products a reanalysis precipitation product and a ground based precipitation product see supplementary case study area and dataset for details all of the precipitation products were aggregated into mean areal precipitation estimates in the drr using the arithmetic averaging method we choose the simple arithmetic mean technique as a the drr is large enough so that the number of grids overlapped is relatively high 93 overlapping grids for cfsr and 157 overlapping grids for the other five products and b the grids can be treated as approximately uniformly distributed across the drr a summary of these precipitation products is presented in table 2 3 3 gauge observations daily rain gauge data from operational station network are collected from 1998 to 2007 serving as the reference dataset against which multi source precipitation products were compared the total number of accessible rain gauges is 30 with a density of 3158 km2 per gauge these gauges have already been subject to rigorous quality control procedures all of the rain records are collected from the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn en or provided by the danjiangkou reservoir dispatching center of china that is responsible for quality control of the rain gauge dataset including e g the gap filling of missed records and the removal of unreliable records other relevant daily meteorological forcing data including daily maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity solar hours daily average wind speed and daily average atmospheric pressure from 1998 to 2007 were obtained to compute the potential evapotranspiration pet using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the mean areal climatic variable estimate over the drr was acquired using the thiessen polygon weighting method the daily reservoir inflow records from 1998 to 2007 were also collected from hydrological services at the danjiangkou reservoir in this study all of the forcing data and evaluation data used in this study range from 1973 when the reservoir was built to 2014 when the water diversion project came into effect hence the influence of dam on the inflows was assumed to be consistent the study period extends from 1998 to 2007 by setting the first two years as the warm up period with 2000 2004 for model calibration and 2005 2007 for model validation 4 results 4 1 evaluation of individual precipitation estimate using the dream zs calibration scheme two parameter inference scenarios were investigated for evaluating the hydrologic utility of six precipitation products in driving daily streamflow simulations in the drr during the period of 1998 2007 in scenario i errors and uncertainties in rainfall estimates were ignored and traditional mcmc method was implemented for solving the parameter inference problem in scenario ii errors in rainfall measurements were described through the storm depth multiplier approach and the batea framework was adopted for solving the parameter inference problem for mcmc the total number of parameters to be calibrated was 15 including 13 sac sma model parameters table 1 and 2 output error model parameters β y for batea the dimension of the model calibration problem is dominated by the number of the storm depth multipliers the number of multipliers equivalent to the storm events with rainfall exceeding a specified rainfall threshold i e 1 mm 2 mm 5 mm and 10 mm is plotted in fig 3 for gridded rainfall dataset and gauge observations as the rainfall threshold decreased the number of multipliers increased consistently a relatively large rainfall threshold 10 mm day was selected to lower computation burden and make the calibration problem computationally feasible in this case apart from two hyperparameters β x involved in input error model the total number of calibrated parameters ranged from 94 aphrodite to 119 cmorph adj 4 1 1 evaluation of 95 predictive uncertainty bands the comparison of 95 uncertainty bands between the two scenarios suggests that batea performed consistently better than mcmc for whatever rainfall dataset was used during both the calibration and validation period fig 4 the observed flow duration curve fdc was well enveloped by the 95 predictive uncertainty bands for all satellite datasets indicating that the sac sma model was appropriate for streamflow simulation in the drr however the model performed poorly for simulations of extremely high and extremely low flows especially in the validation period in addition the simulation accuracies for the validation period were generally worse than those for the calibration period for all datasets quantitative assessment of probabilistic predictions by mcmc and batea was further conducted by utilizing a series of uncertainty indicators including cr aril and rd in the calibration period fig 5 a batea showed a slightly larger cr value compared to mcmc for all precipitation datasets except aphrodite on the other hand the aril and rd values of batea were much smaller than those of mcmc for all the precipitation datasets indicating that batea performed better than mcmc similar results can also be observed in the validation period fig 5 b with the exception that the performance of batea as indicated by cr and rd was worse than that of mcmc we also evaluated the performance of various precipitation datasets when mcmc and batea methods were used in the calibration period aphroite and gauge observations produced the largest values of cr among all individual precipitation estimates indicating better reliability of interval predictions in the validation period aphrodite performed consistently better than gauge observations in terms of cr cfsr produced the worst scores for cr aphrodite exhibited the lowest values of aril and rd among all gridded precipitation products and performed similar to gauge observations in both the calibration and validation period persiann cdr and chirps produced the worst scores for aril and rd on the whole aphrodite leads to better overall performance in daily streamflow simulations among all six gridded precipitation products this finding is consistent with the statistical evaluation results of precipitation products in supplementary results which show that aphrodite provided the best estimation of precipitation compared to the other rainfall observations 4 1 2 evaluation of parameter inference the impact of separately accounting for rainfall uncertainty in the batea framework on parameter inference was assessed by using gauge observations as an instance based on the work of gan et al 2014 five highly sensitive sac sma parameters i e uztwm lztwm pfree pctim and adimp in addition to output error model parameters β y α σ were considered the histograms of these seven parameters derived by mcmc and batea respectively are presented in fig 6 and the statistics mean and standard deviation calculated from the histograms are shown in table 3 while some parameters e g uztwm and adimp follow a truncated distribution with high probability mass at the lower bound other parameters particularly pfree show considerable uncertainty with wide posterior ranges the impact of batea on parameter inference was emphasized for uztwm and lztwm the mean value declines from 4 98 to 1 97 for uztwm and from 49 3 to 41 3 for lztwm respectively in addition there was a significant left shift of the histogram for lztwm the output error model parameters β y were among the most sensitive to uncertainty in rainfall measurements a left shift of probability was observed for both parameters quantitatively the mean values of α and σ declined from 0 78 and 1 17 for mcmc to 0 74 and 1 14 for batea respectively table 3 further shows that batea consistently resulted in a lower standard deviation than mcmc for all the parameters analyzed indicating a lower magnitude of parameter uncertainty moreover a left shift in the probability of output error model parameters was observed for the reference dataset as well as other precipitation estimates this confirms that taking rainfall uncertainty into account in the manner of rainfall multipliers leads to parameter estimates that are physically more reasonable 4 1 3 evaluation of mean values of ensemble simulations to provide more insights into the abilities of various precipitation datasets in driving daily streamflow simulations in the drr two independent time windows one during the calibration period 2004 5 1 2004 10 31 and the other during the validation period 2007 5 1 2007 10 31 were chosen and analyzed the mean values of ensemble streamflow simulations generated by different rainfall estimates using the batea framework were assessed fig 7 shows that all the individual precipitation estimates produced daily streamflow simulations that generally agree with observed flows in the drr simulations derived from gauge observations best fit flow records followed by aphrodite persiann cdr and chirps underestimated flows for most timesteps while cfsr clearly overestimated the flows especially during the validation period all the precipitation estimates failed to accurately reproduce extremely high flows suggesting evident underestimation during both time windows this may be due to 1 the use of catchment mean areal precipitation estimate in driving sac sma resulting in the loss of extreme values in precipitation estimates and 2 the inadequacy of sac sma model structure in characterizing rainfall runoff relationship during extreme events however no evident difference occurred in the recession curves for any precipitation products table 4 gives quantitative comparison of hydrologic simulations derived by various rainfall estimates all goodness of fit measures were computed for mean values of probabilistic forecasts given by batea regarding individual precipitation estimates gauge observations resulted in the highest values of ns lns and mns for the calibration periods and the highest values of ns and lns for the validation period followed by aphrodite the best score of mns for the validation period was observed for cmorph adj and aphrodite the best performance was obtained by aphrodite followed by cmorph adj tmpa 3b42v7 cfsr chirps and persiann cdr 4 2 evaluation of merged precipitation estimate in the present study a merging of six gridded precipitation products was conducted using the developed comprehensive signature of model predictability given in section 2 3 this novel predictability signature involves the definition of an adjustable factor p eq 9 which is subjectively determined and not known as a prior to examine how the weights vary with formal bayesian inference mcmc and batea and the settings of the adjustable parameter p we employed a simple sensitivity analysis with p values varying from 1 6 to 3 fig 8 overall aphrodite was assigned the highest weight whereas persiann cdr and cfsr which were the least satisfactory have the lowest weight close to zero for both mcmc and batea regardless of different levels of p values for mcmc the value of p dominated the relative weightings of precipitation products to be merged as p decreased the weight of aphrodite significantly increased accompanied by a decline in the weights for other precipitation products however as p increased from 1 to 3 the weightings of precipitation products tended to stabilize for batea the weight of aphrodite fluctuated around 0 78 the highest among all the precipitation products in contrast to mcmc the p value exerted no significant influence on weight distribution the comparison between mcmc and batea shows that batea tended to assign higher weight to aphrodite while the weights of other precipitation products were largely reduced the linear weights of precipitation products were distributed more unevenly compared to mcmc on the basis of the above mentioned results a p value of 1 was used for the subsequent merging procedure the 95 predictive intervals of the fdcs produced by various precipitation estimates using the mcmc and batea framework are presented in fig 4 a for the calibration period and in fig 4 b for the validation period like individual precipitation products underestimation of peak flows and overestimation of low flows were observed for the merged precipitation product for both calibration and validation periods batea produced significantly tighter uncertainty bounds than mcmc indicated by the improvements in the lower bound across all magnitudes of flows and upper bound of low flows in the drr a comparison of 95 predictive uncertainty intervals derived by various precipitation datasets shows that the merged rainfall estimate obtained better performance than individual rainfall product and comparable performance with gauge observations when batea was implemented the improvement in tightening predictive uncertainty bounds was more evident this was confirmed by fig 5 which gives quantitative evaluation of probabilistic streamflow simulations in terms of cr aril and rd for mcmc the merged rainfall estimate exhibits lower aril and rd values than the best individual rainfall product aphrodite accompanied by a minor decrease of cr compared to gauge observations the merged rainfall estimate decreased the performance on aril and rd but increased the performance of cr especially in the validation period for batea the merged rainfall estimate provided tighter uncertainty bounds as suggested by lower values of aril and rd similar to mcmc there is a reduction in cr when compared with individual precipitation products with respect to the merged rainfall estimate better overall probabilistic forecasts in the drr were obtained for batea on the whole a merging of six gridded precipitation products based on the model predictability signature s has advantages on tightening predictive uncertainty intervals while not significantly deteriorating the reliability metric fig 7 shows the mean values of ensemble streamflow simulations driven by merged precipitation estimate during two independent time windows in the drr for both calibration and validation periods simulations driven by the merged rainfall estimate using the batea framework closely reproduced the key flow patterns e g the peaks and hydrograph in high and low flow periods during the selected time windows no apparent difference between gauge observations and aphrodite is observed during both time windows moreover simulations produced by the merged precipitation estimate clearly outperformed other satellite and reanalysis precipitation products except for a minor reduction of ns in the calibration period the merged rainfall estimate resulted in consistently better performance than individual rainfall products as suggested by increased values of lns and mns in both calibration and validation periods table 4 while gauge observations produced the best score in terms of ns among all of the compared rainfall input the merged rainfall estimate tended to provide improved simulation of low flows as characterized by lns and mns the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed merging technique was validated against the simple average method the performance of probabilistic predictions driven by the associated merged precipitation estimates is presented in table 5 the simple average method is defined as the arithmetic mean of all six individual precipitation products the results show that except for lns the proposed merging technique generated comparable or better scores for all validation metrics this implies that the proposed merging technique based on model predictability signature provided an optimally merged precipitation estimate that yields more reliable and precise probabilistic model predictions 5 discussions 5 1 comparison of gridded precipitation products against rain gauge observations direct comparison of quantitative rainfall estimates supplementary figure s1 shows that ground based interpolated precipitation product aphrodite obtains best overall performance across all error components including hit bias and missed and false precipitation making it attractive as a validation reference dataset for regions where a dense rain gauge network is inaccessible gebregiorgis and hossain 2015 baudouin et al 2020 closer inspection into rain gauge contribution for aphrodite revealed that daily records from 12 rain gauges which accounts for 40 of the total number of accessible rain gauges used as reference precipitation in the case study were included in the process of interpolating the aphrodite product yatagai et al 2012 this controlled the performance of aphrodite when comparing against rain gauge observations the common precipitation information contained in aphrodite and rain gauge network resulted in overall better performance than any satellite retrieval and reanalysis dataset and the discrepancy between rain gauge network and aphrodite can arise from extra precipitation information contained in additional rain gauges not utilized in aphrodite and to interpolation errors 5 2 formal bayesian inference approaches batea vs mcmc two parameter inference scenarios implemented in the formal bayesian inference framework are evaluated mcmc which lumps all sources of uncertainties and batea which separately accounts for rainfall uncertainty a comprehensive comparison of probabilistic simulations generated by mcmc and batea demonstrates the value of the rainfall multiplier approach in reducing predictive uncertainty not only for classical rain gauge measurements but also for multi source high resolution gridded rainfall products in this paper a threshold of 10 mm day was selected to identify rainfall storms resulting in the number of multipliers ranging from 77 aphrodite to 102 cmorph adj this is merely the consequence of striking a balance between enhanced error adjustment operating over longer rainfall records and the overparameterization arising from too many multipliers to be inferred vrugt et al 2008 increasing the number of multipliers had only marginal benefits we acknowledge the possible limitations of the batea framework which include 1 its inability in dealing with missed precipitation and false precipitation and 2 the derivation of realistic multiplier values in the validation period the former arises from the multiplicative form of rainfall multipliers while multiplicative error models have appealing advantages on the simulations and predictions of true error characteristics tian et al 2013 they fail to incorporate missed and false rainfall which can be dominant in satellite retrievals see supplementary figure s1 the benefits from the multiplier approach are largely attributed to the reduction of hit bias the latter drawback lies in the dependency of multipliers on the rainfall events when it comes to the multipliers in the validation period limited information is provided in practical the multipliers for the validation period are randomly sampled from common log normal distribution thus it is not surprising that batea compared to mcmc shows a larger reduction of model performance from the calibration period to the validation period kavetski et al 2006a also pointed out the inadequacy of storm depth multiplier approach in addressing timing errors in rainfall and argued that a more realistic input error model is needed although a variety of satellite rainfall error models that provides spatiotemporal estimates of each precipitation no precipitation scenario has been developed hong et al 2006 hossain and anagnostou 2006 maggioni et al 2014 more work is needed to incorporate it into uncertainty quantification framework in a straightforward manner to promote the application of satellite precipitation products in hydrological modelling 5 3 on the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed merging technique another contribution of this work lies in the optimal merging of six gridded precipitation products based on model predictability signatures compared to gebregiorgis and hossain 2011 where the merging of precipitation estimates was explored in a grid by grid manner a merging of multi source rainfall datasets was conducted herein at basin scale this method maintains the benefits of merging different rainfall estimates to be compatible with probabilistic forecasts two crucial aspects of predictive uncertainty intervals the reliability and sharpness were taken into account to derive a comprehensive measure of model predictability see eq 9 for details the signature was defined as the minkowski distance between cr aril and the ideal point 1 1 with p as an adjustable parameter this distance metric reduces to the euclidean distance when p 2 the manhattan distance when p 1 and the chebyshev distance when p approaches infinity the flexibility of p gives end users more choices on computing the distance to ideal signature values as the p value increases the weights of multiple precipitation products are distributed more evenly fig 8 in addition it allows any quantitative probabilistic validation metric relevant to the objective of the application or preferred by end users to be incorporated into the formulation the simultaneous consideration of reliability and sharpness was previously utilized by shafii et al 2015 for identification of behavioral solutions in multi criteria glue based model calibration the effectiveness of the proposed merging technique for probabilistic model predictions was validated by comparing it with individual precipitation products in addition to the simple average method considering that the best product aphrodite obtained comparable performances to rain gauge observations only limited additional hydrologically relevant information could be provided by the other precipitation products this resulted in only slight improvements for the merged precipitation estimate when compared against aphrodite however we still recommend that merged precipitation estimates be employed to fully utilize hydrologically relevant information of multi source precipitation dataset this is supported by the improved performances of the proposed merging technique in comparison to the simple average method for both probabilistic and deterministic validation metrics inappropriate merging procedures can incorrectly estimate the value of hydrological information in precipitation products for hydrological modelling by either underestimating or overestimating the weights for blending the products from hydrologists perspective optimally merging multi source precipitation estimates based directly on the predictive skills rather than solely on precipitation properties has greater applicational benefits for improved use of precipitation products in data scarce regions a major challenge is to formulate a comprehensive measure of the predictive ability of a hydrological model from precipitation estimates this paper provides a preliminary solution to this issue by combining the reliability and precision of probabilistic predictions however compared to the progress made on the merging based on precipitation properties the advances that have been made on optimal merging based on model predictability remain limited we believe that the approach outlined herein should increase the potential use of precompiled precipitation products in hydrological modelling 6 conclusions confronted with a plethora of multi source precipitation products researchers need to properly characterize the errors and uncertainties in various precipitation estimates and optimally merge multi source precipitation products to provide more accurate estimates than individual precipitation product this paper provides one such example through uncertainty quantification and reduction of a variety of satellite based reanalysis and ground based rainfall products over the drr during the period of 1998 2007 the comparison of various precipitation estimates reveals that aphrodite constructed purely on point scale rain gauge measurements obtains the best scores regarding precipitation detection capabilities and its utility in probabilistic streamflow simulations cmorph adj and tmpa 3b42v7 are among the best satellite based precipitation products comparable performance to satellite retrievals was acquired for model reanalysis dataset cfsr persiann cdr and chirps were least suitable to the drr batea compared to mcmc can provide more realistic estimates of hydrological model parameters and tighter predictive intervals for both rain gauge observations and gridded precipitation products a merging of six gridded precipitation products based on the proposed model predictability signature helps in further improving probabilistic forecasts in terms of predictive uncertainty bounds and mean values compared to individual precipitation product despite the progress made the limitation of the batea framework for indirect rainfall measurements is illustrated for its inability in handling missed and false precipitation future work is needed to develop more realistic rainfall error models relevant to hydrologic applications in addition more studies are needed to investigate the advantages of the model predictability

2756,the transfer of the hydrological information between catchments is founded on the definition of hydrological similarity which is in turn strictly connected to the features to be regionalised in order to characterise the catchment behaviour in the streamflow generation processes the similarity should reflect also the interaction between meteorological forcings and river streamflow time series while previous hydrological research has identified basins with similar meteorological forcings i e similarity of climate or with similar streamflow time series i e similarity of runoff response the present work proposes for the first time to quantify the interaction between the entire time series of different forcing data and streamflow observations to be considered as a novel hydrological signature and used as a catchment similarity metric in particular the present study proposes the use of a multi variate entropy based measure the so called transfer entropy a time asymmetric quantity which analyses the interaction between different signals the concept of transfer entropy is applied for identifying the dominant hydrological processes occurring in a catchment measuring the transfer of information from different meteorological forcings over the catchment to the corresponding observed time series of daily streamflow at the basin outlet the resulting transfer entropy values are then used as signatures to characterise the main catchment dynamics and a classification of the basins region is obtained assuming that similar values of transfer entropy correspond to hydrologically similar basins the methodology is tested on a densely gauged set of more than 200 catchments across austria and the outcomes of the approach are evaluated against a set of morpho climatic catchment attributes and typical streamflow signatures despite the limitations the method is able to distinguish the predominant or partial role of snow melt and evapotranspiration across the dataset helping to assess differences in catchment response time and to highlight the role of very high orographic precipitation in catchments with a dominant snow regime the study demonstrates the potential of transfer entropy as complementary to consolidated streamflow signatures for assessing hydrological similarity and for quantifying the connection between different catchment processes keywords catchment

1 introduction the assessment of catchment similarity has always been addressed as one of the essential steps for transferring information between watersheds through the identification of the dominant hydrological processes and their main characteristics the delineation of similar groups of basins is required for several regionalisation applications rosbjerg et al 2013 it can be implemented for instance for improving regional flood frequency analysis e g castellarin et al 2001 merz and blöschl 2005 rao and srinivas 2006 sikorska et al 2015 for assessing water availability at annual or seasonal scale e g berghuijs et al 2014 holmes et al 2002 viglione et al 2007 or for low flow statistics estimation e g laaha and blöschl 2006 vezza et al 2010 most of the studies implement indices and signatures based on streamflow observations as metrics for characterising the hydrological behaviour of the watersheds looking at the similarity between some of the hydrograph features e g archfield et al 2014 jehn et al 2020 mcmanamay and derolph 2019 sawicz et al 2011 yaeger et al 2012 in the case of ungauged basins climatic and morphological characteristics are typically used instead e g among the many others knoben et al 2018 swain and patra 2019 to identify similarity on the other hand when the transfer of hydrological information regards the streamflow generation processes at fine temporal scale it is essential to capture the sequential order and the stochastic nature of the runoff generation and propagation considering the information content embedded in the entire streamflow hydrograph and also in its forcings to address this issue a few recent studies have focused on different classification metrics that may synthesise the temporal correlation structure of streamflow processes some of them proposed to analyse similarity of runoff temporal dynamics through the parameters of linear models estimating the global autocorrelation function acf of the streamflow time series chiang et al 2002 corduas 2011 de thomasis and grimaldi 2001 grimaldi 2004 others used single autocorrelation coefficients for regionalisation purposes e g castiglioni et al 2010 lombardi et al 2012 montanari and toth 2007 more recently notable contributions were given by singh et al 2016 who used a data depth function to explore similarity of the whole dynamics of streamflow time series for the transfer of rainfall runoff model parameters or by pérez ciria and chiogna 2020 who applied a classification framework based on the analysis of daily streamflow at multiple temporal scales with the discrete wavelet transform alternatively functional analysis can be used to represents different hydrological regimes as functions which enable the exploitation of the full information stored in the time series of annual hydrograph when clustering catchments e g brunner et al 2020 by taking into account the characterisation of the forcing time series as well as that of the hydrograph toth 2013 provided the first ever watershed clustering including measures of the fine time scale variability and correlation structure of both rainfall and streamflow series including a correlation scaling exponent to classify the shape of the hydrograph acfs but such indices are obtained independently for each of the two time series to the best of our knowledge no studies have so far considered the interaction between the entire time series of forcing data e g precipitation evapotranspiration and snow melt and streamflow quantifying it through signatures to be used as clustering metrics such additional signatures may be effective to enhance the assessment of the similarity of the main hydrological processes taking place in different watersheds and in particular for better understanding the controls of the streamflow generation dynamics linear cross correlation analysis which measures the correlation of two time series as functions of the displacement in time of one relative to the other may measure the similarity of different forcings and streamflow signals in order to identify the dominant factors guiding the runoff generation however given the high nonlinearity of the rainfall runoff relationship the use of a metric able to look beyond linear correlation analysis between meteorological inputs and streamflow would be required one of the possible approaches for this purpose is the use of the concepts of information theory shannon 1948 they are based on the notion of entropy i e the content of information of a signal as a time series or in the multivariate case the content of information shared between more variables i e mutual information an entropy based measure particularly suitable for our purposes is the so called transfer entropy schreiber 2000 a time asymmetric quantity which analyses the interaction between different signals information theory based approaches have been widely used in hydrology and water resources during the last few decades singh 1997 reports a first detailed overview of the development of these methods describing typical applications in hydrological sciences they range for instance from the optimal design of river monitoring networks e g alfonso et al 2014 foroozand and weijs 2021 keum et al 2017 and from geostatistics thiesen et al 2020 to quantitative precipitation estimation neuper and ehret 2019 while ben jaafar and bargaoui 2020 showed that mutual information between precipitation and streamflow time series may be linked to the robustness of a conceptual hydrological model a few recent studies made use of entropy terms derived from shannon s information theory for identifying hydrological similarity for example rajsekhar et al 2013 used direction information transfer a standardised version of mutual information to group hydrological units with similar drought severity and duration ridolfi et al 2016 proposed an entropy based approach to define homogeneous regions based on the redundant and total information provided by pairs of hydrometric stations loritz et al 2018 made use of normalised mutual information between the simulated streamflow time series of sub catchments nested within the same downstream catchment for clustering hillslope models into functional groups of similar runoff generation and implemented shannon entropy as measure of diversity in simulations on the same line ehret et al 2020 included entropy concepts in adaptive clustering to simplify and reduce the computational effort of a distributed hydrological model such studies applied the entropy concepts for grouping and characterising discharge or model states time series across the considered study regions more interestingly for the present study bennett et al 2019 demonstrated how the above cited quantity called transfer entropy can be used to quantify the active transfer of information between hydrologic processes at various time scales while they quantified the flow of information between hydro climatic controls and streamflows aiming at evaluating the structure of different hydrological models in the present study the concept of transfer entropy is applied instead for identifying the processes controlling streamflow generation at catchment scale in a first step the different amount of information transferred from the three main meteorological forcings driving the water balance i e precipitation snow melt and actual evapotranspiration to observed runoff is quantified in terms of transfer entropies for all the study watersheds the estimated transfer entropy values are then used as signatures to characterise the governing catchment dynamics in order to better interpret the spatial pattern of the results a classification of the basins is finally implemented assuming that similar values of transfer entropy for the three forcings identify similar basins through a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm the methodology is tested on a large and densely gauged dataset of 206 austrian catchments the resulting values of transfer entropy and the obtained clusters are analysed and discussed against the values of catchment attributes and against a set of typical streamflow signatures the purpose of the present study is to test the potential of transfer entropy for characterising and classifying catchment dynamics as a complement to traditional runoff signatures and flow indices in particular the aim is to explore the ability of the novel signature to capture different aspects of the streamflow generation dynamics providing a further measure for the assessment of hydrological similarity the paper is organised as follows sec 2 introduces the concept of transfer entropy sec 3 presents the study region and data sec 4 gives the details about the methodology used for characterising the basins based on the information flow from meteorological forcings to runoff and sec 5 reports the corresponding results finally sec 6 reports an interpretation of the obtained transfer entropy values and classes and sec 7 gives the concluding remarks on the approach 2 entropy theory and transfer entropy information theory was initially developed in the field of communication engineering in information theory entropy quantifies the uncertainty derived from the probability of occurrence associated to a variable measuring the extent of surprise of a particular outcome by extension entropy is a measure of the amount of information content in a generic signal shannon entropy h x provides a mathematical formula for explaining the information content of a variable x e g the streamflow time series at a given gauge which has a set of discrete probabilities p 1 p n shannon 1948 singh 1997 the average information content associated to x is called marginal entropy and it is given as 1 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where n is the total number of class intervals also called bins representing the possible states of the variable and p x i is the occurrence probability of x in the ith class interval strictly speaking assuming that one bit is the information content of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability shannon s entropy measures the number of bits needed to optimally encode a sequence of realisations of x if for instance x is a constant signal i e it has a unique known value the probability of that event i e the probability that x assumes the constant value will be one while all the other probability will be zero in this case there will be no uncertainty associated to x and the information content h x will be zero on the other hand if x has a uniform distribution i e the probability of each event is equal to 1 n the marginal entropy assumes its maximum at lo g 2 n since 2 h x i 1 n 1 n log 2 1 n n 1 n log 2 n in the multivariate case the joint entropy represents the whole amount of information embedded in more variables in case of two signals x and y it is defined as follows 3 h x y i 1 n j 1 m p x i y j log 2 p x i y j the marginal entropies of a number of signals often contain duplicated information so that the joint entropy should be less than the sum of marginal entropy unless every variable is independent of each other keum et al 2017 consequently it is possible to measure the portion of the information content shared between the two variables x and y that is named mutual information cover and thomas 2005 4 i x y h x h y h x y mutual information quantifies the knowledge we gain about y by measuring the variable x or vice versa conditional forms of the above presented measures of information can be also defined the conditional entropy i e the additional information provided by the entire time series x if we already know the information content of y is given by 5 h x y h x h x y similarly conditional mutual information given a third variable z can also be defined as the information content shared between x and y provided we already know the information content of z 6 i x y z h x z h y z h x y z all the above mentioned quantities are symmetrical except for the choice of the conditioning variables they are not describing the flow of information between variables in other words we do not know if a variable is somehow influencing the others and vice versa schreiber 2000 developed a method for accounting for information transfer which considers the flow of information in time between signals in order to do so the variables are artificially shifted in time given two original variables x t and y t let s consider x t l x and y t l y as new time series built by shifting x t and y t respectively by lx and ly time lags the quantity called transfer entropy can be written as a particular case of conditional mutual information 7 t e x y l x l y i y t x t 1 x t l x y t 1 y t l y where t e x y is the transfer entropy from x to y associated to time lags lx and ly it represents the mutual information between the target variable y at time t and the dependent variable x at all the previous lx time lags conditioned by the knowledge of the history of variable y itself at the previous ly time lags in case of zero lag it would lose its directional nature corresponding to the simple mutual information between x and y more intuitively transfer entropy can be thought of as the additional knowledge we gain about the variable y at time t by measuring x at the previous lx time steps with respect to the information already given by knowing the previous ly states of y it quantifies the effective information flow from x to y given fixed time lags for a more rigorous treatment and definition of transfer entropy see schreiber 2000 the reader can find other applications of transfer entropy as a tool for causal effects estimation for instance in ruddell and kumar 2009 who used it for quantifying information flows within ecohydrological systems or in hlinka et al 2013 who employed transfer entropy to estimate causality of climate networks it has been underlined in the literature that when choosing the values of the two time lag parameters lx and ly there is a trade off between computational complexity and estimation of accuracy and stability schreiber 2000 hlinka et al 2013 showed how the reliability of transfer entropy estimate decreases for increasing values of time lag due to the difficulties in the estimation of high dimensional probability distributions 3 study region and data the study region is austria where data for 206 catchments see fig 1 covering a large portion of the country are available the size of the watersheds varies considerably but mainly under 1000 km2 93 of the basins and none of them exceeds 3000 km2 the topography of the country varies significantly from the flat and hilly area in the north east to the alps in the centre and in the south west particularly steep in the extreme west the annual precipitation ranges from about 600 mm in the east where the evaporation plays an important role in the water balance to more than 2000 mm in the west mainly due to orographic lifting of north westerly airflows at the rim of the alps viglione et al 2013 even if the amount of precipitation and evapotranspiration ranges consistently the aridity index here defined as the ratio between annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation assumes values from 0 2 to 1 meaning that the all the watersheds are mainly wet or weakly arid and annual evapotranspiration is never higher than precipitation i e there are no energy limited basins following budyko 1974 land use is mainly agricultural in the lowlands and forest in the medium elevation ranges alpine vegetation and rocks prevail in the highest catchments parajka et al 2005 data were provided by the institute of hydraulic engineering and water resources management vienna university of technology which previously screened the runoff data for errors and removed all stations with significant anthropogenic effects hydro meteorological data include daily streamflow and daily meteorological time series for the 33 year period 1976 2008 daily average precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration are defined for 200 meter elevation zones for all the study catchments for further detail about the meteorological time series see parajka et al 2005 the potential evapotranspiration is estimated by a modified blaney criddle method parajka et al 2003 using interpolated daily air temperature and grid maps of potential sunshine duration mészáros et al 2002 in addition to hydro meteorological data a set of further morphological and climatic catchment attributes were also made available in order to characterise the basins and to analyse the results of the methodology topographic attributes such as mean catchment elevation and mean slope derived from a 1 1 km digital elevation model climatic features such as mean and aridity index and snow fraction of precipitation were instead derived from climatic input time series while average snow depth was interpolated from the vast snow gauge network covering the country the upper portion of table 1 reports a summary of the presented basin descriptors along with their main statistics across the study region in order to describe the streamflow characteristics of the basins in the study region a set of streamflow signatures is also computed six widely applied signatures describing flow regimes at different time scales across the same austrian dataset summarised in the lower portion of table 1 are here considered to support the interpretation

streamflow signatures will be reported later in the paper to better discuss the outcomes of the proposed approach fig 6 4 methods catchment characterisation with transfer entropy the aim of the study is to show the use of transfer entropy te as a catchment attribute for identifying dominant hydrological processes and for the characterisation of different types of catchment dynamics in this experiment we decided to consider the information flow transferred to the observed daily streamflow time series from the observed daily precipitation and from the other two main components responsible for the runoff generation daily actual evapotranspiration and snow melt such forcings have been chosen due to their dominant impact on the water balance similarly to what done for example also by berghuijs et al 2014 but unfortunately they are not directly measurable and have therefore been estimated though hydrological modelling see sec 4 1 the approach we propose in this work is based on the following hypotheses i for each catchment the flow of information between catchment forcing data the main controls of runoff generation i e rain snow melt and actual evapotranspiration and the observed streamflow can be quantified with its transfer entropy ii if two or more catchments have similar values of such information flow similar quantities of transferred information from each of the forcings they are similar and the streamflow generation mechanisms are dominated by similar processes this section describes the methodology of the proposed approach first actual evapotranspiration and snow melt time series are estimated through the application of a rainfall runoff model then transfer entropy te values from precipitation actual evapotranspiration and snow melt are computed for all the study catchments in order to better capture and interpret the spatial pattern of the te values and to understand the potential of the proposed signature a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm is finally applied for grouping the basins according to the three values of transfer entropy 4 1 estimation of snow melt and actual evapotranspiration through rainfall runoff modelling as introduced previously two of the variables considered as sources of information to be transferred to catchment streamflow are actual evapotranspiration aet and snow melt as in many previous studies e g berghuijs et al 2014 sikorska et al 2015 tarasova et al 2020 these quantities have been modelled since they are very difficult to measure for this purpose it was decided to use the tuw model which was found to behave very well in austria see e g merz and blöschl 2004 neri et al 2020 parajka et al 2005 the tuw model is a semi distributed version of the hbv model bergström 1976 lindström et al 1997 developed by viglione and parajka 2018 and available through the r package tuwmodel for further details about model routines and characteristics the reader can refer to e g merz and blöschl 2004 neri et al 2020 the model is run at daily time step for all the study catchments with the semi distributed model structure obtained by dividing them into 200 meter elevation zones while model daily inputs precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration and model states are defined over such zones the 15 model parameters are assumed to be the same for the entire catchment additional details on the parameterisation are given in appendix a the tuw model is used in the present work exclusively for modeling the actual evapotranspiration and snow melt at daily scale it should be noted that the model is calibrated against the observed runoff and the resulting simulated snow melt and actual evapotranspiration values are therefore not fully independent from the flow observations however such relationship is indirect being due only to the model parameters values and it should not affect the analysis of the information transfer the resulting simulation performances in terms of kling gupta kge and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse calculated on the streamflow values and summarised in table 2 are very good with kge ranging from 0 56 to 0 94 despite the limitation of using simulated forcings the fact that the tuw model is confirmed to perform very well on all the austrian catchments seems to support the assumption that it may be able to adequately simulate also the snow melt and aet values 4 2 computation of transfer entropy having simulated through the model the actual evapotranspiration and snow melt time series the flow of information from catchment forcing data to the observed streamflow is quantified computing the transfer entropy te from each of the three daily time series of precipitation p actual evapotranspiration aet snow melt melt to the observed streamflow q the use of the transfer entropy introduced in sec 2 eq 7 requires the preliminary choice of the values of the time lags lx and ly to be used in the computation as stated above high time lags negatively influence the reliability of the estimates due to problems in the estimation of high dimensional probability distributions in order to minimise these effects but also to keep the methodology as simple as possible for evaluating the potential of transfer entropy in the characterisation of rainfall runoff dynamics in this study it was decided to consider only the previous time step lx l y 1 thus assessing the information transfer between the forcing variable at day t 1 and the streamflow at day t it is of course clear that the target variable i e daily streamflow time series q is influenced by the forcing variables p aet and melt also at time lags greater than one day due to the memory of the hydrological processes occurring in the basin this is a strong limitation in particular when analysing the role of the actual evapotranspiration since the proposed approach can not capture the long term response of the watershed however choosing to consider just one lag allows us to have at least a first order estimate of the impact of the different variables on the streamflow and at the same time to simplify the te calculation for a better understanding of the information flow thus for this parameterisation the transfer entropies from eq 7 for the three independent variables are defined as 11a t e p q 1 1 i q t p t 1 q t 1 11b t e aet q 1 1 i q t aet t 1 q t 1 11c t e melt q 1 1 i q t melt t 1 q t 1 the computation of transfer entropy is carried out within the r programming environment r core team 2019 by using the package rtransferenropy behrendt et al 2019 transfer entropy as every information theoretic measure requires the estimation of probabilities of occurrence such estimate which is a potential source of uncertainty can be performed following various techniques one option is the use of continuous distribution functions e g krstanovic and singh 1992 and in the case of multivariate data the choice of the distribution is limited to a normal or lognormal distribution for which joint entropy can be calculated as a function of the covariance matrix ozkul et al 2000 otherwise no equations are available to estimate multivariate entropy quantities alternatives are for instance the use of non parametric density estimators e g mishra and coulibaly 2009 or the use of discrete probability distributions which define a number of class intervals to approximate the probabilities by the corresponding relative frequencies entropy calculations using discrete distributions have been preferred in the recent specialised literature due to the unavoidable assumptions when choosing a specific distribution function and to the above mentioned difficulties in formularising the joint entropy in many distributions fahle et al 2015 however the discrete entropy term calculations also require an assumption of data quantisation and there is no consensus on which method should be used keum and coulibaly 2017 among the simplest methods for example the histogram method divides the range of the variables in class intervals with equal width while the quantile method uses fixed quantiles as bin boundaries and it is based on the notion that you want to have the tail events i e extreme events in separate bins in general the choice of the intervals quantiles should be guided both by the distribution of the data and by the number of observations in this case behrendt et al 2019 recommend that the number of bins is limited in order to avoid too many zero observations when calculating relative frequencies as estimators of the joint probabilities in the transfer entropy equations the default version of the algorithm sets the bin limits to the 5 and 95 quantiles isolating extreme tail events on the other hand the literature on the use of transfer entropy for purposes similar to our analysis is extremely limited and to the best of our knowledge no reference on the quantisation method is provided for this experiment the effect of different bin widths and types was tested in analyses preceding the present experiment but the results not reported here were inconclusive as expected the binning strategy affects in part the te calculations and consequently the resulting basin classification however this is consistent with the previous findings of keum et al 2017 and keum and coulibaly 2017 which demonstrated how the quantisation method altered the outcomes of other information theory based applications in that specific case for the optimal design of hydrometric networks in the absence of additional guidelines it was finally decided acknowledging some subjectivity in such choice to divide the data interval into five bins based on the quantile method defining a large central interval between the quartiles and dividing the tails of the distribution into two intermediate intervals between 5 and 25 and between 75 and 95 quantiles respectively and two extreme intervals outside the 5 and 95 quantiles another limitation of the methodology is given by the fact that transfer entropy estimates are known to be biased due to small sample effects to address this issue the comparison of the results with those obtained as a benchmark with a shuffling procedure may be used shuffled versions of the independent variable x shuffled can be generated by randomly drawing values from the time series of x and realigning them to generate new time series then the corresponding shuffled transfer entropies can be computed t e x shuffled y this procedure destroys the time series dependencies of x as well as the statistical dependencies between x and y and it thus introduces a white noise against which the calculated transfer entropy can be benchmarked the implemented r tool allows the automatic computation of the effective transfer entropy marschinski and kantz 2002 in order to derive a consistent estimator shuffling is repeated many times and the average of the resulting shuffled transfer entropy estimates across all replications of te x shuffled y is subtracted from the shannon transfer entropy to obtain a bias corrected estimate 12 et e x y t e x y te x shuffled y the number of shuffles is here set to 100 more details may be found in the rtransferenropy documentation behrendt et al 2019 in this paper transfer entropy is always computed in the effective form of eq 12 however for the sake of simplicity we will in the following refer to the three quantities by the terms t e p q t e aet q and t e melt q where the lag specification is also omitted and it is always 1 the computation of transfer entropy values is carried out for all the catchments in the dataset and for the three forcing variables at the end of the process each watershed is characterised by three values of transfer entropy which estimate the information transferred from each of the control variables to the observed runoff 4 3 catchment classification based on transfer entropy the proposed approach assumes that catchment similarity can be associated to the amount of information flow transferred from the different runoff generation components i e basins with similar values of transfer entropy are assumed to be hydrologically similar thus the last step of the methodology is the implementation of a clustering algorithm to group the austrian catchments based on the set of their transfer entropy values as mentioned previously this additional step allows us to better understand the meaning of the proposed transfer entropy te signatures and of their interrelationship merging the spatial pattern of the three new measures into a unique outcome the classification is here named te hc transfer entropy hierarchical clustering distances between catchments are calculated as the euclidean distance in the three dimensional transfer entropy space and their classification is performed using a hierarchical cluster analysis based on ward s minimum variance method ward 1963 even if the recent literature proposes more refined and sophisticated classification algorithms and procedures several studies still use it for grouping catchments based on signatures with satisfactory results e g jehn et al 2020 kuentz et al 2017 ward s clustering is a simple algorithm which minimises the total within cluster variance at the first step each item represents a single cluster then at each step the algorithm finds the pair of clusters that leads to minimum increase in total within cluster variance after merging this is recursively repeated until all the items belong to one single cluster hierarchical cluster analysis has the advantage that it does not require the a priori definition of the number of clusters the algorithm produces a classification tree and the number of clusters is chosen only in a second phase by cutting the tree 5 results 5 1 transfer entropy values and correlation with morpho climatic attributes and streamflow signatures fig 2 reports the results of the transfer entropy computation described in sec 4 2 above it shows the spatial pattern of the estimated information flow from the three control variables to observed runoff across the austrian basins t e p q in panel a t e aet q in panel b and t e melt q in panel c below a histogram for each of the three te component reports the distribution of the values across the range of variability of te it can be observed that t e p q reaches so much higher values up to 0 20 bits and the distribution is more uniform on the other hand the distribution of t e aet q and t e melt q is positively skewed and the ranges of variability are more limited maximum information flow values do not exceed 0 10 and 0 7 bits respectively for aet and melt it is important to specify not showed in the figure that t e p q is negatively correlated with the other two components pearson s linear correlation coefficients around 0 30 while t e aet q and t e melt q are strongly and positively correlated between each other pearson s coefficient equal to 0 78 in order to ease the interpretation of the results the scatterplots of each of the three obtained te against the morphological and climatic features of table 1 are reported in fig 3 where the number inside each plot indicates the corresponding significant pearson s correlation coefficients if the correlation is not significant i e p values above 0 05 the coefficient is omitted the results indicate that all the three entropy components are clearly related to the attributes linked to elevation elev slope snowf and snowd while only t e aet q and t e melt q show relationships with climatic attributes map and aridity however the interpretation of the results will be deepened in the next sections the relationships between the single te values and the set of streamflow indices described in sec 3 are also investigated as mentioned in the introduction of the paper the streamflow signatures synthesise in indexes different flow conditions and aspects of the hydrographs here the purpose is to look for any potential relationships between such measures and the transfer entropies which on the other hand represent the interaction between forcing variables and runoff thus the six streamflow signatures presented in table 1 are computed for the entire dataset using all the available streamflow records while their spatial pattern will be reported in the next section bottom panel of fig 6 when compared to the te hc outcomes here fig 4 shows the scatterplots between the five signatures and the three transfer entropy values again the corresponding pearson s correlation coefficients are reported in case the test is significant p value below 0 05 detailed discussion and interpretation of the te values against catchment attributes and signatures will be given in sec 6 5 2 te hc classification this section shows the results of the te hc classification sec 4 3 the te hc dendrogram showed in fig 5 reports the hierarchical relationships between the basins during the classification process it is a diagram representing the classification tree produced by the algorithm when applied on the sets of three te values for each catchment the vertical axis of the graph represents the height i e dissimilarity between clusters while the horizontal axis represents the catchments names are omitted to simplify the graph given the high number of items at the beginning of the classification process at the base of the tree each basin represents a single cluster moving upward the graph shows how the algorithm finds successively the clusters leading to minimum increase in total within cluster variance and recursively merges them here a number of clusters equal to six is considered suitable to properly visualise the spatial pattern of the combined new te values the six clusters highlighted by the coloured rectangles are generated by cutting the classification tree of fig 5 the upper portion of fig 6 shows a map of the austrian catchments coloured accordingly to the clusters they belong to all around the map a bar plot for each cluster identified by the same color shows the average transfer entropy values of the cluster basins below in the same figure the te hc classification is compared to the spatial pattern of the selected morpho climatic catchment attributes panels a f and streamflow signatures panels g m described in sec 3 finally fig 7 shows the variability of the different basin attributes and streamflow signatures across the obtained clusters 6 discussion 6 1 interpretation of the te values it is important to recall that when calculating the transfer entropy in the present formulation we are estimating the impact i e the net information flow of the independent variables at the previous day looking first exclusively at the obtained transfer entropy te values it was observed that information flow from p reaches higher values than those from aet and melt fig 2 in addition the distributions of t e aet q and t e melt q are positively skewed such outcomes suggest that a 1 day lag precipitation signal can have a more direct impact on streamflow in comparison to the remaining runoff generation components and that for the majority of the basins the information transferred from aet and melt signals on a previous day is less significant beyond these first considerations the interpretation of the resulting values of transfer entropy in the region is not straightforward and an additional understanding may be gained by analysing how the three tes are individually linked to catchment attributes and streamflow features looking at fig 3 which shows the scatterplot between basin attributes and te values it can be noticed that t e p q first row shows a substantial negative relation with mean elevation elev mean slope slope snow fraction snowf and snow depth snowd which are also strongly correlated between each other not explicitly showed here basins at high elevation generally steeper and characterised by significant presence of snow correspond to low values of transfer entropy from 1 day lag precipitation while for decreasing altitudes and decreasing snowf and snowd the range of variability of t e p q increases and the relationship is less clear the impact of p results to be negatively and significantly correlated also with some of the considered streamflow signatures first row in fig 4 δ p a r which is a measure of catchment seasonality shows the same kind of relationship as observed for elevation and presence of snow in fact seasonality in austria is so much more influenced by snow accumulation and melting dynamics than by the seasonality of precipitation itself interestingly the quickness of the runoff response here quantified by the flashiness index is positively correlated to the impact of the previous day s precipitation p with a pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 67 in contrast negative correlation of t e p q to the baseflow index bfi is observed this confirms that the information from 1 day lag precipitation is higher in catchments with the fastest runoff response while it is weaker where additional dynamics e g infiltration and snow dynamics are involved for what concerns the remaining streamflow and catchment features even if more humid catchments usually correspond to higher values of mean annual runoff the first rows of figs 3 and 4 show that t e p q correlates even if weakly with q y but it does not seem to be linked to map finally no significant relations between p entropy values and low high flow statistics lowq and highq are observed given their high mutual correlation t e aet q and t e melt q are linked in a similar way to morpho climatic basin attributes and streamflow signatures second and third rows in figs 3 and 4 in contrast to the impact of p they are positively correlated pearson s correlation between 0 6 and 0 7 with elevation and presence of snow and flatter catchments corresponds in general to low impact of aet and melt mean annual precipitation map higher in mountainous basins due to the orographic component is also positively correlated with the information flow from melt and more weakly with the impact of aet person s correlations equal to 0 63 and 0 43 respectively in addition more arid catchments are characterised by low information flow from actual evapotranspiration and snow melt consistently high impact of such two components matches with high seasonality δ p a r which as mentioned above is one of primary characteristics of snow dominated catchments in austria they accumulate water in the form of snow during the autumn and winter and release it during spring and summer seasons when snow melt occurs due to the temperature rise finally 1 day lag aet and especially melt te are negatively correlated with low flow statistics lowq and positively correlated with high flow statistics highq in austria in fact seasonal and snow dominated behaviour seems to be associated with more pronounced low and high flows as can be observed looking at their spatial pattern compared to that of δ p a r fig 6h i l on one hand snow deposition in the catchments instead of rain is responsible for small low flows occurring in winter on the other hand the combination of high orographic precipitations and snow melt in spring and summer leads to particularly strong high flows in the more seasonal regions the results discussed so far show that the three considered transfer entropy variables alone are able to capture multiple climatic morphological and hydrological characteristics across the dataset in general from such first considerations we can mainly observe that i in austria the differences in transfer entropy explain mainly those catchments attributes and streamflow signatures linked to snow accumulation and melting processes and that ii the information transferred from precipitation signal on a previous day is able to quantify the quickness of the runoff response 6 2 interpretation of the te hc classes the proposed classification based on the transfer entropy values here named te hc eases the interpretation of the results merging the spatial pattern of the three signatures in a single map in addition considering a set of clusters instead of single values allows one to highlight macro differences between catchments and to simplify the spatial pattern as mentioned previously the results of the classification illustrated in the upper portion of fig 6 are analysed herein against the spatial pattern of the morpho climatic catchment attributes and streamflow signatures below in the same fig 6 in addition boxplots of fig 7 show their values inside the clusters looking at the results of the te hc it can be first noticed how the methodology is able to capture and isolate the catchments with the greatest amount of information flow from precipitation t e p q cluster 5 and 6 respectively light and dark blue group the catchments with the highest impact of p and low impact of aet and melt these basins are indeed typically flat and located at the lowest elevations fig 6a where the presence of snow is not relevant fig 7a b e f such clusters show consistently the highest flashiness index fig 6m and fig 7m at the same time they are characterised by the lowest baseflow fig 7n and the lowest seasonality fig 7h in the more flashy catchments in fact the delayed runoff components due e g to groundwater release or snow seasonal dynamics have low influence and the runoff response is highly dependent on single rainfall events such hydrological behaviour is particularly pronounced in the north east and for a little area in the extreme west corresponding with cluster 6 which consistently match the regions labelled as more flashy by previous studies due to more convective precipitations and rapidly draining soils e g gaál et al 2012 viglione et al 2013 similar low information flow from aet and melt but lower impact of p even if still predominant on snow processes characterise cluster 4 green located in the area at mid low elevation mainly in the south and in the east snow presence is also low but differently from cluster 5 and 6 mean annual precipitation fig 7c is the lowest and consistently with the lower impact of p the hydrograph dynamics are slower higher bfi and lower flashiness in fact cluster 4 is mainly located in areas characterised by pervious soils as highlighted by viglione et al 2013 where catchments are typically able to self regulate the runoff for this reason it shows also the highest low flows lowq fig 7i on the other hand for clusters 1 yellow and 2 red located along the alps the information flow from precipitation is not predominant in particular for cluster 1 the impact of 1 day lag melt and especially of aet which is maximum exceeds that of p it groups snow dominated catchments located at the highest elevation with the most pronounced seasonality fig 7a e h in fact besides its direct effect on the water balance transfer entropy from aet highly depending on temperature may be linked also to the runoff seasonality catchments with high seasonality have aet and q in phase during the year while this is not valid in catchments with low seasonal behaviour consistently and as already mentioned the delayed snow dynamics lead such catchments to have the highest baseflow index bfi cluster 2 includes instead those alpine catchments at slightly lower elevation with less extreme snowy and seasonal behaviour where the information flow from aet and melt is similar to that from p they are located mainly in the eastern part of the alps finally cluster 3 magenta is located in between it identifies catchments with strong impact of snow components but where the information flow from precipitation is still prevalent in fact t e aet q and t e melt q are similar to those of cluster 1 but at the same time t e p q is stronger interestingly these alpine catchments are located exclusively on the northern side of the mountain chain characterised by the highest annual precipitation of the country fig 6c and fig 7c due as already mentioned to the orographic lifting of the north western airflows but where snow dynamics also strongly influence rainfall runoff transformation processes see e g merz and blöschl 2009 in this region the very high precipitations contribute on one side to a significant snow accumulation but at the same time recent rainfall has had a direct impact on the runoff in fact even if map is so much higher than in the other alpine catchments snow accumulation snowd fig 7f is still one of the largest in the region with respect to the other alpine catchments the strong impact of 1 day lag p is reflected also in the stronger flashiness and slightly lower seasonality fig 7h m the identification of snow dominated catchments clusters 1 2 and 3 matches in general with those obtained by previous studies either based e g on signatures viglione et al 2013 on the drivers of flood timescales gaál et al 2012 or on parameter sensitivity analysis sleziak et al 2018 looking overall at the pattern of te components catchment attributes and streamflow signatures we observe increasing predominant impact of p compared to aet and melt components moving from cluster 1 to 6 corresponding to decreasing elevation and snow presence fig 7a e f weaker seasonality and faster hydrograph dynamics fig 7h m n in addition even if clusters 4 to 6 are characterised by a higher aridity index fig 7d and a lower annual discharge fig 7g they still show a much predominant impact of p moreover even if we would expect a certain impact of evapotranspiration in such most arid catchments the information flow from aet is actually the smallest this may be due to the 1 day time lag considered for the experiment hiding the slower contributions of the variable to the water balance on the other hand q y index is higher in cluster 1 and 2 but it is maximum for cluster 3 due to the highest orographic precipitations consistently matching the larger t e p q observed in the upper panel of fig 6 finally differences in lowq and highq are not clearly highlighted through the te classes fig 7i l except for clusters 1 and 3 characterised by the highest impact of aet and melt and by a highly seasonal behaviour which in austria correspond also to weaker low flows and slightly stronger high flows overall it can be observed that the obtained classification which relies exclusively on just three entropy based quantities is consistent with the values of basin attributes and streamflow signatures and with the overall interpretation of austrian hydrology analysed in previous literature in fact this analysis demonstrated that information flows between rainfall runoff drivers can be used as metrics for hydrological similarity it has to be accepted that the study has a few limitations the first is that transfer entropy values are calculated based on a single time lag but on the other hand the size of the basins is overall small secondly since the purpose was to assess the potential of transfer entropy for catchment characterisation in the most parsimonious way te hc was implemented considering information flow just from the three main meteorological forcing components and it can not take into account all the governing hydrological phenomena despite the limitations the approach is able to distinguish the predominant or partial role of snow melt and evapotranspiration across the dataset at the same time the amount of information flow transferred from the precipitation to the runoff hydrograph measuring the impact of rainfall events occurring in the previous day can help on one side to highlight differences in catchment response time but also to capture the direct effect of very high orographic precipitation on the runoff in mountain and snow dominated watersheds as demonstrated by the delineation of cluster 3 that groups the basins on the more humid side of the alpine chain for such reasons we believe that transfer entropy deserves further attention and investigation since it may be seen as an additional instrument to characterise catchment dynamics that are not fully captured by streamflow signatures alone by providing a measure of the interaction between forcing variables and runoff 7 conclusions a novel approach for the characterisation and classification of catchment dynamics through the quantification of the information flows between meteorological runoff forcings and runoff itself has been proposed the central purpose of the analysis is to demonstrate the potential of transfer entropy measures for assessing the similarity in the main hydrological processes governing the rainfall runoff transformation transfer entropy considers the interaction between each one of the entire meteorological forcing time series and it is able to quantify the amount of information transferred from them to the streamflow time series the literature regarding catchment classification normally involves similarity measures based on different streamflow signatures or morphological and climatic features independently from each other this work aimed to show how transfer entropy can be used as a complementary tool for identifying and highlighting similar catchment dynamics this may be particularly interesting when the interaction between forcing variables and runoff needs to be understood as for instance in the case of calibration and regionalisation of rainfall runoff models the information flow from i measured daily precipitation ii simulated actual evapotranspiration and iii simulated snow melt to daily runoff time series was estimated through the computation of transfer entropy values in order to avoid incurring further uncertainties due to the estimate of high dimensional probability distributions and at the same time to simplify the transfer entropy calculation thus allowing a better understanding of the information flow transfer entropy was computed in this work considering only one previous time step 1 day lag transfer entropy even though runoff is certainly affected by forcing variables at greater time lags the analysis can still provide a first order estimate of the transfer entropy and of its ability in identifying useful catchment dynamics future analyses will indeed require the inclusion of higher time lags in transfer entropy computation as well as the inclusion of further runoff forcing components as control variables but this is beyond the scope of this pathfinder article the obtained standardised transfer entropies were first analysed comparing them to the values of available catchment attributes and to a set of six streamflow signatures trying to better understand the results of the transfer entropy calculation in general the differences in transfer entropy tend to be partially explained by catchments features linked to orography which plays a central role in the hydrological behaviour of catchments in such alpine region but at the same time it is noteworthy that the three transfer entropy metrics alone capture meaningful relationships with multiple descriptors and flow characteristics then the transfer entropy values were used as catchment features when applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm the rationale of the method is that similar values of information flow between meteorological forcing and streamflow time series mean similar catchment dynamics within the limitation of the study the results of the classification are promising the method is able to distinguish the predominant or partial role of snow melt and evapotranspiration across the dataset and measuring the impact of rainfall events occurring in the previous day it can help to highlight differences catchment response time and the role of very high orographic precipitation in snow dominated catchments the transfer entropy hierarchical clustering te hc based exclusively on the three indices representing the interaction between forcings meteorological data and runoff is consistent with the results of previous works e g gaál et al 2012 sleziak et al 2018 viglione et al 2013 and with the pattern of the selected streamflow signatures and catchment attributes the methodology demonstrates its ability to capture similarity between more features of the runoff hydrograph described by the indices and confirm therefore the useful contribution of information flow based metrics the present analysis demonstrates the potential of te hc and in particular the potential of transfer entropy as an additional instrument for assessing hydrological similarity and for quantifying the connection between different processes it deserves further investigation and should be seen as a complementary approach to classification techniques based on consolidated streamflow signatures in particular given that te hc is based on the concept of information flow between high resolution forcing and streamflow time series it appears promising especially when the classification aims to detect similarity in dominant hydrological dynamics like the transfer of rainfall runoff model parameters for instance in fact gauged classifications like te hc may help to train clustering algorithms based on basin attributes alone as done e g by jehn et al 2020 mcmanamay and derolph 2019 toth 2013 in the ungauged case or they can be directly implemented in regionalisation frameworks e g masih et al 2010 pool et al 2021 we trust that this work provides a platform for the extension of the ideas and forthcoming experiments will focus on coupling the use of transfer entropy in catchment classification to the application of rainfall runoff model regionalisation techniques testing the improvement allowed by using such novel clusters as founding point of the regionalisation framework

2756,the transfer of the hydrological information between catchments is founded on the definition of hydrological similarity which is in turn strictly connected to the features to be regionalised in order to characterise the catchment behaviour in the streamflow generation processes the similarity should reflect also the interaction between meteorological forcings and river streamflow time series while previous hydrological research has identified basins with similar meteorological forcings i e similarity of climate or with similar streamflow time series i e similarity of runoff response the present work proposes for the first time to quantify the interaction between the entire time series of different forcing data and streamflow observations to be considered as a novel hydrological signature and used as a catchment similarity metric in particular the present study proposes the use of a multi variate entropy based measure the so called transfer entropy a time asymmetric quantity which analyses the interaction between different signals the concept of transfer entropy is applied for identifying the dominant hydrological processes occurring in a catchment measuring the transfer of information from different meteorological forcings over the catchment to the corresponding observed time series of daily streamflow at the basin outlet the resulting transfer entropy values are then used as signatures to characterise the main catchment dynamics and a classification of the basins region is obtained assuming that similar values of transfer entropy correspond to hydrologically similar basins the methodology is tested on a densely gauged set of more than 200 catchments across austria and the outcomes of the approach are evaluated against a set of morpho climatic catchment attributes and typical streamflow signatures despite the limitations the method is able to distinguish the predominant or partial role of snow melt and evapotranspiration across the dataset helping to assess differences in catchment response time and to highlight the role of very high orographic precipitation in catchments with a dominant snow regime the study demonstrates the potential of transfer

1 introduction the assessment of catchment similarity has always been addressed as one of the essential steps for transferring information between watersheds through the identification of the dominant

archfield et al 2014 jehn et al 2020 mcmanamay and derolph 2019 sawicz et al 2011 yaeger et al 2012 in the case of ungauged basins climatic and morphological characteristics are typically used instead e g among the many others knoben et al 2018 swain and patra 2019 to identify similarity on the other hand when the transfer of hydrological information regards the streamflow generation processes at fine temporal scale it is essential to capture the sequential order and the stochastic nature of the runoff generation and propagation considering the information content embedded in the entire streamflow hydrograph and also in its forcings to address this issue a few recent studies have focused on different classification metrics that may synthesise the temporal correlation structure of streamflow processes some of them proposed to analyse similarity of runoff temporal dynamics through the parameters of linear models estimating the global autocorrelation function acf of the streamflow time series chiang et al 2002 corduas 2011 de thomasis and grimaldi 2001 grimaldi 2004 others used single autocorrelation coefficients for regionalisation purposes e g castiglioni et al 2010 lombardi et al 2012 montanari and toth 2007 more recently notable contributions were given by singh et al 2016 who used a data depth function to explore similarity of the whole dynamics of streamflow time series for the transfer of rainfall runoff model parameters or by pérez ciria and chiogna 2020 who applied a classification framework based on the analysis of daily streamflow at multiple temporal scales with the discrete wavelet transform alternatively functional analysis can be used to represents different hydrological regimes as functions which enable the exploitation of the full information stored in the time series of annual hydrograph when clustering catchments e g brunner et al 2020 by taking into account the characterisation of the forcing time series as well as that of the hydrograph toth 2013 provided the first ever watershed clustering including measures of the fine time scale variability and correlation structure of both rainfall and streamflow series including a correlation scaling exponent to classify the shape of the hydrograph acfs but such indices are obtained independently for each of the two time series to the best of our knowledge no studies have so far considered the interaction between the entire time series of forcing data e g precipitation evapotranspiration and snow melt and streamflow quantifying it through signatures to be used as clustering metrics such additional signatures may be effective to enhance the assessment of the similarity of the main hydrological processes taking place in different watersheds and in particular for better understanding the controls of the streamflow generation dynamics linear cross correlation analysis which measures the correlation of two time series as functions of the displacement in time of one relative to the other may measure the similarity of different forcings and streamflow signals in order to identify the dominant factors guiding the runoff generation however given the high nonlinearity of the rainfall runoff relationship the use of a metric able to look beyond linear correlation analysis between meteorological inputs and streamflow would be required one of the possible approaches for this purpose is the use of the concepts of information theory shannon 1948 they are based on the notion of entropy i e the content of information of a signal as a time series or in the multivariate case the content of information shared between more variables i e mutual information an entropy based measure particularly suitable for our purposes is the so called transfer entropy schreiber 2000 a time asymmetric quantity which analyses the interaction between different signals information theory based approaches have been widely used in hydrology and water resources during the last few decades singh 1997 reports a first detailed overview of the development of these methods describing typical applications in hydrological sciences they range for instance from the optimal design of river monitoring networks e g alfonso et al 2014 foroozand and weijs 2021 keum et al 2017 and from geostatistics thiesen et al 2020 to quantitative precipitation estimation neuper and ehret 2019 while ben jaafar and bargaoui 2020 showed that mutual information between precipitation and streamflow time series may be linked to the robustness of a conceptual hydrological model a few recent studies made use of entropy terms derived from shannon s information theory for identifying hydrological similarity for example rajsekhar et al 2013 used direction information transfer a standardised version of mutual information to group hydrological units with similar drought severity and duration ridolfi et al 2016 proposed an entropy based approach to define homogeneous regions based on the redundant and total information provided by pairs of hydrometric stations loritz et al 2018 made use of normalised mutual information between the simulated streamflow time series of sub catchments nested within the same downstream catchment for clustering hillslope models into functional groups of similar runoff generation and implemented shannon entropy as measure of diversity in simulations on the same line ehret et al 2020 included entropy concepts in adaptive clustering to simplify and reduce the computational effort of a distributed hydrological model such studies applied the entropy concepts for grouping and characterising discharge or model states time series across the considered study regions more interestingly for the present study bennett et al 2019 demonstrated how the above cited quantity called transfer entropy can be used to quantify the active transfer of information between hydrologic processes at various time scales while they quantified the flow of information between hydro climatic controls and streamflows aiming at evaluating the structure of different hydrological models in the present study the concept of transfer entropy is applied instead for identifying the processes controlling streamflow generation at catchment scale in a first step the different amount of information transferred from the three main meteorological forcings driving the water balance i e precipitation snow melt and actual evapotranspiration to observed runoff is quantified in terms of transfer entropies for all the study watersheds the estimated transfer entropy values are then used as signatures to characterise the governing catchment dynamics in order to better interpret the spatial pattern of the results a classification of the basins is finally implemented assuming that similar values of transfer entropy for the three forcings identify similar basins through a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm the methodology is tested on a large and densely gauged dataset of 206 austrian catchments the resulting values of transfer entropy and the obtained clusters are analysed and discussed against the values of catchment attributes and against a set of typical streamflow signatures the purpose of the present study is to test the potential of transfer entropy for characterising and classifying catchment dynamics as a complement to traditional runoff signatures and flow indices in particular the aim is to explore the ability of the novel signature to capture different aspects of the streamflow generation dynamics providing a further measure for the assessment of hydrological similarity the paper is organised as follows sec 2 introduces the concept of transfer entropy sec 3 presents the study region and data sec 4 gives the details about the methodology used for characterising the basins based on the information flow from meteorological forcings to runoff and sec 5 reports the corresponding results finally sec 6 reports an interpretation of the obtained transfer entropy values and classes and sec 7 gives the concluding remarks on the approach 2 entropy theory and transfer entropy information theory was initially developed in the field of communication engineering in information theory entropy quantifies the uncertainty derived from the probability of occurrence associated to a variable measuring the extent of surprise of a particular outcome by extension entropy is a measure of the amount of information content in a generic signal shannon entropy h x provides a mathematical formula for explaining the information content of a variable x e g the streamflow time series at a given gauge which has a set of discrete probabilities p 1 p n shannon 1948 singh 1997 the average information content associated to x is called marginal entropy and it is given as 1 h x i 1 n p x i log 2 p x i where n is the total number of class intervals also called bins representing the possible states of the variable and p x i is the occurrence probability of x in the ith class interval strictly speaking assuming that one bit is the information content of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal probability shannon s entropy measures the number of bits needed to optimally encode a sequence of realisations of x if for instance x is a constant signal i e it has a unique known value the probability of that event i e the probability that x assumes the constant value will be one while all the other probability will be zero in this case there will be no uncertainty associated to x and the information content h x will be zero on the other hand if x has a uniform distribution i e the probability of each event is equal to 1 n the marginal entropy assumes its maximum at lo g 2 n since 2 h x i 1 n 1 n log 2 1 n n 1 n log 2 n in the multivariate case the joint entropy represents the whole amount of information embedded in more variables in case of two signals x and y it is defined as follows 3 h x y i 1 n j 1 m p x i y j log 2 p x i y j the marginal entropies of a number of signals often contain duplicated information so that the joint entropy should be less than the sum of marginal entropy unless every variable is independent of each other keum et al 2017 consequently it is possible to measure the portion of the information content shared between the two variables x and y that is named mutual information cover and thomas 2005 4 i x y h x h y h x y mutual information quantifies the knowledge we gain about y by measuring the variable x or vice versa conditional forms of the above presented measures of information can be also defined the conditional entropy i e the additional information provided by the entire time series x if we already know the information content of y is given by 5 h x y h x h x y similarly conditional mutual information given a third variable z can also be defined as the information content shared between x and y provided we already know the information content of z 6 i x y z h x z h y z h x y z all the above mentioned quantities are symmetrical except for the choice of the conditioning variables they are not describing the flow of information between variables in other words we do not know if a variable is somehow influencing the others and vice versa schreiber 2000 developed a method for accounting for information transfer which considers the flow of information in time between signals in order to do so the variables are artificially shifted in time given two original variables x t and y t let s consider x t l x and y t l y as new time series built by shifting x t and y t respectively by lx and ly time lags the quantity called transfer entropy can be written as a particular case of conditional mutual information 7 t e x y l x l y i y t x t 1 x t l x y t 1 y t l y where t e x y is the transfer entropy from x to y associated to time lags lx and ly it represents the mutual information between the target variable y at time t and the dependent variable x at all the previous lx time lags conditioned by the knowledge of the history of variable y itself at the previous ly time lags in case of zero lag it would lose its directional nature corresponding to the simple mutual information between x and y more intuitively transfer entropy can be thought of as the additional knowledge we gain about the variable y at time t by measuring x at the previous lx time steps with respect to the information already given by knowing the previous ly states of y it quantifies the effective information flow from x to y given fixed time lags for a more rigorous treatment and definition of transfer entropy see schreiber 2000 the reader can find other applications of transfer entropy as a tool for causal effects estimation for instance in ruddell and kumar 2009 who used it for quantifying information flows within ecohydrological systems or in hlinka et al 2013 who employed transfer entropy to estimate causality of climate networks it has been underlined in the literature that when choosing the values of the two time lag parameters lx and ly there is a trade off between computational complexity and estimation of accuracy and stability schreiber 2000 hlinka et al 2013 showed how the reliability of transfer entropy estimate decreases for increasing values of time lag due to the difficulties in the estimation of high dimensional probability distributions 3 study region and data the study region is austria where data for 206 catchments see fig 1 covering a large portion of the country are available the size of the watersheds varies considerably but mainly under 1000 km2 93 of the basins and none of them exceeds 3000 km2 the topography of the country varies significantly from the flat and hilly area in the north east to the alps in the centre and in the south west particularly steep in the extreme west the annual precipitation ranges from about 600 mm in the east where the evaporation plays an important role in the water balance to more than 2000 mm in the west mainly due to orographic lifting of north westerly airflows at the rim of the alps viglione et al 2013 even if the amount of precipitation and evapotranspiration ranges consistently the aridity index here defined as the ratio between annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation assumes values from 0 2 to 1 meaning that the all the watersheds are mainly wet or weakly arid and annual evapotranspiration is never higher than precipitation i e there are no energy limited basins following budyko 1974 land use is mainly agricultural in the lowlands and forest in the medium elevation ranges alpine vegetation and rocks prevail in the highest catchments parajka et al 2005 data were provided by the institute of hydraulic engineering and water resources management vienna university of technology which previously screened the runoff data for errors and removed all stations with significant anthropogenic effects hydro meteorological data include daily streamflow and daily meteorological time series for the 33 year period 1976 2008 daily average precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration are defined for 200 meter elevation zones for all the study catchments for further detail about the meteorological time series see parajka et al 2005 the potential evapotranspiration is estimated by a modified blaney criddle method parajka et al 2003 using interpolated daily air temperature and grid maps of potential sunshine duration mészáros et al 2002 in addition to hydro meteorological data a set of further morphological and climatic catchment attributes were also made available in order to characterise the basins and to analyse the results of the methodology topographic attributes such as mean catchment elevation and mean slope derived from a 1 1 km digital elevation model climatic features such as mean and aridity index and snow fraction of precipitation were instead derived from climatic input time series while average snow depth was interpolated from the vast snow gauge network covering the country the upper portion of table 1 reports a summary of the presented basin descriptors along with their main statistics across the study region in order to describe the streamflow characteristics of the basins in the study region a set of streamflow signatures is also computed six widely applied signatures describing flow regimes at different time scales across the same austrian dataset summarised in the lower portion of table 1 are here considered to support the interpretation of the outcomes of the proposed approach mean annual specific runoff mm yr q y which estimates the overall water availability of a catchment defined as the average daily specific runoff q d during the period of record of length t 8 q y 365 t t 1 t q d t the range of the pardé s coefficients pa r i defined as the mean monthly runoff q i for month i 1 12 divided by the mean annual runoff q y this

originate from other sources of delayed flow e g snowmelt here baseflow is estimated through the ih uk institute of hydrology uk smoothed minima approach gustard et al 1992 natural environment research council 1980 a two component hydrograph separation approach based on progressively identified streamflow minima the spatial pattern of the catchment characteristics and of the considered streamflow signatures will be reported later in the paper to better discuss the outcomes of the proposed approach fig 6 4 methods catchment characterisation with transfer entropy the aim of the study is to show the use of transfer entropy te as a catchment attribute for identifying dominant hydrological processes and for the characterisation of different types of catchment dynamics in this experiment we decided to consider the information flow transferred to the observed daily streamflow time series from the observed daily precipitation and from the other two main components responsible for the runoff generation daily actual evapotranspiration and snow melt such forcings have been chosen due to their dominant impact on the water balance similarly to what done for example also by berghuijs et al 2014 but unfortunately they are not directly measurable and have therefore been estimated though hydrological modelling see sec 4 1 the approach we propose in this work is based on the following hypotheses i for each catchment the flow of information between catchment forcing data the main controls of runoff generation i e rain snow melt and actual evapotranspiration and the observed streamflow can be quantified with its transfer entropy ii if two or more catchments have similar values of such information flow similar quantities of transferred information from each of the forcings they are similar and the streamflow generation mechanisms are dominated by similar processes this section describes the methodology of the proposed approach first actual evapotranspiration and snow melt time series are estimated through the application of a rainfall runoff model then transfer entropy te values from precipitation actual evapotranspiration and snow melt are computed for all the study catchments in order to better capture and interpret the spatial pattern of the te values and to understand the potential of the proposed signature a simple hierarchical clustering algorithm is finally applied for grouping the basins according to the three values of transfer entropy 4 1 estimation of snow melt and actual evapotranspiration through rainfall runoff modelling as introduced previously two of the variables considered as sources of information to be transferred to catchment streamflow are actual evapotranspiration aet and snow melt as in many previous studies e g berghuijs et al 2014 sikorska et al 2015 tarasova et al 2020 these quantities have been modelled since they are very difficult to measure for this purpose it was decided to use the tuw model which was found to behave very well in austria see e g merz and blöschl 2004 neri et al 2020 parajka et al 2005 the tuw model is a semi distributed version of the hbv model bergström 1976 lindström et al 1997 developed by viglione and parajka 2018 and available through the r package tuwmodel for further details about model routines and characteristics the reader can refer to e g merz and blöschl 2004 neri et al 2020 the model is run at daily time step for all the study catchments with the semi distributed model structure obtained by dividing them into 200 meter elevation zones while model daily inputs precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration and model states are defined over such zones the 15 model parameters are assumed to be the same for the entire catchment additional details on the parameterisation are given in appendix a the tuw model is used in the present work exclusively for modeling the actual evapotranspiration and snow melt at daily scale it should be noted that the model is calibrated against the observed runoff and the resulting simulated snow melt and actual evapotranspiration values are therefore not fully independent from the flow observations however such relationship is indirect being due only to the model parameters values and it should not affect the analysis of the information transfer the resulting simulation performances in terms of kling gupta kge and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse calculated on the streamflow values and summarised in table 2 are very good with kge ranging from 0 56 to 0 94 despite the limitation of using simulated forcings the fact that the tuw model is confirmed to perform very well on all the austrian catchments seems to support the assumption that it may be able to adequately simulate also the snow melt and aet values 4 2 computation of transfer entropy having simulated through the model the actual evapotranspiration and snow melt time series the flow of information from catchment forcing data to the observed streamflow is quantified computing the transfer entropy te from each of the three daily time series of precipitation p actual evapotranspiration aet snow melt melt to the observed streamflow q the use of the transfer entropy introduced in sec 2 eq 7 requires the preliminary choice of the values of the time lags lx and ly to be used in the computation as stated above high time lags negatively influence the reliability of the estimates due to problems in the estimation of high dimensional probability distributions in order to minimise these effects but also to keep the methodology as simple as possible for evaluating the potential of transfer entropy in the characterisation of rainfall runoff dynamics in this study it was decided to consider only the previous time step lx l y 1 thus assessing the information transfer between the forcing variable at day t 1 and the streamflow at day t it is of course clear that the target variable i e daily streamflow time series q is influenced by the forcing variables p aet and melt also at time lags greater than one day due to the memory of the hydrological processes occurring in the basin this is a strong limitation in particular when analysing the role of the actual evapotranspiration since the proposed approach can not capture the long term response of the watershed however choosing to consider just one lag allows us to have at least a first order estimate of the impact of the different variables on the streamflow and at the same time to simplify the te calculation for a better understanding of the information flow thus for this parameterisation the transfer entropies from eq 7 for the three independent variables are defined as 11a t e p q 1 1 i q t p t 1 q t 1 11b t e aet q 1 1 i q t aet t 1 q t 1 11c t e melt q 1 1 i q t melt t 1 q t 1 the computation of transfer entropy is carried out within the r programming environment r core team 2019 by using the package rtransferenropy behrendt et al 2019 transfer entropy as every information theoretic measure requires the estimation of probabilities of occurrence such estimate which is a potential source of uncertainty can be performed following various techniques one option is the use of continuous distribution functions e g krstanovic and singh 1992 and in the case of multivariate data the choice of the distribution is limited to a normal or lognormal distribution for which joint entropy can be calculated as a function of the covariance matrix ozkul et al 2000 otherwise no equations are available to estimate multivariate entropy quantities alternatives are for instance the use of non parametric density estimators e g mishra and coulibaly 2009 or the use of discrete probability distributions which define a number of class intervals to approximate the probabilities by the corresponding relative frequencies entropy calculations using discrete distributions have been preferred in the recent specialised literature due to the unavoidable assumptions when choosing a specific distribution function and to the above mentioned difficulties in formularising the joint entropy in many distributions fahle et al 2015 however the discrete entropy term calculations also require an assumption of data quantisation and there is no consensus on which method should be used keum and coulibaly 2017 among the simplest methods for example the histogram method divides the range of the variables in class intervals with equal width while the quantile method uses fixed quantiles as bin boundaries and it is based on the notion that you want to have the tail events i e extreme events in separate bins in general the choice of the intervals quantiles should be guided both by the distribution of the data and by the number of observations in this case behrendt et al 2019 recommend that the number of bins is limited in order to avoid too many zero observations when calculating relative frequencies as estimators of the joint probabilities in the transfer entropy equations the default version of the algorithm sets the bin limits to the 5 and 95 quantiles isolating extreme tail events on the other hand the literature on the use of transfer entropy for purposes similar to our analysis is extremely limited and to the best of our knowledge no reference on the quantisation method is provided for this experiment the effect of different bin widths and types was tested in analyses preceding the present experiment but the results not reported here were inconclusive as expected the binning strategy affects in part the te calculations and consequently the resulting basin classification however this is consistent with the previous findings of keum et al 2017 and keum and coulibaly 2017 which demonstrated how the quantisation method altered the outcomes of other information theory based applications in that specific case for the optimal design of hydrometric networks in the absence of additional guidelines it was finally decided acknowledging some subjectivity in such choice to divide the data interval into five bins based on the quantile method defining a large central interval between the quartiles and dividing the tails of the distribution into two intermediate intervals between 5 and 25 and between 75 and 95 quantiles respectively and two extreme intervals outside the 5 and 95 quantiles another limitation of the methodology is given by the fact that transfer entropy estimates are known to be biased due to small sample effects to address this issue the comparison of the results with those obtained as a benchmark with a shuffling procedure may be used shuffled versions of the independent variable x shuffled can be generated by randomly drawing values from the time series of x and realigning them to generate new time series then the corresponding shuffled transfer entropies can be computed t e x shuffled y this procedure destroys the time series dependencies of x as well as the statistical dependencies between x and y and it thus introduces a white noise against which the calculated transfer entropy can be benchmarked the implemented r tool allows the automatic computation of the effective transfer entropy marschinski and kantz 2002 in order to derive a consistent estimator shuffling is repeated many times and the average of the resulting shuffled transfer entropy estimates across all replications of te x shuffled y is subtracted from the shannon transfer entropy to obtain a bias corrected estimate 12 et e x y t e x y te x shuffled y the number of shuffles is here set to 100 more details may be found in the rtransferenropy documentation behrendt et al 2019 in this paper transfer entropy is always computed in the effective form of eq 12 however for the sake of simplicity we will in the following refer to the three quantities by the terms t e p q t e aet q and t e melt q where the lag specification is also omitted and it is always 1 the computation of transfer entropy values is carried out for all the catchments in the dataset and for the three forcing variables at the end of the process each watershed is characterised by three values of transfer entropy which estimate the information transferred from each of the control variables to the observed runoff 4 3 catchment classification based on transfer entropy the proposed approach assumes that catchment similarity can be associated to the amount of information flow transferred from the different runoff generation components i e basins with similar values of transfer entropy are assumed to be hydrologically similar thus the last step of the methodology is the implementation of a clustering algorithm to group the austrian catchments based on the set of their transfer entropy values as mentioned previously this additional step allows us to better understand the meaning of the proposed transfer entropy te signatures and of their interrelationship merging the spatial pattern of the three new measures into a unique outcome the classification is here named te hc transfer entropy hierarchical clustering distances between catchments are calculated as the euclidean distance in the three dimensional transfer entropy space and their classification is performed using a hierarchical cluster analysis based on ward s minimum variance method ward 1963 even if the recent literature proposes more refined and sophisticated classification algorithms and procedures several studies still use it for grouping catchments based on signatures with satisfactory results e g jehn et al 2020 kuentz et al 2017 ward s clustering is a simple algorithm which minimises the total within cluster variance at the first step each item represents a single cluster then at each step the algorithm finds the pair of clusters that leads to minimum increase in total within cluster variance after merging this is recursively repeated until all the items belong to one single cluster hierarchical cluster analysis has the advantage that it does not require the a priori definition of the number of clusters the algorithm produces a classification tree and the number of clusters is chosen only in a second phase by cutting the tree 5 results 5 1 transfer entropy values and correlation with morpho climatic attributes and streamflow signatures fig 2 reports the results of the transfer entropy computation described in sec 4 2 above it shows the spatial pattern of the estimated information flow from the three control variables to observed runoff across the austrian basins t e p q in panel a t e aet q in panel b and t e melt q in panel c below a histogram for each of the three te component reports the distribution of the values across the range of variability of te it can be observed that t e p q reaches so much higher values up to 0 20 bits and the distribution is more uniform on the other hand the distribution of t e aet q and t e melt q is positively skewed and the ranges of variability are more limited maximum information flow values do not exceed 0 10 and 0 7 bits respectively for aet and melt it is important to specify not showed in the figure that t e p q is negatively correlated with the other two components pearson s linear correlation coefficients around 0 30 while t e aet q and t e melt q are strongly and positively correlated between each other pearson s coefficient equal to 0 78 in order to ease the interpretation of the results the scatterplots of each of the three obtained te against the morphological and climatic features of table 1 are reported in fig 3 where the number inside each plot indicates the corresponding significant pearson s correlation coefficients if the correlation is not significant i e p values above 0 05 the coefficient is omitted the results indicate that all the three entropy components are clearly related to the attributes linked to elevation elev slope snowf and snowd while only t e aet q and t e melt q show relationships with climatic attributes map and aridity however the interpretation of the results will be deepened in the next sections the relationships between the single te values and the set of streamflow indices described in sec 3 are also investigated as mentioned in the introduction of the paper the streamflow signatures synthesise in indexes different flow conditions and aspects of the hydrographs here the purpose is to look for any potential relationships between such measures and the transfer entropies which on the other hand represent the interaction between forcing variables and runoff thus the six streamflow signatures presented in table 1 are computed for the entire dataset using all the available streamflow records while their spatial pattern will be reported in the next section bottom panel of fig 6 when compared to the te hc outcomes here fig 4 shows the scatterplots between the five signatures and the three transfer entropy values again the corresponding pearson s correlation coefficients are reported in case the test is significant p value below 0 05 detailed discussion and interpretation of the te values against catchment attributes and signatures will be given in sec 6 5 2 te hc classification this section shows the results of the te hc classification sec 4 3 the te hc dendrogram showed in fig 5 reports the hierarchical relationships between the basins during the classification process it is a diagram representing the classification tree produced by the algorithm when applied on the sets of three te values for each catchment the vertical axis of the graph represents the height i e dissimilarity between clusters while the horizontal axis represents the catchments names are omitted to simplify the graph given the high number of items at the beginning of the classification process at the base of the tree each basin represents a single cluster moving upward the graph shows how the algorithm finds successively the clusters leading to minimum increase in total within cluster variance and recursively merges them here a number of clusters equal to six is considered suitable to properly visualise the spatial pattern of the combined new te values the six clusters highlighted by the coloured rectangles are generated by cutting the classification tree of fig 5 the upper portion of fig 6 shows a map of the austrian catchments coloured accordingly to the clusters they belong to all around the map a bar plot for each cluster identified by the same color shows the average transfer entropy values of the cluster basins below in the same figure the te hc classification is compared to the spatial pattern of the selected morpho climatic catchment attributes panels a f and streamflow signatures panels g m described in sec 3 finally fig 7 shows the variability of the different basin attributes and streamflow signatures across the obtained clusters 6 discussion 6 1 interpretation of the te values it is important to recall that when calculating the transfer entropy in the present formulation we are estimating the impact i e the net information flow of the independent variables at the previous day looking first exclusively at the obtained transfer entropy te values it was observed that information flow from p reaches higher values than those from aet and melt fig 2 in addition the distributions of t e aet q and t e melt q are positively skewed such outcomes suggest that a 1 day lag precipitation signal can have a more direct impact on streamflow in comparison to the remaining runoff generation components and that for the majority of the basins the information transferred from aet and melt signals on a previous day is less significant beyond these first considerations the interpretation of the resulting values of transfer entropy in the region is not straightforward and an additional understanding may be gained by analysing how the three tes are individually linked to catchment attributes and streamflow features looking at fig 3 which shows the scatterplot between basin attributes and te values it can be noticed that t e p q first row shows a substantial negative relation with mean elevation elev mean slope slope snow fraction snowf and snow depth snowd which are also strongly correlated between each other not explicitly showed here basins at high elevation generally steeper and characterised by significant presence of snow correspond to low values of transfer entropy from 1 day lag precipitation while for decreasing altitudes and decreasing snowf and snowd the range of variability of t e p q increases and the relationship is less clear the impact of p results to be negatively and significantly correlated also with some of the considered streamflow signatures first row in fig 4 δ p a r which is a measure of catchment seasonality shows the same kind of relationship as observed for elevation and presence of snow in fact seasonality in austria is so much more influenced by snow accumulation and melting dynamics than by the seasonality of precipitation itself interestingly the quickness of the runoff response here quantified by the flashiness index is positively correlated to the impact of the previous day s precipitation p with a pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 67 in contrast negative correlation of t e p q to the baseflow index bfi is observed this confirms that the information from 1 day lag precipitation is higher in catchments with the fastest runoff response while it is weaker where additional dynamics e g infiltration and snow dynamics are involved for what concerns the remaining streamflow and catchment features even if more humid catchments usually correspond to higher values of mean annual runoff the first rows of figs 3 and 4 show that t e p q correlates even if weakly with q y but it does not seem to be linked to map finally no significant relations between p entropy values and low high flow statistics lowq and highq are observed given their high mutual correlation t e aet q and t e melt q are linked in a similar way to morpho climatic basin attributes and streamflow signatures second and third rows in figs 3 and 4 in contrast to the impact of p they are positively correlated pearson s correlation between 0 6 and 0 7 with elevation and presence of snow and flatter catchments corresponds in general to low impact of aet and melt mean annual precipitation map higher in mountainous basins due to the orographic component is also positively correlated with the information flow from melt and more weakly with the impact of aet person s correlations equal to 0 63 and 0 43 respectively in addition more arid catchments are characterised by low information flow from actual evapotranspiration and snow melt consistently high impact of such two components matches with high seasonality δ p a r which as mentioned above is one of primary characteristics of snow dominated catchments in austria they accumulate water in the form of snow during the autumn and winter and release it during spring and summer seasons when snow melt occurs due to the temperature rise finally 1 day lag aet and especially melt te are negatively correlated with low flow statistics lowq and positively correlated with high flow statistics highq in austria in fact seasonal and snow dominated behaviour seems to be associated with more pronounced low and high flows as can be observed looking at their spatial pattern compared to that of δ p a r fig 6h i l on one hand snow deposition in the catchments instead of rain is responsible for small low flows occurring in winter on the other hand the combination of high orographic precipitations and snow melt in spring and summer leads to particularly strong high flows in the more seasonal regions the results discussed so far show that the three considered transfer entropy variables alone are able to capture multiple climatic morphological and hydrological characteristics across the dataset in general from such first considerations we can mainly observe that i in austria the differences in transfer entropy explain mainly those catchments attributes and streamflow signatures linked to snow accumulation and melting processes and that ii the information transferred from precipitation signal on a previous day is able to quantify the quickness of the runoff response 6 2 interpretation of the te hc classes the proposed classification based on the transfer entropy values here named te hc eases the interpretation of the results merging the spatial pattern of the three signatures in a single map in addition considering a set of clusters instead of single values allows one to highlight macro differences between catchments and to simplify the spatial pattern as mentioned previously the results of the classification illustrated in the upper portion of fig 6 are analysed herein against the spatial pattern of the morpho climatic catchment attributes and streamflow signatures below in the same fig 6 in addition boxplots of fig 7 show their values inside the clusters looking at the results of the te hc it can be first noticed how the methodology is able to capture and isolate the catchments with the greatest amount of information flow from precipitation t e p q cluster 5 and 6 respectively light and dark blue group the catchments with the highest impact of p and low impact of aet and melt these basins are indeed typically flat and located at the lowest elevations fig 6a where the presence of snow is not relevant fig 7a b e f such clusters show consistently the highest flashiness index fig 6m and fig 7m at the same time they are characterised by the lowest baseflow fig 7n and the lowest seasonality fig 7h in the more flashy catchments in fact the delayed runoff components due e g to groundwater release or snow seasonal dynamics have low influence and the runoff response is highly dependent on single rainfall events such hydrological behaviour is particularly pronounced in the north east and for a little area in the extreme west corresponding with cluster 6 which consistently match the regions labelled as more flashy by previous studies due to more convective precipitations and rapidly draining soils e g gaál et al 2012 viglione et al 2013 similar low information flow from aet and melt but lower impact of p even if still predominant on snow processes characterise cluster 4 green located in the area at mid low elevation mainly in the south and in the east snow presence is also low but differently from cluster 5 and 6 mean annual precipitation fig 7c is the lowest and consistently with the lower impact of p the hydrograph dynamics are slower higher bfi and lower flashiness in fact cluster 4 is mainly located in areas characterised by pervious soils as highlighted by viglione et al 2013 where catchments are typically able to self regulate the runoff for this reason it shows also the highest low flows lowq fig 7i on the other hand for clusters 1 yellow and 2 red located along the alps the information flow from precipitation is not predominant in particular for cluster 1 the impact of 1 day lag melt and especially of aet which is maximum exceeds that of p it groups snow dominated catchments located at the highest elevation with the most pronounced seasonality fig 7a e h in fact besides its direct effect on the water balance transfer entropy from aet highly depending on temperature may be linked also to the runoff seasonality catchments with high seasonality have aet and q in phase during the year while this is not valid in catchments with low seasonal behaviour consistently and as already mentioned the delayed snow dynamics lead such catchments to have the highest baseflow index bfi cluster 2 includes instead those alpine catchments at slightly lower elevation with less extreme snowy and seasonal behaviour where the information flow from aet and melt is similar to that from p they are located mainly in the eastern part of the alps finally cluster 3 magenta is located in between it identifies catchments with strong impact of snow components but where the information flow from precipitation is still prevalent in fact t e aet q and t e melt q are similar to those of cluster 1 but at the same time t e p q is stronger interestingly these alpine catchments are located exclusively on the northern side of the mountain chain characterised by the highest annual precipitation of the country fig 6c and fig 7c due as already mentioned to the orographic lifting of the north western airflows but where snow dynamics also strongly influence rainfall runoff transformation processes see e g merz and blöschl 2009 in this region the very high precipitations contribute on one side to a significant snow accumulation but at the same time recent rainfall has had a direct impact on the runoff in fact even if map is so much higher than in the other alpine catchments snow accumulation snowd fig 7f is still one of the largest in the region with respect to the other alpine catchments the strong impact of 1 day lag p is reflected also in the stronger flashiness and slightly lower seasonality fig 7h m the identification of snow dominated catchments clusters 1 2 and 3 matches in general with those obtained by previous studies either based e g on signatures viglione et al 2013 on the drivers of flood timescales gaál et al 2012 or on parameter sensitivity analysis sleziak et al 2018 looking overall at the pattern of te components catchment attributes and streamflow signatures we observe increasing predominant impact of p compared to aet and melt components moving from cluster 1 to 6 corresponding to decreasing elevation and snow presence fig 7a e f weaker seasonality and faster hydrograph dynamics fig 7h m n in addition even if clusters 4 to 6 are characterised by a higher aridity index fig 7d and a lower annual discharge fig 7g they still show a much predominant impact of p moreover even if we would expect a certain impact of evapotranspiration in such most arid catchments the information flow from aet is actually the smallest this may be due to the 1 day time lag considered for the experiment hiding the slower contributions of the variable to the water balance on the other hand q y index is higher in cluster 1 and 2 but it is maximum for cluster 3 due to the highest orographic precipitations consistently matching the larger t e p q observed in the upper panel of fig 6 finally differences in lowq and highq are not clearly highlighted through the te classes fig 7i l except for clusters 1 and 3 characterised by the highest impact of aet and melt and by a highly seasonal behaviour which in austria correspond also to weaker low flows and slightly stronger high flows overall it can be observed that the obtained classification which relies exclusively on just three entropy based quantities is consistent with the values of basin attributes and streamflow signatures and with the overall interpretation of austrian hydrology analysed in previous literature in fact this analysis demonstrated that information flows between rainfall runoff drivers can be used as metrics for hydrological similarity it has to be accepted that the study has a few limitations the first is that transfer entropy values are calculated based on a single time lag but on the other hand the size of the basins is overall small secondly since the purpose was to assess the potential of transfer entropy for catchment characterisation in the most parsimonious way te hc was implemented considering information flow just from the three main meteorological forcing components and it can not take into account all the governing hydrological phenomena despite the limitations the approach is able to distinguish the predominant or partial role of snow melt and evapotranspiration across the dataset at the same time the amount of information flow transferred from the precipitation to the runoff hydrograph measuring the impact of rainfall events occurring in the previous day can help on one side to highlight differences in catchment response time but also to capture the direct effect of very high orographic precipitation on the runoff in mountain and snow dominated watersheds as demonstrated by the delineation of cluster 3 that groups the basins on the more humid side of the alpine chain for such reasons we believe that transfer entropy deserves further attention and investigation since it may be seen as an additional instrument to characterise catchment dynamics that are not fully captured by streamflow signatures alone by providing a measure of the interaction between forcing variables and runoff 7 conclusions a novel approach for the characterisation and classification of catchment dynamics through the quantification of the information flows between meteorological runoff forcings and runoff itself has been proposed the central purpose of the analysis is to demonstrate the potential of transfer entropy measures for assessing the similarity in the main hydrological processes governing the rainfall runoff transformation transfer entropy considers the interaction between each one of the entire meteorological forcing time series and it is able to quantify the amount of information transferred from them to the streamflow time series the literature regarding catchment classification normally involves similarity measures based on different streamflow signatures or morphological and climatic features independently from each other this work aimed to show how transfer entropy can be used as a complementary tool for identifying and highlighting similar catchment dynamics this may be particularly interesting when the interaction between forcing variables and runoff needs to be understood as for instance in the case of calibration and regionalisation of rainfall runoff models the information flow from i measured daily precipitation ii simulated actual evapotranspiration and iii simulated snow melt to daily runoff time series was estimated through the computation of transfer entropy values in order to avoid incurring further uncertainties due to the estimate of high dimensional probability distributions and at the same time to simplify the transfer entropy calculation thus allowing a better understanding of the information flow transfer entropy was computed in this work considering only one previous time step 1 day lag transfer entropy even though runoff is certainly affected by forcing variables at greater time lags the analysis can still provide a first order estimate of the transfer entropy and of its ability in identifying useful catchment dynamics future analyses will indeed require the inclusion of higher time lags in transfer entropy computation as well as the inclusion of further runoff forcing components as control variables but this is beyond the scope of this pathfinder article the obtained standardised transfer entropies were first analysed comparing them to the values of available catchment attributes and to a set of six streamflow signatures trying to better understand the results of the transfer entropy calculation in general the differences in transfer entropy tend to be partially explained by catchments features linked to orography which plays a central role in the hydrological behaviour of catchments in such alpine region but at the same time it is noteworthy that the three transfer entropy metrics alone capture meaningful relationships with multiple descriptors and flow characteristics then the transfer entropy values were used as catchment features when applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm the rationale of the method is that similar values of information flow between meteorological forcing and streamflow time series mean similar catchment dynamics within the limitation of the study the results of the classification are promising the method is able to distinguish the predominant or partial role of snow melt and evapotranspiration across the dataset and measuring the impact of rainfall events occurring in the previous day it can help to highlight differences catchment response time and the role of very high orographic precipitation in snow dominated catchments the transfer entropy hierarchical clustering te hc based exclusively on the three indices representing the interaction between forcings meteorological data and runoff is consistent with the results of previous works e g gaál et al 2012 sleziak et al 2018 viglione et al 2013 and with the pattern of the selected streamflow signatures and catchment attributes the methodology demonstrates its ability to capture similarity between more features of the runoff hydrograph described by the indices and confirm therefore the useful contribution of information flow based metrics the present analysis demonstrates the potential of te hc and in particular the potential of transfer entropy as an additional instrument for assessing hydrological similarity and for quantifying the connection between different processes it deserves further investigation and should be seen as a complementary approach to classification techniques based on consolidated streamflow signatures in particular given that te hc is based on the concept of information flow between high resolution forcing and streamflow time series it appears promising especially when the classification aims to detect similarity in dominant hydrological dynamics like the transfer of rainfall runoff model parameters for instance in fact gauged classifications like te hc may help to train clustering algorithms based on basin attributes alone as done e g by jehn et al 2020 mcmanamay and derolph 2019 toth 2013 in the ungauged case or they can be directly implemented in regionalisation frameworks e g masih et al 2010 pool et al 2021 we trust that this work provides a platform for the extension of the ideas and forthcoming experiments will focus on coupling the use of transfer entropy in catchment classification to the application of rainfall runoff model regionalisation techniques testing the improvement allowed by using such novel clusters as founding point of the regionalisation framework

2757,estimates of nutrient loads are critical for managing the effects of nutrient pollution in receiving waters an accurate calculation of load requires sub daily concurrent measurements of flow and nutrient concentrations continuous flow measurements are common but nutrient concentrations are often measured infrequently and so statistical estimates of flow concentration relationships are often used to infer nutrient concentration on unsampled days contributions of diffuse nonpoint sources to flow concentration relationships in neighboring sites may be similar and methods are available to apportion in stream concentrations to contributions from point and nonpoint sources combining a source apportionment model with a hierarchical statistical model may be a useful approach for leveraging information from more intensively sampled sites to improve estimates of relationships at more sparsely sampled sites the approach is tested using daily measurements of total phosphorus and flow from eight rivers in ohio usa data from seven of the rivers are randomly subsampled to a single sample from each month and a hierarchical model fit to estimate flow concentration relationships for all sites hierarchical model estimates of phosphorus loads in subsampled sites were compared with three site specific models a linear flow concentration relationship a quadratic flow concentration relationship with seasonal corrections and beale s ratio method the hierarchical model improved substantially on the precision of estimated total phosphorus loads at sparsely sampled sites yielding an interquartile range of prediction errors of 22 simple linear load concentration models were the next best performing method with an interquartile range of 33 the average bias in hierarchical model predictions of phosphorus loads was 8 whereas the smallest biases associated with the comparison methods were 10 for both the linear load concentration model and beale s ratio these results suggest that a hierarchical statistical model can be valuable for improving nutrient load estimates when data from a small number of intensively sites are available keywords source apportionment nutrient loads flow concentration relationship data availability data used in the analysis are already available online 1 introduction accurate estimates of nutrient loads from streams and rivers are critical for understanding the effects of nutrient pollution in receiving waters and for guiding decisions on how best to manage those waters the magnitude and timing of nutrient loading affects the dynamics of phytoplankton growth in lakes jeppesen et al 2005 kane et al 2014 and is a key input parameter in mechanistic models of lake processes mukhopadhyay and smith 2000 radbourne et al 2019 measurements of nutrient load also provide the basis for allocating load reductions among dischargers in basin management plans effler et al 2002 direct measurements of nutrient load are costly requiring sub daily observations of both stream flow and nutrient concentrations johnes 2007 because such intense measurements of nutrient concentrations are rarely available different methods are used to infer loads from infrequent nutrient measurements and more widely available continuous flow estimates rating curves are one such method where a statistical relationship between flow and nutrient concentration is first estimated from available concurrent measurements of flow and nutrient concentrations at a sampling station and then applied to the full flow dataset at that same location to estimate a nutrient load quantitative evaluations of this and other estimating approaches all indicate that when applied to a small number of nutrient measurements at a location they provide very uncertain estimates of the actual load moatar and meybeck 2005 salles et al 2008 stenback et al 2011 young et al 1988 load estimates are usually computed for individual sampling locations but aspects of the relationships between nutrients and streamflow among neighboring stations are likely similar and these similarities can potentially be leveraged to improve load estimates for example nutrient loads originating from diffuse nonpoint sources depend on large scale patterns in land use and precipitation and therefore these types of loads may vary similarly with streamflow among different sampling locations and information regarding the rating curve in one location can potentially improve estimates elsewhere hierarchical statistical models represent relationships among groups of samples by assuming that the model structure within each group is the same while model coefficients may differ slightly among groups this approach is a compromise between a model in which one set of coefficients is assigned to all groups in the data set i e completely pooling all available data and a model in which coefficients are estimated independently for each group i e no pooling of data in a hierarchical model data are partially pooled by assuming that coefficients estimated for different groups are related to one another by a common statistical distribution gelman and hill 2007 here i propose an approach for applying hierarchical statistical models to improve estimates of nutrient loads more specifically i express in stream total phosphorus tp concentrations as the sum of point and nonpoint source contributions and hypothesize that relationships between nonpoint source contributions and stream flow are similar among stations based on this hypothesis i examine the case in which one station with intensive daily measurements of nutrient concentrations and flow is available and ask whether the information inherent in this station can be used to improve estimates of nutrient loads at other nearby locations with much sparser observations of nutrient concentrations 2 methods 2 1 data data collected in 2019 from eight rivers in western ohio usa by heidelberg university s national center for water quality research https ncwqr org were used for this study table 1 fig 1 and fig s1 nutrient and sediment concentration data have been collected for over 50 years by this program to help characterize loads of these constituents to lake erie from ohio rivers and analyses of these data have yielded insights into topics such as temporal trends in nutrient loads e g rowland et al 2020 while providing data for calibration and testing of runoff and loading models e g martin et al 2021 for this study data were limited to samples collected in march november to limit the influence of intermittent flow during the winter months catchment areas for the eight sites included in this analysis varied over 3 orders of magnitude 11 16 000 km2 and land uses at these sites were dominated by row crop agriculture at each site in stream tp measurements were collected daily with more frequent measurements during storm events so average daily tp concentrations were computed for each site tp concentrations were measured with semi automated colorimetry epa method 365 1 and full details of quality assurance plan for this study are available https ncwqr org monitoring the total number of samples available for analysis was 2193 evenly distributed among the eight sites co located daily streamflow measurements were collected by the u s geological survey 2 2 mathematical model a flow tp model was specified that separately accounted for contributions from sources that introduce a constant load of phosphorus to the river regardless of flow and contributions from sources in which tp load increases as flow increases bowes et al 2008 these two sources of tp broadly correspond to point sources and nonpoint diffuse sources respectively and for convenience they are referred to as point and nonpoint components for the remainder of this article based on the conceptual model of two distinct contributors to in stream tp we first write an expression that represents in stream tp concentration for a case in which all contributions of tp originate from point sources 1 c i p o i n t l f i where ci point is the in stream concentration of tp and fi is the flow for sample i the righthand site of the equation represents the point source contribution as l the load from point sources divided by the flow rate f because l should generally be unrelated to flow increased flows would tend to decrease observed tp concentration by diluting the introduced load second we express in stream tp concentrations for a case in which all contributions of tp originate from nonpoint sources in this case in stream tp ci nonpoint can be modelled as a power law function of stream flow here we specify the widely used five parameter model cohn et al 1992 2 log c i n o n p o i n t d 1 d 2 s i n 2 π t i d 3 cos 2 π t i d 4 log f i d 5 t i ti in this equation is the decimal year associated with sample i where for example ti for a sample collected on day 100 of year 1 would be 1 100 365 log transformed tp is modeled as varying linearly with log transformed flow fi and seasonal variations in this relationship are modeled by including the two sinusoidal functions of ti the traditional five parameter model allows for a long term trend in concentration by including a direct linear relationship between tp and time ti in the current study only a single year of data is considered so this final trend term is omitted the final model for in stream tp is expressed as the sum of contributions from point source and nonpoint sources as follows 3 c i l f i e x p d 1 d 2 sin 2 π t i d 3 c o s 2 π t i f i d 4 where eq 2 has been back transformed to express in stream tp concentration in its original units so given a set of in stream measurements of tp ci and flow fi the model parameters l d1 d2 d3 and d4 can be estimated statistically 2 3 statistical analysis the model described above can be fit separately for any single site with concurrent measurements of flow and tp concentration but for this analysis i was interested in how tp concentrations could be modeled across groups of sites to improve the overall accuracy of load estimates to that end a hierarchical structure was defined such that different values of the coefficients d1 d2 d3 and d4 were estimated for each site but values for each site were drawn from a single statistical distribution that applied to all sites for example the value of d1 for each site j is expressed as follows 4 log d 1 j n o r m a l μ d 1 σ d 1 that is each site specific value of d1 was drawn from a log normal distribution characterized by a mean value μd1 and a standard deviation σd1 a log normal distribution for d1 was specified to ensure that this parameter was constrained to only positive values normal distributions were specified for the parameters d2 d3 and d4 the parameter l was also estimated from the data but no prior expectation exists for similarity in point source contributions among different sites so an independent value of l was estimated for each site the final model can be expressed as follows 5 l o g c i l o g l j i f i e x p d 1 j i d 2 j i sin 2 π t i d 3 j i c o s 2 π t i f i d 4 j i where the subscript j i refers to station j associated with sample i the sampling distribution for ci was assumed to be log normally distributed so both sides of eq 5 were log transformed when fitting observations of log transformed tp and flow at each site were centered by subtracting the mean values of tp and flow for each site weakly informative priors were specified for each of the parameters in the model to limit the occurrence of extreme values during model fitting then the hierarchical model was fit using stan a statistical programming language for estimating bayesian models with markov chain monte carlo sampling stan development team 2016 i examined the results of this full model to better understand how flow concentration relationships varied among sites the hierarchical relationships between flow concentration relationships among sites enables the model to leverage intensive data collection at a single site to improve estimates of concentration and associated load from other sites with much less data to test whether this approach yielded improvements in predictive accuracy sparse data sets were created by subsampling the available data first one reference site was selected for which all data was retained data from the remaining 7 sites were subsampled by randomly selecting one sample from each month for each site this procedure yielded 9 tp measurements for each of the 7 subsampled sites then the hierarchical model was refit to a data set consisting of one reference site with all available data and seven sites each with 9 samples the fitted model was used to predict tp concentration for all days because the model is expressed in terms of log transformed tp model predictions of back transformed tp were corrected for the log transformation bias ferguson 1986 this predicted tp was combined with measured flow to compute a tp load for each site over the period of record march november the true tp load for each site was computed for each site using all daily measurements and the proportional error of the predicted load was calculated by subtracting the true load calculated with all available data and dividing by the true load the subsampling procedure was repeated 100 times to accumulate a distribution of prediction errors for each site this entire calculation was performed eight times using a different site for the reference site in each case to provide a basis for assessing the performance of the hierarchical model i also fit traditional site specific flow concentration models to the same sets of subsampled data at each site the first site specific model was a linear regression of log transformed tp as a function of log transformed flow 6 log c i a j i b j i l o g f i where the subscript j i on the coefficients a and b indicates that different values of these coefficients were estimated for each site note though that no hierarchical relationships among site specific coefficient values were specified for this comparison model for the second site specific model the sinusoidal terms that represented seasonal variations and the dependence of log ci on the squared value of log fi were included as expressed in eq 2 these two models are identical in structure to models that are typically applied in the widely used loadest software https water usgs gov software loadest for each site after fitting the two models to the subsampled data the models were used to predict concentrations for stream flows for on all available days predicted concentrations were corrected for the log transform bias and used to compute the tp load for a third comparison i computed loads based on beale s ratio method a widely used method to estimate loads that often outperforms approaches based on estimating the flow tp relationship quilbé et al 2006 predicted loads for all methods were summarized as the proportional error in predicted tp load over the period of record for each site all calculations were performed with r r core team 2017 3 results fitting the hierarchical model to all available data yielded insights into the variations in the values of different coefficients among sites fig 2 point source contributions to the tp concentrations were largest for the maumee river with an estimate of 77 1 48 0 111 6 kg day 90 credible intervals in parentheses point source contributions to the blanchard river and the portage river were 22 0 18 0 26 3 kg day and 2 3 1 2 3 6 kg day respectively all other values of l were less than 1 kg day the value of d1 was very similar across all sites except for blanchard river the only site with a strong contribution from point sources credible intervals for d2 for all sites except for lost creek and maumee river overlapped at a value of approximately 0 35 whereas somewhat more variability was observed for d3 the exponent for flow d4 varied over a limited range from a low value of 0 35 to a high value 0 65 with most values clustered around 0 5 examples of model fits to the flow tp relationship illustrate the effects of point source contributions to blanchard river left panel fig 3 at flows below 3 m3 s tp varied inversely with flow exhibiting a dilution effect at higher flows nonpoint source contributions dominated and tp increased with increased flow the effects of seasonal variations in the flow tp relationship were large altering tp concentrations by over 0 1 mg l for a given flow depending on when a sample was collected for honey creek right panel fig 3 no effects of point source were evident and tp increased with increases in flow over the range of conditions sampled seasonal effects on tp concentration again accounted for a large proportion of variability in tp plots of flow tp relationships for other sites exhibited similar characteristics as the examples shown here fig s2 when applied to subsampled data the hierarchical model yielded more accurate and precise estimates of loads than those calculated with site specific models results using the portage river as the reference site are shown as an example comparison fig 4 but use of other sites as reference did not substantially change the results see below mean bias in the predictions can be assessed by comparing the values of mean predictive errors blue diamonds in fig 4 mean prediction errors for the hierarchical model were closer to zero than the other methods for all locations except for the blanchard river and lost creek in lost creek mean prediction error for simple linear regression was closer to zero than the hierarchical model but the distributions of the error overlapped with one another in the blanchard river mean prediction error for loads based on beale s ratio were closest to zero over all of the subsampled sites the average bias in the hierarchical model predictions was 0 08 the average biases associated with beale s ratio and with the linear load concentration model were both 0 10 and the bias associated with the seasonal model was much higher due to very uncertain predictions for rock creek and lost creek the ranges of prediction errors from the hierarchical were narrower for all sites compared to the site specific models indicating that in addition to providing more accurate results the hierarchical model provided more reliable predictions of tp load for any set of samples across all subsampled sites the average interquartile range of prediction errors for the hierarchical model was 0 22 whereas it was 0 33 0 49 and 0 91 for the linear flow concentration model beale s ratio and the seasonal flow concentration model respectively adding seasonal components to the simple regression model accounted for more factors that affect the flow tp relationship but introduced a greater potential for overfitting the limited number of samples hence the range of prediction errors observed in the seasonal site specific model was substantially broader than the other simpler methods e g yellow boxes compared to green boxes in fig 4 the choice of reference site exerted only a weak effect on the accuracy of the hierarchical model in predicting loads fig 5 regardless of the choice of reference site predictions of tp load for lost creek exhibited the greatest bias among all sites 3rd column in fig 5 however the bias in tp load predictions for lost creek were greatest when the blanchard river was used as the reference site this same pattern occurs for predictions in honey and rock creek in which use of the blanchard river data as the reference yielded a slightly greater bias than the use of other sites as reference 4 discussion the relationship between tp concentration and flow varies seasonally and these variations are difficult to predict for example in agricultural areas the interaction between the timing of precipitation events applications of fertilizer and crop growth strongly influences the flow tp relationship puustinen et al 2007 and predicting these interactions a priori is nearly impossible instead intensive data collection is needed to quantify the flow tp relationship in any location however within the scale of a particular watershed or group of neighboring watersheds we can likely assume that certain aspects of the timing of precipitation and farming practices are similar suggesting that flow tp relationships in these watersheds are similar the hierarchical model described here provides a statistical framework for taking advantage of these patterns to improve predictions in sparsely sampled locations based on one intensively sampled reference location and the present analysis has shown that applying the hierarchical model improves both the accuracy and precision of loads estimated at sparsely sampled sites this approach has potential for improving estimates of nutrient loads using existing data and optimizing future data collection efforts many methods are available for estimating constituent loads cohn 1995 but efforts to improve estimates for sparsely sampled locations are rare the widely used loadest model provides a variety of models for rating curves to estimate concentrations as a function of flow runkel et al 2004 and a more recent refinement of this approach uses locally weighted regression to better represent nonlinear relationships between concentrations and flow hirsch et al 2010 however the accuracy of these and other methods degrades as the density of data decreases quilbé et al 2006 targeted stratified sampling is often cited as the best and only approach for improving load estimates with a small number of samples robertson and roerish 1999 the method proposed here improves load estimates beyond those that would be achieved with an optimized sampling strategy 4 1 source apportionment apportioning observed tp concentrations into point and nonpoint contributions greatly facilitated the ability to identify similar trends in nonpoint concentration flow relationships the source apportionment model accurately reproduced the concave up relationship between flow and tp concentration when point sources were present e g the blanchard river other methods represent the flow concentration relationships in these cases with a quadratic curve that matches the data empirically but greatly reducing the interpretability of the model coefficients cohn et al 1992 by explicitly defining point and nonpoint contributions a simple power law relationship could be used to represent nonpoint source contributions in all locations and allow the imposition of hierarchical constraints on the model coefficients others have applied a hierarchical approach to estimate loads with a ratio estimator cha et al 2010 but the current approach applies hierarchical relationships specifically to the aspects of the flow concentration relationship that are expected to be related in the present formulation of the model the point source contribution identified in the blanchard river may still affect estimates of the nonpoint source contribution even after source apportionment more specifically the estimate of the coefficient d1 in the blanchard river differed significantly from estimates for the other sites and load estimates in subsampled data from the blanchard were somewhat less accurate than for other sites these differences suggest that the constant point source load that is used in the model may oversimplify the actual contribution from point sources the manifestation of point source loads of phosphorus as measured in stream tp concentrations may vary seasonally with differences in uptake rates and within river processing bowes et al 2015 jarvie et al 2012 furthermore the point source loads themselves may exhibit systematic seasonal variations and satellite imagery indicates that a wastewater treatment plant is directly upstream from the sampling location on the blanchard river so tp concentrations at this site may have been strongly influenced by variations in effluent loads the effect of point source loads at this location may also contribute to slightly reduced accuracy in estimated loads when the blanchard river is used as a reference site 4 2 implications and future work i have demonstrated one case example in this study in which a hierarchical model improves predictions of load in sparsely sampled sites but further work and analysis is required to broaden the applicability of this approach for example the separation distances between pairs of sites ranged from 11 to 140 km so the sites were relatively closely located to one another further work is required to understand how the similarity of flow concentration relationships changes with increased spatial distance as separation distance increases we might expect that geology land use patterns and precipitation events would diverge which in turn would likely alter the degree which flow tp relationships at one location can inform parameter estimates elsewhere variations in topography may also alter the timing of flow events over relative short distances so applying this method in areas with more topographical relief would provide a contrasting case study overall though the method described here provides a framework for systematically examining how flow concentration relationships vary across a landscape and application of this approach may yield broad improvements in estimates of nutrient loads catchment size also influenced the strength with which rating curves at different locations were related mean bias in predictions was greatest for the smallest catchment lost river in the dataset suggesting that systematic difference exist in flow tp relationships with regard to catchment size loads were also less precisely predicted for the smallest catchment a finding that was expected due to the increased flashiness of small streams cassidy and jordan 2011 note though that the hierarchical model prediction still exhibited much less variability for lost river than the single site regression approaches so incorporating information from other sites stabilized load predictions further analyses of different data sets may also identify factors for selecting the best reference site for intensive sampling the reference site selected in the present study was chosen at random but a better understanding the factors that drive similarity in flow tp relationship may provide for more informed selections of reference sites for example the decrease in precision in the smallest catchment might be reduced by selecting a reference site with a smaller catchment size similarly patterns in correlation among stream flow may help identify sites with stream flows that are similar to the greatest proportion of other locations yuan 2013 4 3 conclusion the hierarchical model formulation described here provides a useful approach for improving the accuracy of phosphorus loads estimates across a region when data from a few intensively sampled sites are available testing the approach with other data sets in other locations and over different spatial scales will help refine the approach and ultimately improve our understanding of factors that influence variations in nutrient loads the success of the hierarchical model in predicting loads at sparsely sampled sites can also provide a roadmap for designing a sampling program to characterize loads in different areas for example this approach is ideally suited to characterizing loads from different tributaries to one receiving water in this case one might opt to intensively sample one tributary and supplement these samples with much less frequent sampling of other tributaries the close spatial proximity of the tributaries would then allow one to calculate accurate estimates of all loads to the receiving water load estimates for a region could also benefit from strategically located intensively sampled sites and a broader array of less

2757,estimates of nutrient loads are critical for managing the effects of nutrient pollution in receiving waters an accurate calculation of load requires sub daily concurrent measurements of flow and nutrient concentrations continuous flow measurements are common but nutrient concentrations are often measured infrequently and so statistical estimates of flow concentration relationships are often used to infer nutrient concentration on unsampled days contributions of diffuse nonpoint sources to flow concentration relationships in neighboring sites may be similar and methods are available to apportion in stream concentrations to contributions from point and nonpoint sources combining a source apportionment model with a hierarchical statistical model may be a useful approach for leveraging information from more intensively sampled sites to improve estimates of relationships at more sparsely sampled sites the approach is tested using daily measurements of total phosphorus and flow from eight rivers in ohio usa data from seven of the rivers are randomly subsampled to a single sample from each month and a hierarchical model fit to estimate flow concentration relationships for all sites hierarchical model estimates of phosphorus loads in subsampled sites were compared with three site specific models a linear flow concentration relationship a quadratic flow concentration relationship with seasonal corrections and beale s ratio method the hierarchical model improved substantially on the precision of estimated total phosphorus loads at sparsely sampled sites yielding an interquartile range of prediction errors of 22 simple linear load concentration models were the next best performing method with an interquartile range of 33 the average bias in hierarchical model predictions of phosphorus loads was 8 whereas the smallest biases associated with the comparison methods were 10 for both the linear load concentration model and beale s ratio these results suggest that a hierarchical statistical model can be valuable for improving nutrient load estimates when data from a small number of intensively sites are available keywords source apportionment nutrient loads flow concentration relationship data availability data used in the analysis are already available online 1 introduction accurate estimates of nutrient loads from streams and rivers are critical for understanding the effects of nutrient pollution in receiving waters and for guiding decisions on how best to manage those waters the magnitude and timing of nutrient loading affects the dynamics of phytoplankton growth in lakes jeppesen et al 2005 kane et al 2014 and is a key input parameter in mechanistic models of lake processes mukhopadhyay and smith 2000 radbourne et al 2019 measurements of nutrient load also provide the basis for allocating load reductions among dischargers in basin management plans effler et al 2002 direct measurements of nutrient load are costly requiring sub daily observations of both stream flow and nutrient concentrations johnes 2007 because such intense measurements of nutrient concentrations are rarely available different methods are used to infer loads from infrequent nutrient measurements and more widely available continuous flow estimates rating curves are one such method where a statistical relationship between flow and nutrient concentration is first estimated from available concurrent measurements of flow and nutrient concentrations at a sampling station and then applied to the full flow dataset at that same location to estimate a nutrient load quantitative evaluations of this and other estimating approaches all indicate that when applied to a small number of nutrient measurements at a location they provide very uncertain estimates of the actual load moatar and meybeck 2005 salles et al 2008 stenback et al 2011 young et al 1988 load estimates are usually computed for individual sampling locations but aspects of the relationships between nutrients and streamflow among neighboring stations are likely similar and these similarities can potentially be leveraged to improve load estimates for example nutrient loads originating from diffuse nonpoint sources depend on large scale patterns in land use and precipitation and therefore these types of loads may vary similarly with streamflow among different sampling locations and information regarding the rating curve in one location can potentially improve estimates elsewhere hierarchical statistical models represent relationships among groups of samples by assuming that the model structure within each group is the same while model coefficients may differ slightly among groups this approach is a compromise between a model in which one set of coefficients is assigned to all groups in the data set i e completely pooling all available data and a model in which coefficients are estimated independently for each group i e no pooling of data in a hierarchical model data are partially pooled by assuming that coefficients estimated for different groups are related to one another by a common statistical distribution gelman and hill 2007 here i propose an approach for applying hierarchical statistical models to improve estimates of nutrient loads more specifically i express in stream total phosphorus tp concentrations as the sum of point and nonpoint source contributions and hypothesize that relationships between nonpoint source contributions and stream flow are similar among stations based on this hypothesis i examine the case in which one station with intensive daily measurements of nutrient concentrations and flow is available and ask whether the information inherent in this station can be used to improve estimates of nutrient loads at other nearby locations with much sparser observations of nutrient concentrations 2 methods 2 1 data data collected in 2019 from eight rivers in western ohio usa by heidelberg university s national center for water quality research https ncwqr org were used for this study table 1 fig 1 and fig s1 nutrient and sediment concentration data have been collected for over 50 years by this program to help characterize loads of these constituents to lake erie from ohio rivers and analyses of these data have yielded insights into topics such as temporal trends in nutrient loads e g rowland et al 2020 while providing data for calibration and testing of runoff and loading models e g martin et al 2021 for this study data were limited to samples collected in march november to limit the influence of intermittent flow during the winter months catchment areas for the eight sites included in this analysis varied over 3 orders of magnitude 11 16 000 km2 and land uses at these sites were dominated by row crop agriculture at each site in stream tp measurements were collected daily with more frequent measurements during storm events so average daily tp concentrations were computed for each site tp concentrations were measured with semi automated colorimetry epa method 365 1 and full details of quality assurance plan for this study are available https ncwqr org monitoring the total number of samples available for analysis was 2193 evenly distributed among the eight sites co located daily streamflow measurements were collected by the u s geological survey 2 2 mathematical model a flow tp model was specified that separately accounted for contributions from sources that introduce a constant load of phosphorus to the river regardless of flow and contributions from sources in which tp load increases as flow increases bowes et al 2008 these two sources of tp broadly correspond to point sources and nonpoint diffuse sources respectively and for convenience they are referred to as point and nonpoint components for the remainder of this article based on the conceptual model of two distinct contributors to in stream tp we first write an expression that represents in stream tp concentration for a case in which all contributions of tp originate from point sources 1 c i p o i n t l f i where ci point is the in stream concentration of tp and fi is the flow for sample i the righthand site of the equation represents the point source contribution as l the load from point sources divided by the flow rate f because l should generally be unrelated to flow increased flows would tend to decrease observed tp concentration by diluting the introduced load second we express in stream tp concentrations for a case in which all contributions of tp originate from nonpoint sources in this case in stream tp ci nonpoint can be modelled as a power law function of stream flow here we specify the widely used five parameter model cohn et al 1992 2 log c i n o n p o i n t d 1 d 2 s i n 2 π t i d 3 cos 2 π t i d 4 log f i d 5 t i ti in this equation is the decimal year associated with sample i where for example ti for a sample collected on day 100 of year 1 would be 1 100 365 log transformed tp is modeled as varying linearly with log transformed flow fi and seasonal variations in this relationship are modeled by including the two sinusoidal functions of ti the traditional five parameter model allows for a long term trend in concentration by including a direct linear relationship between tp and time ti in the current study only a single year of data is considered so this final trend term is omitted the final model for in stream tp is expressed as the sum of contributions from point source and nonpoint sources as follows 3 c i l f i e x p d 1 d 2 sin 2 π t i d 3 c o s 2 π t i f i d 4 where eq 2 has been back transformed to express in stream tp concentration in its original units so given a set of in stream measurements of tp ci and flow fi the model parameters l d1 d2 d3 and d4 can be estimated statistically 2 3 statistical analysis the model described above can be fit separately for any single site with concurrent measurements of flow and tp concentration but for this analysis i was interested in how tp concentrations could be modeled across groups of sites to improve the overall accuracy of load estimates to that end a hierarchical structure was defined such that different values of the coefficients d1 d2 d3 and d4 were estimated for each site but values for each site were drawn from a single statistical distribution that applied to all sites for example the value of d1 for each site j is expressed as follows 4 log d 1 j n o r m a l μ d 1 σ d 1 that is each site specific value of d1 was drawn from a log normal distribution characterized by a mean value μd1 and a standard deviation σd1 a log normal distribution for d1 was specified to ensure that this parameter was constrained to only positive values normal distributions were specified for the parameters d2 d3 and d4 the parameter l was also estimated from the data but no prior expectation exists for similarity in point source contributions among different sites so an independent value of l was estimated for each site the final model can be expressed as follows 5 l o g c i l o g l j i f i e x p d 1 j i d 2 j i sin 2 π t i d 3 j i c o s 2 π t i f i d 4 j i where the subscript j i refers to station j associated with sample i the sampling distribution for ci was assumed to be log normally distributed so both sides of eq 5 were log transformed when fitting observations of log transformed tp and flow at each site were centered by subtracting the mean values of tp and flow for each site weakly informative priors were specified for each of the parameters in the model to limit the occurrence of extreme values during model fitting then the hierarchical model was fit using stan a statistical programming language for estimating bayesian models with markov chain monte carlo sampling stan development team 2016 i examined the results of this full model to better understand how flow concentration relationships varied among sites the hierarchical relationships between flow concentration relationships among sites enables the model to leverage intensive data collection at a single site to improve estimates of concentration and associated load from other sites with much less data to test whether this approach yielded improvements in predictive accuracy sparse data sets were created by subsampling the available data first one reference site was selected for which all data was retained data from the remaining 7 sites were subsampled by randomly selecting one sample from each month for each site this procedure yielded 9 tp measurements for each of the 7 subsampled sites then the hierarchical model was refit to a data set consisting of one reference site with all available data and seven sites each with 9 samples the fitted model was used to predict tp concentration for all days because the model is expressed in terms of log transformed tp model predictions of back transformed tp were corrected for the log transformation bias ferguson 1986 this predicted tp was combined with measured flow to compute a tp load for each site over the period of record march november the true tp load for each site was computed for each site using all daily measurements and the proportional error of the predicted load was calculated by subtracting the true load calculated with all available data and dividing by the true load the subsampling procedure was repeated 100 times to accumulate a distribution of prediction errors for each site this entire calculation was performed eight times using a different site for the reference site in each case to provide a basis for assessing the performance of the hierarchical model i also fit traditional site specific flow concentration models to the same sets of subsampled data at each site the first site specific model was a linear regression of log transformed tp as a function of log transformed flow 6 log c i a j i b j i l o g f i where the subscript j i on the coefficients a and b indicates that different values of these coefficients were estimated for each site note though that no hierarchical relationships among site specific coefficient values were specified for this comparison model for the second site specific model the sinusoidal terms that represented seasonal variations and the dependence of log ci on the squared value of log fi were included as expressed in eq 2 these two models are identical in structure to models that are typically applied in the widely used loadest software https water usgs gov software loadest for each site after fitting the two models to the subsampled data the models were used to predict concentrations for stream flows for on all available days predicted concentrations were corrected for the log transform bias and used to compute the tp load for a third comparison i computed loads based on beale s ratio method a widely used method to estimate loads that often outperforms approaches based on estimating the flow tp relationship quilbé et al 2006 predicted loads for all methods were summarized as the proportional error in predicted tp load over the period of record for each site all calculations were performed with r r core team 2017 3 results fitting the hierarchical model to all available data yielded insights into the variations in the values of different coefficients among sites fig 2 point source contributions to the tp concentrations were largest for the maumee river with an estimate of 77 1 48 0 111 6 kg day 90 credible intervals in parentheses point source contributions to the blanchard river and the portage river were 22 0 18 0 26 3 kg day and 2 3 1 2 3 6 kg day respectively all other values of l were less than 1 kg day the value of d1 was very similar across all sites except for blanchard river the only site with a strong contribution from point sources credible intervals for d2 for all sites except for lost creek and maumee river overlapped at a value of approximately 0 35 whereas somewhat more variability was observed for d3 the exponent for flow d4 varied over a limited range from a low value of 0 35 to a high value 0 65 with most values clustered around 0 5 examples of model fits to the flow tp relationship illustrate the effects of point source contributions to blanchard river left panel fig 3 at flows below 3 m3 s tp varied inversely with flow exhibiting a dilution effect at higher flows nonpoint source contributions dominated and tp increased with increased flow the effects of seasonal variations in the flow tp relationship were large altering tp concentrations by over 0 1 mg l for a given flow depending on when a sample was collected for honey creek right panel fig 3 no effects of point source were evident and tp increased with increases in flow over the range of conditions sampled seasonal effects on tp concentration again accounted for a large proportion of variability in tp plots of flow tp relationships for other sites exhibited similar characteristics as the examples shown here fig s2 when applied to subsampled data the hierarchical model yielded more accurate and precise estimates of loads than those calculated with site specific models results using the portage river as the reference site are shown as an example comparison fig 4 but use of other sites as reference did not substantially change the results see below mean bias in the predictions can be assessed by comparing the values of mean predictive errors blue diamonds in fig 4 mean prediction errors for the hierarchical model were closer to zero than the other methods for all locations except for the blanchard river and lost creek in lost creek mean prediction error for simple linear regression was closer to zero than the hierarchical model but the distributions of the error overlapped with one another in the blanchard river mean prediction error for loads based on beale s ratio were closest to zero over all of the subsampled sites the average bias in the hierarchical model predictions was 0 08 the average biases associated with beale s ratio and with the linear load concentration model were both 0 10 and the bias associated with the seasonal model was much higher due to very uncertain predictions for rock creek and lost creek the ranges of prediction errors from the hierarchical were narrower for all sites compared to the site specific models indicating that in addition to providing more accurate results the hierarchical model provided more reliable predictions of tp load for any set of samples across all subsampled sites the average interquartile range of prediction errors for the hierarchical model was 0 22 whereas it was 0 33 0 49 and 0 91 for the linear flow concentration model beale s ratio and the seasonal flow concentration model respectively adding seasonal components to the simple regression model accounted for more factors that affect the flow tp relationship but introduced a greater potential for overfitting the limited number of samples hence the range of prediction errors observed in the seasonal site specific model was substantially broader than the other simpler methods e g yellow boxes compared to green boxes in fig 4 the choice of reference site exerted only a weak effect on the accuracy of the hierarchical model in predicting loads fig 5 regardless of the choice of reference site predictions of tp load for lost creek exhibited the greatest bias among all sites 3rd column in fig 5 however the bias in tp load predictions for lost creek were greatest when the blanchard river was used as the reference site this same pattern occurs for predictions in honey and rock creek in which use of the blanchard river data as the reference yielded a slightly greater bias than the use of other sites as reference 4 discussion the relationship between tp concentration and flow varies seasonally and these variations are difficult to predict for example in agricultural areas the interaction between the timing of precipitation events applications of fertilizer and crop growth strongly influences the flow tp relationship puustinen et al 2007 and predicting these interactions a priori is nearly impossible instead intensive data collection is needed to quantify the flow tp relationship in any location however within the scale of a particular watershed or group of neighboring watersheds we can likely assume that certain aspects of the timing of precipitation and farming practices are similar suggesting that flow tp relationships in these watersheds are similar the hierarchical model described here provides a statistical framework for taking advantage of these patterns to improve predictions in sparsely sampled locations based on one intensively sampled reference location and the present analysis has shown that applying the hierarchical model improves both the accuracy and precision of loads estimated at sparsely sampled sites this approach has potential for improving estimates of nutrient loads using existing data and optimizing future data collection efforts many methods are available for estimating constituent loads cohn 1995 but efforts to improve estimates for sparsely sampled locations are rare the widely used loadest model provides a variety of models for rating curves to estimate concentrations as a function of flow runkel et al 2004 and a more recent refinement of this approach uses locally weighted regression to better represent nonlinear relationships between concentrations and flow hirsch et al 2010 however the accuracy of these and other methods degrades as the density of data decreases quilbé et al 2006 targeted stratified sampling is often cited as the best and only approach for improving load estimates with a small number of samples robertson and roerish 1999 the method proposed here improves load estimates beyond those that would be achieved with an optimized sampling strategy 4 1 source apportionment apportioning observed tp concentrations into point and nonpoint contributions greatly facilitated the ability to identify similar trends in nonpoint concentration flow relationships the source apportionment model accurately reproduced the concave up relationship between flow and tp concentration when point sources were present e g the blanchard river other methods represent the flow concentration relationships in these cases with a quadratic curve that matches the data empirically but greatly reducing the interpretability of the model coefficients cohn et al 1992 by explicitly defining point and nonpoint contributions a simple power law relationship could be used to represent nonpoint source contributions in all locations and allow the imposition of hierarchical constraints on the model coefficients others have applied a hierarchical approach to estimate loads with a ratio estimator cha et al 2010 but the current approach applies hierarchical relationships specifically to the aspects of the flow concentration relationship that are expected to be related in the present formulation of the model the point source contribution identified in the blanchard river may still affect estimates of the nonpoint source contribution even after source apportionment more specifically the estimate of the coefficient d1 in the blanchard river differed significantly from estimates for the other sites and load estimates in subsampled data from the blanchard were somewhat less accurate than for other sites these differences suggest that the constant point source load that is used in the model may oversimplify the actual contribution from point sources the manifestation of point source loads of phosphorus as measured in stream tp concentrations may vary seasonally with differences in uptake rates and within river processing bowes et al 2015 jarvie et al 2012 furthermore the point source loads themselves may exhibit systematic seasonal variations and satellite imagery indicates that a wastewater treatment plant is directly upstream from the sampling location on the blanchard river so tp concentrations at this site may have been strongly influenced by variations in effluent loads the effect of point source loads at this location may also contribute to slightly reduced accuracy in estimated loads when the blanchard river is used as a reference site 4 2 implications and future work i have demonstrated one case example in this study in which a hierarchical model improves predictions of load in sparsely sampled sites but

2758,investigations of the hydrological processes of the yarlung zangbo river yzr a sizeable highland river on the southern margin of the tibetan plateau tp face challenging constraints owing to the complexities in the water sources and cycle pathway a total of 156 stream water samples from the yzr basin were collected and analyzed to elucidate our understanding of regional hydroclimate the isotopic values were more negative in the uppermost reaches of the yzr and progressively increased along the river with mean δ18o and δd values at 15 16 and 111 58 respectively a clear negative gradient of 0 19 100 m was obtained from the datasets which is consistent with that of the southeastern tp the linear regression for all samples was δd 8 64 δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 93 n 192 and the slope and intercept were highly similar to those of the meteoric water line in the tp suggesting that precipitation plays a dominant role in stream recharge sources combining the results from the air mass trajectory model and the d excess values we found that moisture in the yzr originates mainly from the bay of bengal with westerly mixing in the upper reaches in addition to precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal waters were considered significant water sources for the yzr based on geographic and geological conditions the proportion of glacial meltwater in the uppermost reaches was calculated to range from 68 2 to 70 4 using the end member mixing analysis method the contribution ratios of precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water were almost equal in the middle of the basin while glacial meltwater contribution dominated in the downstream regions these findings will significantly impact understanding of the hydrological cycle in the study area and provide vital baseline knowledge about the contribution proportion of different recharge sources in the yzr basin keywords yarlung zangbo river stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes emma hydrological cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to isotopic fractionation effects analysis of the variations in stable isotopes particularly δ 18o and δ 2h or δd in water can provide information to elucidate hydrological cycle processes dansgaard 1964 gat 2010 mclean and emslie 2012 van der sleen et al 2017 stable isotopic signatures are commonly used to track the sources of stream river water including precipitation ice snow meltwater lakes and groundwater they have also been used to infer groundwater evolution and provenance kong et al 2013 qin et al 2021 wang et al 2016 estimate the contribution ratio of glacial meltwater to rivers or lakes bhat et al 2022 fan et al 2015 and calculate the proportion of local water recycling in arid regions li and garzione 2017 in addition the isotopic composition can reveal the formation mechanism of precipitation wang et al 2019a and constrain the oceanic source of meteoric water guan et al 2013 in particular water stable isotopes provide evidence for identifying moisture sources and transport pathways on the tibetan plateau tp due to significant spatial variability of δ 18o and δd in waters in the mountain regions bhat et al 2022 galewsky et al 2016 hattermann et al 2017 although some fundamental processes controlling the distribution and flow of water within and between various subsystems of the regional hydrological cycles have been studied in the tp evaluating the relationship between different water bodies and quantifying the exchange between them remains a challenge precipitation surface water and groundwater are the most critical components of the hydrological cycle quantifying the exchange between them by studying isotopic compositions is critical for understanding the hydrological cycle processes in recent decades the international atomic energy agency iaea has collected global scale isotopic data of atmospheric water the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip has become a cornerstone of hydrological cycle research iaea wmo 2022 the gnip online database contains data collected from more than 1 200 meteorological stations in over 100 countries worldwide since 1961 although there is only one precipitation isotope monitoring station lhasa station set by iaea in the hinterland of the tp it still provides a valuable baseline for studying seasonal variation characteristics of rainwater isotopes in addition other researchers have also provided some time series data from other major cities such as rikaze linzhi and bomi gao et al 2012 which is also a critical reference baseline data for the analysis of isotopic characteristics of rainwater stable isotopes in surface waters have been studied intensively in the tp and himalayan front because they think that surface water may serve as a substitute for precipitation to compensate for the lack of rainwater samples li and garzione 2017 many studies bershaw et al 2012 hren et al 2009 quade et al 2011 ren et al 2017 yang et al 2021 have confirmed that the south asian monsoon westerly moisture and local surface water recycling are essential components of rainwater they have also identified a clear inverse relationship between δ18o and elevation but the lapse rates differ significantly across the tp the lapse rates were calculated as 0 21 100 m on the northeast margin of the tp bershaw et al 2012 and as high as 0 36 100 m in the southern himalayas wen et al 2012 this indicates that the isotopic characteristics of surface water may vary markedly in different areas such as the southern margins and interior of the plateau targeted research is essential to understand the regional and catchment scale hydrological cycle this may be achieved by analyzing the spatial variability of isotopic characteristics of surface water however these studies ignored the contribution of glaciers and groundwater to river water using isotopic methods shi et al 2021a focused on the isotopic composition of river water groundwater and glacier meltwater in the nianchu river basin a small catchment on the southern margin of the tp they found that the contribution of groundwater is 46 6 in the dry season and that of glacier meltwater is 65 9 in the wet season this indicates that groundwater and glacier meltwater cannot be ignored in the hydrological cycle over the tp but their contribution is still unclear the yarlung zangbo river yzr the upper brahmaputra river is the largest and most elevated river in the tp accounting for 42 4 of the runoff of waterways outside the tp liu et al 2021a the yzr basin is rarely disturbed by human activities due to its high altitude and cold temperature therefore its hydrological processes reflect the natural characteristics of the tp water cycle this contributes to understanding and predicting global climate change because of the high sensitivity of the tp water cycle cheng and wu 2007 liu et al 2021b previous studies have shown that moisture from the arabian sea and the bay of bengal crosses the himalayas to form precipitation with a unique isotopic composition still the contribution of precipitation to stream water remains unclear in addition thousands of glaciers are also distributed in the yzr basin and glacial meltwater may be another important source for the yzr maurer et al 2019 yao et al 2010 moreover geothermal activities occur extensively in the yzr basin due to an active tectonic system in the india asia continental subduction zone zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 hot springs and geysers generated by geothermal activity may provide a large quantity of deep groundwater to the yzr however the proportion contributions of these potential recharge sources of river runoff are unknown leading to ambiguity about the recharge mechanisms of the yzr previous studies have shown the preliminary isotopic characteristics of river water in the yzr based on very sparse river water samples collected in the main stem shi et al 2021a 2021b tan et al 2021 due to the lack of high resolution spatial isotopic data these studies had difficulty elucidating the hydrological cycle over the entire yzr basin knowledge about the recharge mechanisms of river water is highly relevant to addressing the scientific gaps in understanding the critical issues of water resources eco hydrological processes and cryospheric feedback under climatic warming in water tower regions globally to address this research gap this study presents an intensive stream water isotope dataset covering the main stem in the yzr and its major tributaries to explore the spatial variability of stream river water isotopes and the potential controlling factors the isotopic data were used to investigate hydrologic cycle patterns in the yzr basin based on the isotopic characteristics the local stream river water line equation for the tributaries and main stem of the yzr was obtained by linear regression combined analysis of vapor trajectories the deuterium excess d excess values and the altitude effect of isotopes further constrained the moisture sources to help understand the stream water isotope distribution in addition the potential proportions of different stream water sources were quantitatively calculated using the isotopic data of each potential source and the end member mixing analysis method through this approach the hydrologic cycle process and recharge mechanism of the yzr were elucidated which is helpful for further understanding water resources eco hydrological processes and cryospheric feedback under climatic warming in water tower regions globally 2 general setting of the study area the yzr originates from the jema yangzong glacier and flows from west to east through the south of the tp finally flowing into the bay of bengal fig 1 a it is a typical highland river with an average elevation of over 4 600 m you et al 2007 fig 1b as the upstream section of the brahmaputra the yzr is 2 057 km in length with a basin area of 24 2 104 km2 in china and its mean annual river discharge is approximately 1 600 km3 jia et al 2008 xuan et al 2021 the potential hydropower in the yzr basin is around 130 gw xu et al 2002 as the river descends about 5 400 m from west to east with an average gradient of 2 6 fig 1c this attracts much attention because while hydropower development reduces dependence on fossil fuels it also causes ecological and environmental issues in the tp jia et al 2008 the yzr basin can be divided roughly into three sections the upper middle and lower reaches based on differences in geographic features the upper reaches stretch from the headwater region to the lizi and the middle reach from the lizi to milin near the nuxia hydrological station and the lower from milin to pasighat fig 1c the climate in the yzr basin is dominated by the indian monsoon it can be characterized as semi arid in the upper reaches and monsoon semi humid in the middle and lower reaches due to differences in location and topographical features the climate of the yzr basin varies greatly fig 2 shows the spatial variations in annual mean air temperature fig 2a precipitation fig 2b and air humidity fig 2c in the yzr basin based on the daily meteorological data collected by the china meteorological administration over the past few decades the warm and moist airflow over the bay of bengal in the indian ocean flows along the yzr valley and is the most important water source for precipitation in the yzr basin therefore due to the weakening effect of the monsoon precipitation gradually decreases from the lower reaches to the upper reaches of the basin the annual precipitation in pasighat can reach more than 6 000 mm whereas it is lower than 300 mm in the headwater region fig 2b liu et al 2019c the annual average precipitation is 949 mm and the majority of precipitation occurs in the warm season june july august and september affected by the summer monsoon dong et al 2016 sang et al 2016 xuan et al 2021 in addition the annual mean air humidity of the yzr basin varies from 34 in the upper reaches to 82 in the lower region fig 2c showing remarkable spatial variability the world glacial inventory shows that the yzr basin contains 10 816 glaciers liu et al 2012 the glaciers cover approximately 14 493 km2 in area and 1 293 km3 in ice volume accounting for 29 of all glaciers on the tp wang et al 2021 yao et al 2010 fig 1c a large number of glacier meltwater provides water sources for the yzr in the warm season geologically the yzr basin develops from northwest to southeast along the indus zangbo suture zone and is adjacent to the lhasa terrane to the north and the tethyan sedimentary sequences to the south wang et al 2019b as a result there are many active faults in the yzr basin and abundant geothermal resources are derived from these faults hébert et al 2012 liu et al 2020 pan et al 2012 a large number of geothermal springs and geysers have been found in the yzr basin which discharge into the river as a source of some of its water hren et al 2007 wang et al 2017 groundwater plays a critical role in sustaining the yzr flows particularly during the dry winter seasons and stores rainfall in the monsoon seasons that buffers peak river discharges cuthbert et al 2019 yao et al 2021 in mountainous hydrological systems rainfall water usually infiltrates through fractures in the bedrock and transforms into groundwater most groundwater drains into rivers through springs in steep terrains such as river terraces therefore rainwater groundwater and stream water are very closely related here we estimate the contribution of groundwater to stream water with a focus on the effect of hydrothermal water on stream water recharge 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and isotope analysis a total of 156 stream water samples were obtained in july 2018 including 13 from the main stem and 143 from the tributaries of the yzr fig 3 two glacier meltwater samples and two geothermal water samples were collected during the same period the sampling site elevations ranged from 2 000 m to 5 500 m the major tributaries defined by catchment sizes larger than 1 500 km2 of the yzr include the chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu nianchu lhasa nyangqu and parlung zangbo rivers the six major tributaries on the left bank chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu lhasa river nyangqu and parlung zangbo of the yzr were intensively sampled the sampling locations are shown in fig 3 all water samples were collected 10 15 cm below the surface of flowing water water samples were stored in high density polyethylene bottles after complete air removal to avoid evaporation all sample bottles were transferred to a dark and cold container before being transported to the laboratory all stream water samples were measured for stable isotopes δd and δ18o using an l1102 i picarro usa water isotope analyzer in weathering and hydro geochemistry laboratory at the institute of geology and geophysics chinese academy of sciences whl iggcas during the analysis each isotopic standard and sample was tested six times and the mean value of the last four analyses was used as the final result the analytical accuracy was 0 5 for δd and 0 1 for δ 18o the results were expressed as delta values defined as the per mil deviation from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as follows δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r represents the isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the sample and standard respectively in addition 25 stable isotopic values including δd and δ 18o of stream water from the lhasa river basin and 11 stable isotopic values of stream water from the nianchu river basin were extracted from published literature to expand the database liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b shi et al 2021b to evaluate the contribution of different sources to stream water we also collected isotopic data for six rainwater samples three glacier samples and three geothermal water samples which are detailed in table s2 3 2 isotopic data of the different end members as mentioned earlier precipitation glacier meltwater and geothermal water could be sources for the yzr based on the preliminary analysis however there is a vast difference in geographical and climatic characteristics because the yzr basin spans many longitudes from west to east across a huge area therefore we used different end members to calculate the contribution proportion of different water sources for each small catchment the precipitation isotopic data in lhaze rikaze linzhi and bomi gao et al 2012 were used to calculate the contribution of precipitation in the chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo xiangqu nyangqu and parlung zangbo catchments respectively the isotopic values of glacier meltwater were obtained from ren et al 2016 and three samples were collected in july 2012 from the jema yangzong glacier which is regarded as the headwater of the yzr basin they were used to calculate the contribution of glacier meltwater in the chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo catchments the lhasa site 29 39 n 91 06 e 3 650 m above sea level set up by iaea iaea wmo 2022 has long term precipitation isotope data from 1986 to 1992 the mean value of precipitation isotopes in july from 1986 to 1992 at the lhasa site was selected as the end members to calculate the contribution proportion of precipitation in the lhasa river catchment geothermal water end members were collected from the yangbajing geothermal field which is an active non volcanic geothermal system with the highest reservoir temperature in china and has been developed for power generation guo et al 2007 the isotopic data of glacier meltwater in nyenchen tanglha glacier was used to calculate its contribution to the lhasa river catchment table s2 shows details of all data sources 3 3 contribution calculation for potential sources to calculate the contribution of different potential sources end member mixing analysis emma was brought into hydrology by hooper et al 1990 to quantify the dominant sources of runoff water barthold et al 2011 conserved components in water such as chloride stable isotopes and their derived parameters can be used as indicators to calculate the proportion of different input end members in the emma model input end members were assumed to be constant in space and time and the isotopic composition of stream water was considered only as the mixing of different water bodies without any change during flow the emma method has been used to analyze the contribution ratios of potential recharge sources in many hydrological studies kuhlemann et al 2021 ramón et al 2021 shi et al 2021a in a river system comprising of two or more end member components the relationship between the proportion of the potential source and the concentration of an end members indicator can be described by the following equation i 1 n f i 1 i 1 n f i c i j c m j where fi denotes the proportion of potential source i and n represents the end members number and c m j denotes the concentration of j incorporated in component i when precipitation and glacial meltwater are selected to calculate the mass balance mixing model the equation can be rewritten as follows 3 1 f precipitation f glacier 4 δ 18 o stream δ 18 o precipitation f precipitation δ 18 o glacier f glacier where f precipitation and f glacier represent the proportions of precipitation and glacial meltwater for stream water respectively the equation can also be rewritten when three end members are chosen to calculate the contribution as follows 5 1 f precipitation f glacier f gw 6 δ 18 o stream δ 18 o precipitation f precipitation δ 18 o glacier f glacier δ 18 o gw f gw 7 d stream d precipitation f precipitation d glacier f glacier d gw f gw where f gw represents the proportion of geothermal water such as hot springs and d represents the deuterium excess values of stream water precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water respectively equations 3 to 7 can be solved directly by the substitution method δ 18o and δd have been used successfully to track water sources for many decades feng et al 2022 jeelani et al 2021 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 ideally water source end members are described by signatures that are independent of each other in this study to construct a three end members mixing model the δ 18o and d values were used as a dual tracer approach because δ 18o and δd are strongly correlated and dependent although the d value is derived from stable o and h isotopes the δ 18o and d values do not significantly covary figure s1 and can thus be used as independent tracers the δ 18o and d value mixing model has been applied successfully in many hydrological studies such as local hydroclimate studies hydrograph separation analysis and water balance investigations boral and sen 2020 boral et al 2019 feng et al 2022 jeelani et al 2021 montagud et al 2021 3 4 interpolation method in this study the ordinary kriging interpolation method was used to construct the spatial distribution of precipitation temperature and humidity fig 2 as well as spatial isoscapes fig 4 in the study area including δ 18o δd and d excess it takes both the distance and degree of variation among known points into consideration and then estimates the unknown points due to ordinary kriging s merits in providing the best linear unbiased predictions and the best sense of minimum variance it helped us to obtain an overview of regional precipitation temperature humidity and isoscapes to get an interpolation map of the whole yzr basin all meteorological data at the 18 stations and all isotopic stream water data were used to generate a spatial distribution of these meteorological features and isotopes then the extent of the yzr basin was added to them to get figs 2 and 3 all the interpolation and mapping processes were carried out using the surfer and arcgis software 3 5 moisture back trajectories to understand the moisture sources we performed numerical simulation research to track water vapor sources across the yzr basin moisture back trajectories were calculated using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model version 4 0 stein et al 2015 in this model the chaiqu duoxiong zangbo lhasa river and parlung zangbo catchments were chosen for moisture trajectory analysis to track the moisture source of rainwater from july to august 2018 because rainwater may be an important recharge source for stream water for each representative locality the start points of back trajectories were chosen at three levels 100 m 500 m and 1 000 m above ground level the simulation period was 48 h which means that we were able to trace back the movement pathway of the moisture to 48 h before its arrival to form precipitation archived reanalysis data from the global noaa national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar meteorological dataset was used as input data the spatial resolution was 1 latitude longitude this approach combining the hysplit results and isotopic data to uncover the origin and evolution processes of rainwater has been used in many previous hydrological cycle studies bagheri et al 2019 bershaw and lechler 2019 mohammadzadeh et al 2020 4 results 4 1 isotope composition and deuterium excess of stream water the basic information of all stream water samples hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values and d excess values are shown in table s1 table 1 shows the statistical characteristics of the stream water isotopes and d excess of the main stem major tributaries and other minor tributaries the d excess value was defined by dansgaard 1964 as d excess δd 8 δ 18o the δ 18o and δd values of the stream water samples in the yzr basin varied from 20 4 to 10 2 and 146 3 to 66 1 with mean values of 15 2 and 111 6 respectively the isotopic values in water generally tend to be more negative in the west and more positive in the east and there is a clear boundary near 92 e longitudes the average δ 18o and δd values in the western of the yzr basin were approximately 17 4 and 133 3 respectively while those in the eastern part were greater than 13 6 and 96 2 respectively fig 4a b the minimum δ 18o and δd values occurred in the lhasa river basin with average values of 18 6 and 139 5 respectively the maximum values of stable isotopes were 12 4 and 89 3 in the nyangqu catchment respectively the mean d excess value for all stream water samples collected in the yzr basin was 10 table 1 fig 4c which equals the global d excess in precipitation but there were obvious differences between the different catchments the mean d excess values in the main stem 9 43 in lhasa river 9 57 in nyangqu 9 65 and in nianchu river 9 65 were close to 10 while those in chaiqu 4 20 duoxiong zangbo 0 24 and xiangqu 5 62 were much lesser and parlung zangbo had a much highest mean value of 15 48 4 2 linear relationship between δd and δ 18o in stream water the linear regression between δd and δ 18o of all stream water can generate a yzr stream water line swl defined by the equation δd 8 64 δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 94 n 192 fig 5 the swl of the main stem of the yzr was δd 7 00 δ 18o 6 86 r2 0 62 n 13 the slopes and intercepts of the swl were different for each major tributary and are listed in table 2 the swl slope and intercept of all data in the yzr were 8 64 and 19 80 respectively while those for the himalayas were 8 7 and 29 9 respectively however there are remarkable differences between the swl slope and intercept for the seven major sub catchments table 2 the slope and intercept of swl in the upper reaches of the yzr were significantly lower than those in the lower reaches in the upper reaches such as chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo they ranged from 4 58 to 5 01 and from 53 37 to 49 18 respectively in contrast they varied from 6 18 to 8 89 and from 0 24 to 27 84 respectively in the lhasa nyangqu and nianchu river catchments 4 3 hysplit air mass back trajectories based on the results of the hysplit modeling moisture sources were tracked in four small catchments during the sample period as shown in fig 6 these results indicate that the bay of bengal is the principal vapor origin location for the yzr stream water in addition local water vapor recycling is another major source of rainwater in the study area the precipitation in both the lhasa river and parlung zangbo basins mainly originated from the bay of bengal in the sample period fig 6 which is consistent with the results of previous moisture origin studies in the lhasa river basin dai et al 2021 tian et al 2020 in the headwater regions of the yzr including the chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo catchments the water vapor above 500 m mainly came from the southern foothills of the himalayas while the water vapor below 100 m mainly originated from local water vapor recycling fig 6c 4 4 contribution ratios of different end member based on the large isotopic dataset from precipitation glacial melt water geothermal spring water and stream water obtained from existing literature and this study the contribution of different recharge sources was calculated using the emma approach for several small catchments including chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu nianchu river lhasa river nyangqu and parlung zangbo the results are presented in table 3 5 discussion 5 1 recharge effect of rainwater the linear relationship between the δd and δ 18o in local precipitation is referred to as the local meteoric water line lmwl which is a useful tool to track sources and understand the hydrological processes of water by comparing the relative position between the lmwl and a given sample in a plot of δ 18o versus δd gat 1996 jasechko 2019 rozanski et al 1993 the lhasa site 29 7 n 91 13e 3 649 m above sea level is the only gnip site in the yzr basin it was monitored from june 1986 to december 1992 with 42 samples in total based on these data the lmwl can be obtained by a precipitation amount weighted least squares regression as shown in fig 5 the lmwl was δd 7 89 0 15 δ 18o 8 17 2 15 r2 0 99 n 42 iaea wmo 2022 in general the isotopic data of the yzr stream water were scattered along both sides of the lmwl indicating that the relationship between stream water and precipitation is very close and may be of meteoric origin however the slope and intercept of the swl established based on the stream water data of each small catchment were quite different from those of the lwml particularly the intercept precipitation isotopes are significantly affected by geographical and seasonal features and on the other hand there may be large differences in the composition of stream water sources in different catchments kumar et al 2018 present a series of lmwls of the himalayas in different seasons and the intercepts of lmwl in july and august are 22 63 and 17 81 which are very close to the intercept of the swl derived from our stream water data in contrast the intercept of the glacial meltwater line ranged from 37 38 to 9 45 kumar et al 2018 which is close to the intercept of swl in the upper and midstream regions of yzr basin such as the chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu and lhasa catchments in addition both the slope and the intercept show an increasing trend as we move downstream this may reflect the sub cloud evaporation of rainfall local surface evaporation or different recharge sources in different catchments of stream water ren et al 2018 ren et al 2017 the lower swl slope indicates that the stream water has undergone more evaporation it can be inferred that the evaporation intensity gradually weakened as we moved downstream this suggests that the vapor mainly controlled by the south asian monsoon is very likely to originate in the bay of bengal it flows from downstream to upstream along the yzr valley to form precipitation after increasing levels of evaporation along the way unique δ 18o and δd characteristics of the stream water in the yzr are formed furthermore the δ 18o and δd data point distribution of samples from a single small catchment was relatively concentrated fig 5 indicating that all the stream water in each catchment originates from the same water source or undergoes similar hydrological processes in addition some overlap of the δ 18o and δd data points occurs for two close adjacent catchments this can be attributed to the extremely high similarity in their climatic and geographical features however the upstream water isotopic data were distributed in the left lower corner more negative of the δ 18o versus δd plot while those of the downstream water were distributed in the right upper more positive corner fig 5 this likely indicates that there are certain differences in the sources and processes between tributaries 5 2 moisture sources of the study area and altitude effect considering that rainwater is one of the important recharge sources of stream water we first discuss and analyze the source of water vapor in rainwater in the study area which can lay a foundation for analyzing the isotopic characteristics and controlling factors of stream water the hysplit trajectories show that moisture from the bay of bengal and local recycling is the major source of rainwater in the study area during the sampling period and they mainly determine the isotopic composition of rainwater in addition the d excess values can also be used to indicate the moisture source quite a few studies on precipitation have shown that sub cloud evaporation and increased recycling of moisture from evapotranspiration processes may lead to a decrease in d excess bershaw et al 2012 kong et al 2013 ren et al 2017 the water vapor originating from the bay of bengal flows from east to west along the yzr valley and undergoes increasing evaporation resulting in the gradual decrease of d excess river water is the integration of rainwater in a catchment during a period and its isotopic characteristics can reflect the isotopic variation of rainwater bershaw and lechler 2019 li and garzione 2017 thus it explains the d excess value change in stream water from the parlung zangbo to the duoxiong zangbo catchment fig 3c however d excess increased at the yzr headwaters which might be caused by mixing monsoon and westerly derived precipitation similar results have also been reported by hren et al 2009 and ren et al 2016 where regional changes in moisture sources were considered to be the main cause of the increase in d excess in yzr headwaters in addition the relationship between oxygen isotopes and elevation in the yzr basin may be used to infer the factors that control stream water s isotopic characteristics based on linear regression the δ 18o altitudinal gradient is 0 19 100 m figure s3 which is highly consistent with the results obtained by hoke et al 2014 in the southeastern tp however the altitude effect was inverted when we focused on the isotopic composition of stream water from the middle to the upper reaches of the yzr this may be caused either by different sources of water vapor or by mixing different water bodies such as hot springs geothermal springs and groundwater the yzr is the longest river traversing the southern tp from west to east as such the indian summer monsoon weakens towards the yzr headwater and simultaneously the influence of westerly circulation strengthens in this region in addition a large number of normal extensional faults occur in the yzr basin which could provide permeable flow paths for the deep hot groundwater to move to the near surface and discharge into the river many hot springs and geysers have recently been reported in the geothermal belt within the southern part of the tp li et al 2019 qu et al 2017 tang et al 2016 therefore the spatial differences in the isotopic characteristics of stream water in the different small catchments are likely to be caused by the inflow of different water sources 5 3 spatial variation contribution proportion of different sources the same end members precipitation glacier meltwater and geothermal water were selected in the adjacent chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo catchments these two small catchments are located in the uppermost region of the yzr basin more than 800 km away from the lhasa site with long term precipitation isotopic data thus it is fair to select precipitation isotope data from closer stations to calculate the precipitation contribution in these two catchments gao et al 2012 provide precipitation isotopic data table s2 in lhaze located near the duoxiong zangbo catchment fig 3 the isotopic values of glacial meltwater end members were selected from ren et al 2016 we obtained data about the geothermal water end member from a hot spring located near the chaiqu catchment the relative proportions of the three end members were 24 47 70 39 and 5 15 for precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal groundwater respectively in chaiqu and 27 59 68 16 and 4 26 respectively in duoxiong zangbo fig 7 according to these results glacial meltwater is the dominant recharge source for both chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo with a slightly lower proportion in duoxiong zangbo compared to chaiqu because of the slightly higher precipitation although there are some geothermal springs in this area the amount of geothermal water contributing to recharge was very low the glacier meltwater isotopic values used in contribution calculation are 112 5 and 15 8 for δd and δ 18o respectively ren et al 2016 they are the average of isotopic values taken from three glacier samples in jema yangzong glacier it is consistent with the glacier data provided by kumar et al 2019 thus we believe that these samples are reasonably representative of the glacier meltwater isotopic features in the regions from which they were collected xiangqu river is on the left bank of the yzr and nianchu river is on the right they join the yzr at almost the same location near rikaze fig 3 considering that xiangqu and nianchu are two adjacent catchment basins the same input end element can be used to calculate relative contribution however the glacier survey results revealed relatively fewer glaciers in the xiangqu catchment yao et al 2010 whereas many glaciers are distributed along the ridge of the nianchu river watershed therefore the glacial meltwater end member in the xiangqu catchment was neglected and the contributions of precipitation and geothermal water were 52 9 and 47 1 respectively in the nianchu river catchment the contributions of precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water were 65 9 26 5 and 7 6 respectively the proportion of precipitation contribution was similar in these two catchments ranging from approximately one half to two thirds indicating that precipitation is an important recharge source we used the data provided by liu et al 2019b to calculate the contributions of the three end members in the lhasa river catchment the results showed that the proportions were 34 2 28 8 and 37 0 for precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water respectively the results indicated that the contributions of the three end members were almost equal in the lhasa river catchment because there is abundant precipitation a large number of glaciers and multiple active geothermal fields in the area in the nyangqu catchment the isotopic data of the precipitation end member were collected from linzhi gao et al 2012 table s2 the glacial meltwater end member sample was collected from the uppermost reaches of this catchment and the geothermal water end member samples were collected from within the catchment the proportions of precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water were 10 7 51 0 and 38 3 respectively in the adjacent parlung zangbo catchment field investigations found that hot springs were uncommon and their records are rare in the literature indicating that near surface geothermal activity here is low therefore geothermal water end member can be neglected in this catchment the proportions of precipitation and glacial meltwater were 33 3 and 66 7 respectively this suggests that glacial meltwater is the dominant source for the parlung zangbo river which is consistent with the abundance of glaciers in this catchment fig 1c the complexity of the geological characteristics climate and topographical conditions in the yzr triggers a wide variation in the contributions of different recharge sources to runoff glacial meltwater is the most important recharge source in the upper reaches of the yzr and its proportion can reach 90 because of the area s low rainfall and sparse hot springs in the middle region of the yzr around the lhasa river catchment the proportion of each of the end members was almost equal because of the higher rainfall abundance of glaciers and active geothermal system of the area moreover in the eastern region of the yzr glacial meltwater again became the main contributor to stream water because of the large number of glaciers higher temperatures and inactive geothermal systems due to the wide range of conditions of the three end members over the entire yzr basin it is impossible to choose or establish appropriate precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water end members therefore we do not provide a proportional contribution of these end members for the mainstream of the yzr due to the diversity of water sources differences in geographical features and different meteorological conditions the contribution proportion of precipitation glacier meltwater and geothermal water end members showed significant differences across the different locations of the yzr basin table 3 however it is undeniable that the uncertainty in the results of the contribution calculations was largely brought about by end member selection in our calculation we selected the isotopic data of the precipitation samples in july as the precipitation end member to ensure that it was collected in the same period as the stream water samples table s2 but in fact there is a lag in precipitation entering the river and its isotope value is also affected by other factors like evaporation in addition the yarlung zangbo suture is an active tectonic system so it may create many hot springs in the yzr basin hren et al 2007 wang et al 2017 due to the harsh natural conditions and huge areas the hot springs in the yzr basin have not been fully discovered there may be hot springs that contribute significantly to the yzr but have not yet been discovered moreover different geothermal genetic models can also cause significant differences in the isotopic composition of geothermal water tan et al 2021 therefore the selection of geothermal water end members will bring great uncertainty to the calculation results finally there are a large number of glaciers in the study area and the study of the isotopic composition of glacial meltwater is currently at a preliminary stage however we believe that the representativeness of glaciers is more reliable because most glaciers melting occurs in summer and the meltwater enters the river quickly in summary the uncertainty in the calculation process of the emma model caused by the precipitation end member and the geothermal water end member cannot be ignored 5 4 implications for the hydrological cycle the total annual runoff of the yzr is approximately 165 4 billion m3 and more than 60 occurs from july to september jia et al 2008 liu et al 2021a similarly nearly 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the rainy season from july to september sang et al 2016 in the nuxia hydrological station nhs located in the lower reach of the yzr fig 1c the monitoring results show that the runoff in july accounts for 18 49 of the annual runoff in august it is 23 87 and in september it is 17 98 jia et al 2008 it can be seen that this three month flow has accounted for 60 34 of the annual runoff although rainwater causes river flow to change with a lag precipitation has always been considered an essential part of river runoff in the yzr according to the results calculated from emma fig 7 the proportion of precipitation varies from 10 7 to 65 9 over the yzr basin it also indicates that precipitation is a dominant component of the yzr runoff and this is very similar to the numerical simulation results by jiang 2020 and liu et al 2019c therefore it can be inferred that runoff variations of the yzr are mainly due to precipitation changes in magnitude and variability at intra annual and inter annual changes in addition the maximum value of the proportion of glacier meltwater can reach 70 39 in the very upper reach of the yzr basin and it is 66 7 in the parlung zangbo catchment according to our emma results the numerical simulation result shows that the proportion of the glacier snow meltwater ranges from 33 7 to 44 7 with an average value of 38 21 in the nhs jiang 2020 it can be seen that glacier meltwater is also an essential component of the yzr runoff global climate change may bring widespread change to the tp such as the rising air temperature declining wind speed pan evaporation paradox dimming solar radiation wu et al 2021 etc moreover there was a small overall increase in precipitation in the yzr basin in the past century xu et al 2019a xu et al 2019b xuan et al 2021 a corresponding increase in rainfall will also result in a significant increase in river runoff still the runoff would increase if air temperatures continued to rise because it would melt more glaciers however glacier retreat is an irreversible process during global climatic changes combined with all these actions effect it is foreseeable that the yzr flow will continue to increase in the future because of more rainfall and glacier meltwater rising river flow and the water level will cause downstream flooding or geological disasters threatening downstream safety 6 summary and conclusion here we analyzed the stable isotopic characteristics of stream waters across the yzr basin to reveal the river recharge mechanisms and quantitatively estimate the contributions of different recharge sources of the yzr basin a total of 156 stream water samples were collected from the main stem and tributaries in the yzr basin subsequently the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values and d excess values were presented in detail combined with previously published data stable isotopic spatial characteristics were revealed a series of local stream water lines for each small catchment in the yzr basin was constructed using linear regression analysis moisture sources were tracked using hysplit modeling and the effect of altitude on oxygen isotopes was also calculated in addition the contributions of potential water sources were quantitatively estimated based on the stable isotopic data using the emma method the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values of stream water in the yzr basin varied from 20 4 to 10 2 and 146 3 to 66 1 with mean values of 15 2 and 111 6 respectively the local surface water line of the yzr was δd 8 64 δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 91 n 192 and the slope was very close to that of the lmwl but the intercept was higher than that of the lmwl the stable isotopic data of the yzr were closely distributed along the lmwl indicating that stream water mainly came from precipitation hysplit modeling results and d excess values showed that precipitation in the study area mainly originated from the bay of bengal however it is also affected by the westerlies in the uppermost region of the yzr the potential sources of yzr stream water include glacial meltwater atmospheric precipitation and geothermal springs and their proportions change spatially glacial meltwater was the dominant recharge source in the uppermost reaches of the yzr with a ratio ranging from 68 2 to 70 4 in the middle parts of the yzr basin such as the xiangqu nianchu river and lhasa river basins the contribution ratios of the three supply sources were almost equal in the eastern regions of the yzr basin the proportion of glacial meltwater end member was greater than 50 because of the large number of glaciers in these areas and the relatively high air temperature in particular the contribution of glacial meltwater to river water was found to be crucial in the yzr basin longer and more extensive observations of stream water isotopes in the yzr basin should be conducted to fairly and precisely ascertain the contributions of different potential recharge sources the results of the present study are expected to have major implications for understanding the hydrogeological cycle and managing water resources in the yzr basin credit authorship contribution statement liheng wang conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

2758,investigations of the hydrological processes of the yarlung zangbo river yzr a sizeable highland river on the southern margin of the tibetan plateau tp face challenging constraints owing to the complexities in the water sources and cycle pathway a total of 156 stream water samples from the yzr basin were collected and analyzed to elucidate our understanding of regional hydroclimate the isotopic values were more negative in the uppermost reaches of the yzr and progressively increased along the river with mean δ18o and δd values at 15 16 and 111 58 respectively a clear negative gradient of 0 19 100 m was obtained from the datasets which is consistent with that of the southeastern tp the linear regression for all samples was δd 8 64 δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 93 n 192 and the slope and intercept were highly similar to those of the meteoric water line in the tp suggesting that precipitation plays a dominant role in stream recharge sources combining the results from the air mass trajectory model and the d excess values we found that moisture in the yzr originates mainly from the bay of bengal with westerly mixing in the upper reaches in addition to precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal waters were considered significant water sources for the yzr based on geographic and geological conditions the proportion of glacial meltwater in the uppermost reaches was calculated to range from 68 2 to 70 4 using the end member mixing analysis method the contribution ratios of precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water were almost equal in the middle of the basin while glacial meltwater contribution dominated in the downstream regions these findings will significantly impact understanding of the hydrological cycle in the study area and provide vital baseline knowledge about the contribution proportion of different recharge sources in the yzr basin keywords yarlung zangbo river stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes emma hydrological cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to isotopic fractionation effects analysis of the variations in stable isotopes particularly δ 18o and δ 2h or δd in water can provide information to elucidate hydrological cycle processes dansgaard 1964 gat 2010 mclean and emslie 2012 van der sleen et al 2017 stable isotopic signatures are commonly used to track the sources of stream river water including precipitation ice snow meltwater lakes and groundwater they have also been used to infer groundwater evolution and provenance kong et al 2013 qin et al 2021 wang et al 2016 estimate the contribution ratio of glacial meltwater to rivers or lakes bhat et al 2022 fan et al 2015 and calculate the proportion of local water recycling in arid regions li and garzione 2017 in addition the isotopic composition can reveal the formation mechanism of precipitation wang et al 2019a and constrain the oceanic source of meteoric water guan et al 2013 in particular water stable isotopes provide evidence for identifying moisture sources and transport pathways on the tibetan plateau tp due to significant spatial variability of δ 18o and δd in waters in the mountain regions bhat et al 2022 galewsky et al 2016 hattermann et al 2017 although some fundamental processes controlling the distribution and flow of water within and between various subsystems of the regional hydrological cycles have been studied in the tp evaluating the relationship between different water bodies and quantifying the exchange between them remains a challenge precipitation surface water and groundwater are the most critical components of the hydrological cycle quantifying the exchange between them by studying isotopic compositions is critical for understanding the hydrological cycle processes in recent decades the international atomic energy agency iaea has collected global scale isotopic data of atmospheric water the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip has become a cornerstone of hydrological cycle research iaea wmo 2022 the gnip online database contains data collected from more than 1 200 meteorological stations in over 100 countries worldwide since 1961 although there is only one precipitation isotope monitoring station lhasa station set by iaea in the hinterland of the tp it still provides a valuable baseline for studying seasonal variation characteristics of rainwater isotopes in addition other researchers have also provided some time series data from other major cities such as rikaze linzhi and bomi gao et al 2012 which is also a critical reference baseline data for the analysis of isotopic characteristics of rainwater stable isotopes in surface waters have been studied intensively in the tp and himalayan front because they think that surface water may serve as a substitute for precipitation to compensate for the lack of rainwater samples li and garzione 2017 many studies bershaw et al 2012 hren et al 2009 quade et al 2011 ren et al 2017 yang et al 2021 have confirmed that the south asian monsoon westerly moisture and local surface water recycling are essential components of rainwater they have also identified a clear inverse relationship between δ18o and elevation but the lapse rates differ significantly across the tp the lapse rates were calculated as 0 21 100 m on the northeast margin of the tp bershaw et al 2012 and as high as 0 36 100 m in the southern himalayas wen et al 2012 this indicates that the isotopic characteristics of surface water may vary markedly in different areas such as the southern margins and interior of the plateau targeted research is essential to understand the regional and catchment scale hydrological cycle this may be achieved by analyzing the spatial variability of isotopic characteristics of surface water however these studies ignored the contribution of glaciers and groundwater to river water using isotopic methods shi et al 2021a focused on the isotopic composition of river water groundwater and glacier meltwater in the nianchu river basin a small catchment on the southern margin of the tp they found that the contribution of groundwater is 46 6 in the dry season and that of glacier meltwater is 65 9 in the wet season this indicates that groundwater and glacier meltwater cannot be ignored in the hydrological cycle over the tp but their contribution is still unclear the yarlung zangbo river yzr the upper brahmaputra river is the largest and most elevated river in the tp accounting for 42 4 of the runoff of waterways outside the tp liu et al 2021a the yzr basin is rarely disturbed by human activities due to its high altitude and cold temperature therefore its hydrological processes reflect the natural characteristics of the tp water cycle this contributes to understanding and predicting global climate change because of the high sensitivity of the tp water cycle cheng and wu 2007 liu et al 2021b previous studies have shown that moisture from the arabian sea and the bay of bengal crosses the himalayas to form precipitation with a unique isotopic composition still the contribution of precipitation to stream water remains unclear in addition thousands of glaciers are also distributed in the yzr basin and glacial meltwater may be another important source for the yzr maurer et al 2019 yao et al 2010 moreover geothermal activities occur extensively in the yzr basin due to an active tectonic system in the india asia continental subduction zone zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 hot springs and geysers generated by geothermal activity may provide a large quantity of deep groundwater to the yzr however the proportion contributions of these potential recharge sources of river runoff are unknown leading to ambiguity about the recharge mechanisms of the yzr previous studies have shown the preliminary isotopic characteristics of river water in the yzr based on very sparse river water samples collected in the main stem shi et al 2021a 2021b tan et al 2021 due to the lack of high resolution spatial isotopic data these studies had difficulty elucidating the hydrological cycle over the entire yzr basin knowledge about the recharge mechanisms of river water is highly relevant to addressing the scientific gaps in understanding the critical issues of water resources eco hydrological processes and cryospheric feedback under climatic warming in water tower regions globally to address this research gap this study presents an intensive stream water isotope dataset covering the main stem in the yzr and its major tributaries to explore the spatial variability of stream river water isotopes and the potential controlling factors the isotopic data were used to investigate hydrologic cycle patterns in the yzr basin based on the isotopic characteristics the local stream river water line equation for the tributaries and main stem of the yzr was obtained by linear regression combined analysis of vapor trajectories the deuterium excess d excess values and the altitude effect of isotopes further constrained the moisture sources to help understand the stream water isotope distribution in addition the potential proportions of different stream water sources were quantitatively calculated using the isotopic data of each potential source and the end member mixing analysis method through this approach the hydrologic cycle process and recharge mechanism of the yzr were elucidated which is helpful for further understanding water resources eco hydrological processes and cryospheric feedback under climatic warming in water tower regions globally 2 general setting of the study area the yzr originates from the jema yangzong glacier and flows from west to east through the south of the tp finally flowing into the bay of bengal fig 1 a it is a typical highland river with an average elevation of over 4 600 m you et al 2007 fig 1b as the upstream section of the brahmaputra the yzr is 2 057 km in length with a basin area of 24 2 104 km2 in china and its mean annual river discharge is approximately 1 600 km3 jia et al 2008 xuan et al 2021 the potential hydropower in the yzr basin is around 130 gw xu et al 2002 as the river descends about 5 400 m from west to east with an average gradient of 2 6 fig 1c this attracts much attention because while hydropower development reduces dependence on fossil fuels it also causes ecological and environmental issues in the tp jia et al 2008 the yzr basin can be divided roughly into three sections the upper middle and lower reaches based on differences in geographic features the upper reaches stretch from the headwater region to the lizi and the middle reach from the lizi to milin near the nuxia hydrological station and the lower from milin to pasighat fig 1c the climate in the yzr basin is dominated by the indian monsoon it can be characterized as semi arid in the upper reaches and monsoon semi humid in the middle and lower reaches due to differences in location and topographical features the climate of the yzr basin varies greatly fig 2 shows the spatial variations in annual mean air temperature fig 2a precipitation fig 2b and air humidity fig 2c in the yzr basin based on the daily meteorological data collected by the china meteorological administration over the past few decades the warm and moist airflow over the bay of bengal in the indian ocean flows along the yzr valley and is the most important water source for precipitation in the yzr basin therefore due to the weakening effect of the monsoon precipitation gradually decreases from the lower reaches to the upper reaches of the basin the annual precipitation in pasighat can reach more than 6 000 mm whereas it is lower than 300 mm in the headwater region fig 2b liu et al 2019c the annual average precipitation is 949 mm and the majority of precipitation occurs in the warm season june july august and september affected by the summer monsoon dong et al 2016 sang et al 2016 xuan et al 2021 in addition the annual mean air humidity of the yzr basin varies from 34 in the upper reaches to 82 in the lower region fig 2c showing remarkable spatial variability the world glacial inventory shows that the yzr basin contains 10 816 glaciers liu et al 2012 the glaciers cover approximately 14 493 km2 in area and 1 293 km3 in ice volume accounting for 29 of all glaciers on the tp wang et al 2021 yao et al 2010 fig 1c a large number of glacier meltwater provides water sources for the yzr in the warm season geologically the yzr basin develops from northwest to southeast along the indus zangbo suture zone and is adjacent to the lhasa terrane to the north and the tethyan sedimentary sequences to the south wang et al 2019b as a result there are many active faults in the yzr basin and abundant geothermal resources are derived from these faults hébert et al 2012 liu et al 2020 pan et al 2012 a large number of geothermal springs and geysers have been found in the yzr basin which discharge into the river as a source of some of its water hren et al 2007 wang et al 2017 groundwater plays a critical role in sustaining the yzr flows particularly during the dry winter seasons and stores rainfall in the monsoon seasons that buffers peak river discharges cuthbert et al 2019 yao et al 2021 in mountainous hydrological systems rainfall water usually infiltrates through fractures in the bedrock and transforms into groundwater most groundwater drains into rivers through springs in steep terrains such as river terraces therefore rainwater groundwater and stream water are very closely related here we estimate the contribution of groundwater to stream water with a focus on the effect of hydrothermal water on stream water recharge 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and isotope analysis a total of 156 stream water samples were obtained in july 2018 including 13 from the main stem and 143 from the tributaries of the yzr fig 3 two glacier meltwater samples and two geothermal water samples were collected during the same period the sampling site elevations ranged from 2 000 m to 5 500 m the major tributaries defined by catchment sizes larger than 1 500 km2 of the yzr include the chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu nianchu lhasa nyangqu and parlung zangbo rivers the six major tributaries on the left bank chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu lhasa river nyangqu and parlung zangbo of the yzr were intensively sampled the sampling locations are shown in fig 3 all water samples were collected 10 15 cm below the surface of flowing water water samples were stored in high density polyethylene bottles after complete air removal to avoid evaporation all sample bottles were transferred to a dark and cold container before being transported to the laboratory all stream water samples were measured for stable isotopes δd and δ18o using an l1102 i picarro usa water isotope analyzer in weathering and hydro geochemistry laboratory at the institute of geology and geophysics chinese academy of sciences whl iggcas during the analysis each isotopic standard and sample was tested six times and the mean value of the last four analyses was used as the final result the analytical accuracy was 0 5 for δd and 0 1 for δ 18o the results were expressed as delta values defined as the per mil deviation from vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow as follows δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r represents the isotope ratios 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the sample and standard respectively in addition 25 stable isotopic values including δd and δ 18o of stream water from the lhasa river basin and 11 stable isotopic values of stream water from the nianchu river basin were extracted from published literature to expand the database liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b shi et al 2021b to evaluate the contribution of different sources to stream water we also collected isotopic data for six rainwater samples three glacier samples and three geothermal water samples which are detailed in table s2 3 2 isotopic data of the different end members as mentioned earlier precipitation glacier meltwater and geothermal water could be sources for the yzr based on the preliminary analysis however there is a vast difference in geographical and climatic characteristics because the yzr basin spans many longitudes from west to east across a huge area therefore we used different end members to calculate the contribution proportion of different water sources for each small catchment the precipitation isotopic data in lhaze rikaze linzhi and bomi gao et al 2012 were used to calculate the contribution of precipitation in the chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo xiangqu nyangqu and parlung zangbo catchments respectively the isotopic values of glacier meltwater were obtained from ren et al 2016 and three samples were collected in july 2012 from the jema yangzong glacier which is regarded as the headwater of the yzr basin they were used to calculate the contribution of glacier meltwater in the chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo catchments the lhasa site 29 39 n 91 06 e 3 650 m above sea level set up by iaea iaea wmo 2022 has long term precipitation isotope data from 1986 to 1992 the mean value of precipitation isotopes in july from 1986 to 1992 at the lhasa site was selected as the end members to calculate the contribution proportion of precipitation in the lhasa river catchment geothermal water end members were collected from the yangbajing geothermal field which is an active non volcanic geothermal system with the highest reservoir temperature in china and has been developed for power generation guo et al 2007 the isotopic data of glacier meltwater in nyenchen tanglha glacier was used to calculate its contribution to the lhasa river catchment table s2 shows details of all data sources 3 3 contribution calculation for potential sources to calculate the contribution of different potential sources end member mixing analysis emma was brought into hydrology by hooper et al 1990 to quantify the dominant sources of runoff water barthold et al 2011 conserved components in water such as chloride stable isotopes and their derived parameters can be used as indicators to calculate the proportion of different input end members in the emma model input end members were assumed to be constant in space and time and the isotopic composition of stream water was considered only as the mixing of different water bodies without any change during flow the emma method has been used to analyze the contribution ratios of potential recharge sources in many hydrological studies kuhlemann et al 2021 ramón et al 2021 shi et al 2021a in a river system comprising of two or more end member components the relationship between the proportion of the potential source and the concentration of an end members indicator can be described by the following equation i 1 n f i 1 i 1 n f i c i j c m j where fi denotes the proportion of potential source i and n represents the end members number and c m j denotes the concentration of j incorporated in component i when precipitation and glacial meltwater are selected to calculate the mass balance mixing model the equation can be rewritten as follows 3 1 f precipitation f glacier 4 δ 18 o stream δ 18 o precipitation f precipitation δ 18 o glacier f glacier where f precipitation and f glacier represent the proportions of precipitation and glacial meltwater for stream water respectively the equation can also be rewritten when three end members are chosen to calculate the contribution as follows 5 1 f precipitation f glacier f gw 6 δ 18 o stream δ 18 o precipitation f precipitation δ 18 o glacier f glacier δ 18 o gw f gw 7 d stream d precipitation f precipitation d glacier f glacier d gw f gw where f gw represents the proportion of geothermal water such as hot springs and d represents the deuterium excess values of stream water precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water respectively equations 3 to 7 can be solved directly by the substitution method δ 18o and δd have been used successfully to track water sources for many decades feng et al 2022 jeelani et al 2021 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 ideally water source end members are described by signatures that are independent of each other in this study to construct a three end members mixing model the δ 18o and d values were used as a dual tracer approach because δ 18o and δd are strongly correlated and dependent although the d value is derived from stable o and h isotopes the δ 18o and d values do not significantly covary figure s1 and can thus be used as independent tracers the δ 18o and d value mixing model has been applied successfully in many hydrological studies such as local hydroclimate studies hydrograph separation analysis and water balance investigations boral and sen 2020 boral et al 2019 feng et al 2022 jeelani et al 2021 montagud et al 2021 3 4 interpolation method in this study the ordinary kriging interpolation method was used to construct the spatial distribution of precipitation temperature and humidity fig 2 as well as spatial isoscapes fig 4 in the study area including δ 18o δd and d excess it takes both the distance and degree of variation among known points into consideration and then estimates the unknown points due to ordinary kriging s merits in providing the best linear unbiased predictions and the best sense of minimum variance it helped us to obtain an overview of regional precipitation temperature humidity and isoscapes to get an interpolation map of the whole yzr basin all meteorological data at the 18 stations and all isotopic stream water data were used to generate a spatial distribution of these meteorological features and isotopes then the extent of the yzr basin was added to them to get figs 2 and 3 all the interpolation and mapping processes were carried out using the surfer and arcgis software 3 5 moisture back trajectories to understand the moisture sources we performed numerical simulation research to track water vapor sources across the yzr basin moisture back trajectories were calculated using the hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory hysplit model version 4 0 stein et al 2015 in this model the chaiqu duoxiong zangbo lhasa river and parlung zangbo catchments were chosen for moisture trajectory analysis to track the moisture source of rainwater from july to august 2018 because rainwater may be an important recharge source for stream water for each representative locality the start points of back trajectories were chosen at three levels 100 m 500 m and 1 000 m above ground level the simulation period was 48 h which means that we were able to trace back the movement pathway of the moisture to 48 h before its arrival to form precipitation archived reanalysis data from the global noaa national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar meteorological dataset was used as input data the spatial resolution was 1 latitude longitude this approach combining the hysplit results and isotopic data to uncover the origin and evolution processes of rainwater has been used in many previous hydrological cycle studies bagheri et al 2019 bershaw and lechler 2019 mohammadzadeh et al 2020 4 results 4 1 isotope composition and deuterium excess of stream water the basic information of all stream water samples hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values and d excess values are shown in table s1 table 1 shows the statistical characteristics of the stream water isotopes and d excess of the main stem major tributaries and other minor tributaries the d excess value was defined by dansgaard 1964 as d excess δd 8 δ 18o the δ 18o and δd values of the stream water samples in the yzr basin varied from 20 4 to 10 2 and 146 3 to 66 1 with mean values of 15 2 and 111 6 respectively the isotopic values in water generally tend to be more negative in the west and more positive in the east and there is a clear boundary near 92 e longitudes the average δ 18o and δd values in the western of the yzr basin were approximately 17 4 and 133 3 respectively while those in the eastern part were greater than 13 6 and 96 2 respectively fig 4a b the minimum δ 18o and δd values occurred in the lhasa river basin with average values of 18 6 and 139 5 respectively the maximum values of stable isotopes were 12 4 and 89 3 in the nyangqu catchment respectively the mean d excess value for all stream water samples collected in the yzr basin was 10 table 1 fig 4c which equals the global d excess in precipitation but there were obvious differences between the different catchments the mean d excess values in the main stem 9 43 in lhasa river 9 57 in nyangqu 9 65 and in nianchu river 9 65 were close to 10 while those in chaiqu 4 20 duoxiong zangbo 0 24 and xiangqu 5 62 were much lesser and parlung zangbo had a much highest mean value of 15 48 4 2 linear relationship between δd and δ 18o in stream water the linear regression between δd and δ 18o of all stream water can generate a yzr stream water line swl defined by the equation δd 8 64 δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 94 n 192 fig 5 the swl of the main stem of the yzr was δd 7 00 δ 18o 6 86 r2 0 62 n 13 the slopes and intercepts of the swl were different for each major tributary and are listed in table 2 the swl slope and intercept of all data in the yzr were 8 64 and 19 80 respectively while those for the himalayas were 8 7 and 29 9 respectively however there are remarkable differences between the swl slope and intercept for the seven major sub catchments table 2 the slope and intercept of swl in the upper reaches of the yzr were significantly lower than those in the lower reaches in the upper reaches such as chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo they ranged from 4 58 to 5 01 and from 53 37 to 49 18 respectively in contrast they varied from 6 18 to 8 89 and from 0 24 to 27 84 respectively in the lhasa nyangqu and nianchu river catchments 4 3 hysplit air mass back trajectories based on the results of the hysplit modeling moisture sources were tracked in four small catchments during the sample period as shown in fig 6 these results indicate that the bay of bengal is the principal vapor origin location for the yzr stream water in addition local water vapor recycling is another major source of rainwater in the study area the precipitation in both the lhasa river and parlung zangbo basins mainly originated from the bay of bengal in the sample period fig 6 which is consistent with the results of previous moisture origin studies in the lhasa river basin dai et al 2021 tian et al 2020 in the headwater regions of the yzr including the chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo catchments the water vapor above 500 m mainly came from the southern foothills of the himalayas while the water vapor below 100 m mainly originated from local water vapor recycling fig 6c 4 4 contribution ratios of different end member based on the large isotopic dataset from precipitation glacial melt water geothermal spring water and stream water obtained from existing literature and this study the contribution of different recharge sources was calculated using the emma approach for several small catchments including chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu nianchu river lhasa river nyangqu and parlung zangbo the results are presented in table 3 5 discussion 5 1 recharge effect of rainwater the linear relationship between the δd and δ 18o in local precipitation is referred to as the local meteoric water line lmwl which is a useful tool to track sources and understand the hydrological processes of water by comparing the relative position between the lmwl and a given sample in a plot of δ 18o versus δd gat 1996 jasechko 2019 rozanski et al 1993 the lhasa site 29 7 n 91 13e 3 649 m above sea level is the only gnip site in the yzr basin it was monitored from june 1986 to december 1992 with 42 samples in total based on these data the lmwl can be obtained by a precipitation amount weighted least squares regression as shown in fig 5 the lmwl was δd 7 89 0 15 δ 18o 8 17 2 15 r2 0 99 n 42 iaea wmo 2022 in general the isotopic data of the yzr stream water were scattered along both sides of the lmwl indicating that the relationship between stream water and precipitation is very close and may be of meteoric origin however the slope and intercept of the swl established based on the stream water data of each small catchment were quite different from those of the lwml particularly the intercept precipitation isotopes are significantly affected by geographical and seasonal features and on the other hand there may be large differences in the composition of stream water sources in different catchments kumar et al 2018 present a series of lmwls of the himalayas in different seasons and the intercepts of lmwl in july and august are 22 63 and 17 81 which are very close to the intercept of the swl derived from our stream water data in contrast the intercept of the glacial meltwater line ranged from 37 38 to 9 45 kumar et al 2018 which is close to the intercept of swl in the upper and midstream regions of yzr basin such as the chaiqu duoxiong zangbo xiangqu and lhasa catchments in addition both the slope and the intercept show an increasing trend as we move downstream this may reflect the sub cloud evaporation of rainfall local surface evaporation or different recharge sources in different catchments of stream water ren et al 2018 ren et al 2017 the lower swl slope indicates that the stream water has undergone more evaporation it can be inferred that the evaporation intensity gradually weakened as we moved downstream this suggests that the vapor mainly controlled by the south asian monsoon is very likely to originate in the bay of bengal it flows from downstream to upstream along the yzr valley to form precipitation after increasing levels of evaporation along the way unique δ 18o and δd characteristics of the stream water in the yzr are formed furthermore the δ 18o and δd data point distribution of samples from a single small catchment was relatively concentrated fig 5 indicating that all the stream water in each catchment originates from the same water source or undergoes similar hydrological processes in addition some overlap of the δ 18o and δd data points occurs for two close adjacent catchments this can be attributed to the extremely high similarity in their climatic and geographical features however the upstream water isotopic data were distributed in the left lower corner more negative of the δ 18o versus δd plot while those of the downstream water were distributed in the right upper more positive corner fig 5 this likely indicates that there are certain differences in the sources and processes between tributaries 5 2 moisture sources of the study area and altitude effect considering that rainwater is one of the important recharge sources of stream water we first discuss and analyze the source of water vapor in rainwater in the study area which can lay a foundation for analyzing the isotopic characteristics and controlling factors of stream water the hysplit trajectories show that moisture from the bay of bengal and local recycling is the major source of rainwater in the study area during the sampling period and they mainly determine the isotopic composition of rainwater in addition the d excess values can also be used to indicate the moisture source quite a few studies on precipitation have shown that sub cloud evaporation and increased recycling of moisture from evapotranspiration processes may lead to a decrease in d excess bershaw et al 2012 kong et al 2013 ren et al 2017 the water vapor originating from the bay of bengal flows from east to west along the yzr valley and undergoes increasing evaporation resulting in the gradual decrease of d excess river water is the integration of rainwater in a catchment during a period and its isotopic characteristics can reflect the isotopic variation of rainwater bershaw and lechler 2019 li and garzione 2017 thus it explains the d excess value change in stream water from the parlung zangbo to the duoxiong zangbo catchment fig 3c however d excess increased at the yzr headwaters which might be caused by mixing monsoon and westerly derived precipitation similar results have also been reported by hren et al 2009 and ren et al 2016 where regional changes in moisture sources were considered to be the main cause of the increase in d excess in yzr headwaters in addition the relationship between oxygen isotopes and elevation in the yzr basin may be used to infer the factors that control stream water s isotopic characteristics based on linear regression the δ 18o altitudinal gradient is 0 19 100 m figure s3 which is highly consistent with the results obtained by hoke et al 2014 in the southeastern tp however the altitude effect was inverted when we focused on the isotopic composition of stream water from the middle to the upper reaches of the yzr this may be caused either by different sources of water vapor or by mixing different water bodies such as hot springs geothermal springs and groundwater the yzr is the longest river traversing the southern tp from west to east as such the indian summer monsoon weakens towards the yzr headwater and simultaneously the influence of westerly circulation strengthens in this region in addition a large number of normal extensional faults occur in the yzr basin which could provide permeable flow paths for the deep hot groundwater to move to the near surface and discharge into the river many hot springs and geysers have recently been reported in the geothermal belt within the southern part of the tp li et al 2019 qu et al 2017 tang et al 2016 therefore the spatial differences in the isotopic characteristics of stream water in the different small catchments are likely to be caused by the inflow of different water sources 5 3 spatial variation contribution proportion of different sources the same end members precipitation glacier meltwater and geothermal water were selected in the adjacent chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo catchments these two small catchments are located in the uppermost region of the yzr basin more than 800 km away from the lhasa site with long term precipitation isotopic data thus it is fair to select precipitation isotope data from closer stations to calculate the precipitation contribution in these two catchments gao et al 2012 provide precipitation isotopic data table s2 in lhaze located near the duoxiong zangbo catchment fig 3 the isotopic values of glacial meltwater end members were selected from ren et al 2016 we obtained data about the geothermal water end member from a hot spring located near the chaiqu catchment the relative proportions of the three end members were 24 47 70 39 and 5 15 for precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal groundwater respectively in chaiqu and 27 59 68 16 and 4 26 respectively in duoxiong zangbo fig 7 according to these results glacial meltwater is the dominant recharge source for both chaiqu and duoxiong zangbo with a slightly lower proportion in duoxiong zangbo compared to chaiqu because of the slightly higher precipitation although there are some geothermal springs in this area the amount of geothermal water contributing to recharge was very low the glacier meltwater isotopic values used in contribution calculation are 112 5 and 15 8 for δd and δ 18o respectively ren et al 2016 they are the average of isotopic values taken from three glacier samples in jema yangzong glacier it is consistent with the glacier data provided by kumar et al 2019 thus we believe that these samples are reasonably representative of the glacier meltwater isotopic features in the regions from which they were collected xiangqu river is on the left bank of the yzr and nianchu river is on the right they join the yzr at almost the same location near rikaze fig 3 considering that xiangqu and nianchu are two adjacent catchment basins the same input end element can be used to calculate relative contribution however the glacier survey results revealed relatively fewer glaciers in the xiangqu catchment yao et al 2010 whereas many glaciers are distributed along the ridge of the nianchu river watershed therefore the glacial meltwater end member in the xiangqu catchment was neglected and the contributions of precipitation and geothermal water were 52 9 and 47 1 respectively in the nianchu river catchment the contributions of precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water were 65 9 26 5 and 7 6 respectively the proportion of precipitation contribution was similar in these two catchments ranging from approximately one half to two thirds indicating that precipitation is an important recharge source we used the data provided by liu et al 2019b to calculate the contributions of the three end members in the lhasa river catchment the results showed that the proportions were 34 2 28 8 and 37 0 for precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water respectively the results indicated that the contributions of the three end members were almost equal in the lhasa river catchment because there is abundant precipitation a large number of glaciers and multiple active geothermal fields in the area in the nyangqu catchment the isotopic data of the precipitation end member were collected from linzhi gao et al 2012 table s2 the glacial meltwater end member sample was collected from the uppermost reaches of this catchment and the geothermal water end member samples were collected from within the catchment the proportions of precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water were 10 7 51 0 and 38 3 respectively in the adjacent parlung zangbo catchment field investigations found that hot springs were uncommon and their records are rare in the literature indicating that near surface geothermal activity here is low therefore geothermal water end member can be neglected in this catchment the proportions of precipitation and glacial meltwater were 33 3 and 66 7 respectively this suggests that glacial meltwater is the dominant source for the parlung zangbo river which is consistent with the abundance of glaciers in this catchment fig 1c the complexity of the geological characteristics climate and topographical conditions in the yzr triggers a wide variation in the contributions of different recharge sources to runoff glacial meltwater is the most important recharge source in the upper reaches of the yzr and its proportion can reach 90 because of the area s low rainfall and sparse hot springs in the middle region of the yzr around the lhasa river catchment the proportion of each of the end members was almost equal because of the higher rainfall abundance of glaciers and active geothermal system of the area moreover in the eastern region of the yzr glacial meltwater again became the main contributor to stream water because of the large number of glaciers higher temperatures and inactive geothermal systems due to the wide range of conditions of the three end members over the entire yzr basin it is impossible to choose or establish appropriate precipitation glacial meltwater and geothermal water end members therefore we do not provide a proportional contribution of these end members for the mainstream of the yzr due to the diversity of water sources differences in geographical features and different meteorological conditions the contribution proportion of precipitation glacier meltwater and geothermal water end members showed significant differences across the different locations of the yzr basin table 3 however it is undeniable that the uncertainty in the results of the contribution calculations was largely brought about by end member selection in our calculation we selected the isotopic data of the precipitation samples in july as the precipitation end member to ensure that it was collected in the same period as the stream water samples table s2 but in fact there is a lag in precipitation entering the river and its isotope value is also affected by other factors like evaporation in addition the yarlung zangbo suture is an active tectonic system so it may create many hot springs in the yzr basin hren et al 2007 wang et al 2017 due to the harsh natural conditions and huge areas the hot springs in the yzr basin have not been fully discovered there may be hot springs that contribute significantly to the yzr but have not yet been discovered moreover different geothermal genetic models can also cause significant differences in the isotopic composition of geothermal water tan et al 2021 therefore the selection of geothermal water end members will bring great uncertainty to the calculation results finally there are a large number of glaciers in the study area and the study of the isotopic composition of glacial meltwater is currently at a preliminary stage however we believe that the representativeness of glaciers is more reliable because most glaciers melting occurs in summer and the meltwater enters the river quickly in summary the uncertainty in the calculation process of the emma model caused by the precipitation end member and the geothermal water end member cannot be ignored 5 4 implications for the hydrological cycle the total annual runoff of the yzr is approximately 165 4 billion m3 and more than 60 occurs from july to september jia et al 2008 liu et al 2021a similarly nearly 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the rainy season from july to september sang et al 2016 in the nuxia hydrological station nhs located in the lower reach of the yzr fig 1c the monitoring results show that the runoff in july accounts for 18 49 of the annual runoff in august it is 23 87 and in september it is 17 98 jia et al 2008 it can be seen that this three month flow has accounted for 60 34 of the annual runoff although rainwater causes river flow to change with a lag precipitation has always been considered an essential part of river runoff in the yzr according to the results calculated from emma fig 7 the proportion of precipitation varies from 10 7 to 65 9 over the yzr basin it also indicates that precipitation is a dominant component of the yzr runoff and this is very similar to the numerical simulation results by jiang 2020 and liu et al 2019c therefore it can be inferred that runoff variations of the yzr are mainly due to precipitation changes in magnitude and variability at intra annual and inter annual changes in addition the maximum value of the proportion of glacier meltwater can reach 70 39 in the very upper reach of the yzr basin and it is 66 7 in the parlung zangbo catchment according to our emma results the numerical simulation result shows that the proportion of the glacier snow meltwater ranges from 33 7 to 44 7 with an average value of 38 21 in the nhs jiang 2020 it can be seen that glacier meltwater is also an essential component of the yzr runoff global climate change may bring widespread change to the tp such as the rising air temperature declining wind speed pan evaporation paradox dimming solar radiation wu et al 2021 etc moreover there was a small overall increase in precipitation in the yzr basin in the past century xu et al 2019a xu et al 2019b xuan et al 2021 a corresponding increase in rainfall will also result in a significant increase in river runoff still the runoff would increase if air temperatures continued to rise because it would melt more glaciers however glacier retreat is an irreversible process during global climatic changes combined with all these actions effect it is foreseeable that the yzr flow will continue to increase in the future because of more rainfall and glacier meltwater rising river flow and the water level will cause downstream flooding or geological disasters threatening downstream safety 6 summary and conclusion here we analyzed the stable isotopic characteristics of stream waters across the yzr basin to reveal the river recharge mechanisms and quantitatively estimate the contributions of different recharge sources of the yzr basin a total of 156 stream water samples were collected from the main stem and tributaries in the yzr basin subsequently the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values and d excess values were presented in detail combined with previously published data stable isotopic spatial characteristics were revealed a series of local stream water lines for each small catchment in the yzr basin was constructed using linear regression analysis moisture sources were tracked using hysplit modeling and the effect of altitude on oxygen isotopes was also calculated in addition the contributions of potential water sources were quantitatively estimated based on the stable isotopic data using the emma method the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic values of stream water in the yzr basin varied from 20 4 to 10 2 and 146 3 to 66 1 with mean values of 15 2 and 111 6 respectively the local surface water line of the yzr was δd 8 64 δ 18o 19 80 r2 0 91 n 192 and the slope was very close to that of the lmwl but the intercept was higher than that of the lmwl the stable isotopic data of the yzr were closely distributed along the lmwl indicating that stream water mainly came from precipitation hysplit modeling results and d excess values showed that precipitation in the study area mainly originated from the bay of bengal however it is also affected by the westerlies in the uppermost region of the yzr the potential sources of yzr stream water include glacial meltwater atmospheric precipitation and geothermal springs and their proportions change spatially glacial meltwater was the dominant recharge source in the uppermost reaches of the yzr with a ratio ranging from 68 2 to 70 4 in the middle parts of the yzr basin such as the xiangqu nianchu river and lhasa river basins the contribution ratios of the three supply sources were almost equal in the eastern regions of the yzr basin the proportion of glacial meltwater end member was greater than 50 because of the large number of glaciers in these areas and the relatively high air temperature in particular the contribution of glacial meltwater to river water was found to be crucial in the yzr basin longer and more extensive observations of stream water isotopes in the yzr basin should be conducted to fairly and precisely ascertain the contributions of different potential recharge sources the results of the present study are expected to have major implications for understanding the hydrogeological cycle and managing water resources in the yzr basin credit authorship contribution statement liheng wang conceptualization methodology software formal analysis

2759,soil hydraulic properties including soil water retention control various terrestrial hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration measuring and monitoring these properties at large scales is challenging therefore over the past decade remote sensing has been investigated as a promising tool for large scale mapping of soil hydraulic properties nonetheless a solid physical relationship between soil hydraulic and spectral properties is still lacking to close this knowledge gap this study introduces a novel physical empirical model that to our best knowledge for the first time connects the soil water retention curve swrc to soil spectral reflectance the new model has been developed based on the hypothesis that the capillary and adsorbed water components of the swrc exhibit vastly different optical properties due to their distinct distribution within the soil porous system the model was validated using soil water retention and reflectance measurements of 21 soils vastly differing in physical and hydraulic properties the model provides not only a new and accurate soil moisture reflectance functional relationship but also a potential means for retrieval of the soil water retention curve from spectral reflectance in the shortwave infrared domain keywords soil reflectance hydraulic soil properties soil water retention optical remote sensing data availability matlab codes used for this project and a detailed description of the steps required to execute the codes are available in the supplementary material section 1 introduction soil hydraulic functions are important soil properties governing land surface water infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration across a range of spatial scales hence the land atmosphere water exchange depends strongly on the soil hydraulic functions from local to regional scales mohanty 2013 the soil water retention curve swrc is an important soil hydraulic function that is related to the connectivity and size of the soil pore space which are governed by soil texture structure and constituent materials tuller and or 2004 the swrc can be measured with numerous laboratory techniques such as the richards pressure plate apparatus and tempe cells dane and hopmans 2002 the hanging water column dane and hopmans 2002 the chilled mirror dewpoint gee et al 1992 the long column dane et al 1992 and the suction table romano et al 2002 methods however measuring the swrc at large spatial scales is not currently feasible recent advances in proximal and remote sensing of soils not only provide cost efficient and rapid methods for soil property retrieval at small scales but also promising means to map these properties at larger scales using satellite observations for example high correlations have been observed between soil reflectance spectra in the optical domain 300 2500 nm and soil mineralogy and chemical soil composition omran 2017 coblinski et al 2021 mendes et al 2021 soil organic matter content leue et al 2017 hong et al 2018 tziolas et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 soil particle size distribution bänninger et al 2006 hermansen et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2018 norouzi et al 2021 and soil water content lobell and asner 2002 sadeghi et al 2015 bablet et al 2018 tian et al 2021 dupiau et al 2022 the small scale findings are important as they can potentially build the foundation for satellite remote sensing of the corresponding soil property at larger scales e g sadeghi et al 2017 past studies that focused on proximal and remote sensing of soil hydraulic functions mainly relied on statistical relationships termed spectral transfer functions that link a soil hydraulic parameter to dry soil reflectance spectra within the optical domain arslan et al 2014 babaeian et al 2015a 2015b pittaki chrysodonta et al 2018 blaschek et al 2019 the accuracy of these relationships varies depending on the number and combination of the wavelengths considered for building the spectral transfer functions nonetheless due to the statistical nature of these models their performance for soils beyond the training datasets is questionable machine learning ml techniques provide other powerful means for inferring soil hydraulic properties from soil reflectance data however most of the ml methods do not consider the underlying physics of the problem and require a large set of observations for calibration baumann et al 2022 studies of babaeian et al 2021 using a shortwave infrared swir camera and yu et al 2021 using a ground penetration radar are small scale examples of conventional physics based methods for proximal sensing of soil hydraulic properties they estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture from proximal sensing observations and numerically invert the moisture flow equation i e the richards equation to estimate the hydraulic soil properties this approach has also shown great potential for remote sensing of soil hydraulic functions at larger scales montzka et al 2011 mohanty 2013 but it requires computationally demanding numerical models in the present study a new radiative transfer model based on the two flux model of kubelka and munk 1931 was developed the model directly connects the reflectance spectrum of a wetted soil to its swrc the new model considers the short wave infrared swir region of the electromagnetic spectrum where soil reflectance significantly varies with soil moisture eon and bachmann 2021 the model provides new insights about the role of soil hydraulic properties in coupling soil moisture and spectral reflectance thereby providing a more detailed soil moisture reflectance relationship than currently exists 2 theory the new proposed model is based on the kubelka munk km two flux model that describes radiative transfer in highly diffusing materials kubelka and munk 1931 and can be derived from the radiative transfer equation assuming a semi isotropic distribution of the diffuse radiation propagating in forward and backward directions vargas 1999 sandoval and kim 2014 accordingly the km model relies on two ordinary differential equations to simulate the forward i w m 2 sr 1 and backward j w m 2 sr 1 radiance fluxes 1 di λ z dz k s i λ z s j λ z 2 dj λ z dz k s j λ z s j λ z where z m is the depth of the material soil in this study λ m is the wavelength and k m 1 and s m 1 are the absorption and scattering coefficients respectively which are functions of the medium properties and the wavelength solving the km equations for an optically thick medium yields the following equation for reflectance r of the material ciani et al 2005 thennadil 2008 3 r 1 k s k s 2 2 k s eq 3 can be rearranged as follows 4 r k s 1 r 2 2 r where r is referred to as transformed reflectance sadeghi et al 2015 in media such as soils and mixtures composed of different constituents the optical properties k and s of the mixed medium are generally written as the average of the optical properties of individual constituents duncan 1940 ciani et al 2005 torrent and barrón 2008 sadeghi et al 2015 for example sadeghi et al 2015 assumed the optical coefficients of moist soils as a linear volumetric average of the optical coefficients of dry soil particles and water and derived an analytical relationship that links soil moisture content and reflectance here we develop a more physically consistent averaging scheme for soil optical properties to that end we consider the soil water structure at various moisture levels as shown in fig 1 water is retained in soil in two forms i capillary water filling the space between soil particles and ii adsorbed water consisting of a water film surrounding soil particles tuller et al 1999 in general in partially saturated soils both capillary and adsorptive soil water coexist when a soil dries the capillary water recedes into the pore corners and beyond a certain texture dependent matric potential threshold the retained water mainly exists as adsorbed water films we hypothesize that soil optical properties vary significantly not only with soil water content but also with soil water structure around soil particles accordingly we consider different light absorption and scattering coefficients k and s for the capillary and adsorptive water in soil in addition due to complexity of the soil water system we consider a nonlinear mixing model as a more general case of the linear model of sadeghi et al 2015 as follows 5 k k d k a θ a p a k c θ c p c 6 s s d s a θ a p a s c θ c p c where k d and s d are the absorption and scattering coefficients of the dry soil k a and s a are the absorption and scattering coefficients of the adsorptive water k c and s c are the absorption and scattering coefficients of the capillary water θ a and θ c are the adsorptive and capillary volumetric water contents and p a and p c are two shape factors for the proposed nonlinear model note that the air component and its effects on the soil reflectance were assumed to be negligible measured reflectance spectra of pure water indicate that its reflectance approaches zero in the swir bands huete 2004 accordingly the transformed reflectance of water approaches infinity at these bands k w s w hence we may assume that the scattering coefficient of water is negligible when compared to its absorption coefficient at these bands k w s w assuming that the scattering coefficients for both capillary and adsorbed water are negligible s a s c 0 dividing eq 5 by eq 6 yields 7 k s k d s d k a s d θ a p a k c s d θ c p c eq 7 can be written in terms of the transformed reflectance as follows see eq 4 8 r r d c a θ a p a r a c c θ c p c r c where r is the total transformed reflectance partitioned into three components of r d r a and r c corresponding to the dry soil adsorptive moisture and capillary moisture respectively c a k a s d and c c k c s d eq 8 with four fitting parameters p a p c c a c c directly links the soil reflectance to soil hydraulic properties as explained below it should be emphasized that eq 8 is applied at each wavelength λ within the swir band during drying of the soil sample accordingly the fitting parameters are wavelength dependent but for simplicity of notation we drop the subscript λ in this equation and throughout the paper note that the linear model of sadeghi et al 2015 is a special case of the proposed model eq 8 for p a p c 1 and c a c c numerous models ranging from simple algebraic functions to sophisticated physical relationships have been developed to connect the capillary and adsorptive moisture components to soil matric potential or and tuller 1999 khlosi et al 2006 lebeau and konrad 2010 peters et al 2021 in this study we rely on the lebeau and konrad 2010 model hereinafter lk model due to its simplicity solid physical foundation and flexibility in fitting actual measurements of the swrc this model partitions total volumetric water content θ into its capillary and adsorptive components as follows 9 θ θ c θ a where the capillary component is expressed based on kosugi 1996 10 θ c 1 2 θ s e r f c ln h h m 2 σ and the adsorptive component is expressed based on the campbell and shiozawa 1992 model for very low matric potentials which linearly decreases as capillary water increases 11 θ a θ o 1 ln h ln h d 1 θ c θ s where θ s is the saturated volumetric water content h is the matric potential h m is the matric potential that corresponds to the median capillary pore radius σ is the standard deviation of the log transformed capillary pore radius distribution θ o is a fitting parameter in the campbell and shiozawa 1992 model developed for very low matric potentials in the absence of capillary water h d is the matric potential at oven dryness and generally corresponds to a finite value of 105 m campbell and shiozawa 1992 and erfc denotes the complementary error function it should be noted that while the matric potential represents a negative subatmospheric pressure lower potential means larger negative number out of convenience it is commonly plotted on a positive scale with a minus sign in front of the units the matric potential is synonymous with the capillary and adsorptive surface forces that hold water within the soil porous system against gravity dry soils exhibit very low matric potentials this forward model assumes that the swrc is known over a wide range of soil moisture values consequently the capillary and adsorptive moisture components can be determined as a fraction of the total moisture content via fitting the lk model eqs 9 to 11 to the swrc measurements to optimize the free model parameters h m σ and θ o the determined capillary and adsorptive components are then substituted into eq 8 to establish the moisture reflectance relationship the proposed swrc reflectance relationship is then tested in the forward mode i e from swrc toward reflectance to explore future opportunities for retrieving the swrc directly from soil reflectance data 3 experimental data to evaluate the performance of the proposed model 21 well characterized arizona source soils covering a wide range of textures fig 2 and table 1 and mineral compositions kaolinite mica illite smectite and or vermiculite and chlorite and biotite were used the experimentally determined soil properties used are the swrcs and the reflectance spectra of the drying soils 3 1 soil water retention curve a detailed description of the soil water retention curve measurements is provided in jensen et al 2015 in brief the wet end of the swrc was measured with tempe cells soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa the soil samples were first air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve and then compacted into tempe cells with a volume of 70 cm3 on top of a saturated ceramic plate with 1 bar air entry pressure the target dry bulk packing density was calculated according to cosby et al 1984 applying the relationship θ s 0 126 s a n d 48 9 the tempe cells were connected to a manifold with a high precision digital pressure vacuum gauge and a high resolution pressure vacuum regulator a constant head reservoir was used to slowly saturated the samples from the bottom to minimize potential air entrapment after saturation the samples were drained in sequence at matric heads that conform to super atmospheric pressures of 0 5 1 5 3 0 5 0 10 0 15 0 50 0 and 80 0 kpa after each drainage step once the samples reached equilibrium the water content was determined each soil was measured in triplicate at 25 c additional details are provided in tuller and or 2004 the dry end of the swrc was measured with a wp4 t dewpoint potentiameter and an aqualab vapor sorption analyzer vsa meter group inc pullman wa usa both the vsa and the wp4 t instruments are based on the chilled mirror dew point technique and measure the relative humidity rh of the soil air that is in equilibrium with the soil water phase the well known kelvin equation is applied to convert rh to matric potential the samples were oven dried at 105 c to determine the gravimetric water content to ensure equilibrium subsamples of the soils were brought to different predetermined moisture levels several weeks prior to the measurements and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 3 2 spectral reflectance an asd labspec 2500 spectroradiometer malvern panalytical westborough ma usa was employed to measure the reflectance spectra of the soils for various moisture levels for the optical range from 350 to 2500 nm the spectra were measured with a view angle of 34 i e phase angle of 22 and an illumination angle of 12 to minimize background reflections black cylindrical plastic vessels with a diameter of 40 mm and a height of 1 5 mm were used to contain the soil samples the soil samples were oven dried at 105 c sieved through a 2 mm sieve and then packed into the vessels the target packing densities for the reflectance measurements were the same as used for the swrc measurements to prevent preferential particle orientation at the surface and to minimize shadow effects the samples were cautiously leveled the spectroradiometer s probe was positioned a few millimeters above the containers holding the soil samples the spectroradiometer was calibrated with a white spectralon diffuse reflectance standard labsphere inc north sutton nh usa the soil samples were initially saturated with a 2 ml syringe and the reflectance spectra automatically measured every 3 min during soil drying from saturation to air dry the air dry reflectance is used as the first component on the right hand side of eq 8 the measurement times for the three example soils az2 sand az12 sandy loam and az18 clay were 129 min 198 min and 204 min respectively in addition a 0 01 g resolution digital scale was used to record the wet soil mass in 3 minute intervals to determine the soil moisture the relationship θ b d m w m d m d where bd is the soil bulk density m w is the wet soil mass and m d is the dry soil mass was used to calculate the volumetric soil moisture corresponding to each spectrum thin soil samples were used for this experiment because thicker samples would potentially introduce errors when estimating the soil moisture due to the difference between surface soil moisture corresponding to the reflectance spectra and the average soil moisture measured with the digital scale philpot 2014 note that the sample thickness 1 5 mm has been shown to be substantially larger than the light penetration depth for various dry az soils norouzi et al 2021 4 results and discussion 4 1 partitioning capillary and adsorptive soil water the best fits of the lk model to the measured swrc of the az soils using a global optimization algorithm ugray et al 2007 are depicted in fig 3 with the optimized parameter sets listed in table 1 together with the soil texture information as observed the lk model yields a close match to the measurements of all the az soils over the entire saturation range the capillary and adsorption dominant regions of the swrcs are separated by the water content at which the capillary and adsorptive curves intersect the fitting parameters in table 1 show a strong correlation with soil texture for example σ θ o and h m increase with increasing clay content also increasing clay content shifts the intersection between the capillary and adsorptive curves towards higher water contents and matric heads the vastly different shapes of the swrcs in fig 3 due to a wide range of fitting parameters of the lk model table 1 emphasize the adequacy of the dataset used for validation of the proposed model fig 4 shows the lk derived capillary and adsorptive soil water components as a function of total soil water this partitioning provides a critical input for the proposed reflectance model eq 8 the partitioning varies significantly from soil to soil this large variation tied to our hypothesis that the capillary and adsorptive moisture will have a different signature on the soil reflectance provides a strong testament for the feasibility of retrieving the soil hydraulic property information from spectral reflectance data in particular the capillary and adsorptive water co exist above the transition point while the adsorptive water dominates soil moisture below the transition point from a physical standpoint this is consistent with the faster decline of the capillary water than the adsorptive water as soil dries out fig 1 this concept expressed in eq 8 indicates a distinct change in the r θ relationship at the transition point which will be examined in the following section 4 2 effects of capillary and adsorbed water on reflectance fig 5 depicts the measured transformed reflectance together with the capillary and adsorbed water as a function of total water content for six distinct soils at 2210 nm these observations primarily confirm our hypothesis that different capillary and adsorbed water component partitioning yields different optical properties and therefore can be distinguished based on spectral reflectance measurements there is a distinct change of the r θ relationship where soil water transitions from the capillary to the adsorbed form in particular a slope change occurs near the point where the adsorbed water reaches its maximum the r θ relationships of the coarser soils i e az2 and az12 show a nearly linear behavior but different slopes in the adsorbed and capillary water dominated regions in contrast nonlinear r θ behavior is evident for az18 with 52 clay especially in the adsorbed water dominated region all six soils exhibit nearly linear behavior in the mixed region especially beyond the transition point towards higher total water content the linearity does not necessarily mean that the powers p a and p c are near unity it can also result from the combined convexity and concavity of the capillary and adsorbed water contents especially for the finer textured soils i e az18 and az19 based on the partitioned water content into capillary and adsorbed components fig 4 we investigated the coefficients p a p c c a c c of the proposed reflectance model eq 8 initially without any specific constraints we conducted this analysis for the swir range 1200 2500 nm where the assumptions underlying eq 8 are expected to be sounder we determined the optimum model parameter values for each individual wavelength via least squares fitting of eq 8 to the measured reflectance data as evident from fig 6 the powers of the proposed model p a and p c are nearly independent of the wavelength which indicates that they are more dependent on the soil texture and mineralogy the powers p a and p c are close to unity for soils az2 az4b az12 and az19 exhibiting a nearly linear r θ relationship in the dominantly capillary and adsorbed water content regions in contrast the powers substantially deviate from unity for the az3 and az18 soils which points to the nonlinearity of r a θ a and r c θ c functions i e second and third terms of eq 8 respectively as observed in fig 6 the powers for az12 and az19 start to deviate from the mean at shorter wavelengths showing a higher degree of nonlinearity of the r a θ a and r c θ c relationships at these wavelengths the deviations are likely due to the assumption underlying eq 8 that the scattering coefficient of water s w is negligible compared to the absorption coefficient of water k w to understand the valid region for this assumption we investigated the k w spectrum from kou et al 1993 depicted in fig 7 at shorter wavelengths toward the near infrared and visible regions below 1300 nm k w decreases significantly and hence the assumption of k w s w no longer holds sadeghi et al 2015 therefore we restrict the model application to wavelengths greater than 1300 nm fig 8 presents the spectrum of the remaining model parameters c a and c c based on our initial unbounded least squares model optimization the overall spectrum of the dimensionless c a and c c coefficients shown in fig 8 is similar for all soils although its baseline is shifted vertically due to the difference in the background soil scattering coefficient s d the observed noises are mainly due to the optimization procedure which was conducted independently for each individual wavelength and without any specific constraints a comparison of figs 7 and 8 reveals great similarity between the spectra of these parameters and that of pure water in particular two major peaks near 1930 nm and 1470 nm observed for c a and c c coincide with the peaks of pure water this similarity confirms the solid physical basis of the proposed model and is consistent with our definition of c a and c c as the relative strength of the absorption coefficient of capillary or adsorbed water to the scattering coefficient of the dry soil c a k a s d c c k c s d with c a and c c as scale parameters and p a and p c as shape parameters in the r θ model eq 8 the independence of p a and p c from the wavelength in fig 6 points to the fact that the shape of the r θ curve is generally similar at different wavelengths while its magnitude is determined by the wavelength dependent c a and c c values this behavior is illustrated in fig 9 showing the r θ relationship for selected soils at three different wavelengths the figure highlights the similarity of the r θ curve due to the similar values of the powers p a and p c at different wavelengths in addition variation of c a and c c with wavelength due to the spectral variation of k w explains the different magnitudes of r θ at different wavelengths the discussed similarity is better visualized via the first derivative of the transformed reflectance with respect to soil moisture d r d θ showing the r θ slope at various moisture levels fig 9 further highlights the effects of the water structure on the wet soil reflectance the moisture level where d r d θ peaks marks the transition from the capillary to the adsorbed water dominated regions this coincidence indicates the rich hydraulic property information content of the spectral reflectance data this connection between the swrc and reflectance implies the feasibility of soil hydraulic property retrievals directly from reflectance data the majority of the r θ relationships depicted in fig 9 exhibit a nearly linear behavior in the capillary water dominated region but nonlinear behavior in the adsorbed water dominated region this is likely due to a more complex light transfer process after capillary water recedes into pore corners fig 1 where the water film structure and distribution and particle pore size distributions could play a part after discovering that p a and p c do not depend on wavelength in order to reduce the uncertainties of the model parameters we performed a secondary constrained model optimization forcing the same parameters p a and p c across all wavelengths fig 10 shows the updated set of the model parameters for all investigated az soils most soils show significantly different parameters for the adsorbed and capillary water components which agrees with our main hypothesis that adsorbed and capillary water have different effects on the reflectance spectra interestingly for most soils p a p c and c a c c this may be explained by the increased interaction of light with soil particles coated with thin water films in the adsorbed water region causing a lower reflectance higher transformed reflectance philpot 2010 while p c is close to unity for most soils i e nearly linear r c θ c function p a is substantially larger than 1 in most cases i e a concave upward r a θ a function fig 11 shows the r θ relationship for all investigated soils for 1650 and 2210 nm wavelengths corresponding to the two swir bands of the landsat satellite as shown the proposed model was able to successfully model a wide variety of the r θ relationships observed for different soils including curves with linear behavior in both the capillary and adsorbed water regions az2 az12 az13 linear behavior in the capillary water region and nonlinear behavior in the adsorbed water region az1 az3 az14 az18 as well as nonlinear behavior in both the capillary and adsorbed water regions az6 the capillary to adsorbed water transition point is clearly visible in the r θ relationship this transition occurs at low moisture levels in coarse textured soils with smaller adsorbed water region e g az1 and at high moisture levels in fine textured soils with greater adsorbed water region e g az18 hence the new model offers a way to formally partition capillary and adsorbed water solely based on swir soil reflectance measurements fig 11 also confirms that employing a constant value for the parameters p a and p c for swir wavelengths is feasible keeping these parameters constant for each soil not only reduces the parameter uncertainties but also provides a unique measure of the r θ nonlinearity that can be intimately linked to the soil hydraulic properties fig 12 shows the r θ relationship for all investigated soils for the 1650 and 2210 nm wavelengths when assuming a linear mixing model i e p a p c 1 in this case eq 8 reduces to a multi linear model with two optical coefficients c a and c c that define the relative strength of the absorption coefficient of the capillary or adsorbed water to the scattering coefficient of the dry soil c a k a s d c c k c s d as revealed in fig 12 except for soils with highly nonlinear reflectance behavior in the adsorption dominated region e g az3 az16 and az18 model estimates are still in close agreement with the measured data for other soils this agreement is mainly because the water content components are partitioned in the proposed model so that the major change in reflectance at the transition point can be adequately modeled via a linear combination of the capillary and adsorbed water components with regard to computational efficiency the assumption of a linear mixing model potentially reduces the computation time and uncertainty of the proposed model for inverse estimation of the swrc parameters from swir reflectance measurements 5 summary and conclusions the results of this study confirm our hypothesis that the capillary and adsorbed components of soil water differently impact soil reflectance due to the difference in their structure within the soil pore space the results further reveal that the coupling of soil moisture and reflectance contains valuable information about soil hydraulic properties in particular moisture reflectance coupling clearly marks the transition from the capillary dominated to adsorbed water dominated regions of the swrc this point occurs at low soil moisture levels in coarse textured soils and shifts toward higher soil moisture levels with increasing clay content accordingly a new physical empirical model eq 8 was proposed that directly links the soil spectral reflectance in the swir domain to the swrc it should be noted that this first effort was devoted to developing a forward model for the entire range of soil textures considering the soil water retention curve as input and the soil reflectance as output the model provides a new and accurate soil moisture reflectance functional relationship because the new model aims at connecting soil reflectance to retention parameters it requires the soil retention curve as input and involves more soil specific parameters that need to be determined via calibration which is less preferable for satellite and airborne remote sensing of soil moisture however the new model provides a novel approach to potentially retrieve the soil water retention curve from swir hyperspectral reflectance data in laboratory settings in practice this task can be accomplished by finding the parameters of a soil water retention model e g h m σ and θ o in eqs 10 and 11

2759,soil hydraulic properties including soil water retention control various terrestrial hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration measuring and monitoring these properties at large scales is challenging therefore over the past decade remote sensing has been investigated as a promising tool for large scale mapping of soil hydraulic properties nonetheless a solid physical relationship between soil hydraulic and spectral properties is still lacking to close this knowledge gap this study introduces a novel physical empirical model that to our best knowledge for the first time connects the soil water retention curve swrc to soil spectral reflectance the new model has been developed based on the hypothesis that the capillary and adsorbed water components of the swrc exhibit vastly different optical properties due to their distinct distribution within the soil porous system the model was validated using soil water retention and reflectance measurements of 21 soils vastly differing in physical and hydraulic properties the model provides not only a new and accurate soil moisture reflectance functional relationship but also a potential means for retrieval of the soil water retention curve from spectral reflectance in the shortwave infrared domain keywords soil reflectance hydraulic soil properties soil water retention optical remote sensing data availability matlab codes used for this project and a detailed description of the steps required to execute the codes are available in the supplementary material section 1 introduction soil hydraulic functions are important soil properties governing land surface water infiltration runoff and evapotranspiration across a range of spatial scales hence the land atmosphere water exchange depends strongly on the soil hydraulic functions from local to regional scales mohanty 2013 the soil water retention curve swrc is an important soil hydraulic function that is related to the connectivity and size of the soil pore space which are governed by soil texture structure and constituent materials tuller and or 2004 the swrc can be measured with numerous laboratory techniques such as the richards pressure plate apparatus and tempe cells dane and hopmans 2002 the hanging water column dane and hopmans 2002 the chilled mirror dewpoint gee et al 1992 the long column dane et al 1992 and the suction table romano et al 2002 methods however measuring the swrc at large spatial scales is not currently feasible recent advances in proximal and remote sensing of soils not only provide cost efficient and rapid methods for soil property retrieval at small scales but also promising means to map these properties at larger scales using satellite observations for example high correlations have been observed between soil reflectance spectra in the optical domain 300 2500 nm and soil mineralogy and chemical soil composition omran 2017 coblinski et al 2021 mendes et al 2021 soil organic matter content leue et al 2017 hong et al 2018 tziolas et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 soil particle size distribution bänninger et al 2006 hermansen et al 2017 sadeghi et al 2018 norouzi et al 2021 and soil water content lobell and asner 2002 sadeghi et al 2015 bablet et al 2018 tian et al 2021 dupiau et al 2022 the small scale findings are important as they can potentially build the foundation for satellite remote sensing of the corresponding soil property at larger scales e g sadeghi et al 2017 past studies that focused on proximal and remote sensing of soil hydraulic functions mainly relied on statistical relationships termed spectral transfer functions that link a soil hydraulic parameter to dry soil reflectance spectra within the optical domain arslan et al 2014 babaeian et al 2015a 2015b pittaki chrysodonta et al 2018 blaschek et al 2019 the accuracy of these relationships varies depending on the number and combination of the wavelengths considered for building the spectral transfer functions nonetheless due to the statistical nature of these models their performance for soils beyond the training datasets is questionable machine learning ml techniques provide other powerful means for inferring soil hydraulic properties from soil reflectance data however most of the ml methods do not consider the underlying physics of the problem and require a large set of observations for calibration baumann et al 2022 studies of babaeian et al 2021 using a shortwave infrared swir camera and yu et al 2021 using a ground penetration radar are small scale examples of conventional physics based methods for proximal sensing of soil hydraulic properties they estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture from proximal sensing observations and numerically invert the moisture flow equation i e the richards equation to estimate the hydraulic soil properties this approach has also shown great potential for remote sensing of soil hydraulic functions at larger scales montzka et al 2011 mohanty 2013 but it requires computationally demanding numerical models in the present study a new radiative transfer model based on the two flux model of kubelka and munk 1931 was developed the model directly connects the reflectance spectrum of a wetted soil to its swrc the new model considers the short wave infrared swir region of the electromagnetic spectrum where soil reflectance significantly varies with soil moisture eon and bachmann 2021 the model provides new insights about the role of soil hydraulic properties in coupling soil moisture and spectral reflectance thereby providing a more detailed soil moisture reflectance relationship than currently exists 2 theory the new proposed model is based on the kubelka munk km two flux model that describes radiative transfer in highly diffusing materials kubelka and munk 1931 and can be derived from the radiative transfer equation assuming a semi isotropic distribution of the diffuse radiation propagating in forward and backward directions vargas 1999 sandoval and kim 2014 accordingly the km model relies on two ordinary differential equations to simulate the forward i w m 2 sr 1 and backward j w m 2 sr 1 radiance fluxes 1 di λ z dz k s i λ z s j λ z 2 dj λ z dz k s j λ z s j λ z where z m is the depth of the material soil in this study λ m is the wavelength and k m 1 and s m 1 are the absorption and scattering coefficients respectively which are functions of the medium properties and the wavelength solving the km equations for an optically thick medium yields the following equation for reflectance r of the material ciani et al 2005 thennadil 2008 3 r 1 k s k s 2 2 k s eq 3 can be rearranged as follows 4 r k s 1 r 2 2 r where r is referred to as transformed reflectance sadeghi et al 2015 in media such as soils and mixtures composed of different constituents the optical properties k and s of the mixed medium are generally written as the average of the optical properties of individual constituents duncan 1940 ciani et al 2005 torrent and barrón 2008 sadeghi et al 2015 for example sadeghi et al 2015 assumed the optical coefficients of moist soils as a linear volumetric average of the optical coefficients of dry soil particles and water and derived an analytical relationship that links soil moisture content and reflectance here we develop a more physically consistent averaging scheme for soil optical properties to that end we consider the soil water structure at various moisture levels as shown in fig 1 water is retained in soil in two forms i capillary water filling the space between soil particles and ii adsorbed water consisting of a water film surrounding soil particles tuller et al 1999 in general in partially saturated soils both capillary and adsorptive soil water coexist when a soil dries the capillary water recedes into the pore corners and beyond a certain texture dependent matric potential threshold the retained water mainly exists as adsorbed water films we hypothesize that soil optical properties vary significantly not only with soil water content but also with soil water structure around soil particles accordingly we consider different light absorption and scattering coefficients k and s for the capillary and adsorptive water in soil in addition due to complexity of the soil water system we consider a nonlinear mixing model as a more general case of the linear model of sadeghi et al 2015 as follows 5 k k d k a θ a p a k c θ c p c 6 s s d s a θ a p a s c θ c p c where k d and s d are the absorption and scattering coefficients of the dry soil k a and s a are the absorption and scattering coefficients of the adsorptive water k c and s c are the absorption and scattering coefficients of the capillary water θ a and θ c are the adsorptive and capillary volumetric water contents and p a and p c are two shape factors for the proposed nonlinear model note that the air component and its effects on the soil reflectance were assumed to be negligible measured reflectance spectra of pure water indicate that its reflectance approaches zero in the swir bands huete 2004 accordingly the transformed reflectance of water approaches infinity at these bands k w s w hence we may assume that the scattering coefficient of water is negligible when compared to its absorption coefficient at these bands k w s w assuming that the scattering coefficients for both capillary and adsorbed water are negligible s a s c 0 dividing eq 5 by eq 6 yields 7 k s k d s d k a s d θ a p a k c s d θ c p c eq 7 can be written in terms of the transformed reflectance as follows see eq 4 8 r r d c a θ a p a r a c c θ c p c r c where r is the total transformed reflectance partitioned into three components of r d r a and r c corresponding to the dry soil adsorptive moisture and capillary moisture respectively c a k a s d and c c k c s d eq 8 with four fitting parameters p a p c c a c c directly links the soil reflectance to soil hydraulic properties as explained below it should be emphasized that eq 8 is applied at each wavelength λ within the swir band during drying of the soil sample accordingly the fitting parameters are wavelength dependent but for simplicity of notation we drop the subscript λ in this equation and throughout the paper note that the linear model of sadeghi et al 2015 is a special case of the proposed model eq 8 for p a p c 1 and c a c c numerous models ranging from simple algebraic functions to sophisticated physical relationships have been developed to connect the capillary and adsorptive moisture components to soil matric potential or and tuller 1999 khlosi et al 2006 lebeau and konrad 2010 peters et al 2021 in this study we rely on the lebeau and konrad 2010 model hereinafter lk model due to its simplicity solid physical foundation and flexibility in fitting actual measurements of the swrc this model partitions total volumetric water content θ into its capillary and adsorptive components as follows 9 θ θ c θ a where the capillary component is expressed based on kosugi 1996 10 θ c 1 2 θ s e r f c ln h h m 2 σ and the adsorptive component is expressed based on the campbell and shiozawa 1992 model for very low matric potentials which linearly decreases as capillary water increases 11 θ a θ o 1 ln h ln h d 1 θ c θ s where θ s is the saturated volumetric water content h is the matric potential h m is the matric potential that corresponds to the median capillary pore radius σ is the standard deviation of the log transformed capillary pore radius distribution θ o is a fitting parameter in the campbell and shiozawa 1992 model developed for very low matric potentials in the absence of capillary water h d is the matric potential at oven dryness and generally corresponds to a finite value of 105 m campbell and shiozawa 1992 and erfc denotes the complementary error function it should be noted that while the matric potential represents a negative subatmospheric pressure lower potential means larger negative number out of convenience it is commonly plotted on a positive scale with a minus sign in front of the units the matric potential is synonymous with the capillary and adsorptive surface forces that hold water within the soil porous system against gravity dry soils exhibit very low matric potentials this forward model assumes that the swrc is known over a wide range of soil moisture values consequently the capillary and adsorptive moisture components can be determined as a fraction of the total moisture content via fitting the lk model eqs 9 to 11 to the swrc measurements to optimize the free model parameters h m σ and θ o the determined capillary and adsorptive components are then substituted into eq 8 to establish the moisture reflectance relationship the proposed swrc reflectance relationship is then tested in the forward mode i e from swrc toward reflectance to explore future opportunities for retrieving the swrc directly from soil reflectance data 3 experimental data to evaluate the performance of the proposed model 21 well characterized arizona source soils covering a wide range of textures fig 2 and table 1 and mineral compositions kaolinite mica illite smectite and or vermiculite and chlorite and biotite were used the experimentally determined soil properties used are the swrcs and the reflectance spectra of the drying soils 3 1 soil water retention curve a detailed description of the soil water retention curve measurements is provided in jensen et al 2015 in brief the wet end of the swrc was measured with tempe cells soil moisture equipment corp santa barbara ca usa the soil samples were first air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve and then compacted into tempe cells with a volume of 70 cm3 on top of a saturated ceramic plate with 1 bar air entry pressure the target dry bulk packing density was calculated according to cosby et al 1984 applying the relationship θ s 0 126 s a n d 48 9 the tempe cells were connected to a manifold with a high precision digital pressure vacuum gauge and a high resolution pressure vacuum regulator a constant head reservoir was used to slowly saturated the samples from the bottom to minimize potential air entrapment after saturation the samples were drained in sequence at matric heads that conform to super atmospheric pressures of 0 5 1 5 3 0 5 0 10 0 15 0 50 0 and 80 0 kpa after each drainage step once the samples reached equilibrium the water content was determined each soil was measured in triplicate at 25 c additional details are provided in tuller and or 2004 the dry end of the swrc was measured with a wp4 t dewpoint potentiameter and an aqualab vapor sorption analyzer vsa meter group inc pullman wa usa both the vsa and the wp4 t instruments are based on the chilled mirror dew point technique and measure the relative humidity rh of the soil air that is in equilibrium with the soil water phase the well known kelvin equation is applied to convert rh to matric potential the samples were oven dried at 105 c to determine the gravimetric water content to ensure equilibrium subsamples of the soils were brought to different predetermined moisture levels several weeks prior to the measurements and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 3 2 spectral reflectance an asd labspec 2500 spectroradiometer malvern panalytical westborough ma usa was employed to measure the reflectance spectra of the soils for various moisture levels for the optical range from 350 to 2500 nm the spectra were measured with a view angle of 34 i e phase angle of 22 and an illumination angle of 12 to minimize background reflections black cylindrical plastic vessels with a diameter of 40 mm and a height of 1 5 mm were used to contain the soil samples the soil samples were oven dried at 105 c sieved through a 2 mm sieve and then packed into the vessels the target packing densities for the reflectance measurements were the same as used for the swrc measurements to prevent preferential particle orientation at the surface and to minimize shadow effects the samples were cautiously leveled the spectroradiometer s probe was positioned a few millimeters above the containers holding the soil samples the spectroradiometer was calibrated with a white spectralon diffuse reflectance standard labsphere inc north sutton nh usa the soil samples were initially saturated with a 2 ml syringe and the reflectance spectra automatically measured every 3 min during soil drying from saturation to air dry the air dry reflectance is used as the first component on the right hand side of eq 8 the measurement times for the three example soils az2 sand az12 sandy loam and az18 clay were 129 min 198 min and 204 min respectively in addition a 0 01 g resolution digital scale was used to record the wet soil mass in 3 minute intervals to determine the soil moisture the relationship θ b d m w m d m d where bd is the soil bulk density m w is the wet soil mass and m d is the dry soil mass was used to calculate the volumetric soil moisture corresponding to each spectrum thin soil samples were used for this experiment because thicker samples would potentially introduce errors when estimating the soil moisture due to the difference between surface soil moisture corresponding to the reflectance spectra and the average soil moisture measured with the digital scale philpot 2014 note that the sample thickness 1 5 mm has been shown to be substantially larger than the light penetration depth for various dry az soils norouzi et al 2021 4 results and discussion 4 1 partitioning capillary and adsorptive soil water the best fits of the lk model to the measured swrc of the az soils using a global optimization algorithm ugray et al 2007 are depicted in fig 3 with the optimized parameter sets listed in table 1 together with the soil texture information as observed the lk model yields a close match to the measurements of all the az soils over the entire saturation range the capillary and adsorption dominant regions of the swrcs are separated by the water content at which the capillary and adsorptive curves intersect the fitting parameters in table 1 show a strong correlation with soil texture for example σ θ o and h m increase with increasing clay content also increasing clay content shifts the intersection between the capillary and adsorptive curves towards higher water contents and matric heads the vastly different shapes of the swrcs in fig 3 due to a wide range of fitting parameters of the lk model table 1 emphasize the adequacy of the dataset used for validation of the proposed model fig 4 shows the lk derived capillary and adsorptive soil water components as a function of total soil water this partitioning provides a critical input for the proposed reflectance model eq 8 the partitioning varies significantly from soil to soil this large variation tied to our hypothesis that the capillary and adsorptive moisture will have a different signature on the soil reflectance provides a strong testament for the feasibility of retrieving the soil hydraulic property information from spectral reflectance data in particular the capillary and adsorptive water co exist above the transition point while the adsorptive water dominates soil moisture below the transition point from a physical standpoint this is consistent with the faster decline of the capillary water than the adsorptive water as soil dries out fig 1 this concept expressed in eq 8 indicates a distinct change in the r θ relationship at the transition point which will be examined in the following section 4 2 effects of capillary and adsorbed water on reflectance fig 5 depicts the measured transformed reflectance together with the capillary and adsorbed water as a function of total water content for six distinct soils at 2210 nm these observations primarily confirm our hypothesis that different capillary and adsorbed water component partitioning yields different optical properties and therefore can be distinguished based on spectral reflectance measurements there is a distinct change of the r θ relationship where soil water transitions from the capillary to the adsorbed form in particular a slope change occurs near the point where the adsorbed water reaches its maximum the r θ relationships of the coarser soils i e az2 and az12 show a nearly linear behavior but different slopes in the adsorbed and capillary water dominated regions in contrast nonlinear r θ behavior is evident for az18 with 52 clay especially in the adsorbed water dominated region all six soils exhibit nearly linear behavior in the mixed region especially beyond the transition point towards higher total water content the linearity does not necessarily mean that the powers p a and p c are near unity it can also result from the combined convexity and concavity of the capillary and adsorbed water contents especially for the finer textured soils i e az18 and az19 based on the partitioned water content into capillary and adsorbed components fig 4 we investigated the coefficients p a p c c a c c of the proposed reflectance model eq 8 initially without any specific constraints we conducted this analysis for the swir range 1200 2500 nm where the assumptions underlying eq 8 are expected to be sounder we determined the optimum model parameter values for each individual wavelength via least squares fitting of eq 8 to the measured reflectance data as evident from fig 6 the powers of the proposed model p a and p c are nearly independent of the wavelength which indicates that they are more dependent on the soil texture and mineralogy the powers p a and p c are close to unity for soils az2 az4b az12 and az19 exhibiting a nearly linear r θ relationship in the dominantly capillary and adsorbed water content regions in contrast the powers substantially deviate from unity for the az3 and az18 soils which points to the nonlinearity of r a θ a and r c θ c functions i e second and third terms of eq 8 respectively as observed in fig 6 the powers for az12 and az19 start to deviate from the mean at shorter wavelengths showing a higher degree of nonlinearity of the r a θ a and r c θ c relationships at these wavelengths the deviations are likely due to the assumption underlying eq 8 that the scattering coefficient of water s w is negligible compared to the absorption coefficient of water k w to understand the valid region for this assumption we investigated the k w spectrum from kou et al 1993 depicted in fig 7 at shorter wavelengths toward the near infrared and visible regions below 1300 nm k w decreases significantly and hence the assumption of k w s w no longer holds sadeghi et al 2015 therefore we restrict the model application to wavelengths greater than 1300 nm fig 8 presents the spectrum of the remaining model parameters c a and c c based on our initial unbounded least squares model optimization the overall spectrum of the dimensionless c a and c c coefficients shown in fig 8 is similar for all soils although its baseline is shifted vertically due to the difference in the background soil scattering coefficient s d the observed noises are mainly due to the optimization procedure which was conducted independently for each individual wavelength and without any specific constraints a comparison of figs 7 and 8 reveals great similarity between the spectra of these parameters and that of pure water in particular two major peaks near 1930 nm and 1470 nm observed for c a and c c coincide with the peaks of pure water this similarity confirms the solid physical basis of the proposed model and is consistent with our definition of c a and c c as the relative strength of the absorption coefficient of capillary or adsorbed water to the scattering coefficient of the dry soil c a k a s d c c k c s d with c a and c c as scale parameters and p a and p c as shape parameters in the r θ model eq 8 the independence of p a and p c from the wavelength in fig 6 points to the fact that the shape of the r θ curve is generally similar at different wavelengths while its magnitude is determined by the wavelength dependent c a and c c values this behavior is illustrated in fig 9 showing the r θ relationship for selected soils at three different wavelengths the figure highlights the similarity of the r θ curve due to the similar values of the powers p a and p c at different wavelengths in addition variation of c a and c c with wavelength due to the spectral variation of k w explains the different magnitudes of r θ at different wavelengths the discussed similarity is better visualized via the first derivative of the transformed reflectance with respect to soil moisture d r d θ showing the r θ slope at various moisture levels fig 9 further highlights the effects of the water structure on the wet soil reflectance the moisture level where d r d θ peaks marks the transition from the capillary to the adsorbed water dominated regions this coincidence indicates the rich hydraulic property information content of the spectral reflectance data this connection between the swrc and reflectance implies the feasibility of soil hydraulic property retrievals directly from reflectance data the majority of the r θ relationships depicted in fig 9 exhibit a nearly linear behavior in the capillary water dominated region but nonlinear behavior in the adsorbed water dominated region this is likely due to a more complex light transfer process after capillary water recedes into pore corners fig 1 where the water film structure and distribution and particle pore size distributions could play a part after discovering that p a and p c do not depend on wavelength in order to reduce the uncertainties of the model parameters we performed a secondary constrained model optimization forcing the same parameters p a and p c across all wavelengths fig 10 shows the updated set of the model parameters for all investigated az soils most soils show significantly different parameters for the adsorbed and capillary water components which agrees with our main hypothesis that adsorbed and capillary water have different effects on the reflectance spectra interestingly for most soils p a p c and c a c c this may be explained by the increased interaction of light with soil particles coated with thin water films in the adsorbed water region causing a lower reflectance higher transformed reflectance philpot 2010 while p c is close to unity for most soils i e nearly linear r c θ c function p a is substantially larger than 1 in most cases i e a concave upward r a θ a function fig 11 shows the r θ relationship for all investigated soils for 1650 and 2210 nm wavelengths corresponding to the two swir bands of the landsat satellite as shown the proposed model was able to successfully model a wide variety of the r θ relationships observed for different soils including curves with linear behavior in both the capillary and adsorbed water regions az2 az12 az13 linear behavior in the capillary water region and nonlinear behavior in the adsorbed water region az1 az3 az14 az18 as well as nonlinear behavior in both the capillary and adsorbed water regions az6 the capillary to adsorbed water transition point is clearly visible in the r θ relationship this transition occurs at low moisture levels in coarse textured soils with smaller adsorbed water region e g az1 and at high moisture levels in fine textured soils with greater adsorbed water region e g az18 hence the new model offers a way to formally partition capillary and adsorbed water solely based on swir soil reflectance measurements fig 11 also confirms that employing a constant value for the parameters p a and p c for swir wavelengths is feasible keeping these parameters constant for each soil not only reduces the parameter uncertainties but also provides a unique measure of the r θ nonlinearity that can be intimately linked to the soil hydraulic properties fig 12 shows the r θ relationship for all investigated soils for the 1650 and 2210 nm wavelengths when assuming a linear mixing model i e p a p c 1 in this case eq 8 reduces to a multi linear model with two optical coefficients c a and c c that define the relative strength of the absorption coefficient of the capillary or adsorbed water to the scattering coefficient of the dry soil c a k a s d c c k c s d as revealed in fig 12 except for soils with highly nonlinear reflectance behavior in the adsorption dominated region e g az3 az16 and az18 model estimates are still in close agreement with the measured data for other soils this agreement is mainly because the water content components are partitioned in the proposed model so that the major change in reflectance at the transition point can be adequately modeled via a linear combination of the capillary and adsorbed water components with regard to computational efficiency the assumption of a linear mixing model potentially reduces the computation time and uncertainty of the proposed model for inverse estimation of the swrc parameters from swir reflectance measurements 5 summary and conclusions the results of this study confirm our hypothesis that the capillary and adsorbed components of soil water differently impact soil reflectance due to the difference in their structure within the soil pore space the results further reveal that the coupling of soil moisture and reflectance contains valuable information about soil hydraulic properties in particular moisture reflectance coupling clearly marks the transition from the capillary dominated to adsorbed water dominated regions of the swrc this point occurs at low soil moisture levels in coarse textured soils and shifts toward higher soil moisture levels with increasing clay content accordingly a new physical empirical model eq 8 was proposed that directly links the soil spectral reflectance in the swir domain to the swrc it should be noted that this first effort was devoted to developing a forward model for the entire range of soil textures considering the soil water retention curve as input and the soil reflectance as output the model provides a new and accurate soil moisture reflectance functional relationship because the new model aims at connecting soil reflectance to retention parameters it requires the soil retention curve as input and involves more soil specific parameters that need to be determined via calibration which is less preferable for satellite and airborne remote sensing of soil moisture however the new model provides a novel approach to potentially retrieve the soil water retention curve from swir hyperspectral reflectance data in laboratory settings in practice this task can be accomplished by finding the parameters of a soil water retention model e g h m σ and θ o in eqs 10 and 11
