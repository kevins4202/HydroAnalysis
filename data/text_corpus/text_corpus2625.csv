13125,with the continuous development of the electroplating and electroless plating industries a large amount of waste solution is generated every year mainly including spent plating solution and plating pieces rinse wastewater the discharge standard of waste solution is also continuously improved if the electroplating electroless plating waste solution is not treated timely and effectively it will occupy the land resources of the factory increasing the operating cost and pose a serious threat to the environment and human health additionally the rich valuable metal resources in the waste solution will not be adequately reused therefore there is an urgent need to develop more advanced electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technologies herein the electroplating electroless ni cu plating waste solution spent plating solution and plating pieces rinse wastewater is taken to analyze the causes and component characteristics of the waste solution the principle advantages and disadvantages and optimization progress of the treatment technology for electroplating electroless plating waste solution are summarized from three aspects simple and direct removal of valuable metal elements separation and recovery of valuable metal elements and direct preparation of high value materials from waste solution the technical advantages of multi method combined treatment of waste solution have been analyzed further research direction such as direct high value materialization utilization of waste solution is proposed keywords electroplating electroless plating removal of valuable metal elements separation and recovery direct high value materialization waste solution treatment 1 introduction electroplating electroless plating coating can improve the oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance of the substrate material and further enhance the conductivity and wear resistance of the substrate material 1 therefore electroplating and electroless plating technologies are widely used in machine manufacturing light industry electrical and electronic industries etc and are developing rapidly at a very high growth rate 2 4 which has become an indispensable part of the manufacturing and processing industry for example the annual net growth rate of the electroless ni plating industry averages 10 15 as a result a large amount of waste solution will be generated in the electroplating electroless plating process which mainly includes spent plating solution and plating pieces rinse wastewater 5 8 the components contained in the plating pieces rinse wastewater are similar to those of the spent plating solution and can be regarded as a dilution of the spent plating solution 3 9 so electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment is mainly to deal with the spent plating solution due to the complex composition of electroplating electroless plating waste solution which contains a large amount of valuable metal elements and various organic additives for example complexing agents such as citric acid and lactic acid etc surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate etc 2 5 10 its treatment is a major problem in today s environmental governance in the early stage methods with low economic cost simple equipment and easy operation such as chemical coagulation 11 electrocoagulation 12 13 and membrane filtration etc 14 15 were used to directly remove valuable metal elements and organics in electroplating electroless plating waste solution and the treated water was reused or discharged to standard however these conventional methods have significant shortcomings such as secondary pollution caused by the generation of a large amount of heavy metal containing sludge consuming a large number of chemical reagents and reducing treatment efficiency caused by membrane fouling etc more importantly the non renewable valuable metal resources in the waste solution are not able to be separated and recovered by these methods therefore some electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technologies that can effectively separate and recover valuable metal elements such as electrolysis 16 17 electrodialysis 18 and ion exchange 19 20 have been developed however many problems still remain unsolved for example the high energy consumption caused by low current efficiency low durability and poor selectivity of electrodialysis membranes low ion exchange capacity etc on the other hand it is a great challenge to use a single treatment technology to realize the separation and recovery of valuable metals in waste solution with complex components therefore while dealing with electroplating electroless plating waste solution the multi method joint integration technology of directly high value materialization of valuable metal elements to improve economic benefits is favored by more and more researchers herein typical electroplating electroless plating ni and cu waste solution is taken as examples and the causes and composition characteristics of waste solution focus on spent plating solution are analyzed based on three perspectives simple and direct removal of pollutants from waste solution the separation and recycling of valuable metal elements and the direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements from waste solution the principle advantages and disadvantages and optimization progress of electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technology are reviewed the next research direction is proposed focus on the combined use of multiple treatment methods and the direct high value materialization of waste solution 2 the generation characteristics and hazards of electroplating electroless plating waste solution before plating the metal salts concentration of plating solution usually reaches hundreds of g l for example watt typed ni plating solution is composed of 40 60 g l nicl2 and 240 310 g l niso4 2 plating solution will become waste due to the gradual consumption of metal salts for electroplating many impurity components are accumulated in the plating solution that have been used for a long time and the structure of some additives has been destroyed more importantly the metal ions concentration is reduced if the plating solution is not treated timely and effectively it will affect the quality of plating layer and increase power consumption which cannot continue to be used normally and becomes waste solution 21 for electroless plating the spent solution is produced for many reasons 10 such as the improper preparation or the immature pretreatment process of the plating solution causes the instability of the plating solution improper control of the plating process or the aging of the plating solution leads to the instability of the plating solution formula 1 shows that after a long time of electroless plating metal ions and hypophosphite ions in solution are consumed but byproducts such as phosphate ions sodium ions and sulfate ions are gradually accumulated when byproducts reach a certain concentration the performance of electroless plating solution decreases turbidity and aging and even spontaneous decomposition this will greatly affect the quality of the metal phosphorus alloy coating so the electroless ni plating spent solution is formed 5 with the development of the electroplating and electroless plating industries a large amount of waste solution needs to be treated taking the circuit board industry as an example ni plating including electroless plating and electroplating is one of the many production processes for circuit boards at present the annual output of circuit boards in china alone has exceeded 200 million m2 and every 100 m2 of circuit boards will produce 40 l of ni plating waste solution based on this calculation only in china the circuit board industry generates 80 million l of ni plating waste solution every year the ni mass concentration in waste solution in circuit board industry is about 5 0 g l 1 3 nah 2 po 2 3 h 2 o niso 4 3 nah 2 po 3 h 2 so 4 2 h 2 ni on the other hand the composition of electroplating electroless plating waste solution is more complex containing high concentrations of ni 3 50 77 50 g l table 1 cu 26 00 41 60 g l table 2 and other valuable metal elements such as bi 0 04 g l table 2 as well as cyanide 12 g l table 2 and many other toxic and harmful pollutants such as hypophosphite phosphate and other p containing substances and the total p concentration range is 3 38 110 70 g l table 3 in order to minimize the impact of heavy metal pollution on the environment and human health china has strengthened the control of heavy metal emissions and the ni2 emission standard requires 0 1 mg l 22 however most enterprises only perform simple chemical coagulation to form sludge valuable metal element in the sludge is difficult to recover which is easy to diffuse and leaching to cause secondary pollution the cost of medicament consumption is also high additionally the transportation and storage of waste solution also squeezes the production space of factory in view of the composition and characteristics of waste solution selecting corresponding treatment technology is the theoretical basis for the effective separation recovery and direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements therefore characteristics of the main components of electroplating electroless plating waste solution mentioned in previous studies are summarized and analyzed as tables 1 3 showed the electroplating electroless plating waste solution mainly contains main salt such as ni2 concentration range is 3 50 77 50 g l i e 0 06 1 30 m hypophosphite phosphate and other p containing substances total p concentration range is 3 38 110 70 g l i e 0 11 3 57 m ph buffering agents such as h3bo3 and h3po3 nh4 and organic complexing agents and surfactants containing c n s etc due to the stable complexes formed by the combination of metal ions and complexing agents such as cu edta and ni edta it is difficult to completely remove metal ions by most common chemical coagulation methods if valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution cannot be effectively recycled it will cause serious environmental pollution and endanger human health table 4 it also causes the waste of non renewable valuable metal resources therefore it is necessary to develop treatment technologies that can efficiently separate recover and utilize valuable metal elements in the waste solution recent years great progress has been made on the treatment and utilization of electroplating electroless plating waste solution herein the principles advantages and disadvantages and optimization research are summarized on the view of the removal recovery and direct high value materialization utilizing valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution finally the further research direction of waste solution recovery and treatment is proposed based on multi method combination and direct high value materialization utilizing valuable metal elements 3 removal separation and recycling and direct high value materialization utilization of valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution in view of the serious environmental pollution caused by waste solution the first thing that researchers think about is how to directly remove harmful substances in electroplating electroless plating waste solution to meet emission standards considering the cost chemical coagulation 11 31 is one of the most commonly used methods in industry simultaneously researchers hope to develop renewable efficient and inexpensive adsorbents 32 to remove valuable metal elements from waste solution later several electrochemical methods are developed including direct removal of valuable metal elements such as electrocoagulation 12 13 and microelectrolysis 33 34 and separation and recovery of valuable metal elements such as electrodialysis 18 and electrolysis 16 17 moreover in recent years various of membrane filtration and separation technologies such as microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have been widely used for the removal of valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution 10 valuable metal elements separation and recovery methods such as extraction 35 36 ion exchange 19 20 and deionization 37 38 are also used although researchers focus on the shortcomings of various methods for technical enhancement and improvement however it is difficult for a single treatment method to simultaneously meet the ever increasing requirements for environmental protection and the demand for efficient separation and recovery as well as the high value materialization utilization of valuable metal elements therefore combined methods with two or more technologies to deep remove such as fenton destroying the complex hydroxide coagulation sodium sulfide coagulation method or separate and recover such as electrodialysis electrolysis of valuable metal elements are used recently on the basis of solving environmental pollution problem and realizing valuable metal elements recycling the research of directly preparing high value materials in waste solution to further improve economic benefits has received more and more attention herein the progress of electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technology is summarized from three aspects direct removal table 5 separation and recovery table 6 and direct high value materialization utilization of valuable metal elements table 7 3 1 direct removal of valuable metal elements 3 1 1 chemical coagulation method chemical coagulation method is to add various coagulation agents such as lime sodium sulfide sodium hydroxide and other substances to waste solution that can react with metal ions to form precipitation the precipitation is separated by a sedimentation tank or filtering equipment and the treated water is discharged or reused after reaching the standard the common industrial chemical coagulation treatment process of ni and cu plating waste solution is shown in fig 1 the reaction principles of different chemical coagulation methods to remove ni cu and other metals in waste solution are summarized 11 that is metals can be removed by adding alkaline reagents like cao ca oh 2 mg oh 2 naoh and nh4oh sulfides reagents like na2s nahs h2s and fes carbonates reagents like na2co3 and caco3 phosphates reagents like apatite and hydroxyapatite macromolecular trapping agents and small molecular precipitants like na3s3c3n3 9h2o na k 2cs3 nh2o and c6h14o2ps2k to produce metal oxides hydroxides sulfides carbonates phosphates and other forms of precipitation in practice two or more chemical coagulation methods are used simultaneously bonk et al 31 had used lime and caustic soda to precipitate metals in electroless ni plating waste solution after filtration sodium sulfide was used to further remove metals in the solution consequently ni2 was efficiently removed and waste solution treatment cost was greatly reduced yu et al 39 used lime milk as a chemical precipitator to treat lower concentration 50 mg l electroless ni plating waste solution after electrolysis and ni2 concentration was reduced to less than 1 mg l it has confirmed that chemical coagulation is an effective treatment method for waste solution with different metal ion concentration in addition to remove cu2 and ni2 chemical coagulation method is also suitable for removing cd2 pb2 and other heavy metal ions özverdi et al 40 successfully removed cd2 pb2 cu2 and other heavy metals in solution through pyrite and synthetic fes in previous studies researchers compared different chemical precipitators to find an effective and economical one mirbagheri et al 41 confirmed the applicability of alkaline reagents and naoh to remove cu2 and cr3 after converting cr6 to cr3 the cr3 concentration can be reduced to 0 01 ppm by adding ca oh 2 precipitation after comparing the hydroxide precipitation and the carbonate method the former was selected and further experiments were conducted to confirm that lime had more advantages than naoh in removing cr heavy metal ions from waste solution from the perspective of economy and precipitation speed organic complexing agents such as edta can form complexes with metal ions and greatly increase the solubility of metal ions so it is widely used in electroplating and electroless plating industries however these complexes in waste solution are stable in structure and difficult to be removed effectively by traditional chemical coagulation method the advanced oxidation process aop can oxidize many complexes into inorganic forms so that metal ions become free fenton process is one of the most effective aop processes 42 the hydroxyl radical oh produced by mixed solution of fe2 and h2o2 has strong oxidizing properties formula 2 which can oxidize many organometallic compounds into inorganic forms thereby changing metal ions to free state 43 44 2 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 oh oh a large number of studies have proved that fenton process can improve the removal rate of organometallic compounds in electroplating electroless plating waste solution 45 46 however fenton process has the problem of low oxidation efficiency 47 to solve this problem zhao 42 and nguyen et al 48 combined the fenton process with ozone oxidation process to treat ni plating waste solution effectively removing pollutants such as ni edta and greatly reducing the cost it opens up a new idea for the treating waste solution containing ni edta chemical coagulation method has the advantages of simple treatment process and low cost so it has a wide range of practical applications in industry however the method also has many shortcomings for solutions containing a variety of metal ions chemical coagulation method cannot separate the metals although kurama 49 used naoh and mgo to successfully precipitate metal ions such as ni cu zn and cr from solution however it cannot achieve metal ions selective separation only using other processes can further purify the precipitate moreover a large amount of sludge containing heavy metal elements is produced during chemical coagulation process which is prone to secondary pollution large quantities of coagulation agents are consumed and new impurities are introduced into waste solution additionally colloidal precipitation is easily formed during sulfide precipitation which affects the effect of filtration and separation 50 51 3 1 2 adsorption method adsorption method can effectively remove heavy metal ions by using adsorption material with unique physical chemical structure because of its large specific surface area good adsorption performance and other properties adsorption material shows the advantages of high adsorption rate high elution rate excellent permeability stability and is gradually widely used in waste solution treatment commonly used adsorbents are kaolin activated carbon diatomite chitosan resin sepiolite polysaccharide resin and so on activated carbon adsorbent is used to remove pollutants in electroplating chemical plating waste solution because of its simple process however conventional activated carbon can only remove organic matter odor and valuable metal ions to a certain extent to improve the adsorption capacity the pore density pore size distribution and surface functional groups of activated carbon are modified through chemical method so as to increase the specific surface area and improve the adsorption performance 32 to save costs biomass materials and waste tires were used to prepare activated carbon the modified activated carbon prepared by chemical treatment and carbonization of coconut husk has a high removal efficiency for ni2 in the waste solution and ni2 adsorbed by activated carbon can be recovered by using hcl solution 52 hasar 53 prepared activated carbon by h2so4 activated almond shells which could effectively adsorb ni2 with a removal rate of 97 8 under the optimal conditions abbasi et al 54 prepared activated carbon by pyrolyzing waste tires which shows high adsorption capacity of removing heavy metal ions such as cu2 and ni2 in waste solution at present most activated carbon has been replaced by cheaper adsorbents such as chitosan cts and kaolinite 55 chitosan is the product of deacetylation of chitin various active functional groups in the molecule make it have a strong ability to coordinate with metal ions 56 several modifications techniques such as crosslinking 57 grafting 58 and combining with other adsorbent materials have been developed to enhance the adsorption property and stability in acidic medium 59 but the modified chitosan adsorption method has obvious limitations low regeneration capacity and weak adsorption capacity of some valuable metal ions recent years nanostructured materials have also been widely used as adsorbents in removal of heavy metal ions in waste solution dubey et al 60 gave a detailed explanation on the adsorption mechanism of nanomaterials as fig 2 showed the metallic species adsorption process consists of three well known steps the first is film diffusion that is the adsorbate transports through a surface film to the exterior of the adsorbent the second is pore diffusion that assumes diffusion of the adsorbate within the pores of the adsorbent the last is intra particle diffusion which includes the adsorption of solute at the adsorbent interior surfaces srivastava et al 61 used 15 20 nm al powder to remove ni2 in waste solution and found that when initial ni2 concentration was low and the stirring speed was high the ni2 removal rate was close to 100 many studies have shown that compared to traditional adsorbents nanomaterials have many advantages and are excellent candidates for removing heavy metal pollutants from waste solution 60 however the effluent of electroplating electroless plating waste solution after adsorption treatment usually cannot meet the requirements for the ni2 discharge standard of 0 1 mg l 22 3 1 3 electrocoagulation method chemical coagulation requires adding a large amount of chemical reagent and produces a large amount of heavy metal containing sludge which is easy to cause secondary pollution however electrocoagulation process products a relatively less sludge due to the generation of coagulant cations in situ by electrolysis of metal anodes the al or fe alloy and the stainless steel are usually used as sacrificial anode and cathode respectively 12 as shown in fig 3a the electrocoagulation process involves three successive stages 13 first the electrolytic oxidation of sacrificial anode produces coagulants which mainly includes the dissolution of the al anode and water electrolysis reaction formula 3 5 second the destabilization of contaminants and particulate suspension and breaking of emulsions due to the consumption of h formula 5 the ph near the cathode increases thereby inducing the precipitation of metal ions as corresponding hydroxides and co precipitation with al hydroxides formula 6 8 simultaneously metal cations men and higher oxidized metal compounds like cr6 may be electrochemical reduced to pure metals me0 and lower oxidized metal compounds cr3 at the cathode surface respectively 3 al al 3 3e 4 2h 2 o 4h o 2 4 e 5 2h 2 o 2e h 2 2oh 6 me n ne nme 0 7 cr 2 o 7 2 6e 7h 2 o 2cr 3 14 oh 8 me n noh me oh n finally flocs are formed by the coagulation of the destabilized phases additionally the anode metal ions such as al3 and hydroxide ions oh generated at the electrode surface react in the bulk wastewater to generate various hydroxides and form polymers formulae 9 10 the metal cation hydroxyl compounds formed by hydrolysis polymerization have a large surface area and good adsorption performance so it can adsorb pollutant particles in solution electrocoagulation technology combines four functions of electrochemical oxidation electrochemical reduction coagulation and air flotation it has the advantages of high treatment efficiency short reaction time no need to add chemicals small footprint small amount of sludge and simple follow up treatment 63 64 9 al 3 3oh al oh 3 10 n al oh 3 al n oh 3 n adhoum et al 65 first studied the ability of al as anode to treat various metal ions cu2 zn2 cr6 in electroplating waste solution and found that the removal rate of cu and zn is 5 times faster than that of cr due to the different removal mechanism electrocoagulation method had high efficiency and fast speed only taking 20 min to reduce the metal ion content below the emission standard kilany et al 66 used electrocoagulation in a newly designed electrolytic cell to simultaneously remove cu2 and demulsify from cu plating waste solution under optimum conditions cu2 and oil removal rate were 98 in only 15 mins and 85 in 1 h respectively akbal et al 67 used fe al electrode pair to remove cu cr and ni from plating waste solution through electrocoagulation and found that cu cr and ni could be completely removed in 20 mins under the optimal condition electrocoagulation also has some limitations such as large anode consumption simultaneously an oxide film passivation layer is easily formed on the anode surface especially al anode which prevents al dissolution and ion transmission and reduces the efficiency of waste solution treatment cl can be adsorbed and penetrate into the passivation layer on the anode surface causing the destruction of passivation film however if cl concentration in the waste solution is too low the passivation of the electrode cannot be effectively suppressed while an excessively high cl concentration will not only cause severe corrosion of al electrode but also affect the recycling of water resulting in excessive energy consumption in our lab supergravity field was introduced in electrocoagulation process to enhance the mass transfer process of cl to the passivation layer fig 3b and 3c 62 in the simulated waste solution with low cl concentration it effectively increased the al anode dissolution rate made the outer oxidation layer thinned and improved the removal rate of cu moreover the flocs produced by electrocoagulation do not settle quickly which often results in turbid effluent additionally there are often residual fe ions in the effluent of electrocoagulation which is a by product of electrocoagulation therefore it is still insufficient to use electrocoagulation as the only treatment method 68 3 1 4 microelectrolysis method microelectrolysis method is that two metals or metal and non metal with a potential difference directly contact and are completely immersed in the electrolyte solution thereby forming a lot of fine primary cells no need for external power source to achieve the purification of waste solution 33 generally the microelectrolysis reaction mechanism involves galvanic cell reaction redox flocculation adsorption co precipitation etc 34 69 the electrode reactions are as follows 70 formulae 11 and 12 are the anode oxidation reaction formulae 13 16 are the cathode reduction reaction formula 13 formulae 14 15 and formula 16 are in the oxygen free oxygen acid as well as oxygen neutral and weakly alkaline conditions respectively 11 fe s fe 2 aq 2e 12 fe 2 aq fe 3 aq e 13 2h aq 2e 2 h h 2 g 14 o 2 g 4h aq 4e 2 h 2 o 15 o 2 g 2h aq 2e h 2 o 2 aq 16 o 2 g 2 h 2 o 4e 4oh aq it has proved that microelectrolysis method can effectively remove metal ions in waste solution wu et al 71 verified that fe c microelectrolysis packing could effectively remove u vi from solution chen et al 72 used fe c microelectrolysis to degrade organic waste solution containing cu edta and found that oh radicals generated under acidic aerobic condition during the microelectrolysis process attacked to the organic groups of coordination compounds resulting in complex bonds breaking cu2 was removed via nascent gelatinous ferric hydroxide and ferrous hydroxide and edta was degraded by oh radicals microelectrolysis technology also has many disadvantages such as acidic operating conditions ph 2 3 large amounts of acid needs to be added to adjust ph leading to fast dissolution of fe0 production of large amounts of fe containing sludge and hardening of the filler in recent years the improvement of microelectrolysis method mainly focuses on the following four aspects 1 catalytic microelectrolysis fan et al 73 added a small amount of cu directly to the conventional fe c reactor to raise the electrode reaction efficiency because some refractory organics can be reduced directly on cu surface there is no need for aeration treatment so fe0 and fe2 will not react with oxygen leading to the reduce of fe0 consumption and fe based sludge production moreover the fe cu process covers wider ph range from 2 to 10 5 2 heavy metal modified fe c microelectrolysis filler li et al 74 added mn powder to fe c microelectrolysis filler for sintering modification to form stable and regular fe mn c modified microelectrolysis filler which solved the hardening problem 3 improve reactor structure in order to easily supplement the loss of fe c filler prevent clogging and deactivation and reduce investment costs li et al 75 used fe c particles to remove cu2 from solutions in electrocatalytic internal microelectrolysis fluidized bed 4 combine microelectrolysis with other methods zhang et al 76 use aeration and oxidation reagents such as o3 h2o2 to modify the reductive internal microelectrolysis process to be oxidative and proved that the ozone aerated internal microelectrolysis filter process could be operated at wide ph range without significant treatment efficiencies change excellent treatment performance could be obtained by oxidation reagents integrated with internal microelectrolysis processes wang et al 77 develop interior microelectrolysis fenton recycle ferrite to treat simulated electroplating waste solution containing chelated cu microelectrolysis reaction could directly degrade the chelated cu and produce fe2 for the fenton reaction to degrade it after decomplexation the microelectrolysis fenton effluent directly flows into the recycle ferrite reactor to remove 99 9 cu2 under optimum conditions 3 1 5 membrane separation technology according to the pore size of membrane and the size of retained solute the pressure driven membrane separation process can be divided into the following categories microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro the detailed classification standard is shown in fig 4 78 the membranes pore size is in the following order mf 0 1 1 um uf 20 1000 å nf 0 5 2 nm ro internal voids less than 5 å the order of membrane operating pressure is opposite to that of membrane pore size ro 1 10 mpa nf 0 35 3 mpa uf 0 100 1 mpa mf 0 01 0 2 mpa the membrane operating cost reduces with the decrease of membrane operating pressure 1 reverse osmosis ro separation follows the solution diffusion model 79 that is solute and solvent are dissolved in ro membrane respectively and the chemical potential energy difference on both membrane sides is diffusion driving force which is mainly affected by concentration gradient and applied pressure ro is usually used in the final step of waste solution treatment process to ensure the effluent quality which can effectively remove monovalent ion such as na cl with a retention rate of 95 99 14 15 colla et al 80 first used uf or traditional coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration technology to treat the steel plant waste solution and finally adopted ro most salts such as chloride fluoride calcium sulfate etc can be removed by ro filtration and the conductivity alkalinity and total dissolved solids have dropped sharply qin et al 81 used roll type ro equipment to treat cu plating rinsing water and found that membrane flux increased with the increase of pressure drop and temperature and permeate concentration decreased with the increase of pressure drop ro membrane is mostly polyamide material with poor acid and alkali resistance narrow ph range of applicable treatment solutions and low acid recovery rate so it has limitations for the treatment of most acidic heavy metal ion waste solution 2 nanofiltration most nf membranes are electrically charged on the surface and inside pores which can interact with charged ions in solution moreover each pore channel of nf membrane can only contain 3 4 h2o molecules dh2o 0 276 nm compared with the outside of pore channel h2o molecules arrange more orderly in the limited space and possess lower dielectric constant charged ions are repelled when entering the medium with low dielectric constant from high dielectric constant and the higher the ion valence the stronger the repulsion therefore nf filtration mechanism is more complex and needs further study at present the electrostatic and steric hindrance model is generally accepted which combines the pore size screening mechanism donnan repulsion effect and dielectric effect 82 nf can remove solutes with a molecular weight of 200 2000 da and reduce the salt load of ro by removing 40 70 of monovalent salts it can also be used for water softening mohammad et al 83 used nf membranes to treat ni p electroless plating waste solution and found that 98 ni2 can be rejected by nf and ni2 and monovalent na can be separated well boricha et al 84 prepare nf membranes by casting and spraying strong chelating agent diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid dtpa coating on polyether sulfone uf substrate to treat electroplating waste solution zn2 and fe3 retention rates were 94 and 93 respectively which increased with the increase of pressure and feed flow rate but not affected by feed ph hosseini et al 85 prepared poly acrylonitrile nf membrane to remove ni and cr elements in electroplating waste solution ni and cr elements rejection rate increased with the increase of poly acrylonitrile concentration and it decreased with the increase of polyethylene glycol concentration due to the increase of permeation flux both the effluent of nf and ro desalination meet the national reuse standards but nf is more suitable for large scale industrial applications for the treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution because it can provide higher permeation flux at low operating pressures 3 ultrafiltration uf follows pore size screening principle and can separate macromolecules with diameter of 0 05 0 2 μm or molecular weight of 10 000 100 000 in solution it also can trap viruses bacteria colloids macromolecular organics oil protein and suspended solids etc complexation micelle strengthening ultrafiltration waste solution treatment technology has been developed its separation mechanism is to first selectively construct a large molecular weight complexing agent heavy metal ion polymer or heavy metal ion containing micelles to make the diameter larger than uf membrane pore size uncomplexed metal ions pass through the uf membrane to achieve selective removal of metal ions 86 87 in order to achieve the selective separation of multiple valuable metal ions in waste solution zhang et al 86 using polyacrylate sodium paas as the complexing agent studied the effect of rotating disk membrane rdm on the selective separation and removal of ni2 and cr3 in complexation uf process the difference in shear induced dissociation of paa ni and paa cr complex can be adjusted by ph and rotation speed so as to realize the selective separation and removal of ni2 and cr3 at different ph the existence of ions in the solution is different which affects the membrane ion retention effect qin et al 88 studied the filtration effect of feed ph on electroless plating ni rinsing solution by uf when feed ph was lower than 3 68 fe2 was in free state and was not retained by uf however when feed ph increased fe2 rejection rate increased significantly because fe2 was in colloidal form during membrane separation process concentration polarization causes an increase in operating pressure and a decrease in permeate flux 89 bhattacharjee et al 90 used an intermittent stirring plate to decrease concentration polarization and increase the flux and rejection rate moreover membrane fouling is also a cause of the decrease in permeate flux 91 irena et al 92 used uf as the pre process of ro process to remove colloidal pollutants and dissolved substances larger than 0 4 um and eliminate ro membrane pollution 4 microfiltration the porosity of mf membrane is as high as 70 80 and the thickness is 90 150 um separation mechanism is based on the pore size sieve effect to remove cu2 in waste solution using a low pressure membrane wang et al 93 embedded stainless steel mesh into active polyvinylidene fluoride membrane to prepare conducting mf membrane as fig 5 showed through electrophoresis and electrochemical oxidation reduction on the energized film cu2 is converted into cu oh 2 and cu deposition and removed membrane fouling caused by organic matter microorganisms smaller particles of colloidal materials and salt will cause precipitation and reduce membrane flux 94 therefore using of mf membrane to pre treat waste solution can prevent ro membrane pollution bahar et al 95 filtered and pretreated waste solution with ceramic mf membrane after chemical coagulation to reduce the biological pollution and fouling of ro membrane thereby preventing membrane fouling 3 1 6 combined method with the improvement of industrial material performance requirements and the development of electroplating electroless plating technology the component of plating solution becomes more and more complicated leading to the waste solution containing a variety of pollutants there are some shortcomings in a single waste solution treatment method if different methods are used in combination it can often achieve complementary advantages to meet the waste solution treatment requirements therefore researchers are increasingly considering combining various processes to deeply remove valuable metal elements from waste solution in plating ni waste solution ni element is usually in complex state and high concentration which is difficult to form hydroxide or sulfide precipitation single chemical coagulation is difficult to remove complexed heavy metal ions therefore fenton reaction is usually used in combination with other methods to firstly break the complex structure and then remove metal ions for example to break citrate ni chelate by fenton reaction and remove ni combination process of fenton reagent electrolytic reduction chemical coagulation was used to treat electroless ni plating waste solution 46 after cathodic deposition and alkaline solution precipitation 99 9 ni is separated zhou et al 44 used fe c microelectrolysis activated h2o2 oxidation fenton reaction process to simultaneously recover p and purify ni in plating ni waste solution lan et al 96 used microelectrolysis fenton reaction coagulation process to treat the edta cu2 containing waste solution produced by electroless cu plating under optimal condition cu2 and cod removal rate could reach 100 and 87 respectively it can be seen that the combined use of different methods can achieve complementary advantages and effectively remove pollutants in waste solution which is currently a research hotspot in waste solution treatment 3 2 recovery of valuable metal elements in waste solution above methods are only harmless treatment of waste solution however sludge formed by chemical coagulation non renewable adsorbents and electrocoagulation has become a new dangerous solid waste due to the presence of unrecovered heavy metals after long term stacking heavy metals will be re released into the environment and cause secondary pollution moreover non renewable valuable metal elements have not been separated and recycled resulting in a waste of resources therefore it is great significance to recycle valuable metal elements while treating waste solution some technology for separation and recovery of valuable metal elements were developed the key findings of which are summarized in table 6 3 2 1 electrolysis method electrolysis method is usually used to treat waste solution with high metal ion concentration which can not only selectively recover high purity metals 86 but also oxidize organics and reducing inorganics so as to achieve the purpose of degrading cod 17 researchers have done a lot of research on treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution by electrolysis 97 idhayachander 98 7and dutra et al 6 applied electrolysis method to treat plating ni and cu waste solution which effectively recovered metal ions and removed some pollutants electrolysis method has some disadvantages like high concentration polarization low current efficiency and high energy consumption so researchers improved electrolysis method by electrode modification rotating flow electrolysis pulse electrolysis and ion membrane electrolysis to improve system conductivity to reduce energy consumption reduce electrode boundary layer thickness to eliminate concentration polarization and concentrate metal ion concentration to improve current efficiency etc some researchers modify the electrodes for example gonzález et al 99 used hydrotalcite as electrolysis electrodes to recover cd2 and pb2 and remove pollutants which exhibited good treatment effect liu et al 100 prepared stainless steel mesh electrode coated with single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts ssn swcnts ssn electrode without polymerizer possesses high conductivity it can efficiently remove metal ions and can be regenerated with nitric acid after repeated use in order to solve concentration polarization barr 101 proposed rotating flow electrolysis technology fig 6 this technology allows the electrolyte to keep flowing during the electrodeposition process reduces electrode boundary layer thickness thereby reduces concentration polarization so the target metal can be preferentially precipitated at a lower concentration through this technology high purity metals are successfully recovered from various waste solution and metal recovery rate can usually reach more than 90 102 in our previous study 103 a centrifuge electrode is applied for the simple and green recovery of high purity cu powders by electrodeposition from the leaching solution of electroplating sludge containing low concentration multi metal fig 7a because the centrifuge electrode enhances the mass transfer serious concentration polarization of cu electrodeposition in low concentration leaching solution is eliminated and the limiting current density is increased fig 7b cu2 is preferentially reduced by electrolysis and the electrodeposition of metal impurities is effectively inhibited due to the large potential difference between cu cu2 and other metal ions under small concentration polarization fig 7c as a result the purity recovery ratio and current efficiency of cu products are obviously increased cu powders with a purity of 99 9 are selectively separated from the multi metal leaching solution of electroplating sludge additionally cu products structure from powders to foils could be obtained by adjusting the cu concentration and rotating speed fig 7d pulse electrolysis method can also effectively alleviate concentration polarization pulse current makes the system react in the alternate mode of power supply power off power supply which will affect mass transfer adsorption and desorption and electric double layer effect of electrode surface it has confirmed that compared to direct current pulsed current can more efficiently recover high purity metals from waste solution and with lower consumption 104 although electrolysis treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution to recover valuable metal elements has the advantages of high efficiency stable operation simple operation and environmental friendliness its cost is relatively high moreover the conversion rate of phosphate is restricted by the electrode effective active surface area and the electrolysis voltage njau et al 105 found that although higher electrolysis voltage can improve phosphate conversion rate it will lead to serious hydrogen evolution which decreases current efficiency and increases energy consumption especially in treatment of low concentration solutions single electrolysis method is poor in complex treatment so electrolysis method is very suitable for the treatment of high concentration electroplating electroless plating waste solution in the initial stage 106 3 2 2 electrodialysis method the principle of electrodialysis ed is shown in fig 8 the cation exchange membrane c and anion exchange membrane a are alternately installed between the anode and cathode forming cells between a and c the raw electroplating electroless plating waste solution flows into each cell simultaneously and ion concentration is the same everywhere direct current is applied between the two electrode plates to form a direct current electric field under the electric field force the cation in each cell moves towards the cathode and is blocked by a through c while the anion moves towards the anode and is blocked by c through a finally alternating low salinity solution and high salinity solution are formed to achieve the purpose of concentration and desalination 18 the waste solutions containing different metal ions such as cu2 ni2 zn2 and cr6 etc are all suitable for ed treatment low salinity solution and high salinity solution are generated by ed treatment although the low salinity solution may not meet the discharge standards it can usually be used as rinsing water for plating pieces while for the high salinity solution it can be fed to the bath to recover volumes lost by evaporation and drag out during ni electroplating process without damaging the quality of plating pieces 25 107 generally ed technology can effectively recover water and separate heavy metal ions from electroplating electroless plating waste solution the main advantage of ed is that the concentration ratio of the high salinity solution and the low salinity solution can reach about 100 times which is higher than that of ro membrane the concentrated solution i e high salinity solution can be reused in plating bath which has a good environmental benefit unfortunately the equipment investment and maintenance costs of ed are relatively high and the ion exchange membranes are needed the ion exchange membranes are prone to membrane fouling scaling and concentration polarization etc so membrane flux gradually decreases with time and frequent maintenance is required additionally this method has poor selective separation and recovery capabilities for metal ions with similar valence states 108 109 aiming at technical defects caused by ion exchange membranes konstantinos 110 designed electrostatic shielding zone ion current collectors eszs icss to replace ion exchange membranes for electrodialysis eszs icss are formed by electron and ion conductive media for example a packed bed of graphite powder is placed between the anode and the cathode which will cause the electric field inside the electrolysis device to be discontinuous thereby forming an ion dilution and ion concentration chamber because the new method does not require selective ion exchange membranes the above shortcomings do not exist experiments have proved that this method has the same treatment effect as electrodialysis ed cannot selectively recover metals according to earlier reports 111 112 dydo et al 113 improve the selectivity of ed by introducing additives such as ligands and complexing agents it has also been found that zn2 can be effectively separated from iron in a simulating electroplating zn waste solution by adding citric acid and using a heterogeneous cm h am h ralex membrane the zn recovery rate exceeded 86 6 3 2 3 solvent extraction method solvent extraction is also called liquid liquid extraction which is commonly used for separating and purifying substances solvent extraction uses a water insoluble extractant to contact the waste solution the organic matter heavy metals rare metals etc are combined with the extractant to realize phase transfer and purify the waste solution because of the liquid liquid contact it can be operated continuously and the separation effect is perfect 35 heavy metals such as cr ni and cu can be efficiently recovered under the action of solvent extraction 36 for cr containing electroplating waste solution solvent extraction method can successfully separate cr6 and obtain sodium dichromate after concentration and crystallization for electroplating zn cr iii alloy waste solution there are two heavy metal ions of zn and cr mixed in the solution and the extraction of cr requires a higher ph so sze et al 114 designed the process flow of diethylhexyl phosphoric acid dehpa extraction of zinc and ammoniated dehpa extraction of cr iii sahu et al 115 used tributyl phosphate tbp to extract and recover cr and zn from electroplating waste solution after that cr and zn can be removed from the tbp extractant by different stripping solution for cu containing waste solution copper sulfate is usually the extraction product which can be returned to the electroplating and electroless plating bath 116 previously single phase extractant was used to extract metals the disadvantage of a single carrier is that the loading capacity of the organic relative to the metal ions is low 117 acidic extractant and neutral extractant are used in combination to improve the extraction efficiency due to their synergistic effect the extraction effect is significantly enhanced 24 for example eyupoglu et al 118 used lix 63 and 2bda to synergistically extract electroplating cr ni waste solution and ni extraction rate reached 98 5 sulaiman et al 35 used green binary mixtures of d2ehpa octanol system as extractant which was capable of extracting ni from electroless ni plating waste solution up to 90 under optimal conditions 1 0 m hno3 was employed as stripping agent for the back extraction of ni from the ni loaded organic phase which proved that the green organic phase can be recycled back for ni extraction as well as minimizing the use of an expensive carrier in solvent extraction process 3 2 4 ion exchange method ion exchange method is often used in treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solutions 19 this method is to exchange ions in solid ion exchanger with ions in dilute solution using environmentally friendly ions to replace the ions harmful to the environment 20 ion exchange process is similar to adsorption process but specific metal ions can be separated due to the different chemical properties of the ion exchange matrix ion exchange matrices include cation exchange resin and anion exchange resin resins are also divided into synthetic resins and natural resins synthetic resins are more popular because they can separate metals without restriction 119 cation exchange resins are divided into hydrogen type and sodium type the working principle is shown as following eqs 17 19 hydrogen type 17 h n r y n yr nh sodium type 18 na n r y n yr nna the working principle of anion exchange resin can be expressed by the following formula 19 r oh n m n rm noh where r is the active group of the resin yn and mn are the cation and anion to be exchanged in solution respectively 120 the most preferred ion exchanger is cation exchanger composed of strong acid resin containing a sulfonic acid group and a weakly basic resin containing a hydroxy acid group 121 it is proved that the ion exchanger has a good adsorption effect on heavy metal ions such as ni2 and cu2 122 however the adsorption mechanism of composite resins on heavy metal ion complexes is unclear li et al 123 studied the resin adsorption mechanism they desorbed the resin after adsorption and recovered high purity nano metal from the desorption solution through chemical reduction proving that the process is feasible in the recovery of high purity metals ion exchange method has the advantages of low energy consumption less use of chemical reagents no sludge generation and good treatment effect however the operating cost is high and the equipment needs to be maintained frequently moreover the resin is easily contaminated especially in waste solution with high metal ions therefore ion exchange method is often used in conjunction with electrodialysis method which is suitable for the treatment of high concentration waste solution 124 3 2 5 electrodeionization method electrodeionization edi method is under the combination of electrodialysis and ion exchange technology 37 the principle of edi is that the ions in the low salinity solution produced by electrodialysis are exchanged and transported by active material under an electric field and then the pure water and metal ions are deeply separated and recovered 38 that is a mixed ion exchange resin of anion and cation installed in the low salinity solution chamber of the electrodialysis device compared with ion exchange method the edi method can regenerate ion exchange resin through electrical energy with this technology high purity water can be deeply separated simultaneously and metal salts can be concentrated and recovered many research groups have investigated the feasibility of edi technology lu 125 developed a novel integrated two stage edi process to recover ni2 and pure water from simulated electroplating ni waste solution which can remove 99 of ni2 from the solution about 94 of ni2 is removed in the first stage and about 96 7 of the remaining ni2 is removed in the second stage the concentrated solution with ni2 concentration as high as 11 031 mg l is obtained through closed circulation and pure water with resistivity exceeding 1 6 mω cm is produced compared with chemical precipitation method this process can bring considerable economic benefits because ion exchange membranes are needed in edi process like electrodialysis it is also troubled by membrane fouling scaling and concentration polarization 3 2 6 combination method for the separation and recovery of valuable metal elements like the treatment method of directly removing valuable metal elements in waste solution each single treatment method for recovering valuable metal elements in waste solution also has its own limitations and a good recovery effect cannot usually be obtained when used alone according to the advantages and disadvantages of various methods combining different methods can often achieve complementary advantages the combination of membrane filtration processes and electrolysis processes is also an effective method for separating and recovering heavy metal ions zuo et al 126 proposed a process that combines multiple membrane filtration and electrodialysis to treat plating waste solution first uf and mf are used for pretreatment then electrodialysis is used for effective desalination finally nf and ro are used the concentrated solution after electrodialysis is deeply processed for electrolysis method it is suitable to process waste solution containing high concentration valuable metal elements due to the high current efficiency however for waste solution with low concentration valuable metal elements the electrolysis current efficiency is low and the energy consumption is high while electrodialysis and electrodeionization methods show obvious advantages in treatment of waste solution with low concentration valuable metal elements high concentration ratio good concentration effect low energy consumption more thorough separation of valuable metal elements and stable fresh water effluent however it is easy to occur membrane fouling scaling and concentration polarization etc for electrodialysis and electrodeionization methods to process waste solution with high concentration valuable metal 127 therefore the electrolysis method can recover the concentrated solution produced by electrodialysis and electrodeionization which can save energy consumption and improve the purity and recovery rate of valuable metals 18 wang et al 22 investigated the influence of operating conditions on the treatment of electroplating wastewater by electrodialysis combined with the electrodeposition ni2 concentration in the anolyte and the catholyte could be reduced from 1 0 initial concentration to 0 015 and 0 085 mg l respectively far below 0 1 mg l the introduction of electrodeposition enhanced ni2 migration in the electrolytes leading to the decrease the energy consumption similarly like electrodialysis the ion exchange method is also suitable for low concentration heavy metal solutions the effluent quality is good and the regenerated solution needs further treatment so it can also be combined with electrolysis to recover valuable metals 128 the combined use of electrolysis electrodialysis electrodeionization processes can meet the high efficiency and deep separation and recovery of metals and solve the problem of poor effluent quality to achieve water reuse requirements and increase the content of treatment range of ni spent solution 108 electro oxidation method is usually used to remove a large amount of ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 complexes in ni electroplating waste solution but it cannot directly recover ni guan 129 realized decomposition of ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 complexes and the reduction and recovery of ni2 by the combined process of electro oxidation and electrolysis and analyzed the influence of parameters such as the current density ph value and reaction temperature on the performance of electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions ni recovery rate and the ammonia removal efficiency can reach 99 and 70 respectively under the optimal conditions cathode surface deposits are zero valent ni the electrochemical reaction process is that ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 complexes are destroyed in the electro oxidation process to generate ni2 and free nh3 then ni2 is reduced on cathode and nh3 is released 130 in order to decompose the stable complex formed by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and toxic metals such as ni etc zhao et al 131 established a photocatalysis electrochemical combined process using tio2 ti plate as anode and stainless steel as cathode and realized the decomposition of ni edta and the recovery of ni at the same time compared with single photocatalytic or electro oxidation treatment technology the removal rate of ni edta is greatly increased to 90 the results show that the depolymerization of ni edta is mainly through the cleavage of amine group on ni edta however the depolymerization of the acetate group is weak moreover the decomposition of ni edta at anode and the reduction and recovery of ni2 at cathode are synergistically consistent so ni recovery rate is also greatly improved compared with electrolysis and photocatalysis which can reach 45 3 3 materialization utilization of waste solution the development process of electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment has changed from the initial single removal of all pollutants to a targeted separation and treatment of pollutants and the recovery and utilization of valuable metal elements considering the economic benefit valuable metal elements in waste solution using as high value materials is increasingly emphasized as mentioned above chemical coagulation as the most widely used industrial treatment method will produce a large amount of sludge in view of the characteristics of sludge containing a large amount of calcium hydroxide the brick fired porcelain method has been widely used in research 132 however this method cannot completely solve the pollution problem of heavy metals because of secondary pollution problems such as volatilization and leaching of heavy metals 133 therefore the most widely industrial utilization method cannot effectively solve the pollution problem and difficult to realize the valuable metal elements in waste solution some technology for direct high value material utilization of valuable metal elements were developed in waste solution the key findings of which are summarized in table 7 3 3 1 direct preparation of high value layered double hydroxides ldhs materials from waste solution ldhs is the general name of hydrotalcite ht and hydrotalcite like compounds htlcs ldhs shows good application prospects in the fields of energy conversion and electrochemical energy storage such as secondary batteries and electrocatalysis using waste solution as raw material to directly prepare ldhs by real time synthesis method has attracted more and more attention the method for preparing ldhs is a simple process and it has significant economic benefits especially to obtain high value materials while processing waste solution the direct preparation of ldhs from waste solution has a certain general applicability and it can be prepared from waste solution containing ni cu cr zn and fe 134 135 htlcs material has strong adsorption capacity for anions and heavy metal pollutants the htlcs material prepared in situ from waste solution has been successfully applied to adsorb and remove contaminants such as i cu2 and zn2 for example cu based htlcs materials prepared from electroplating waste solution by using coprecipitation have good thermal and structural stability and achieve a saturated adsorption of iodide ions of 41 23mg g under the optimal conditions 136 wang et al 137 demonstrated that co precipitating as with zn and fe in wastewater to in situ form ldhs exhibited excellent potential for removal and direct stabilization of as iii miyata et al 138 discovered that htlcs can be used as new catalytic materials taylor et al 139 confirmed that ldhs after thermal decomposition can be used as a highly active catalyst and catalyst carrier so waste solution can be used as the raw material of catalyst to achieve higher value zhu et al 7 prepared graphene oxide nial layered double hydroxide composite go nial ldhs from electroless ni plating waste solution go nial ldhs has broad application prospects in methanol oxidation catalysts and supercapacitor electrode materials 3 3 2 direct high value materialization of metal element in waste solution as coating material electroplating electroless plating waste solution was used as raw material to directly prepare high value electrode materials by attaching metals to a substance through different methods huang et al 140 added naoh to the electroplating electroless plating waste solution to produce metal oxides which were directly deposited on m fe3o4 sio2 nanoparticles to prepare four pure magnetite catalysts m fe3o4 sio2 zno m fe3o4 sio2 cuo m fe3o4 sio2 fe2o3 and m fe3o4 sio2 nio fig 9a through the comparison of degradation experiments of methyl orange it was found that m fe3o4 sio2 zno processed the best catalytic performance and the methyl orange removal rate was 91 5 the heavy metals recovery rate reached more than 98 zhao et al 141 used electroplating waste solution as raw material and successfully prepared cu c core shell coaxial nanowires nws by a simple continuous flow wet chemical method fig 9b cu c nws modified electrode has a special role in conventional human serum samples glucose analysis or carbohydrate capillary electrophoresis chip detection which exhibit a high and reproducible sensitivity of 437 8 ma cm 2 mm 1 to glucose at 0 65 v jin et al 142 prepared carbon fiber mft cfs material coated with melamine resin modified by tetraheryl ethylene diamide as a new ni recovery method in electroless ni plating waste solution it was found that functional cf could selectively separate ni2 from the solution and nano ni coating carbon fiber ni mft cfs material was formed at the same time ni mft cfs material processed excellent electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation performance moreover jin et al 8 grafted melamine formaldehyde tetraoxalyl ethylenediamine chelating resin onto activated carbon mft ac and adsorbed pdcl2 sol on the mft ac and then immersed them into the electroless ni plating waste solution finally adding l ascorbic acid to synthesize nano ni through ultrasound to obtain a nano ni activated c composite material ni ac which displayed excellent catalysis for the ultrasonic degradation of 2 6 dcp with a degradation efficiency of 93 under the optimum conditions 3 3 3 other direct high value materialization of electroplating electroless plating waste solution technology in addition to the above two systematic technologies for direct preparation of high value materials from electroplating electroless plating waste solution there are some other technologies tsai et al 29 used chemical coagulation to directly prepare ni oh 2 with a size of approximately 0 5 μm from electroless ni plating waste solution by adjusting process parameters such as ph temperature reaction duration and agitation the prepared ni oh 2 included amorphous ni oh 2 and α ni oh 2 which is a good energy conversion material in ni based secondary batteries ni removal efficiency is more than 98 fu et al 143 used electroplating and steel pickling waste solution as raw materials and successfully prepared ni cu zn ferrite powder with cubic structure by hydrothermal method the ni cu zn ferrite is suitable for multilayer chip inductors because its μi is 168 from 1 khz to 10 mhz liu et al 144 used the untreated electroless ni plating waste solution as the source of phosphorus carbon and other doping ions li2co3 and fe2o3 were directly added to waste solution and dissolved mixed under mechanical stirring then the mixture was dried to obtain a precursor multi doped lifepo4 c was prepared by sintering the precursor at 650 c for 7 h in n2 atmosphere electrochemical tests showed that the multi doped lifepo4 c as lithium ion cathode material processed high capacity and excellent capacity retention on this basis liu 145 used fe powder as the fe source and electroless ni plating waste solution as the raw material of phosphorus carbon ni and other dopants and successfully synthesized multi doped lifepo4 c the material prepared by this method has comparable electrochemical performance with similar materials prepared from electroless ni plating waste solution and fe2o3 or ferrous oxalate in previous studies but it has more cheap and environmental protection in summary the treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution has entered a new node and people are paying more and more attention to the direct high value materialization of valuable metal resources however the development of related technologies to better protect the environment and save resources is still full of challenges a lot of research should focus on the remaining elements in the waste solution after the direct high value materialization utilization process which should be advanced treated in combination with the treatment methods of sections 3 1 and 3 2 4 future perspectives with the improvement of plating layer quality requirements the composition of electroplating electroless plating solution becomes more and more complicated as a result the types of pollutants in waste plating solution increase and treating waste solution with only one technology is difficult to simultaneously meet the requirements of economy environmental protection and resource recovery combined use of multiple methods with complementary advantages to treat electroplating electroless plating waste solutions showing great advantages has gradually become a development trend for examples electrolysis and electrodialysis are usually used in combination that is high concentration waste solution is treated by electrolysis to obtain low concentration solution and then electrodialysis is used and the concentrated solution obtained by electrodialysis can be returned to electrolysis process for treatment it avoids the low current efficiency and high energy consumption of electrolysis method to treat low concentration waste solution and membrane fouling of electrodialysis method to process high concentration solution the advantages of high recovery rate and high product purity of electrolysis method and the strong concentration ability of electrodialysis method are manifested additionally because they generally exist in stable complex state the valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution are difficult to separate and recover the combined method of first using the fenton reaction or electro oxidation method to break the complex and then combining with other methods to separate and recover the free metal ions should receive more attention for example fenton reagent electrolysis combination method can break citrate ni chelate in electroless ni plating waste solution by fenton reaction and recover ni by electrolysis process electro oxidation electrolysis combination method can degrade ni ammonia complexes ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 in waste plating solution by electro oxidation method and reduce and recover ni2 by electrolysis method however the optimization and integration potential of the combination methods still need to be explored and further research is needed on the strengthening mechanism of the combination methods and the design of process parameters to make it more suitable for practical and efficient treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution the direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution is a promising way to effectively improve the economic benefits of waste solution treatment the technology may give new aspects that are currently required to be explored and the remaining elements in the waste solution after direct high value materialization utilization process should be advanced treated there may be a huge future opportunity to efficiently treat electroplating electroless plating waste solution in a cleaner green and economical way however it requires researchers to make more efforts to explore and research 5 conclusions a large amount of waste solution containing rich valuable metal elements is produced due to the rapid development of the electroplating electroless plating industry if waste solution cannot be effectively treated it will not only threaten human health and ecological environment but also cause a waste of valuable metal resources according to the purpose of the treatment of valuable metal elements in waste solution the current technology for processing electroplating electroless plating waste solution is mainly divided into three categories direct removal of valuable metal elements separation and recovery of valuable metal elements and direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements the valuable metal elements in waste solution can be effectively removed or separated and recovered by each electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technology however the single treatment technology has shortcomings and a lot of enhancement and improvement measures have been done to address these shortcomings according to the advantages and disadvantages of various methods multi method combined technology with complementary advantages has been developed to treat waste solution although there is still a lot of research to be done to direct high value materialization treatment of waste solution this method can achieve efficient utilization of valuable metal resources and increase the economic benefits of waste solution treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13125,with the continuous development of the electroplating and electroless plating industries a large amount of waste solution is generated every year mainly including spent plating solution and plating pieces rinse wastewater the discharge standard of waste solution is also continuously improved if the electroplating electroless plating waste solution is not treated timely and effectively it will occupy the land resources of the factory increasing the operating cost and pose a serious threat to the environment and human health additionally the rich valuable metal resources in the waste solution will not be adequately reused therefore there is an urgent need to develop more advanced electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technologies herein the electroplating electroless ni cu plating waste solution spent plating solution and plating pieces rinse wastewater is taken to analyze the causes and component characteristics of the waste solution the principle advantages and disadvantages and optimization progress of the treatment technology for electroplating electroless plating waste solution are summarized from three aspects simple and direct removal of valuable metal elements separation and recovery of valuable metal elements and direct preparation of high value materials from waste solution the technical advantages of multi method combined treatment of waste solution have been analyzed further research direction such as direct high value materialization utilization of waste solution is proposed keywords electroplating electroless plating removal of valuable metal elements separation and recovery direct high value materialization waste solution treatment 1 introduction electroplating electroless plating coating can improve the oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance of the substrate material and further enhance the conductivity and wear resistance of the substrate material 1 therefore electroplating and electroless plating technologies are widely used in machine manufacturing light industry electrical and electronic industries etc and are developing rapidly at a very high growth rate 2 4 which has become an indispensable part of the manufacturing and processing industry for example the annual net growth rate of the electroless ni plating industry averages 10 15 as a result a large amount of waste solution will be generated in the electroplating electroless plating process which mainly includes spent plating solution and plating pieces rinse wastewater 5 8 the components contained in the plating pieces rinse wastewater are similar to those of the spent plating solution and can be regarded as a dilution of the spent plating solution 3 9 so electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment is mainly to deal with the spent plating solution due to the complex composition of electroplating electroless plating waste solution which contains a large amount of valuable metal elements and various organic additives for example complexing agents such as citric acid and lactic acid etc surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate etc 2 5 10 its treatment is a major problem in today s environmental governance in the early stage methods with low economic cost simple equipment and easy operation such as chemical coagulation 11 electrocoagulation 12 13 and membrane filtration etc 14 15 were used to directly remove valuable metal elements and organics in electroplating electroless plating waste solution and the treated water was reused or discharged to standard however these conventional methods have significant shortcomings such as secondary pollution caused by the generation of a large amount of heavy metal containing sludge consuming a large number of chemical reagents and reducing treatment efficiency caused by membrane fouling etc more importantly the non renewable valuable metal resources in the waste solution are not able to be separated and recovered by these methods therefore some electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technologies that can effectively separate and recover valuable metal elements such as electrolysis 16 17 electrodialysis 18 and ion exchange 19 20 have been developed however many problems still remain unsolved for example the high energy consumption caused by low current efficiency low durability and poor selectivity of electrodialysis membranes low ion exchange capacity etc on the other hand it is a great challenge to use a single treatment technology to realize the separation and recovery of valuable metals in waste solution with complex components therefore while dealing with electroplating electroless plating waste solution the multi method joint integration technology of directly high value materialization of valuable metal elements to improve economic benefits is favored by more and more researchers herein typical electroplating electroless plating ni and cu waste solution is taken as examples and the causes and composition characteristics of waste solution focus on spent plating solution are analyzed based on three perspectives simple and direct removal of pollutants from waste solution the separation and recycling of valuable metal elements and the direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements from waste solution the principle advantages and disadvantages and optimization progress of electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technology are reviewed the next research direction is proposed focus on the combined use of multiple treatment methods and the direct high value materialization of waste solution 2 the generation characteristics and hazards of electroplating electroless plating waste solution before plating the metal salts concentration of plating solution usually reaches hundreds of g l for example watt typed ni plating solution is composed of 40 60 g l nicl2 and 240 310 g l niso4 2 plating solution will become waste due to the gradual consumption of metal salts for electroplating many impurity components are accumulated in the plating solution that have been used for a long time and the structure of some additives has been destroyed more importantly the metal ions concentration is reduced if the plating solution is not treated timely and effectively it will affect the quality of plating layer and increase power consumption which cannot continue to be used normally and becomes waste solution 21 for electroless plating the spent solution is produced for many reasons 10 such as the improper preparation or the immature pretreatment process of the plating solution causes the instability of the plating solution improper control of the plating process or the aging of the plating solution leads to the instability of the plating solution formula 1 shows that after a long time of electroless plating metal ions and hypophosphite ions in solution are consumed but byproducts such as phosphate ions sodium ions and sulfate ions are gradually accumulated when byproducts reach a certain concentration the performance of electroless plating solution decreases turbidity and aging and even spontaneous decomposition this will greatly affect the quality of the metal phosphorus alloy coating so the electroless ni plating spent solution is formed 5 with the development of the electroplating and electroless plating industries a large amount of waste solution needs to be treated taking the circuit board industry as an example ni plating including electroless plating and electroplating is one of the many production processes for circuit boards at present the annual output of circuit boards in china alone has exceeded 200 million m2 and every 100 m2 of circuit boards will produce 40 l of ni plating waste solution based on this calculation only in china the circuit board industry generates 80 million l of ni plating waste solution every year the ni mass concentration in waste solution in circuit board industry is about 5 0 g l 1 3 nah 2 po 2 3 h 2 o niso 4 3 nah 2 po 3 h 2 so 4 2 h 2 ni on the other hand the composition of electroplating electroless plating waste solution is more complex containing high concentrations of ni 3 50 77 50 g l table 1 cu 26 00 41 60 g l table 2 and other valuable metal elements such as bi 0 04 g l table 2 as well as cyanide 12 g l table 2 and many other toxic and harmful pollutants such as hypophosphite phosphate and other p containing substances and the total p concentration range is 3 38 110 70 g l table 3 in order to minimize the impact of heavy metal pollution on the environment and human health china has strengthened the control of heavy metal emissions and the ni2 emission standard requires 0 1 mg l 22 however most enterprises only perform simple chemical coagulation to form sludge valuable metal element in the sludge is difficult to recover which is easy to diffuse and leaching to cause secondary pollution the cost of medicament consumption is also high additionally the transportation and storage of waste solution also squeezes the production space of factory in view of the composition and characteristics of waste solution selecting corresponding treatment technology is the theoretical basis for the effective separation recovery and direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements therefore characteristics of the main components of electroplating electroless plating waste solution mentioned in previous studies are summarized and analyzed as tables 1 3 showed the electroplating electroless plating waste solution mainly contains main salt such as ni2 concentration range is 3 50 77 50 g l i e 0 06 1 30 m hypophosphite phosphate and other p containing substances total p concentration range is 3 38 110 70 g l i e 0 11 3 57 m ph buffering agents such as h3bo3 and h3po3 nh4 and organic complexing agents and surfactants containing c n s etc due to the stable complexes formed by the combination of metal ions and complexing agents such as cu edta and ni edta it is difficult to completely remove metal ions by most common chemical coagulation methods if valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution cannot be effectively recycled it will cause serious environmental pollution and endanger human health table 4 it also causes the waste of non renewable valuable metal resources therefore it is necessary to develop treatment technologies that can efficiently separate recover and utilize valuable metal elements in the waste solution recent years great progress has been made on the treatment and utilization of electroplating electroless plating waste solution herein the principles advantages and disadvantages and optimization research are summarized on the view of the removal recovery and direct high value materialization utilizing valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution finally the further research direction of waste solution recovery and treatment is proposed based on multi method combination and direct high value materialization utilizing valuable metal elements 3 removal separation and recycling and direct high value materialization utilization of valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution in view of the serious environmental pollution caused by waste solution the first thing that researchers think about is how to directly remove harmful substances in electroplating electroless plating waste solution to meet emission standards considering the cost chemical coagulation 11 31 is one of the most commonly used methods in industry simultaneously researchers hope to develop renewable efficient and inexpensive adsorbents 32 to remove valuable metal elements from waste solution later several electrochemical methods are developed including direct removal of valuable metal elements such as electrocoagulation 12 13 and microelectrolysis 33 34 and separation and recovery of valuable metal elements such as electrodialysis 18 and electrolysis 16 17 moreover in recent years various of membrane filtration and separation technologies such as microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration and reverse osmosis have been widely used for the removal of valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution 10 valuable metal elements separation and recovery methods such as extraction 35 36 ion exchange 19 20 and deionization 37 38 are also used although researchers focus on the shortcomings of various methods for technical enhancement and improvement however it is difficult for a single treatment method to simultaneously meet the ever increasing requirements for environmental protection and the demand for efficient separation and recovery as well as the high value materialization utilization of valuable metal elements therefore combined methods with two or more technologies to deep remove such as fenton destroying the complex hydroxide coagulation sodium sulfide coagulation method or separate and recover such as electrodialysis electrolysis of valuable metal elements are used recently on the basis of solving environmental pollution problem and realizing valuable metal elements recycling the research of directly preparing high value materials in waste solution to further improve economic benefits has received more and more attention herein the progress of electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technology is summarized from three aspects direct removal table 5 separation and recovery table 6 and direct high value materialization utilization of valuable metal elements table 7 3 1 direct removal of valuable metal elements 3 1 1 chemical coagulation method chemical coagulation method is to add various coagulation agents such as lime sodium sulfide sodium hydroxide and other substances to waste solution that can react with metal ions to form precipitation the precipitation is separated by a sedimentation tank or filtering equipment and the treated water is discharged or reused after reaching the standard the common industrial chemical coagulation treatment process of ni and cu plating waste solution is shown in fig 1 the reaction principles of different chemical coagulation methods to remove ni cu and other metals in waste solution are summarized 11 that is metals can be removed by adding alkaline reagents like cao ca oh 2 mg oh 2 naoh and nh4oh sulfides reagents like na2s nahs h2s and fes carbonates reagents like na2co3 and caco3 phosphates reagents like apatite and hydroxyapatite macromolecular trapping agents and small molecular precipitants like na3s3c3n3 9h2o na k 2cs3 nh2o and c6h14o2ps2k to produce metal oxides hydroxides sulfides carbonates phosphates and other forms of precipitation in practice two or more chemical coagulation methods are used simultaneously bonk et al 31 had used lime and caustic soda to precipitate metals in electroless ni plating waste solution after filtration sodium sulfide was used to further remove metals in the solution consequently ni2 was efficiently removed and waste solution treatment cost was greatly reduced yu et al 39 used lime milk as a chemical precipitator to treat lower concentration 50 mg l electroless ni plating waste solution after electrolysis and ni2 concentration was reduced to less than 1 mg l it has confirmed that chemical coagulation is an effective treatment method for waste solution with different metal ion concentration in addition to remove cu2 and ni2 chemical coagulation method is also suitable for removing cd2 pb2 and other heavy metal ions özverdi et al 40 successfully removed cd2 pb2 cu2 and other heavy metals in solution through pyrite and synthetic fes in previous studies researchers compared different chemical precipitators to find an effective and economical one mirbagheri et al 41 confirmed the applicability of alkaline reagents and naoh to remove cu2 and cr3 after converting cr6 to cr3 the cr3 concentration can be reduced to 0 01 ppm by adding ca oh 2 precipitation after comparing the hydroxide precipitation and the carbonate method the former was selected and further experiments were conducted to confirm that lime had more advantages than naoh in removing cr heavy metal ions from waste solution from the perspective of economy and precipitation speed organic complexing agents such as edta can form complexes with metal ions and greatly increase the solubility of metal ions so it is widely used in electroplating and electroless plating industries however these complexes in waste solution are stable in structure and difficult to be removed effectively by traditional chemical coagulation method the advanced oxidation process aop can oxidize many complexes into inorganic forms so that metal ions become free fenton process is one of the most effective aop processes 42 the hydroxyl radical oh produced by mixed solution of fe2 and h2o2 has strong oxidizing properties formula 2 which can oxidize many organometallic compounds into inorganic forms thereby changing metal ions to free state 43 44 2 h 2 o 2 fe 2 fe 3 oh oh a large number of studies have proved that fenton process can improve the removal rate of organometallic compounds in electroplating electroless plating waste solution 45 46 however fenton process has the problem of low oxidation efficiency 47 to solve this problem zhao 42 and nguyen et al 48 combined the fenton process with ozone oxidation process to treat ni plating waste solution effectively removing pollutants such as ni edta and greatly reducing the cost it opens up a new idea for the treating waste solution containing ni edta chemical coagulation method has the advantages of simple treatment process and low cost so it has a wide range of practical applications in industry however the method also has many shortcomings for solutions containing a variety of metal ions chemical coagulation method cannot separate the metals although kurama 49 used naoh and mgo to successfully precipitate metal ions such as ni cu zn and cr from solution however it cannot achieve metal ions selective separation only using other processes can further purify the precipitate moreover a large amount of sludge containing heavy metal elements is produced during chemical coagulation process which is prone to secondary pollution large quantities of coagulation agents are consumed and new impurities are introduced into waste solution additionally colloidal precipitation is easily formed during sulfide precipitation which affects the effect of filtration and separation 50 51 3 1 2 adsorption method adsorption method can effectively remove heavy metal ions by using adsorption material with unique physical chemical structure because of its large specific surface area good adsorption performance and other properties adsorption material shows the advantages of high adsorption rate high elution rate excellent permeability stability and is gradually widely used in waste solution treatment commonly used adsorbents are kaolin activated carbon diatomite chitosan resin sepiolite polysaccharide resin and so on activated carbon adsorbent is used to remove pollutants in electroplating chemical plating waste solution because of its simple process however conventional activated carbon can only remove organic matter odor and valuable metal ions to a certain extent to improve the adsorption capacity the pore density pore size distribution and surface functional groups of activated carbon are modified through chemical method so as to increase the specific surface area and improve the adsorption performance 32 to save costs biomass materials and waste tires were used to prepare activated carbon the modified activated carbon prepared by chemical treatment and carbonization of coconut husk has a high removal efficiency for ni2 in the waste solution and ni2 adsorbed by activated carbon can be recovered by using hcl solution 52 hasar 53 prepared activated carbon by h2so4 activated almond shells which could effectively adsorb ni2 with a removal rate of 97 8 under the optimal conditions abbasi et al 54 prepared activated carbon by pyrolyzing waste tires which shows high adsorption capacity of removing heavy metal ions such as cu2 and ni2 in waste solution at present most activated carbon has been replaced by cheaper adsorbents such as chitosan cts and kaolinite 55 chitosan is the product of deacetylation of chitin various active functional groups in the molecule make it have a strong ability to coordinate with metal ions 56 several modifications techniques such as crosslinking 57 grafting 58 and combining with other adsorbent materials have been developed to enhance the adsorption property and stability in acidic medium 59 but the modified chitosan adsorption method has obvious limitations low regeneration capacity and weak adsorption capacity of some valuable metal ions recent years nanostructured materials have also been widely used as adsorbents in removal of heavy metal ions in waste solution dubey et al 60 gave a detailed explanation on the adsorption mechanism of nanomaterials as fig 2 showed the metallic species adsorption process consists of three well known steps the first is film diffusion that is the adsorbate transports through a surface film to the exterior of the adsorbent the second is pore diffusion that assumes diffusion of the adsorbate within the pores of the adsorbent the last is intra particle diffusion which includes the adsorption of solute at the adsorbent interior surfaces srivastava et al 61 used 15 20 nm al powder to remove ni2 in waste solution and found that when initial ni2 concentration was low and the stirring speed was high the ni2 removal rate was close to 100 many studies have shown that compared to traditional adsorbents nanomaterials have many advantages and are excellent candidates for removing heavy metal pollutants from waste solution 60 however the effluent of electroplating electroless plating waste solution after adsorption treatment usually cannot meet the requirements for the ni2 discharge standard of 0 1 mg l 22 3 1 3 electrocoagulation method chemical coagulation requires adding a large amount of chemical reagent and produces a large amount of heavy metal containing sludge which is easy to cause secondary pollution however electrocoagulation process products a relatively less sludge due to the generation of coagulant cations in situ by electrolysis of metal anodes the al or fe alloy and the stainless steel are usually used as sacrificial anode and cathode respectively 12 as shown in fig 3a the electrocoagulation process involves three successive stages 13 first the electrolytic oxidation of sacrificial anode produces coagulants which mainly includes the dissolution of the al anode and water electrolysis reaction formula 3 5 second the destabilization of contaminants and particulate suspension and breaking of emulsions due to the consumption of h formula 5 the ph near the cathode increases thereby inducing the precipitation of metal ions as corresponding hydroxides and co precipitation with al hydroxides formula 6 8 simultaneously metal cations men and higher oxidized metal compounds like cr6 may be electrochemical reduced to pure metals me0 and lower oxidized metal compounds cr3 at the cathode surface respectively 3 al al 3 3e 4 2h 2 o 4h o 2 4 e 5 2h 2 o 2e h 2 2oh 6 me n ne nme 0 7 cr 2 o 7 2 6e 7h 2 o 2cr 3 14 oh 8 me n noh me oh n finally flocs are formed by the coagulation of the destabilized phases additionally the anode metal ions such as al3 and hydroxide ions oh generated at the electrode surface react in the bulk wastewater to generate various hydroxides and form polymers formulae 9 10 the metal cation hydroxyl compounds formed by hydrolysis polymerization have a large surface area and good adsorption performance so it can adsorb pollutant particles in solution electrocoagulation technology combines four functions of electrochemical oxidation electrochemical reduction coagulation and air flotation it has the advantages of high treatment efficiency short reaction time no need to add chemicals small footprint small amount of sludge and simple follow up treatment 63 64 9 al 3 3oh al oh 3 10 n al oh 3 al n oh 3 n adhoum et al 65 first studied the ability of al as anode to treat various metal ions cu2 zn2 cr6 in electroplating waste solution and found that the removal rate of cu and zn is 5 times faster than that of cr due to the different removal mechanism electrocoagulation method had high efficiency and fast speed only taking 20 min to reduce the metal ion content below the emission standard kilany et al 66 used electrocoagulation in a newly designed electrolytic cell to simultaneously remove cu2 and demulsify from cu plating waste solution under optimum conditions cu2 and oil removal rate were 98 in only 15 mins and 85 in 1 h respectively akbal et al 67 used fe al electrode pair to remove cu cr and ni from plating waste solution through electrocoagulation and found that cu cr and ni could be completely removed in 20 mins under the optimal condition electrocoagulation also has some limitations such as large anode consumption simultaneously an oxide film passivation layer is easily formed on the anode surface especially al anode which prevents al dissolution and ion transmission and reduces the efficiency of waste solution treatment cl can be adsorbed and penetrate into the passivation layer on the anode surface causing the destruction of passivation film however if cl concentration in the waste solution is too low the passivation of the electrode cannot be effectively suppressed while an excessively high cl concentration will not only cause severe corrosion of al electrode but also affect the recycling of water resulting in excessive energy consumption in our lab supergravity field was introduced in electrocoagulation process to enhance the mass transfer process of cl to the passivation layer fig 3b and 3c 62 in the simulated waste solution with low cl concentration it effectively increased the al anode dissolution rate made the outer oxidation layer thinned and improved the removal rate of cu moreover the flocs produced by electrocoagulation do not settle quickly which often results in turbid effluent additionally there are often residual fe ions in the effluent of electrocoagulation which is a by product of electrocoagulation therefore it is still insufficient to use electrocoagulation as the only treatment method 68 3 1 4 microelectrolysis method microelectrolysis method is that two metals or metal and non metal with a potential difference directly contact and are completely immersed in the electrolyte solution thereby forming a lot of fine primary cells no need for external power source to achieve the purification of waste solution 33 generally the microelectrolysis reaction mechanism involves galvanic cell reaction redox flocculation adsorption co precipitation etc 34 69 the electrode reactions are as follows 70 formulae 11 and 12 are the anode oxidation reaction formulae 13 16 are the cathode reduction reaction formula 13 formulae 14 15 and formula 16 are in the oxygen free oxygen acid as well as oxygen neutral and weakly alkaline conditions respectively 11 fe s fe 2 aq 2e 12 fe 2 aq fe 3 aq e 13 2h aq 2e 2 h h 2 g 14 o 2 g 4h aq 4e 2 h 2 o 15 o 2 g 2h aq 2e h 2 o 2 aq 16 o 2 g 2 h 2 o 4e 4oh aq it has proved that microelectrolysis method can effectively remove metal ions in waste solution wu et al 71 verified that fe c microelectrolysis packing could effectively remove u vi from solution chen et al 72 used fe c microelectrolysis to degrade organic waste solution containing cu edta and found that oh radicals generated under acidic aerobic condition during the microelectrolysis process attacked to the organic groups of coordination compounds resulting in complex bonds breaking cu2 was removed via nascent gelatinous ferric hydroxide and ferrous hydroxide and edta was degraded by oh radicals microelectrolysis technology also has many disadvantages such as acidic operating conditions ph 2 3 large amounts of acid needs to be added to adjust ph leading to fast dissolution of fe0 production of large amounts of fe containing sludge and hardening of the filler in recent years the improvement of microelectrolysis method mainly focuses on the following four aspects 1 catalytic microelectrolysis fan et al 73 added a small amount of cu directly to the conventional fe c reactor to raise the electrode reaction efficiency because some refractory organics can be reduced directly on cu surface there is no need for aeration treatment so fe0 and fe2 will not react with oxygen leading to the reduce of fe0 consumption and fe based sludge production moreover the fe cu process covers wider ph range from 2 to 10 5 2 heavy metal modified fe c microelectrolysis filler li et al 74 added mn powder to fe c microelectrolysis filler for sintering modification to form stable and regular fe mn c modified microelectrolysis filler which solved the hardening problem 3 improve reactor structure in order to easily supplement the loss of fe c filler prevent clogging and deactivation and reduce investment costs li et al 75 used fe c particles to remove cu2 from solutions in electrocatalytic internal microelectrolysis fluidized bed 4 combine microelectrolysis with other methods zhang et al 76 use aeration and oxidation reagents such as o3 h2o2 to modify the reductive internal microelectrolysis process to be oxidative and proved that the ozone aerated internal microelectrolysis filter process could be operated at wide ph range without significant treatment efficiencies change excellent treatment performance could be obtained by oxidation reagents integrated with internal microelectrolysis processes wang et al 77 develop interior microelectrolysis fenton recycle ferrite to treat simulated electroplating waste solution containing chelated cu microelectrolysis reaction could directly degrade the chelated cu and produce fe2 for the fenton reaction to degrade it after decomplexation the microelectrolysis fenton effluent directly flows into the recycle ferrite reactor to remove 99 9 cu2 under optimum conditions 3 1 5 membrane separation technology according to the pore size of membrane and the size of retained solute the pressure driven membrane separation process can be divided into the following categories microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro the detailed classification standard is shown in fig 4 78 the membranes pore size is in the following order mf 0 1 1 um uf 20 1000 å nf 0 5 2 nm ro internal voids less than 5 å the order of membrane operating pressure is opposite to that of membrane pore size ro 1 10 mpa nf 0 35 3 mpa uf 0 100 1 mpa mf 0 01 0 2 mpa the membrane operating cost reduces with the decrease of membrane operating pressure 1 reverse osmosis ro separation follows the solution diffusion model 79 that is solute and solvent are dissolved in ro membrane respectively and the chemical potential energy difference on both membrane sides is diffusion driving force which is mainly affected by concentration gradient and applied pressure ro is usually used in the final step of waste solution treatment process to ensure the effluent quality which can effectively remove monovalent ion such as na cl with a retention rate of 95 99 14 15 colla et al 80 first used uf or traditional coagulation flocculation sedimentation sand filtration technology to treat the steel plant waste solution and finally adopted ro most salts such as chloride fluoride calcium sulfate etc can be removed by ro filtration and the conductivity alkalinity and total dissolved solids have dropped sharply qin et al 81 used roll type ro equipment to treat cu plating rinsing water and found that membrane flux increased with the increase of pressure drop and temperature and permeate concentration decreased with the increase of pressure drop ro membrane is mostly polyamide material with poor acid and alkali resistance narrow ph range of applicable treatment solutions and low acid recovery rate so it has limitations for the treatment of most acidic heavy metal ion waste solution 2 nanofiltration most nf membranes are electrically charged on the surface and inside pores which can interact with charged ions in solution moreover each pore channel of nf membrane can only contain 3 4 h2o molecules dh2o 0 276 nm compared with the outside of pore channel h2o molecules arrange more orderly in the limited space and possess lower dielectric constant charged ions are repelled when entering the medium with low dielectric constant from high dielectric constant and the higher the ion valence the stronger the repulsion therefore nf filtration mechanism is more complex and needs further study at present the electrostatic and steric hindrance model is generally accepted which combines the pore size screening mechanism donnan repulsion effect and dielectric effect 82 nf can remove solutes with a molecular weight of 200 2000 da and reduce the salt load of ro by removing 40 70 of monovalent salts it can also be used for water softening mohammad et al 83 used nf membranes to treat ni p electroless plating waste solution and found that 98 ni2 can be rejected by nf and ni2 and monovalent na can be separated well boricha et al 84 prepare nf membranes by casting and spraying strong chelating agent diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid dtpa coating on polyether sulfone uf substrate to treat electroplating waste solution zn2 and fe3 retention rates were 94 and 93 respectively which increased with the increase of pressure and feed flow rate but not affected by feed ph hosseini et al 85 prepared poly acrylonitrile nf membrane to remove ni and cr elements in electroplating waste solution ni and cr elements rejection rate increased with the increase of poly acrylonitrile concentration and it decreased with the increase of polyethylene glycol concentration due to the increase of permeation flux both the effluent of nf and ro desalination meet the national reuse standards but nf is more suitable for large scale industrial applications for the treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution because it can provide higher permeation flux at low operating pressures 3 ultrafiltration uf follows pore size screening principle and can separate macromolecules with diameter of 0 05 0 2 μm or molecular weight of 10 000 100 000 in solution it also can trap viruses bacteria colloids macromolecular organics oil protein and suspended solids etc complexation micelle strengthening ultrafiltration waste solution treatment technology has been developed its separation mechanism is to first selectively construct a large molecular weight complexing agent heavy metal ion polymer or heavy metal ion containing micelles to make the diameter larger than uf membrane pore size uncomplexed metal ions pass through the uf membrane to achieve selective removal of metal ions 86 87 in order to achieve the selective separation of multiple valuable metal ions in waste solution zhang et al 86 using polyacrylate sodium paas as the complexing agent studied the effect of rotating disk membrane rdm on the selective separation and removal of ni2 and cr3 in complexation uf process the difference in shear induced dissociation of paa ni and paa cr complex can be adjusted by ph and rotation speed so as to realize the selective separation and removal of ni2 and cr3 at different ph the existence of ions in the solution is different which affects the membrane ion retention effect qin et al 88 studied the filtration effect of feed ph on electroless plating ni rinsing solution by uf when feed ph was lower than 3 68 fe2 was in free state and was not retained by uf however when feed ph increased fe2 rejection rate increased significantly because fe2 was in colloidal form during membrane separation process concentration polarization causes an increase in operating pressure and a decrease in permeate flux 89 bhattacharjee et al 90 used an intermittent stirring plate to decrease concentration polarization and increase the flux and rejection rate moreover membrane fouling is also a cause of the decrease in permeate flux 91 irena et al 92 used uf as the pre process of ro process to remove colloidal pollutants and dissolved substances larger than 0 4 um and eliminate ro membrane pollution 4 microfiltration the porosity of mf membrane is as high as 70 80 and the thickness is 90 150 um separation mechanism is based on the pore size sieve effect to remove cu2 in waste solution using a low pressure membrane wang et al 93 embedded stainless steel mesh into active polyvinylidene fluoride membrane to prepare conducting mf membrane as fig 5 showed through electrophoresis and electrochemical oxidation reduction on the energized film cu2 is converted into cu oh 2 and cu deposition and removed membrane fouling caused by organic matter microorganisms smaller particles of colloidal materials and salt will cause precipitation and reduce membrane flux 94 therefore using of mf membrane to pre treat waste solution can prevent ro membrane pollution bahar et al 95 filtered and pretreated waste solution with ceramic mf membrane after chemical coagulation to reduce the biological pollution and fouling of ro membrane thereby preventing membrane fouling 3 1 6 combined method with the improvement of industrial material performance requirements and the development of electroplating electroless plating technology the component of plating solution becomes more and more complicated leading to the waste solution containing a variety of pollutants there are some shortcomings in a single waste solution treatment method if different methods are used in combination it can often achieve complementary advantages to meet the waste solution treatment requirements therefore researchers are increasingly considering combining various processes to deeply remove valuable metal elements from waste solution in plating ni waste solution ni element is usually in complex state and high concentration which is difficult to form hydroxide or sulfide precipitation single chemical coagulation is difficult to remove complexed heavy metal ions therefore fenton reaction is usually used in combination with other methods to firstly break the complex structure and then remove metal ions for example to break citrate ni chelate by fenton reaction and remove ni combination process of fenton reagent electrolytic reduction chemical coagulation was used to treat electroless ni plating waste solution 46 after cathodic deposition and alkaline solution precipitation 99 9 ni is separated zhou et al 44 used fe c microelectrolysis activated h2o2 oxidation fenton reaction process to simultaneously recover p and purify ni in plating ni waste solution lan et al 96 used microelectrolysis fenton reaction coagulation process to treat the edta cu2 containing waste solution produced by electroless cu plating under optimal condition cu2 and cod removal rate could reach 100 and 87 respectively it can be seen that the combined use of different methods can achieve complementary advantages and effectively remove pollutants in waste solution which is currently a research hotspot in waste solution treatment 3 2 recovery of valuable metal elements in waste solution above methods are only harmless treatment of waste solution however sludge formed by chemical coagulation non renewable adsorbents and electrocoagulation has become a new dangerous solid waste due to the presence of unrecovered heavy metals after long term stacking heavy metals will be re released into the environment and cause secondary pollution moreover non renewable valuable metal elements have not been separated and recycled resulting in a waste of resources therefore it is great significance to recycle valuable metal elements while treating waste solution some technology for separation and recovery of valuable metal elements were developed the key findings of which are summarized in table 6 3 2 1 electrolysis method electrolysis method is usually used to treat waste solution with high metal ion concentration which can not only selectively recover high purity metals 86 but also oxidize organics and reducing inorganics so as to achieve the purpose of degrading cod 17 researchers have done a lot of research on treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution by electrolysis 97 idhayachander 98 7and dutra et al 6 applied electrolysis method to treat plating ni and cu waste solution which effectively recovered metal ions and removed some pollutants electrolysis method has some disadvantages like high concentration polarization low current efficiency and high energy consumption so researchers improved electrolysis method by electrode modification rotating flow electrolysis pulse electrolysis and ion membrane electrolysis to improve system conductivity to reduce energy consumption reduce electrode boundary layer thickness to eliminate concentration polarization and concentrate metal ion concentration to improve current efficiency etc some researchers modify the electrodes for example gonzález et al 99 used hydrotalcite as electrolysis electrodes to recover cd2 and pb2 and remove pollutants which exhibited good treatment effect liu et al 100 prepared stainless steel mesh electrode coated with single walled carbon nanotubes swcnts ssn swcnts ssn electrode without polymerizer possesses high conductivity it can efficiently remove metal ions and can be regenerated with nitric acid after repeated use in order to solve concentration polarization barr 101 proposed rotating flow electrolysis technology fig 6 this technology allows the electrolyte to keep flowing during the electrodeposition process reduces electrode boundary layer thickness thereby reduces concentration polarization so the target metal can be preferentially precipitated at a lower concentration through this technology high purity metals are successfully recovered from various waste solution and metal recovery rate can usually reach more than 90 102 in our previous study 103 a centrifuge electrode is applied for the simple and green recovery of high purity cu powders by electrodeposition from the leaching solution of electroplating sludge containing low concentration multi metal fig 7a because the centrifuge electrode enhances the mass transfer serious concentration polarization of cu electrodeposition in low concentration leaching solution is eliminated and the limiting current density is increased fig 7b cu2 is preferentially reduced by electrolysis and the electrodeposition of metal impurities is effectively inhibited due to the large potential difference between cu cu2 and other metal ions under small concentration polarization fig 7c as a result the purity recovery ratio and current efficiency of cu products are obviously increased cu powders with a purity of 99 9 are selectively separated from the multi metal leaching solution of electroplating sludge additionally cu products structure from powders to foils could be obtained by adjusting the cu concentration and rotating speed fig 7d pulse electrolysis method can also effectively alleviate concentration polarization pulse current makes the system react in the alternate mode of power supply power off power supply which will affect mass transfer adsorption and desorption and electric double layer effect of electrode surface it has confirmed that compared to direct current pulsed current can more efficiently recover high purity metals from waste solution and with lower consumption 104 although electrolysis treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution to recover valuable metal elements has the advantages of high efficiency stable operation simple operation and environmental friendliness its cost is relatively high moreover the conversion rate of phosphate is restricted by the electrode effective active surface area and the electrolysis voltage njau et al 105 found that although higher electrolysis voltage can improve phosphate conversion rate it will lead to serious hydrogen evolution which decreases current efficiency and increases energy consumption especially in treatment of low concentration solutions single electrolysis method is poor in complex treatment so electrolysis method is very suitable for the treatment of high concentration electroplating electroless plating waste solution in the initial stage 106 3 2 2 electrodialysis method the principle of electrodialysis ed is shown in fig 8 the cation exchange membrane c and anion exchange membrane a are alternately installed between the anode and cathode forming cells between a and c the raw electroplating electroless plating waste solution flows into each cell simultaneously and ion concentration is the same everywhere direct current is applied between the two electrode plates to form a direct current electric field under the electric field force the cation in each cell moves towards the cathode and is blocked by a through c while the anion moves towards the anode and is blocked by c through a finally alternating low salinity solution and high salinity solution are formed to achieve the purpose of concentration and desalination 18 the waste solutions containing different metal ions such as cu2 ni2 zn2 and cr6 etc are all suitable for ed treatment low salinity solution and high salinity solution are generated by ed treatment although the low salinity solution may not meet the discharge standards it can usually be used as rinsing water for plating pieces while for the high salinity solution it can be fed to the bath to recover volumes lost by evaporation and drag out during ni electroplating process without damaging the quality of plating pieces 25 107 generally ed technology can effectively recover water and separate heavy metal ions from electroplating electroless plating waste solution the main advantage of ed is that the concentration ratio of the high salinity solution and the low salinity solution can reach about 100 times which is higher than that of ro membrane the concentrated solution i e high salinity solution can be reused in plating bath which has a good environmental benefit unfortunately the equipment investment and maintenance costs of ed are relatively high and the ion exchange membranes are needed the ion exchange membranes are prone to membrane fouling scaling and concentration polarization etc so membrane flux gradually decreases with time and frequent maintenance is required additionally this method has poor selective separation and recovery capabilities for metal ions with similar valence states 108 109 aiming at technical defects caused by ion exchange membranes konstantinos 110 designed electrostatic shielding zone ion current collectors eszs icss to replace ion exchange membranes for electrodialysis eszs icss are formed by electron and ion conductive media for example a packed bed of graphite powder is placed between the anode and the cathode which will cause the electric field inside the electrolysis device to be discontinuous thereby forming an ion dilution and ion concentration chamber because the new method does not require selective ion exchange membranes the above shortcomings do not exist experiments have proved that this method has the same treatment effect as electrodialysis ed cannot selectively recover metals according to earlier reports 111 112 dydo et al 113 improve the selectivity of ed by introducing additives such as ligands and complexing agents it has also been found that zn2 can be effectively separated from iron in a simulating electroplating zn waste solution by adding citric acid and using a heterogeneous cm h am h ralex membrane the zn recovery rate exceeded 86 6 3 2 3 solvent extraction method solvent extraction is also called liquid liquid extraction which is commonly used for separating and purifying substances solvent extraction uses a water insoluble extractant to contact the waste solution the organic matter heavy metals rare metals etc are combined with the extractant to realize phase transfer and purify the waste solution because of the liquid liquid contact it can be operated continuously and the separation effect is perfect 35 heavy metals such as cr ni and cu can be efficiently recovered under the action of solvent extraction 36 for cr containing electroplating waste solution solvent extraction method can successfully separate cr6 and obtain sodium dichromate after concentration and crystallization for electroplating zn cr iii alloy waste solution there are two heavy metal ions of zn and cr mixed in the solution and the extraction of cr requires a higher ph so sze et al 114 designed the process flow of diethylhexyl phosphoric acid dehpa extraction of zinc and ammoniated dehpa extraction of cr iii sahu et al 115 used tributyl phosphate tbp to extract and recover cr and zn from electroplating waste solution after that cr and zn can be removed from the tbp extractant by different stripping solution for cu containing waste solution copper sulfate is usually the extraction product which can be returned to the electroplating and electroless plating bath 116 previously single phase extractant was used to extract metals the disadvantage of a single carrier is that the loading capacity of the organic relative to the metal ions is low 117 acidic extractant and neutral extractant are used in combination to improve the extraction efficiency due to their synergistic effect the extraction effect is significantly enhanced 24 for example eyupoglu et al 118 used lix 63 and 2bda to synergistically extract electroplating cr ni waste solution and ni extraction rate reached 98 5 sulaiman et al 35 used green binary mixtures of d2ehpa octanol system as extractant which was capable of extracting ni from electroless ni plating waste solution up to 90 under optimal conditions 1 0 m hno3 was employed as stripping agent for the back extraction of ni from the ni loaded organic phase which proved that the green organic phase can be recycled back for ni extraction as well as minimizing the use of an expensive carrier in solvent extraction process 3 2 4 ion exchange method ion exchange method is often used in treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solutions 19 this method is to exchange ions in solid ion exchanger with ions in dilute solution using environmentally friendly ions to replace the ions harmful to the environment 20 ion exchange process is similar to adsorption process but specific metal ions can be separated due to the different chemical properties of the ion exchange matrix ion exchange matrices include cation exchange resin and anion exchange resin resins are also divided into synthetic resins and natural resins synthetic resins are more popular because they can separate metals without restriction 119 cation exchange resins are divided into hydrogen type and sodium type the working principle is shown as following eqs 17 19 hydrogen type 17 h n r y n yr nh sodium type 18 na n r y n yr nna the working principle of anion exchange resin can be expressed by the following formula 19 r oh n m n rm noh where r is the active group of the resin yn and mn are the cation and anion to be exchanged in solution respectively 120 the most preferred ion exchanger is cation exchanger composed of strong acid resin containing a sulfonic acid group and a weakly basic resin containing a hydroxy acid group 121 it is proved that the ion exchanger has a good adsorption effect on heavy metal ions such as ni2 and cu2 122 however the adsorption mechanism of composite resins on heavy metal ion complexes is unclear li et al 123 studied the resin adsorption mechanism they desorbed the resin after adsorption and recovered high purity nano metal from the desorption solution through chemical reduction proving that the process is feasible in the recovery of high purity metals ion exchange method has the advantages of low energy consumption less use of chemical reagents no sludge generation and good treatment effect however the operating cost is high and the equipment needs to be maintained frequently moreover the resin is easily contaminated especially in waste solution with high metal ions therefore ion exchange method is often used in conjunction with electrodialysis method which is suitable for the treatment of high concentration waste solution 124 3 2 5 electrodeionization method electrodeionization edi method is under the combination of electrodialysis and ion exchange technology 37 the principle of edi is that the ions in the low salinity solution produced by electrodialysis are exchanged and transported by active material under an electric field and then the pure water and metal ions are deeply separated and recovered 38 that is a mixed ion exchange resin of anion and cation installed in the low salinity solution chamber of the electrodialysis device compared with ion exchange method the edi method can regenerate ion exchange resin through electrical energy with this technology high purity water can be deeply separated simultaneously and metal salts can be concentrated and recovered many research groups have investigated the feasibility of edi technology lu 125 developed a novel integrated two stage edi process to recover ni2 and pure water from simulated electroplating ni waste solution which can remove 99 of ni2 from the solution about 94 of ni2 is removed in the first stage and about 96 7 of the remaining ni2 is removed in the second stage the concentrated solution with ni2 concentration as high as 11 031 mg l is obtained through closed circulation and pure water with resistivity exceeding 1 6 mω cm is produced compared with chemical precipitation method this process can bring considerable economic benefits because ion exchange membranes are needed in edi process like electrodialysis it is also troubled by membrane fouling scaling and concentration polarization 3 2 6 combination method for the separation and recovery of valuable metal elements like the treatment method of directly removing valuable metal elements in waste solution each single treatment method for recovering valuable metal elements in waste solution also has its own limitations and a good recovery effect cannot usually be obtained when used alone according to the advantages and disadvantages of various methods combining different methods can often achieve complementary advantages the combination of membrane filtration processes and electrolysis processes is also an effective method for separating and recovering heavy metal ions zuo et al 126 proposed a process that combines multiple membrane filtration and electrodialysis to treat plating waste solution first uf and mf are used for pretreatment then electrodialysis is used for effective desalination finally nf and ro are used the concentrated solution after electrodialysis is deeply processed for electrolysis method it is suitable to process waste solution containing high concentration valuable metal elements due to the high current efficiency however for waste solution with low concentration valuable metal elements the electrolysis current efficiency is low and the energy consumption is high while electrodialysis and electrodeionization methods show obvious advantages in treatment of waste solution with low concentration valuable metal elements high concentration ratio good concentration effect low energy consumption more thorough separation of valuable metal elements and stable fresh water effluent however it is easy to occur membrane fouling scaling and concentration polarization etc for electrodialysis and electrodeionization methods to process waste solution with high concentration valuable metal 127 therefore the electrolysis method can recover the concentrated solution produced by electrodialysis and electrodeionization which can save energy consumption and improve the purity and recovery rate of valuable metals 18 wang et al 22 investigated the influence of operating conditions on the treatment of electroplating wastewater by electrodialysis combined with the electrodeposition ni2 concentration in the anolyte and the catholyte could be reduced from 1 0 initial concentration to 0 015 and 0 085 mg l respectively far below 0 1 mg l the introduction of electrodeposition enhanced ni2 migration in the electrolytes leading to the decrease the energy consumption similarly like electrodialysis the ion exchange method is also suitable for low concentration heavy metal solutions the effluent quality is good and the regenerated solution needs further treatment so it can also be combined with electrolysis to recover valuable metals 128 the combined use of electrolysis electrodialysis electrodeionization processes can meet the high efficiency and deep separation and recovery of metals and solve the problem of poor effluent quality to achieve water reuse requirements and increase the content of treatment range of ni spent solution 108 electro oxidation method is usually used to remove a large amount of ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 complexes in ni electroplating waste solution but it cannot directly recover ni guan 129 realized decomposition of ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 complexes and the reduction and recovery of ni2 by the combined process of electro oxidation and electrolysis and analyzed the influence of parameters such as the current density ph value and reaction temperature on the performance of electrochemical oxidation and reduction reactions ni recovery rate and the ammonia removal efficiency can reach 99 and 70 respectively under the optimal conditions cathode surface deposits are zero valent ni the electrochemical reaction process is that ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 complexes are destroyed in the electro oxidation process to generate ni2 and free nh3 then ni2 is reduced on cathode and nh3 is released 130 in order to decompose the stable complex formed by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and toxic metals such as ni etc zhao et al 131 established a photocatalysis electrochemical combined process using tio2 ti plate as anode and stainless steel as cathode and realized the decomposition of ni edta and the recovery of ni at the same time compared with single photocatalytic or electro oxidation treatment technology the removal rate of ni edta is greatly increased to 90 the results show that the depolymerization of ni edta is mainly through the cleavage of amine group on ni edta however the depolymerization of the acetate group is weak moreover the decomposition of ni edta at anode and the reduction and recovery of ni2 at cathode are synergistically consistent so ni recovery rate is also greatly improved compared with electrolysis and photocatalysis which can reach 45 3 3 materialization utilization of waste solution the development process of electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment has changed from the initial single removal of all pollutants to a targeted separation and treatment of pollutants and the recovery and utilization of valuable metal elements considering the economic benefit valuable metal elements in waste solution using as high value materials is increasingly emphasized as mentioned above chemical coagulation as the most widely used industrial treatment method will produce a large amount of sludge in view of the characteristics of sludge containing a large amount of calcium hydroxide the brick fired porcelain method has been widely used in research 132 however this method cannot completely solve the pollution problem of heavy metals because of secondary pollution problems such as volatilization and leaching of heavy metals 133 therefore the most widely industrial utilization method cannot effectively solve the pollution problem and difficult to realize the valuable metal elements in waste solution some technology for direct high value material utilization of valuable metal elements were developed in waste solution the key findings of which are summarized in table 7 3 3 1 direct preparation of high value layered double hydroxides ldhs materials from waste solution ldhs is the general name of hydrotalcite ht and hydrotalcite like compounds htlcs ldhs shows good application prospects in the fields of energy conversion and electrochemical energy storage such as secondary batteries and electrocatalysis using waste solution as raw material to directly prepare ldhs by real time synthesis method has attracted more and more attention the method for preparing ldhs is a simple process and it has significant economic benefits especially to obtain high value materials while processing waste solution the direct preparation of ldhs from waste solution has a certain general applicability and it can be prepared from waste solution containing ni cu cr zn and fe 134 135 htlcs material has strong adsorption capacity for anions and heavy metal pollutants the htlcs material prepared in situ from waste solution has been successfully applied to adsorb and remove contaminants such as i cu2 and zn2 for example cu based htlcs materials prepared from electroplating waste solution by using coprecipitation have good thermal and structural stability and achieve a saturated adsorption of iodide ions of 41 23mg g under the optimal conditions 136 wang et al 137 demonstrated that co precipitating as with zn and fe in wastewater to in situ form ldhs exhibited excellent potential for removal and direct stabilization of as iii miyata et al 138 discovered that htlcs can be used as new catalytic materials taylor et al 139 confirmed that ldhs after thermal decomposition can be used as a highly active catalyst and catalyst carrier so waste solution can be used as the raw material of catalyst to achieve higher value zhu et al 7 prepared graphene oxide nial layered double hydroxide composite go nial ldhs from electroless ni plating waste solution go nial ldhs has broad application prospects in methanol oxidation catalysts and supercapacitor electrode materials 3 3 2 direct high value materialization of metal element in waste solution as coating material electroplating electroless plating waste solution was used as raw material to directly prepare high value electrode materials by attaching metals to a substance through different methods huang et al 140 added naoh to the electroplating electroless plating waste solution to produce metal oxides which were directly deposited on m fe3o4 sio2 nanoparticles to prepare four pure magnetite catalysts m fe3o4 sio2 zno m fe3o4 sio2 cuo m fe3o4 sio2 fe2o3 and m fe3o4 sio2 nio fig 9a through the comparison of degradation experiments of methyl orange it was found that m fe3o4 sio2 zno processed the best catalytic performance and the methyl orange removal rate was 91 5 the heavy metals recovery rate reached more than 98 zhao et al 141 used electroplating waste solution as raw material and successfully prepared cu c core shell coaxial nanowires nws by a simple continuous flow wet chemical method fig 9b cu c nws modified electrode has a special role in conventional human serum samples glucose analysis or carbohydrate capillary electrophoresis chip detection which exhibit a high and reproducible sensitivity of 437 8 ma cm 2 mm 1 to glucose at 0 65 v jin et al 142 prepared carbon fiber mft cfs material coated with melamine resin modified by tetraheryl ethylene diamide as a new ni recovery method in electroless ni plating waste solution it was found that functional cf could selectively separate ni2 from the solution and nano ni coating carbon fiber ni mft cfs material was formed at the same time ni mft cfs material processed excellent electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation performance moreover jin et al 8 grafted melamine formaldehyde tetraoxalyl ethylenediamine chelating resin onto activated carbon mft ac and adsorbed pdcl2 sol on the mft ac and then immersed them into the electroless ni plating waste solution finally adding l ascorbic acid to synthesize nano ni through ultrasound to obtain a nano ni activated c composite material ni ac which displayed excellent catalysis for the ultrasonic degradation of 2 6 dcp with a degradation efficiency of 93 under the optimum conditions 3 3 3 other direct high value materialization of electroplating electroless plating waste solution technology in addition to the above two systematic technologies for direct preparation of high value materials from electroplating electroless plating waste solution there are some other technologies tsai et al 29 used chemical coagulation to directly prepare ni oh 2 with a size of approximately 0 5 μm from electroless ni plating waste solution by adjusting process parameters such as ph temperature reaction duration and agitation the prepared ni oh 2 included amorphous ni oh 2 and α ni oh 2 which is a good energy conversion material in ni based secondary batteries ni removal efficiency is more than 98 fu et al 143 used electroplating and steel pickling waste solution as raw materials and successfully prepared ni cu zn ferrite powder with cubic structure by hydrothermal method the ni cu zn ferrite is suitable for multilayer chip inductors because its μi is 168 from 1 khz to 10 mhz liu et al 144 used the untreated electroless ni plating waste solution as the source of phosphorus carbon and other doping ions li2co3 and fe2o3 were directly added to waste solution and dissolved mixed under mechanical stirring then the mixture was dried to obtain a precursor multi doped lifepo4 c was prepared by sintering the precursor at 650 c for 7 h in n2 atmosphere electrochemical tests showed that the multi doped lifepo4 c as lithium ion cathode material processed high capacity and excellent capacity retention on this basis liu 145 used fe powder as the fe source and electroless ni plating waste solution as the raw material of phosphorus carbon ni and other dopants and successfully synthesized multi doped lifepo4 c the material prepared by this method has comparable electrochemical performance with similar materials prepared from electroless ni plating waste solution and fe2o3 or ferrous oxalate in previous studies but it has more cheap and environmental protection in summary the treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution has entered a new node and people are paying more and more attention to the direct high value materialization of valuable metal resources however the development of related technologies to better protect the environment and save resources is still full of challenges a lot of research should focus on the remaining elements in the waste solution after the direct high value materialization utilization process which should be advanced treated in combination with the treatment methods of sections 3 1 and 3 2 4 future perspectives with the improvement of plating layer quality requirements the composition of electroplating electroless plating solution becomes more and more complicated as a result the types of pollutants in waste plating solution increase and treating waste solution with only one technology is difficult to simultaneously meet the requirements of economy environmental protection and resource recovery combined use of multiple methods with complementary advantages to treat electroplating electroless plating waste solutions showing great advantages has gradually become a development trend for examples electrolysis and electrodialysis are usually used in combination that is high concentration waste solution is treated by electrolysis to obtain low concentration solution and then electrodialysis is used and the concentrated solution obtained by electrodialysis can be returned to electrolysis process for treatment it avoids the low current efficiency and high energy consumption of electrolysis method to treat low concentration waste solution and membrane fouling of electrodialysis method to process high concentration solution the advantages of high recovery rate and high product purity of electrolysis method and the strong concentration ability of electrodialysis method are manifested additionally because they generally exist in stable complex state the valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution are difficult to separate and recover the combined method of first using the fenton reaction or electro oxidation method to break the complex and then combining with other methods to separate and recover the free metal ions should receive more attention for example fenton reagent electrolysis combination method can break citrate ni chelate in electroless ni plating waste solution by fenton reaction and recover ni by electrolysis process electro oxidation electrolysis combination method can degrade ni ammonia complexes ni nh3 n 2 1 n 6 in waste plating solution by electro oxidation method and reduce and recover ni2 by electrolysis method however the optimization and integration potential of the combination methods still need to be explored and further research is needed on the strengthening mechanism of the combination methods and the design of process parameters to make it more suitable for practical and efficient treatment of electroplating electroless plating waste solution the direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements in electroplating electroless plating waste solution is a promising way to effectively improve the economic benefits of waste solution treatment the technology may give new aspects that are currently required to be explored and the remaining elements in the waste solution after direct high value materialization utilization process should be advanced treated there may be a huge future opportunity to efficiently treat electroplating electroless plating waste solution in a cleaner green and economical way however it requires researchers to make more efforts to explore and research 5 conclusions a large amount of waste solution containing rich valuable metal elements is produced due to the rapid development of the electroplating electroless plating industry if waste solution cannot be effectively treated it will not only threaten human health and ecological environment but also cause a waste of valuable metal resources according to the purpose of the treatment of valuable metal elements in waste solution the current technology for processing electroplating electroless plating waste solution is mainly divided into three categories direct removal of valuable metal elements separation and recovery of valuable metal elements and direct high value materialization of valuable metal elements the valuable metal elements in waste solution can be effectively removed or separated and recovered by each electroplating electroless plating waste solution treatment technology however the single treatment technology has shortcomings and a lot of enhancement and improvement measures have been done to address these shortcomings according to the advantages and disadvantages of various methods multi method combined technology with complementary advantages has been developed to treat waste solution although there is still a lot of research to be done to direct high value materialization treatment of waste solution this method can achieve efficient utilization of valuable metal resources and increase the economic benefits of waste solution treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13126,as the world population increases and water resources diminish the recovery of wastewater has attracted the attention of researchers and government agencies besides the increasing amount of toxic pollutants in groundwater above the threshold raises questions about the efficiency of current wastewater treatments nickel rich wastewater in particular has a great contribution to the contamination of water bodies due to its wide application in the electroplating industry stainless steel manufacturing and storage battery industries its negative consequences are strongly related to human health inappropriate selection of metal removal technologies affects aspects of cost efficiency and sustainability therefore this review addresses the latest technologies 2017 2021 for treating nickel rich wastewater the techniques were divided into four categories physicochemical electrochemical bioremediation and others furthermore patents and economic aspects were discussed consequently this review sought to offer insights for developing new technologies with lower energy consumption and high removal efficiency allowing their commercialization graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heavy metal ions nickel ii removal nickel ii recovery wastewater treatment waste recycling 1 introduction the next generation could face global issues around unrestrained water consumption and industrial production the scarcity of drinking water is a consequence of the discharge of contaminants rich wastewater 1 about 2 20 of the chemicals containing heavy metals and other toxic substances are discarded after the electroplating process resulting in a worldwide issue 2 3 electroplating is widely used in various industrial segments the process covers the metal with a metallic layer by electrodeposition improving its physical appearance protecting against corrosion or altering surface properties however the acid pickling alkaline cleaning and rinsing steps result in solutions with a high concentration of heavy metals cyanides and sulfate complexes 4 besides nickel baths in the plated jewelry industry have been deactivated due to the allergenic potential of nickel requiring final disposal 5 national and international standards for maximum metal concentration in μg l 1 are stipulated based on the world health organization who and the united states environmental protection agency usepa 6 7 nevertheless heavy metals accumulate in the ecosystem contaminating the human body through food they cause several health effects such as respiratory damage including lung cancer diarrhea low blood pressure bone defects etc 8 10 furthermore exposure to metals alters enzymatic activity and biochemical processes 11 12 workers exposed to chromium and nickel may have altered blood glucose hemoglobin and serum creatinine 13 14 additionally the association of heavy metals can cause neurological disorders such as depression and alzheimer s disease 15 the result of high exposure was reported by chang et al 16 workers in an electroplating industry presented urine with a ni ii concentration of 1 74 22 73 μg l 1 recently environmental protection departments have imposed guidelines on wastewater discharge from electroplating nickel has greater attention due to its wide use as a protective coating against corrosion in the composition of stainless steel or metal alloys and composites 17 18 likewise it is also used in a decorative finish resulting in a glossy effect the total ni ii standard as per the water pollutants special discharge limit considers that the ni ii concentration did not exceed 0 1 ppm 19 therefore it is necessary to apply effective treatment processes that result in treated effluent and reuse water in this context furthermore simple operation methods and no need for on site maintenance are an impetus for the commercialization of wastewater treatment the choice of treatment method depends on the objective and financial budget for example electrochemical methods are known for their low consumption of chemical products and sludge production furthermore they promote the total mineralization of toxic pollutants 3 on the other hand despite sludge production the biological treatment stands out for its high efficiency and low operating cost in addition biofilms developed by microorganisms adsorb less soluble species in their cell walls allowing the treatment of large volumes of wastewater 20 21 in general the aim is to avoid slow processes that produce secondary effluent which require the addition of non reusable chemical products bleaches coagulants and polymers with issues of eliminating the excess sludge produced searches with the term electroplating industry wastewater in the last five years in the field of title abstract and keywords are shown in fig 1 they demonstrate the growing trend in addressing this topic of environmental interest that requires efficient and innovative solutions nickel recycling greatly contributes to the environmental preservation of mineral sites consumption of fuels electricity water and production cost savings in this way we discussed an overview of the different ni ii removal techniques most applied in the last five years besides important trends for research development were also addressed including patents no reviews are available on the removal or recovery of ni ii from the electroplating industry wastewater the discussion offers an opportunity to investigate techniques other than conventional ones and reveal unlimited future perspectives towards sustainability as illustrated in fig 2 the review was divided into four main technologies physicochemical electrochemical bioremediation and others the advantages and disadvantages of the main technologies covered in this review are listed in table 1 2 physicochemical processes the physicochemical treatment of effluents removes pollutants not removed by biological processes this type of treatment also reduces the organic load before biological treatment the use of chemical agents can modify the physical state of colloidal particles making them stable and coagulable furthermore the physical interaction between molecules by van der waals forces also allows the removal of contaminants this section discussed the removal methods that use these interactions as adsorption chemical precipitation membrane filtration and ion exchange although we discussed several studies with nanomaterials the key research area must be optimized at the nanoscale aiming at new materials and technologies for water remediation 2 1 adsorption the phenomenon in which molecules adhere to the surface of solid material through physical forces or chemical bonding is known as adsorption the technique has attracted attention due to its low cost easy operation and simple design in this context adsorbent materials are highly used to remove ni ii rich impurities 42 45 a ni ii removal mechanism was proposed by zhou et al 46 using an ion imprinting polymer layer through free radical polymerization loaded on silylated magnetic nanoparticles iicfmpss it occurred in three steps 1 complexation and electrostatic interaction by combining ni ii with hydroxyl groups present in iicfmpss 2 amino groups in acrylamide reacted with ni ii via complexation 3 by complexation and electrostatic interaction carboxyl groups on sodium acrylate increased the adsorption capacity of ni ii jimenez et al 47 used commercial sorbents to remove zn ii in nickel plated baths the presence of the metal results in black stains on the coating bone char was an efficient adsorbent without significant loss of ni 1 according to the molecular simulation the chemical structure of bone coal rich in hydroxyapatite composed of oh and po4 3 groups allowed the electrostatic interaction with the metal ions the removal of impurities from the bath avoids the generation of a large volume of effluent and a large amount of sludge joshiba et al 48 prepare amine containing silica magnetic nanosorbents to remove cu ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii the maximum adsorption capacity of the nanosorbent was 419 9 mg g 1 for cu ii 321 9 mg g 1 for ni ii 217 3 mg g 1 for cd ii and 137 6 mg g 1 for zn ii the freundlich model adjusted to the equilibrium data and indicated that the adsorption of metals depended on physisorption for example copper oxide nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm can also capture nickel ions in residual water 49 the optimum condition for the adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles was 15 4 mg g 1 the ni ii removal at neutral ph reached 76 and decreased with increasing initial concentration the langmuir isotherm indicated that the adsorption occurred in a monolayer described by the pseudo second order model the ability to use industrial waste as adsorbents to remove metals from electroplating wastewater has constantly been growing in adsorption studies the minimization of industrial waste occurs for the metal and the destination of the adsorbent de angelis et al 50 studied hydroxyapatite synthesized from eggshell residues to remove ni ii the phenomena presented during the process indicated a removal linked to the precipitation of phosphate containing ni ii and the ion exchange involved a ni ii removal rate of 91 was achieved over 80 min the adsorption of metals using sugarcane bagasse showed a strong interaction of metal ions with the adsorbent s lignin cellulose and hemicellulose components 51 the increase of ph contact time and concentration until the equilibrium stage favored the process ezeonuegbu et al 52 studied the effect of ni ii and pb ii adsorption using sugarcane bagasse the adsorption parameters were studied to obtain a greater removal of metals the ideal condition occurs at ph 5 0 30 c contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate 90 min with an adsorbent dosage of 0 5 g pb ii and ni ii removals were 89 31 and 96 33 respectively the ability of sugarcane to remove ni ii more efficiently was due to the electronic affinity linked to the ionic beam hydration energy and electrostatic forces that are more favorable for ni ii than pb ii several studies present adsorption as the main process for removing heavy metals especially ni ii from electroplating wastewater 53 55 most report that a component in the adsorbent with ionic affinity with ni ii increases the removal capacity for example peng et al 56 and zhao et al 57 used calcium sources to improve the adsorption of ni ii in their adsorbents the first used calcined electroplating sludge and the second used hydrated calcium silicate as an adsorbent in both studies a large amount of calcium in the adsorbents played a fundamental role in the process of ni ii adsorption via cation exchange as a result ni ii removals in high concentrations of electroplating wastewater were efficient however they did not analyze the selective effect with other metals jeon et al 58 studied the ni ii removal efficiency of electroplating wastewater containing high sodium content the powdered sericite was immobilized using the sodium alginate trapping method this concept did not provide na ions with influence on the ni ii removal it did not generate competitiveness among them acting more selectively to remove up to 95 of ni ii in the solution in the continuous process using a fixed bed column to the authors immobilized sericite can be essential in selecting ni ii removal lee et al 59 also used a fixed bed column based on a fe2o3 carbon foam for the adsorption of cr ii cu ii and ni ii however ni ii had the lowest removal rate among the three metals analyzed about three times lower than cr ii although adsorption is a convenient technique for removing ni ii at high concentrations studies did not report using the technique for small concentrations the use of biochars also has high removal efficiencies biofertilizer provides high porosity surface area metal affinity surface modifications stability recyclability and safe disposal 60 in addition the combination of porous algae biochar and ferric oxide demonstrated a synergistic adsorption effect serving as an efficient and recyclable ni ii removal agent 61 according to yan et al 62 the strong removal capacity combining pre precipitation and adsorption indicated that the ni ii adsorption mechanisms of biochar were mainly related to ion exchange adsorption and complexation between metal ions and surface functional groups of the biochar the scale up criteria for adsorption involve the following considerations kept constant 1 geometric similarity the relationship between column height and diameter 2 kinematic similarity physical properties of the solution in the columns 3 dynamic similarity particle size porosity and linear velocities in the columns residence time and space velocity can also be kept constant 63 2 2 chemical precipitation in general metals precipitate in the form of metal hydroxides the reaction takes place as the ph is adjusted the difficulty in precipitating metals occurs when the solution has several metallic species due to the similarities of the metals concerning the solubility curves versus ph generating a large amount of sludge is a disadvantage of the technique the sludge impairs management transport as well as its final disposition when ni ii ions are removed from residual solutions by chemical precipitation the complexing agent in the solution prevents the ion from remaining dispersed in the solution and chemically bonding with the binding agent to form an insoluble precipitate 64 after leaching a solution containing ni ii and al iii razavian et al 65 separated the two metals using excessive amounts of sodium hydroxide as a precipitating agent separating the al and ni precipitates at different phs for ph 1 eq 1 was predominant and blue flakes were observed on the solution s surface with the increase of ph to 7 the formation of the ni precipitate was more evident following the stoichiometry of eq 2 however the most effective separation for the nickel hydroxide was obtained at ph 14 verifying the formation of green solids in the lower part of the solution while the blue flakes dissolved 1 al 2 so 4 3 6 naoh 2 al oh 3 3 na 2 so 4 2 niso 4 2 naoh ni oh 2 na 2 so 4 tanong et al 66 recovered metals from a pregnant leach solution the wastewater contained zn ii mn ii cd ii co ii and ni ii ions except for ni ii the removal occurred by electrodeposition and solvent extraction ni ii removal occurred by chemical precipitation using sodium carbonate as precipitating agent both studies present the ni ii chemical precipitation as a simple technique without specific variable control however some authors explore ways to expand the concepts and applications of the technique four oligoethylenamine dithiocarbamates oedtc were used in chemical precipitation to remove cu ii ni ii and zn ii from acidic residual water from electroplating 25 four oedtc showed high ni ii and zn ii removal generating an effluent with residual concentrations of 0 003 0 008 and 0 021 0 046 mg l 1 respectively scanning electron microscope micrographs indicated compact particles besides the sludge produced had the potential to be recycled hydroxide precipitants reduce the wastewater ph and the ni ii concentration making the precipitation process difficult in this way new precipitants seek to maintain a constant ph level ensuring high efficiency wang et al 67 used silica xerogel containing amine as a precipitating solid the greenish precipitate showed characteristics to be used as a glass dye composed of amorphous ni oh 2 nanosheets the precipitating solid was collected and reused for two more cycles the ni ii removal was high reaching 99 34 99 65 its removal can also occur by sulfide precipitation jerroumi et al 68 performed tests in a perfectly agitated batch reactor the authors analyzed ph molar ratio s ii ni ii and dosage of s ii ions ni ii removal reached 91 for industrial wastewater with ph 5 and an equimolar ratio of 1 1 the characterized solid sludge was constituted in greater proportion by millerite nis and nickel oxide nio according to eq 4 4 nis s 3 2 o 2 g nio s s o 2 g the circular economy concept can be applied in a ni waste to energy cycle in this way recovered hydroxides can act as energetic materials the formation of amorphous ni oh 2 and α ni oh 2 was improved in the presence of ligand ions such as cl nh3 and c6h5o7 3 which acted as stabilizers and improved the conductivity of the electroplating wastewater 69 with the addition of 3 m naoh and the presence of the ligands several hydroxides were obtained from ph 12 and the ni oh 2 precipitation occurs in four forms eqs 5 6 7 and 8 the analysis of the precipitation temperature resulted in a high ni ii removal of 98 3 at 50 c as shown in fig 3 5 ni h 2 o 6 2 2 oh ni oh 2 s 6 h 2 o 6 ni nh 3 6 2 2 oh ni oh 2 s 6 n h 3 7 nicl 2 oh ni oh 2 s cl 8 ni c 6 h 5 o 7 2 oh ni oh 2 s c 6 h 5 o 7 3 although chemical precipitation is more economical and commonly used to treat industrial effluents containing ni ii and or other metals the process can become ineffective in the presence of strong complexing agents besides the high buffer capacity provided by complexing agents requires excessive amounts of chemicals to neutralize alkalinity 66 69 70 a partial similarity must be applied to scale up a chemical precipitation process resulting in a reduced number of similarity criteria crucial for the process 71 an analysis of time constants identifies minor and large scale by products and provides information on unnecessary requirements a physical model employing computational fluid dynamics can predict the effect of scaling up and optimize the process 2 3 membrane filtration among the ni ii removal techniques membrane filtration is one of the most selective whose main characteristic is to provide a selection of the components based on the diameter of the membrane pores scale up experiments determine filter capacity based on the maximum filtrate volume needed to block the filter 72 small scale tests aim to assess the impact on product quality and underpin the large scale filtration process basic aspects such as batch volume process time and filtration flow must be evaluated besides filter encrustation must be considered process dependent therefore the tests must take place with a constant flow rate the processes related to membrane filtration are separated into reverse osmosis ultrafiltration nanofiltration and electrodialysis in reverse osmosis a semipermeable membrane is used which separates the pollutant allowing only the passage of purified fluid the method removes various species and is widely used in the desalination process at low pressures membranes whose pores are larger than metal ions are used to remove dissolved and colloidal materials the process is known as ultrafiltration the combination of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis is known as nanofiltration which combines a high removal rate with low energy consumption combining the better of the other two techniques as it is an electrochemical technique where the passage of potential in a membrane promotes the removal of components electrodialysis has shown itself to be promising in the field of metal removal and will be discussed later 73 in several membrane filtration technologies simpler design low space occupation and high removal efficiency are sought to target an industrial application noor et al 74 studied the removal capacity of sayong ball clay sbc membrane powder for ni ii removal from industrial wastewater they confirmed that the membrane was effective for removal in three different grinding times 10 20 and 30 h with rates removal of 88 87 82 96 and 85 13 respectively although removal occurs under all conditions the determining factor for the test with a shorter grinding time to have the higher removal rate was the smaller average pore diameter 2 44 nm resulting in a greater surface area 5 41 m2 g 1 therefore a greater surface area of the membrane exposed to ni ii represents a greater probability of removal the feasibility of choosing filtration membranes for heavy metal removal is also associated with their stability and number of operating cycles during the process studies with supported liquid membranes stand out due to the stability of their structure according to raja sulaiman et al 75 the palm oil in the supported liquid membrane showed a high potential for ni ii removal with values of 91 at a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 feed flow the process remained stable for 10 cycles even with high flow confirming the stability proposal the process was considered environmentally friendly for liquid membrane systems supported by ni ii removal zhang et al 76 studied the mechanical parameters of a rotating disk membrane used to remove ni ii through the complexation ultrafiltration process sodium polyacrylate used as a filtering and complexing agent presented a 99 5 ni ii removal the removal rate was due to the rotation speed control which remained stable up to 3000 rpm regardless of the ph change thus the radial pressure distribution and the shear rate on the membrane surface remained stable in forming polymer metal complexes a modern membrane filtration technology is the adsorptive membrane it is an efficient method due to the simultaneous use of surface adsorption and the structural property of the filtration membrane compared to conventional methods the adsorptive membrane presents lower energy consumption and ease of scale up 77 78 bisheh et al 79 studied the modification of polyethersulfone to a multilayer adsorptive membrane with alginate chitosan and porous organic polymer according to the authors the variable that most influenced the increase of ni ii and pb ii removal was ph the removal rate increased from 1 to 6 as the ph increased due to the formation of metal oxides on the other hand in acidic environments there was a competition between metals and h ions due to the protonation of amine groups reducing the rate of adsorption of metal ions li et al 80 proposed a hybrid filtration membrane formed by a complex structure containing polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with polyacrylic acid paa protection and zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 particles zif 8 on the surface two distinct processes contributed to the ni ii removal 1 the strong interaction between ni ii and the hydroxyl structure of zif 8 2 electrostatic adsorption by carboxyl groups in the paa layers regarding the simultaneous process zif 8 showed greater selectivity in binding to ni ii making this study a valuable reference on ultrafiltration membranes designed for high selectivity of ni ii the ni ii removal by membrane filtration can be improved through particles that increase the adsorption rate and variations in the solution conditions 2 4 ion exchange the ion exchange mechanism involves exchanging an ion in the solution for a similar charge ion attached to a solid and immobile material 81 the studies highlight that the immobilized material must present easy separation high sorption capacity low operating cost and ecological advantages 82 amino functionalized biochar mgfealo4 composites removed ni ii by ion exchange 83 biochar derived from composite coated rice bran had a sorption rate of 76 51 ni ii due to the ability of iron to facilitate magnetic separation of ni ii its removal also occurred due to the complexation of ni ii with amino carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups present in the biochar gorokhovsky et al 84 reported that the dosage of 6 7 g of potassium polytitanate ppt powder formed a differentiated structure after ion exchange with ni ii ions intercalated between the ppt layers the solid product showed the formation of nanoscale complexes of ni containing oxy cations the modified solid showed a large surface area with excellent photocatalytic activity in the visible range of solar radiation making it useful for purifying dye contaminated water hydrogels and resins have a decisive role in removing metals by ion exchange the anionic magnetic hydrogel for electroplating waste treatment is a viable option considering its performance as an adsorbent including insensitivity to ph fast kinetic adsorption high reuse potential and efficiency in magnetic separation 99 85 its main removal mechanism on the surface is by ion exchange li et al 86 developed a magnetic cation exchange resin the material was developed to efficiently remove cu ii and ni ii ions presenting a uniform grain diameter of 80 150 μm and good magnetic characteristics facilitating the ion agglomeration on its surface its maximum removal was highly ph dependent 4 0 6 0 showing that the resin s electronic affinity with ni ii ions outperformed its competitiveness with h ions in solution in general chelating ion exchange resins are copolymers that can form coordinated bonds with metal ions amino groups provide nitrogen electron pairs for ions forming covalent bonds 87 88 ma et al 89 modeled a new na h dual exchange chelating resin to remove ni ii ions in a fixed bed column ion exchanger containing iminodiacetic acid functional groups however h ions led to competitive protonation reducing the ability to remove ni ii in addition na ions resulted in the precipitation of nickel hydroxide promoting the clogging of the ion exchange column the study highlights the importance of predicting the na h mix ratio from the bed feed for better ion exchange performance resulting in a high ni ii removal rate the great challenge of these studies is linked to maintaining the high selectivity for partial removal of ions with a lower operational cost 3 electrochemical technologies electrochemical methods are based on oxidoreduction reactions they are more active and efficient compared to conventional technologies 3 furthermore they do not require chemical products for effective wastewater treatment this section approaches electrocoagulation electroflotation electrodeposition and electrodialysis 3 1 electrocoagulation electrocoagulation is based on the electrochemical method of electrolysis for the treatment of effluents the oxidation of metallic electrodes is responsible for the formation of the coagulating agent without the need to add chemical compounds to promote coagulation the released ions neutralize the charges of the polluting particles initiating electrocoagulation since the process occurs through the oxidation of metallic anodes the treatment uses more compact equipment is simple to operate versatile and with good receptivity to automation 90 91 determining the kinetic constant in the process is essential for scaling up in this way stable operational criteria ensure that electrocoagulation is controlled by the particle coagulation rate rather than the availability of ions 92 the advantages of electrocoagulation allow the use of reactors that favor removal due to the efficient monitoring and control of variables 93 moersidik et al 94 removed 99 75 ni ii from wastewater rich in metal and chemical oxygen demand cod under optimal operating conditions the reactor consisted of 12 aluminum plates inside the ideal condition with a current density of 20 ma cm 2 ph 10 and 60 min of contact time favored the ability to obtain coagulated nickel complexes the increase of ph increased the ni ii removal efficiency with hydroxide precipitation second order kinetics showed a constant reaction rate of 0 1783 l mg min resulting in an overall reactor efficiency of 41 although cod required secondary treatment high metal removal met jakarta government quality standards other processes can occur along with electrocoagulation for example huang et al 95 studied the mechanism for removing ni ii cu ii and cr iv in wastewater by electrocoagulation the langmuir isotherm described the adsorption of ni ii and cu ii by the coagulant al oh 3 however for cr iv adsorption the freundlich isotherm showed the most suitable fit in the treatment of ni ii and cu ii ions both competed for the active site of al oh 3 and cu ii suppressed the adsorption of ni ii thus for the treatment of a single metal the mechanism of removing by electrocoagulation was the adsorption reaction on the other hand liu et al 96 used a stainless steel plate with a polypyrrole ppy coating to obtain the ni ii removal by electrocoagulation the ppy anode also prevented anodic corrosion process optimization took place at ph 4 current density 30 ma cm 2 lasting 70 min as a result the ni ii removal efficiency reached 80 besides the smooth and homogeneous surface of ppy as a protective coating resulted in a corrosion inhibition efficiency of 30 even after 10 batches of electrocoagulation these associations with other techniques demonstrate the flexibility of electrocoagulation in industrial applications 3 2 electroflotation electroflotation generates bubbles in an aqueous medium by electrolysis the arrangement of the grids to provide good coverage in the flotation tank area allows uniform mixing of the wastewater and gas bubbles the gas evolution process can be divided into three physical processes nucleation growth and detachment nucleation occurs on electrode surfaces usually in highly saturated solutions bubbles are detached from the electrode by buoyancy forces or liquid shear forces regarding the formation of the sizes of the bubbles the predominant and limiting factors for its application are the nature of the electrode and its location in the electromotive series 73 these bubble evolution stages leave operating conditions gas production and residence time easily controlled mainly using low voltage 97 hoseinian et al 98 treated ni rich wastewater in an oscillating grid flotation cell the authors evaluated the effects of hydrodynamic parameters such as energy input bubble size and surfactant concentration the increase in energy input from 0 to 2 w kg 1 increased the ni ii removal rate by 80 due to increased collision of larger bubbles and ideal flotation rate for smaller bubbles the results indicated that ion flotation was appropriate for ni ii removal in a period with high kinetic removal other parameters such as chemical interactions water entrainment in the foam phase and separation mechanisms are also important 99 they are evaluated by changing the ph concentration of the collector ionic strength others 3 3 electrodeposition electrodeposition involves depositing the metal in the solid state occurring in a potentiostatic or galvanostatic way design for scale up electrochemical reactors is controlled based on mass transfer at the electrode surface the concentration of metallic ions decreases on the surface of the cathode fick s law describes the mass flux of metallic ions the electrochemical conversion with diffusive mass transport in the electrode results from the removal of metal ions by the applied current density dimensionless numbers like reynolds sherwood and schmidt reduce the number of variables to determine mass transfer 100 table 2 shows the studies of the last five years that aimed to remove ni ii from wastewater by electrodeposition studies obtained metallic alloys besides ni ii removal adding another metal source in the electrolytic bath 101 102 studies on contaminant removal generally demonstrated high efficiencies above 90 103 105 li et al 104 combined fixed bed resin adsorption with further reduction by electrodeposition after adsorption on two columns the effluent concentration was less than 0 1 mg l 1 the removal was 95 6 in the electrodeposition tests recovering elementary nickel the study suggested that combining the techniques is a viable and cost effective way to replace chemical precipitation 3 4 electrodialysis applying a potential difference to a semipermeable membrane can promote the chemical separation of components in a solution the process known as electrodialysis excels at removing ions from wastewater due to its continuous operation not requiring the addition of chemical reagents 108 according to the illustration in fig 4 it is one of the most economical recent technologies with the advantage of producing reuse water removing metal ions in low concentrations 109 besides scaling inhibitors are added allowing the treated water to become a reusable industrial product according to benvenuti et al 110 electrodialysis applied to an ionic exchange membrane cationic ionac mc 3470 and anionic ionac ma 3475 of 16 cm2 achieved a ni ii removal rate of 95 obtaining clean water of reuse with conductivity close to tapping water 200 ms cm 1 demonstrating a good quality in the bench scale recovery water transferring the study to an industrial scale the reuse of the concentrated flux saved 20 of chemical products for the nickel bath 111 water reuse indicated a reduction of 150 m3 year 1 in water consumption this value impacted the reduction of chemical products needed to treat it making the financial process more viable another commercial membrane combined with electrodialysis has been approached to reduce the ni ii concentration to less than 0 1 mg l 1 103 the combination of electrodialysis with ruthenium iridium sintered titanium plate indicated that the initial ni ii concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 in the anolyte and catholyte was reduced to 0 015 and 0 085 mg l 1 respectively with the initial ni ii concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 meeting the strict discharge standard of 0 1 mg l 1 in addition electrodeposition of ni ii at the cathode increased the migration of ni ii in the electrolytes decreasing energy consumption however excessive energy consumption is still a major impediment to expanding the process on an industrial scale in addition to membrane related problems such as scale and low lifetime 112 4 bioremediation bioremediation treats wastewater through biological processes of transformation degradation and contaminant removal its merits are high efficiency easy handling and cost effectiveness 113 114 microalgae and anaerobic bioreactors have widely been used to remove effluents 4 1 microalgae the release of untreated wastewater containing biotoxic substances such as heavy metals is an environmental and health challenge facing our community recent advances in removal microbiology have propelled bioremediation as a better and more effective alternative to conventional techniques 115 microalgae act by biosorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation in the remediation of pollutants 116 the removal of organic molecules aromatic compounds and pesticides occur by biosorption it is a passive process where the microalgae biomass has retention properties on the surface which allows bioadsorption of substances 117 118 in the biosorption mechanism the biomass type determines the binding mechanisms of the metal and metabolic processes occur in the cell wall 119 bioaccumulation is an active process where biomass metabolizes nutrients through surfaces 120 organic and inorganic pollutants are transferred into the cells of microorganisms decreasing their concentrations in aqueous solutions 121 likewise biodegradation consists of removing pollutants with the aid of microorganisms microalgae convert organic matter into small molecules used as nutrients for their growth 122 zhou et al 123 studied a rotating algae biofilm rab reactor for the ni ii removal from high strength industrial wastewater the growth of indigenous microalgae through ni ii consumption reached a removal rate above 90 to the authors the algae derived from rab were more robust and resistant to ni ii exposure maintaining the integrity of cell membranes for comparison purposes fig 5 a shows that rab reactors had higher ni ii removal efficiency than bubble columns under all conditions studied fig 5 b displays that the removal rate by the rab reactors was also superior to bubble columns the study demonstrated an important advance in using microalgae for more robust equipment like a rotary reactor 4 2 anaerobic bioreactors the high operational cost the need for secondary treatment energy consumption or the generation of secondary effluents make the techniques known as traditional adsorption filtration precipitation flotation of ions limited 124 biological treatment becomes a low cost environmentally friendly and efficient remediation technology in this context besides it can treat effluents with high organic loads allowing methane management 125 126 parades aguilar et al 127 evaluated the ni ii removal from industrial wastewater in an upflow anaerobic sludge bioreactor uasb containing zeolite inoculated with anaerobic sludge the ni ii removal rate reached 99 for the 250 500 ppm concentration range the high rate of alkalinity and biogas production confirmed the activity of microbial metabolism also the sequencing of the 16s rrna genes indicated that the bacterial genera treponema ruminococcus syntrophobacter dorea kosmotoga and clostridium represented an abundance between 10 and 50 in the bioreactor the absence of the genera fervidobacterium and geobacter at the end of the treatment suggested that they had a fundamental role in the ni ii biological removal at the beginning of the treatment biomass from cyanobacteria was effective in removing ni ii and pb ii 128 the batch reactor operated at ph 7 temperature between 25 and 45 c promoted the biosorption between ni ii and the biomass in a short time of 15 min with a biomass concentration of 0 1 g l 1 ni ii removal reached 92 57 showing a strong adsorption interaction of ni ii with the cyanobacteria biomass although anaerobic bioreactors have several advantages biological conversion is dependent on the scale that occurs in conjunction with the transfer of heat mass and momentum behaving differently on a small scale compared to an industrial scale 129 the increase in scale implies an increase in the height of the reactor and a reduction in cross section concerning the volume retaining biogas and decreasing treatment efficiency in general negative scaling effects can be avoided by considering the pilot scale application of the full scale reactor height the same cross sectional area volume ratio and identical gas velocities 4 2 1 treatment of electroplating sludge electroplating sludge contains a large amount of heavy metals which must be preferably treated using easy removal techniques melting is a common solidification treatment that concentrates and encapsulates heavy metals in a glass matrix to yue et al 130 the melting process with fly ash from solid waste incineration led to the volatilization of heavy metals in the form of chlorine salts with different volatilization rates for different metals zn 33 pb 96 cu 33 cd 79 cr 81 and ni 31 the co pyrolysis process makes full use of two raw materials creating a synergy contributing to higher density greater specific surface area pore volumes and more active functional groups 131 metal leaching can be performed with biochar ecological fixatives along with iron sulfide 132 co pyrolysis biochar is the most prominent technique in the immobilization of metals in electroplating sludge reaching up to an immobilization rate of up to 98 for various metals sun et al 133 used a sophisticated microwave pyrolysis treatment to improve sludge immobilization however the immobilization rate was lower than that of the biochar reaching 75 of immobilization 4 2 2 perspectives on sludge resources recovery although electroplating has an important cost benefit ratio due to the extension of metallic structures this process generates solid residues with high concentrations of metals known as electroplating sludge the recovery of electroplating sludge can be explored as an economic and environmental assessment studies present the circular economy as a practical efficient and effective solution for the recovery of metallic residues in the electroplating process 112 134 in a metal co melting process used for wastewater sludge treatment a total of 3 to 5 of the by product in the co melting process referred to as secondary fly ash was produced by the flue gas cleaning system 130 the concentration of pb and zn in secondary fly ash has almost reached the required grade of some lead zinc ore which can be used directly in the foundry industry as metal recycling is highly valued in electrochemical processes the use of copper slag on cathodic carbon promotes an extremely complex electroplating sludge removal containing ni cu cr and fe promoting a high recovery of these metals forming solid compounds 135 although they have not yet evolved from pilot to industrial scale in the case of electrodialysis advances in antifouling membranes and electrode materials could boost their development furthermore further increase in electrode life can be achieved by using advanced coatings such as mixed metal oxide and magnéli phase tino2n 1 materials 136 5 comparison of processes and combined processes comparison of ni ii removal processes is common in wastewater treatment studies 137 138 yasar et al 139 compared the removal of heavy metals ni ii cr ii cu ii and cd ii by physicochemical processes coagulation and flocculation and ozone oxidation ozone treatment indicated removing 42 of ni ii and 26 of cr ii on the other hand aluminum sulfate as a coagulant in combination with polyacrylamide polymer achieved 99 and 98 removal of ni ii and cr ii therefore more efficient than ozone oxidation additionally the combination of processes has been widely used they may involve electrocoagulation and advanced oxidative process 94 adsorption and electrodeposition 104 electrodialysis and electrodeposition 140 pre precipitation with fenton precipitation 141 fe activated carbon microelectrolysis coupled with h2o2 142 integrated chelation and flocculation 143 shear induced dissociation and ultrafiltration 144 and fenton oxidation combined with recycled ferrite process 145 mardiyono et al 146 used electrocoagulation as the initial treatment of electroplating effluent subsequently bioremediation with bacillus subtilis removed ni ii at a maximum rate of 85 61 the combination of treatment techniques aims to maximize its efficiency and depends on simplicity rate removal and cost effectiveness besides the combination of two techniques allows treatment of the waste generated in the first technique resulting in high utilization and generation of by products and waste minimization 6 other techniques alternative techniques have been used to remove heavy metals from wastewater from electroplating for example zhou et al 142 recovered phosphorus and removed nickel simultaneously via iron activated carbon and hydrogen peroxide the isothermal reaction resulted in the recovery of 99 99 of p the ni precipitation at high ph and its adsorption in iron hydroxides and activated carbon resulted in a high removal of 89 bacillus subtilis and organophosphate monoesters were used to remove ni ii from wastewater using a biomineralization method resulting in nickel phosphate octahydrate 147 the ni ii removal efficiency was 76 41 for 0 02 mol of organophosphorus monoester and 2 g of bacillus subtilis powder the reaction was maintained at ph 6 at 25 c with a holding time of 36 h processes involving washings were also reported 148 149 chelating oxime lix63 and organophosphorus transporters d2ehpa synergistically removed ni ii 148 the synergism of d2ehpa octanol was also studied for ni ii removal by solvent extraction and indicated a technique for future applications 149 the electroplating wastewater freezing and crystallization method showed a 77 1 ni ii melt water removal rate after gravity separation for 5 min 150 this melting ice removal rate after gravity separation lasting 18 h was 97 9 besides the study demonstrated that the ni ii removal was directly proportional to weight loss after the dehydration process therefore a longer dehydration time in the centrifuge increases the removal capacity during dehydration 7 economic aspects and patents cost reduction is a crucial factor in wastewater treatment in this context adsorption and precipitation continue as the most common techniques due to easy operation regenerability low cost energy consumption and environmental protection representing industrial application through patents on ni ii removal 151 152 chen 151 invented a ni ii removal method using potassium ferrate trivalent ferric ions acted as complexing agents to isolate and remove ni ii after adding polyacrylamide to coagulate and precipitate the metal the electrochemical techniques also stand out in terms of the economic aspect mainly with the combined use of the mentioned techniques and low ni ii concentrations electrodialysis was essential to recovering ni ii from boric acid as a catalyst in ultrasound assisted electrolysis 153 the method had the advantage of producing reused water a ni ii removal system used an electrolysis device depositing ni ii at the cathode 154 its recycling occurred by adding limestone and calcium chloride compounds to reach a ph of 8 9 forming orthophosphite citrate and tartrate anions these products resulted in calcium precipitation the solid material was removed by filtration according to wang et al 140 the use of a conductive graphite adhesive cga resin as an electrode for capacitive deionization cdi removed ni ii with decreasing concentration from 0 095 g l 1 to 0 005 g l 1 consuming 1 6 kw h 1 per ton of wastewater besides the electrodes regeneration and the electrolytic performance of the cga resin remained stable during the cycle the spent electrodes were electrochemically regenerated as illustrated in fig 6 8 conclusion this review addressed recent advances in ni ii removal from electroplating industry wastewater over the last five years while water recovery is a niche scarcity of resources will pressure the world to use environmentally friendly technologies to remove contaminants future research should focus on lowering the cost of systems high efficiencies and developing intelligent systems all techniques have advantages and their uses depend on their feasibility most studies reported batch and bench scale systems therefore continuous system and pilot scale studies are needed to demonstrate industrial applications besides real wastewater should be studied more than synthetic effluent investigating the true interaction of the technology with the compounds in the solution likewise research should focus on commercializing techniques in the field of contaminant removal leading to the development of the next generation of wastewater treatment in a sustainable

13126,as the world population increases and water resources diminish the recovery of wastewater has attracted the attention of researchers and government agencies besides the increasing amount of toxic pollutants in groundwater above the threshold raises questions about the efficiency of current wastewater treatments nickel rich wastewater in particular has a great contribution to the contamination of water bodies due to its wide application in the electroplating industry stainless steel manufacturing and storage battery industries its negative consequences are strongly related to human health inappropriate selection of metal removal technologies affects aspects of cost efficiency and sustainability therefore this review addresses the latest technologies 2017 2021 for treating nickel rich wastewater the techniques were divided into four categories physicochemical electrochemical bioremediation and others furthermore patents and economic aspects were discussed consequently this review sought to offer insights for developing new technologies with lower energy consumption and high removal efficiency allowing their commercialization graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords heavy metal ions nickel ii removal nickel ii recovery wastewater treatment waste recycling 1 introduction the next generation could face global issues around unrestrained water consumption and industrial production the scarcity of drinking water is a consequence of the discharge of contaminants rich wastewater 1 about 2 20 of the chemicals containing heavy metals and other toxic substances are discarded after the electroplating process resulting in a worldwide issue 2 3 electroplating is widely used in various industrial segments the process covers the metal with a metallic layer by electrodeposition improving its physical appearance protecting against corrosion or altering surface properties however the acid pickling alkaline cleaning and rinsing steps result in solutions with a high concentration of heavy metals cyanides and sulfate complexes 4 besides nickel baths in the plated jewelry industry have been deactivated due to the allergenic potential of nickel requiring final disposal 5 national and international standards for maximum metal concentration in μg l 1 are stipulated based on the world health organization who and the united states environmental protection agency usepa 6 7 nevertheless heavy metals accumulate in the ecosystem contaminating the human body through food they cause several health effects such as respiratory damage including lung cancer diarrhea low blood pressure bone defects etc 8 10 furthermore exposure to metals alters enzymatic activity and biochemical processes 11 12 workers exposed to chromium and nickel may have altered blood glucose hemoglobin and serum creatinine 13 14 additionally the association of heavy metals can cause neurological disorders such as depression and alzheimer s disease 15 the result of high exposure was reported by chang et al 16 workers in an electroplating industry presented urine with a ni ii concentration of 1 74 22 73 μg l 1 recently environmental protection departments have imposed guidelines on wastewater discharge from electroplating nickel has greater attention due to its wide use as a protective coating against corrosion in the composition of stainless steel or metal alloys and composites 17 18 likewise it is also used in a decorative finish resulting in a glossy effect the total ni ii standard as per the water pollutants special discharge limit considers that the ni ii concentration did not exceed 0 1 ppm 19 therefore it is necessary to apply effective treatment processes that result in treated effluent and reuse water in this context furthermore simple operation methods and no need for on site maintenance are an impetus for the commercialization of wastewater treatment the choice of treatment method depends on the objective and financial budget for example electrochemical methods are known for their low consumption of chemical products and sludge production furthermore they promote the total mineralization of toxic pollutants 3 on the other hand despite sludge production the biological treatment stands out for its high efficiency and low operating cost in addition biofilms developed by microorganisms adsorb less soluble species in their cell walls allowing the treatment of large volumes of wastewater 20 21 in general the aim is to avoid slow processes that produce secondary effluent which require the addition of non reusable chemical products bleaches coagulants and polymers with issues of eliminating the excess sludge produced searches with the term electroplating industry wastewater in the last five years in the field of title abstract and keywords are shown in fig 1 they demonstrate the growing trend in addressing this topic of environmental interest that requires efficient and innovative solutions nickel recycling greatly contributes to the environmental preservation of mineral sites consumption of fuels electricity water and production cost savings in this way we discussed an overview of the different ni ii removal techniques most applied in the last five years besides important trends for research development were also addressed including patents no reviews are available on the removal or recovery of ni ii from the electroplating industry wastewater the discussion offers an opportunity to investigate techniques other than conventional ones and reveal unlimited future perspectives towards sustainability as illustrated in fig 2 the review was divided into four main technologies physicochemical electrochemical bioremediation and others the advantages and disadvantages of the main technologies covered in this review are listed in table 1 2 physicochemical processes the physicochemical treatment of effluents removes pollutants not removed by biological processes this type of treatment also reduces the organic load before biological treatment the use of chemical agents can modify the physical state of colloidal particles making them stable and coagulable furthermore the physical interaction between molecules by van der waals forces also allows the removal of contaminants this section discussed the removal methods that use these interactions as adsorption chemical precipitation membrane filtration and ion exchange although we discussed several studies with nanomaterials the key research area must be optimized at the nanoscale aiming at new materials and technologies for water remediation 2 1 adsorption the phenomenon in which molecules adhere to the surface of solid material through physical forces or chemical bonding is known as adsorption the technique has attracted attention due to its low cost easy operation and simple design in this context adsorbent materials are highly used to remove ni ii rich impurities 42 45 a ni ii removal mechanism was proposed by zhou et al 46 using an ion imprinting polymer layer through free radical polymerization loaded on silylated magnetic nanoparticles iicfmpss it occurred in three steps 1 complexation and electrostatic interaction by combining ni ii with hydroxyl groups present in iicfmpss 2 amino groups in acrylamide reacted with ni ii via complexation 3 by complexation and electrostatic interaction carboxyl groups on sodium acrylate increased the adsorption capacity of ni ii jimenez et al 47 used commercial sorbents to remove zn ii in nickel plated baths the presence of the metal results in black stains on the coating bone char was an efficient adsorbent without significant loss of ni 1 according to the molecular simulation the chemical structure of bone coal rich in hydroxyapatite composed of oh and po4 3 groups allowed the electrostatic interaction with the metal ions the removal of impurities from the bath avoids the generation of a large volume of effluent and a large amount of sludge joshiba et al 48 prepare amine containing silica magnetic nanosorbents to remove cu ii cd ii zn ii and ni ii the maximum adsorption capacity of the nanosorbent was 419 9 mg g 1 for cu ii 321 9 mg g 1 for ni ii 217 3 mg g 1 for cd ii and 137 6 mg g 1 for zn ii the freundlich model adjusted to the equilibrium data and indicated that the adsorption of metals depended on physisorption for example copper oxide nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm can also capture nickel ions in residual water 49 the optimum condition for the adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles was 15 4 mg g 1 the ni ii removal at neutral ph reached 76 and decreased with increasing initial concentration the langmuir isotherm indicated that the adsorption occurred in a monolayer described by the pseudo second order model the ability to use industrial waste as adsorbents to remove metals from electroplating wastewater has constantly been growing in adsorption studies the minimization of industrial waste occurs for the metal and the destination of the adsorbent de angelis et al 50 studied hydroxyapatite synthesized from eggshell residues to remove ni ii the phenomena presented during the process indicated a removal linked to the precipitation of phosphate containing ni ii and the ion exchange involved a ni ii removal rate of 91 was achieved over 80 min the adsorption of metals using sugarcane bagasse showed a strong interaction of metal ions with the adsorbent s lignin cellulose and hemicellulose components 51 the increase of ph contact time and concentration until the equilibrium stage favored the process ezeonuegbu et al 52 studied the effect of ni ii and pb ii adsorption using sugarcane bagasse the adsorption parameters were studied to obtain a greater removal of metals the ideal condition occurs at ph 5 0 30 c contact time between adsorbent and adsorbate 90 min with an adsorbent dosage of 0 5 g pb ii and ni ii removals were 89 31 and 96 33 respectively the ability of sugarcane to remove ni ii more efficiently was due to the electronic affinity linked to the ionic beam hydration energy and electrostatic forces that are more favorable for ni ii than pb ii several studies present adsorption as the main process for removing heavy metals especially ni ii from electroplating wastewater 53 55 most report that a component in the adsorbent with ionic affinity with ni ii increases the removal capacity for example peng et al 56 and zhao et al 57 used calcium sources to improve the adsorption of ni ii in their adsorbents the first used calcined electroplating sludge and the second used hydrated calcium silicate as an adsorbent in both studies a large amount of calcium in the adsorbents played a fundamental role in the process of ni ii adsorption via cation exchange as a result ni ii removals in high concentrations of electroplating wastewater were efficient however they did not analyze the selective effect with other metals jeon et al 58 studied the ni ii removal efficiency of electroplating wastewater containing high sodium content the powdered sericite was immobilized using the sodium alginate trapping method this concept did not provide na ions with influence on the ni ii removal it did not generate competitiveness among them acting more selectively to remove up to 95 of ni ii in the solution in the continuous process using a fixed bed column to the authors immobilized sericite can be essential in selecting ni ii removal lee et al 59 also used a fixed bed column based on a fe2o3 carbon foam for the adsorption of cr ii cu ii and ni ii however ni ii had the lowest removal rate among the three metals analyzed about three times lower than cr ii although adsorption is a convenient technique for removing ni ii at high concentrations studies did not report using the technique for small concentrations the use of biochars also has high removal efficiencies biofertilizer provides high porosity surface area metal affinity surface modifications stability recyclability and safe disposal 60 in addition the combination of porous algae biochar and ferric oxide demonstrated a synergistic adsorption effect serving as an efficient and recyclable ni ii removal agent 61 according to yan et al 62 the strong removal capacity combining pre precipitation and adsorption indicated that the ni ii adsorption mechanisms of biochar were mainly related to ion exchange adsorption and complexation between metal ions and surface functional groups of the biochar the scale up criteria for adsorption involve the following considerations kept constant 1 geometric similarity the relationship between column height and diameter 2 kinematic similarity physical properties of the solution in the columns 3 dynamic similarity particle size porosity and linear velocities in the columns residence time and space velocity can also be kept constant 63 2 2 chemical precipitation in general metals precipitate in the form of metal hydroxides the reaction takes place as the ph is adjusted the difficulty in precipitating metals occurs when the solution has several metallic species due to the similarities of the metals concerning the solubility curves versus ph generating a large amount of sludge is a disadvantage of the technique the sludge impairs management transport as well as its final disposition when ni ii ions are removed from residual solutions by chemical precipitation the complexing agent in the solution prevents the ion from remaining dispersed in the solution and chemically bonding with the binding agent to form an insoluble precipitate 64 after leaching a solution containing ni ii and al iii razavian et al 65 separated the two metals using excessive amounts of sodium hydroxide as a precipitating agent separating the al and ni precipitates at different phs for ph 1 eq 1 was predominant and blue flakes were observed on the solution s surface with the increase of ph to 7 the formation of the ni precipitate was more evident following the stoichiometry of eq 2 however the most effective separation for the nickel hydroxide was obtained at ph 14 verifying the formation of green solids in the lower part of the solution while the blue flakes dissolved 1 al 2 so 4 3 6 naoh 2 al oh 3 3 na 2 so 4 2 niso 4 2 naoh ni oh 2 na 2 so 4 tanong et al 66 recovered metals from a pregnant leach solution the wastewater contained zn ii mn ii cd ii co ii and ni ii ions except for ni ii the removal occurred by electrodeposition and solvent extraction ni ii removal occurred by chemical precipitation using sodium carbonate as precipitating agent both studies present the ni ii chemical precipitation as a simple technique without specific variable control however some authors explore ways to expand the concepts and applications of the technique four oligoethylenamine dithiocarbamates oedtc were used in chemical precipitation to remove cu ii ni ii and zn ii from acidic residual water from electroplating 25 four oedtc showed high ni ii and zn ii removal generating an effluent with residual concentrations of 0 003 0 008 and 0 021 0 046 mg l 1 respectively scanning electron microscope micrographs indicated compact particles besides the sludge produced had the potential to be recycled hydroxide precipitants reduce the wastewater ph and the ni ii concentration making the precipitation process difficult in this way new precipitants seek to maintain a constant ph level ensuring high efficiency wang et al 67 used silica xerogel containing amine as a precipitating solid the greenish precipitate showed characteristics to be used as a glass dye composed of amorphous ni oh 2 nanosheets the precipitating solid was collected and reused for two more cycles the ni ii removal was high reaching 99 34 99 65 its removal can also occur by sulfide precipitation jerroumi et al 68 performed tests in a perfectly agitated batch reactor the authors analyzed ph molar ratio s ii ni ii and dosage of s ii ions ni ii removal reached 91 for industrial wastewater with ph 5 and an equimolar ratio of 1 1 the characterized solid sludge was constituted in greater proportion by millerite nis and nickel oxide nio according to eq 4 4 nis s 3 2 o 2 g nio s s o 2 g the circular economy concept can be applied in a ni waste to energy cycle in this way recovered hydroxides can act as energetic materials the formation of amorphous ni oh 2 and α ni oh 2 was improved in the presence of ligand ions such as cl nh3 and c6h5o7 3 which acted as stabilizers and improved the conductivity of the electroplating wastewater 69 with the addition of 3 m naoh and the presence of the ligands several hydroxides were obtained from ph 12 and the ni oh 2 precipitation occurs in four forms eqs 5 6 7 and 8 the analysis of the precipitation temperature resulted in a high ni ii removal of 98 3 at 50 c as shown in fig 3 5 ni h 2 o 6 2 2 oh ni oh 2 s 6 h 2 o 6 ni nh 3 6 2 2 oh ni oh 2 s 6 n h 3 7 nicl 2 oh ni oh 2 s cl 8 ni c 6 h 5 o 7 2 oh ni oh 2 s c 6 h 5 o 7 3 although chemical precipitation is more economical and commonly used to treat industrial effluents containing ni ii and or other metals the process can become ineffective in the presence of strong complexing agents besides the high buffer capacity provided by complexing agents requires excessive amounts of chemicals to neutralize alkalinity 66 69 70 a partial similarity must be applied to scale up a chemical precipitation process resulting in a reduced number of similarity criteria crucial for the process 71 an analysis of time constants identifies minor and large scale by products and provides information on unnecessary requirements a physical model employing computational fluid dynamics can predict the effect of scaling up and optimize the process 2 3 membrane filtration among the ni ii removal techniques membrane filtration is one of the most selective whose main characteristic is to provide a selection of the components based on the diameter of the membrane pores scale up experiments determine filter capacity based on the maximum filtrate volume needed to block the filter 72 small scale tests aim to assess the impact on product quality and underpin the large scale filtration process basic aspects such as batch volume process time and filtration flow must be evaluated besides filter encrustation must be considered process dependent therefore the tests must take place with a constant flow rate the processes related to membrane filtration are separated into reverse osmosis ultrafiltration nanofiltration and electrodialysis in reverse osmosis a semipermeable membrane is used which separates the pollutant allowing only the passage of purified fluid the method removes various species and is widely used in the desalination process at low pressures membranes whose pores are larger than metal ions are used to remove dissolved and colloidal materials the process is known as ultrafiltration the combination of ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis is known as nanofiltration which combines a high removal rate with low energy consumption combining the better of the other two techniques as it is an electrochemical technique where the passage of potential in a membrane promotes the removal of components electrodialysis has shown itself to be promising in the field of metal removal and will be discussed later 73 in several membrane filtration technologies simpler design low space occupation and high removal efficiency are sought to target an industrial application noor et al 74 studied the removal capacity of sayong ball clay sbc membrane powder for ni ii removal from industrial wastewater they confirmed that the membrane was effective for removal in three different grinding times 10 20 and 30 h with rates removal of 88 87 82 96 and 85 13 respectively although removal occurs under all conditions the determining factor for the test with a shorter grinding time to have the higher removal rate was the smaller average pore diameter 2 44 nm resulting in a greater surface area 5 41 m2 g 1 therefore a greater surface area of the membrane exposed to ni ii represents a greater probability of removal the feasibility of choosing filtration membranes for heavy metal removal is also associated with their stability and number of operating cycles during the process studies with supported liquid membranes stand out due to the stability of their structure according to raja sulaiman et al 75 the palm oil in the supported liquid membrane showed a high potential for ni ii removal with values of 91 at a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 feed flow the process remained stable for 10 cycles even with high flow confirming the stability proposal the process was considered environmentally friendly for liquid membrane systems supported by ni ii removal zhang et al 76 studied the mechanical parameters of a rotating disk membrane used to remove ni ii through the complexation ultrafiltration process sodium polyacrylate used as a filtering and complexing agent presented a 99 5 ni ii removal the removal rate was due to the rotation speed control which remained stable up to 3000 rpm regardless of the ph change thus the radial pressure distribution and the shear rate on the membrane surface remained stable in forming polymer metal complexes a modern membrane filtration technology is the adsorptive membrane it is an efficient method due to the simultaneous use of surface adsorption and the structural property of the filtration membrane compared to conventional methods the adsorptive membrane presents lower energy consumption and ease of scale up 77 78 bisheh et al 79 studied the modification of polyethersulfone to a multilayer adsorptive membrane with alginate chitosan and porous organic polymer according to the authors the variable that most influenced the increase of ni ii and pb ii removal was ph the removal rate increased from 1 to 6 as the ph increased due to the formation of metal oxides on the other hand in acidic environments there was a competition between metals and h ions due to the protonation of amine groups reducing the rate of adsorption of metal ions li et al 80 proposed a hybrid filtration membrane formed by a complex structure containing polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf with polyacrylic acid paa protection and zeolitic imidazolate framework 8 particles zif 8 on the surface two distinct processes contributed to the ni ii removal 1 the strong interaction between ni ii and the hydroxyl structure of zif 8 2 electrostatic adsorption by carboxyl groups in the paa layers regarding the simultaneous process zif 8 showed greater selectivity in binding to ni ii making this study a valuable reference on ultrafiltration membranes designed for high selectivity of ni ii the ni ii removal by membrane filtration can be improved through particles that increase the adsorption rate and variations in the solution conditions 2 4 ion exchange the ion exchange mechanism involves exchanging an ion in the solution for a similar charge ion attached to a solid and immobile material 81 the studies highlight that the immobilized material must present easy separation high sorption capacity low operating cost and ecological advantages 82 amino functionalized biochar mgfealo4 composites removed ni ii by ion exchange 83 biochar derived from composite coated rice bran had a sorption rate of 76 51 ni ii due to the ability of iron to facilitate magnetic separation of ni ii its removal also occurred due to the complexation of ni ii with amino carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups present in the biochar gorokhovsky et al 84 reported that the dosage of 6 7 g of potassium polytitanate ppt powder formed a differentiated structure after ion exchange with ni ii ions intercalated between the ppt layers the solid product showed the formation of nanoscale complexes of ni containing oxy cations the modified solid showed a large surface area with excellent photocatalytic activity in the visible range of solar radiation making it useful for purifying dye contaminated water hydrogels and resins have a decisive role in removing metals by ion exchange the anionic magnetic hydrogel for electroplating waste treatment is a viable option considering its performance as an adsorbent including insensitivity to ph fast kinetic adsorption high reuse potential and efficiency in magnetic separation 99 85 its main removal mechanism on the surface is by ion exchange li et al 86 developed a magnetic cation exchange resin the material was developed to efficiently remove cu ii and ni ii ions presenting a uniform grain diameter of 80 150 μm and good magnetic characteristics facilitating the ion agglomeration on its surface its maximum removal was highly ph dependent 4 0 6 0 showing that the resin s electronic affinity with ni ii ions outperformed its competitiveness with h ions in solution in general chelating ion exchange resins are copolymers that can form coordinated bonds with metal ions amino groups provide nitrogen electron pairs for ions forming covalent bonds 87 88 ma et al 89 modeled a new na h dual exchange chelating resin to remove ni ii ions in a fixed bed column ion exchanger containing iminodiacetic acid functional groups however h ions led to competitive protonation reducing the ability to remove ni ii in addition na ions resulted in the precipitation of nickel hydroxide promoting the clogging of the ion exchange column the study highlights the importance of predicting the na h mix ratio from the bed feed for better ion exchange performance resulting in a high ni ii removal rate the great challenge of these studies is linked to maintaining the high selectivity for partial removal of ions with a lower operational cost 3 electrochemical technologies electrochemical methods are based on oxidoreduction reactions they are more active and efficient compared to conventional technologies 3 furthermore they do not require chemical products for effective wastewater treatment this section approaches electrocoagulation electroflotation electrodeposition and electrodialysis 3 1 electrocoagulation electrocoagulation is based on the electrochemical method of electrolysis for the treatment of effluents the oxidation of metallic electrodes is responsible for the formation of the coagulating agent without the need to add chemical compounds to promote coagulation the released ions neutralize the charges of the polluting particles initiating electrocoagulation since the process occurs through the oxidation of metallic anodes the treatment uses more compact equipment is simple to operate versatile and with good receptivity to automation 90 91 determining the kinetic constant in the process is essential for scaling up in this way stable operational criteria ensure that electrocoagulation is controlled by the particle coagulation rate rather than the availability of ions 92 the advantages of electrocoagulation allow the use of reactors that favor removal due to the efficient monitoring and control of variables 93 moersidik et al 94 removed 99 75 ni ii from wastewater rich in metal and chemical oxygen demand cod under optimal operating conditions the reactor consisted of 12 aluminum plates inside the ideal condition with a current density of 20 ma cm 2 ph 10 and 60 min of contact time favored the ability to obtain coagulated nickel complexes the increase of ph increased the ni ii removal efficiency with hydroxide precipitation second order kinetics showed a constant reaction rate of 0 1783 l mg min resulting in an overall reactor efficiency of 41 although cod required secondary treatment high metal removal met jakarta government quality standards other processes can occur along with electrocoagulation for example huang et al 95 studied the mechanism for removing ni ii cu ii and cr iv in wastewater by electrocoagulation the langmuir isotherm described the adsorption of ni ii and cu ii by the coagulant al oh 3 however for cr iv adsorption the freundlich isotherm showed the most suitable fit in the treatment of ni ii and cu ii ions both competed for the active site of al oh 3 and cu ii suppressed the adsorption of ni ii thus for the treatment of a single metal the mechanism of removing by electrocoagulation was the adsorption reaction on the other hand liu et al 96 used a stainless steel plate with a polypyrrole ppy coating to obtain the ni ii removal by electrocoagulation the ppy anode also prevented anodic corrosion process optimization took place at ph 4 current density 30 ma cm 2 lasting 70 min as a result the ni ii removal efficiency reached 80 besides the smooth and homogeneous surface of ppy as a protective coating resulted in a corrosion inhibition efficiency of 30 even after 10 batches of electrocoagulation these associations with other techniques demonstrate the flexibility of electrocoagulation in industrial applications 3 2 electroflotation electroflotation generates bubbles in an aqueous medium by electrolysis the arrangement of the grids to provide good coverage in the flotation tank area allows uniform mixing of the wastewater and gas bubbles the gas evolution process can be divided into three physical processes nucleation growth and detachment nucleation occurs on electrode surfaces usually in highly saturated solutions bubbles are detached from the electrode by buoyancy forces or liquid shear forces regarding the formation of the sizes of the bubbles the predominant and limiting factors for its application are the nature of the electrode and its location in the electromotive series 73 these bubble evolution stages leave operating conditions gas production and residence time easily controlled mainly using low voltage 97 hoseinian et al 98 treated ni rich wastewater in an oscillating grid flotation cell the authors evaluated the effects of hydrodynamic parameters such as energy input bubble size and surfactant concentration the increase in energy input from 0 to 2 w kg 1 increased the ni ii removal rate by 80 due to increased collision of larger bubbles and ideal flotation rate for smaller bubbles the results indicated that ion flotation was appropriate for ni ii removal in a period with high kinetic removal other parameters such as chemical interactions water entrainment in the foam phase and separation mechanisms are also important 99 they are evaluated by changing the ph concentration of the collector ionic strength others 3 3 electrodeposition electrodeposition involves depositing the metal in the solid state occurring in a potentiostatic or galvanostatic way design for scale up electrochemical reactors is controlled based on mass transfer at the electrode surface the concentration of metallic ions decreases on the surface of the cathode fick s law describes the mass flux of metallic ions the electrochemical conversion with diffusive mass transport in the electrode results from the removal of metal ions by the applied current density dimensionless numbers like reynolds sherwood and schmidt reduce the number of variables to determine mass transfer 100 table 2 shows the studies of the last five years that aimed to remove ni ii from wastewater by electrodeposition studies obtained metallic alloys besides ni ii removal adding another metal source in the electrolytic bath 101 102 studies on contaminant removal generally demonstrated high efficiencies above 90 103 105 li et al 104 combined fixed bed resin adsorption with further reduction by electrodeposition after adsorption on two columns the effluent concentration was less than 0 1 mg l 1 the removal was 95 6 in the electrodeposition tests recovering elementary nickel the study suggested that combining the techniques is a viable and cost effective way to replace chemical precipitation 3 4 electrodialysis applying a potential difference to a semipermeable membrane can promote the chemical separation of components in a solution the process known as electrodialysis excels at removing ions from wastewater due to its continuous operation not requiring the addition of chemical reagents 108 according to the illustration in fig 4 it is one of the most economical recent technologies with the advantage of producing reuse water removing metal ions in low concentrations 109 besides scaling inhibitors are added allowing the treated water to become a reusable industrial product according to benvenuti et al 110 electrodialysis applied to an ionic exchange membrane cationic ionac mc 3470 and anionic ionac ma 3475 of 16 cm2 achieved a ni ii removal rate of 95 obtaining clean water of reuse with conductivity close to tapping water 200 ms cm 1 demonstrating a good quality in the bench scale recovery water transferring the study to an industrial scale the reuse of the concentrated flux saved 20 of chemical products for the nickel bath 111 water reuse indicated a reduction of 150 m3 year 1 in water consumption this value impacted the reduction of chemical products needed to treat it making the financial process more viable another commercial membrane combined with electrodialysis has been approached to reduce the ni ii concentration to less than 0 1 mg l 1 103 the combination of electrodialysis with ruthenium iridium sintered titanium plate indicated that the initial ni ii concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 in the anolyte and catholyte was reduced to 0 015 and 0 085 mg l 1 respectively with the initial ni ii concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 meeting the strict discharge standard of 0 1 mg l 1 in addition electrodeposition of ni ii at the cathode increased the migration of ni ii in the electrolytes decreasing energy consumption however excessive energy consumption is still a major impediment to expanding the process on an industrial scale in addition to membrane related problems such as scale and low lifetime 112 4 bioremediation bioremediation treats wastewater through biological processes of transformation degradation and contaminant removal its merits are high efficiency easy handling and cost effectiveness 113 114 microalgae and anaerobic bioreactors have widely been used to remove effluents 4 1 microalgae the release of untreated wastewater containing biotoxic substances such as heavy metals is an environmental and health challenge facing our community recent advances in removal microbiology have propelled bioremediation as a better and more effective alternative to conventional techniques 115 microalgae act by biosorption bioaccumulation and biodegradation in the remediation of pollutants 116 the removal of organic molecules aromatic compounds and pesticides occur by biosorption it is a passive process where the microalgae biomass has retention properties on the surface which allows bioadsorption of substances 117 118 in the biosorption mechanism the biomass type determines the binding mechanisms of the metal and metabolic processes occur in the cell wall 119 bioaccumulation is an active process where biomass metabolizes nutrients through surfaces 120 organic and inorganic pollutants are transferred into the cells of microorganisms decreasing their concentrations in aqueous solutions 121 likewise biodegradation consists of removing pollutants with the aid of microorganisms microalgae convert organic matter into small molecules used as nutrients for their growth 122 zhou et al 123 studied a rotating algae biofilm rab reactor for the ni ii removal from high strength industrial wastewater the growth of indigenous microalgae through ni ii consumption reached a removal rate above 90 to the authors the algae derived from rab were more robust and resistant to ni ii exposure maintaining the integrity of cell membranes for comparison purposes fig 5 a shows that rab reactors had higher ni ii removal efficiency than bubble columns under all conditions studied fig 5 b displays that the removal rate by the rab reactors was also superior to bubble columns the study demonstrated an important advance in using microalgae for more robust equipment like a rotary reactor 4 2 anaerobic bioreactors the high operational cost the need for secondary treatment energy consumption or the generation of secondary effluents make the techniques known as traditional adsorption filtration precipitation flotation of ions limited 124 biological treatment becomes a low cost environmentally friendly and efficient remediation technology in this context besides it can treat effluents with high organic loads allowing methane management 125 126 parades aguilar et al 127 evaluated the ni ii removal from industrial wastewater in an upflow anaerobic sludge bioreactor uasb containing zeolite inoculated with anaerobic sludge the ni ii removal rate reached 99 for the 250 500 ppm concentration range the high rate of alkalinity and biogas production confirmed the activity of microbial metabolism also the sequencing of the 16s rrna genes indicated that the bacterial genera treponema ruminococcus syntrophobacter dorea kosmotoga and clostridium represented an abundance between 10 and 50 in the bioreactor the absence of the genera fervidobacterium and geobacter at the end of the treatment suggested that they had a fundamental role in the ni ii biological removal at the beginning of the treatment biomass from cyanobacteria was effective in removing ni ii and pb ii 128 the batch reactor operated at ph 7 temperature between 25 and 45 c promoted the biosorption between ni ii and the biomass in a short time of 15 min with a biomass concentration of 0 1 g l 1 ni ii removal reached 92 57 showing a strong adsorption interaction of ni ii with the cyanobacteria biomass although anaerobic bioreactors have several advantages biological conversion is dependent on the scale that occurs in conjunction with the transfer of heat mass and momentum behaving differently on a small scale compared to an industrial scale 129 the increase in scale implies an increase in the height of the reactor and a reduction in cross section concerning the volume retaining biogas and decreasing treatment efficiency in general negative scaling effects can be avoided by considering the pilot scale application of the full scale reactor height the same cross sectional area volume ratio and identical gas velocities 4 2 1 treatment of electroplating sludge electroplating sludge contains a large amount of heavy metals which must be preferably treated using easy removal techniques melting is a common solidification treatment that concentrates and encapsulates heavy metals in a glass matrix to yue et al 130 the melting process with fly ash from solid waste incineration led to the volatilization of heavy metals in the form of chlorine salts with different volatilization rates for different metals zn 33 pb 96 cu 33 cd 79 cr 81 and ni 31 the co pyrolysis process makes full use of two raw materials creating a synergy contributing to higher density greater specific surface area pore volumes and more active functional groups 131 metal leaching can be performed with biochar ecological fixatives along with iron sulfide 132 co pyrolysis biochar is the most prominent technique in the immobilization of metals in electroplating sludge reaching up to an immobilization rate of up to 98 for various metals sun et al 133 used a sophisticated microwave pyrolysis treatment to improve sludge immobilization however the immobilization rate was lower than that of the biochar reaching 75 of immobilization 4 2 2 perspectives on sludge resources recovery although electroplating has an important cost benefit ratio due to the extension of metallic structures this process generates solid residues with high concentrations of metals known as electroplating sludge the recovery of electroplating sludge can be explored as an economic and environmental assessment studies present the circular economy as a practical efficient and effective solution for the recovery of metallic residues in the electroplating process 112 134 in a metal co melting process used for wastewater sludge treatment a total of 3 to 5 of the by product in the co melting process referred to as secondary fly ash was produced by the flue gas cleaning system 130 the concentration of pb and zn in secondary fly ash has almost reached the required grade of some lead zinc ore which can be used directly in the foundry industry as metal recycling is highly valued in electrochemical processes the use of copper slag on cathodic carbon promotes an extremely complex electroplating sludge removal containing ni cu cr and fe promoting a high recovery of these metals forming solid compounds 135 although they have not yet evolved from pilot to industrial scale in the case of electrodialysis advances in antifouling membranes and electrode materials could boost their development furthermore further increase in electrode life can be achieved by using advanced coatings such as mixed metal oxide and magnéli phase tino2n 1 materials 136 5 comparison of processes and combined processes comparison of ni ii removal processes is common in wastewater treatment studies 137 138 yasar et al 139 compared the removal of heavy metals ni ii cr ii cu ii and cd ii by physicochemical processes coagulation and flocculation and ozone oxidation ozone treatment indicated removing 42 of ni ii and 26 of cr ii on the other hand aluminum sulfate as a coagulant in combination with polyacrylamide polymer achieved 99 and 98 removal of ni ii and cr ii therefore more efficient than ozone oxidation additionally the combination of processes has been widely used they may involve electrocoagulation and advanced oxidative process 94 adsorption and electrodeposition 104 electrodialysis and electrodeposition 140 pre precipitation with fenton precipitation 141 fe activated carbon microelectrolysis coupled with h2o2 142 integrated chelation and flocculation 143 shear induced dissociation and ultrafiltration 144 and fenton oxidation combined with recycled ferrite process 145 mardiyono et al 146 used electrocoagulation as the initial treatment of electroplating effluent subsequently bioremediation with bacillus subtilis removed ni ii at a maximum rate of 85 61 the combination of treatment techniques aims to maximize its efficiency and depends on simplicity rate removal and cost effectiveness besides the combination of two techniques allows treatment of the waste generated in the first technique resulting in high utilization and generation of by products and waste minimization 6 other techniques alternative techniques have been used to remove heavy metals from wastewater from electroplating for example zhou et al 142 recovered phosphorus and removed nickel simultaneously via iron activated carbon and hydrogen peroxide the isothermal reaction resulted in the recovery of 99 99 of p the ni precipitation at high ph and its adsorption in iron hydroxides and activated carbon resulted in a high removal of 89 bacillus subtilis and organophosphate monoesters were used to remove ni ii from wastewater using a biomineralization method resulting in nickel phosphate octahydrate 147 the ni ii removal efficiency was 76 41 for 0 02 mol of organophosphorus monoester and 2 g of bacillus subtilis powder the reaction was maintained at ph 6 at 25 c with a holding time of 36 h processes involving washings were also reported 148 149 chelating oxime lix63 and organophosphorus transporters d2ehpa synergistically removed ni ii 148 the synergism of d2ehpa octanol was also studied for ni ii removal by solvent extraction and indicated a technique for future applications 149 the electroplating wastewater freezing and crystallization method showed a 77 1 ni ii melt water removal rate after gravity separation for 5 min 150 this melting ice removal rate after gravity separation lasting 18 h was 97 9 besides the study demonstrated that the ni ii removal was directly proportional to weight loss after the dehydration process therefore a longer dehydration time in the centrifuge increases the removal capacity during dehydration 7 economic aspects and patents cost reduction is a crucial factor in wastewater treatment in this context adsorption and precipitation continue as the most common techniques due to easy operation regenerability low cost energy consumption and environmental protection representing industrial application through patents on ni ii removal 151 152 chen 151 invented a ni ii removal method using potassium ferrate trivalent ferric ions acted as complexing agents to isolate and remove ni ii after adding polyacrylamide to coagulate and precipitate the metal the electrochemical techniques also stand out in terms of the economic aspect mainly with the combined use of the mentioned techniques and low ni ii concentrations electrodialysis was essential to recovering ni ii from boric acid as a catalyst in ultrasound assisted electrolysis 153 the method had the advantage of producing reused water a ni ii removal system used an electrolysis device depositing ni ii at the cathode 154 its recycling occurred by adding limestone and calcium chloride compounds to reach a ph of 8 9 forming orthophosphite citrate and tartrate anions these products resulted in calcium precipitation the solid material was removed by filtration according to wang et al 140 the use of a conductive graphite adhesive cga resin as an electrode for capacitive deionization cdi removed ni ii with decreasing concentration from 0 095 g l 1 to 0 005 g l 1 consuming 1 6 kw h 1 per ton of wastewater besides the electrodes regeneration and the electrolytic performance of the cga resin remained stable during the cycle the spent electrodes were electrochemically regenerated as illustrated in fig 6 8 conclusion this review addressed recent advances in ni ii removal from electroplating industry wastewater over the last five years while water recovery is a niche scarcity of resources will pressure the world to use environmentally friendly technologies to remove contaminants future research should focus on lowering the cost of systems high efficiencies and developing intelligent systems all techniques have advantages and their uses depend on their feasibility most studies reported batch and bench scale systems therefore continuous system and pilot scale studies are needed to demonstrate industrial applications besides real wastewater should be studied more than synthetic effluent investigating the true interaction of the technology with the compounds in the solution likewise research should focus on commercializing techniques in the field of contaminant removal leading to the development of the next generation of wastewater treatment in a sustainable

13127,electro dewatering edw of sludge has been regarded as an economical and efficient dewatering method in recent years there have been some studies on municipal sludge and industrial sludge however the effects of industrial sludge with high metal and salty content on the edw performance are still unclear here we investigate edw in the characteristics of steel industrial sludge which contains large amounts of salts and metals first the differences between the steel industrial sludge and the other sludge in edw treatment were explored then the mechanism of interaction between the transformation of metal speciation and dewatering performance was investigated the results indicated that the optimal 40 09 moisture content mc could be obtained under the operating conditions of 60 v voltage and 2 6 bar pressure moreover the ph variation and electro redox behavior can lead to the transformation of metal speciation and release charged intermediates relating to metal causing the rise of current in the edw process these phenomena were beneficial to continuous dewatering by contrast the speciation of ca and zn is mainly affected by electromigration and electroosmotic flow but the speciation of fe and al is more affected by the oxidizing atmosphere this work extended the application range of edw and filled the gap of edw for the industrial sludge field keywords electro dewatering steel sludge moisture content current metal speciation 1 introduction according to the china environment statistical yearbook 2018 as the by products of steel printing and dyeing metallurgy papermaking and chemical industry wastewater treatment processes 1 approximately 24 45 million tons of industrial sludge 60 moisture content were generated per year in china meanwhile the large amount of sludge poses a major threat to the environment due to the difficulties of treatment and disposal 2 3 the moisture content of non dewatering industrial sludge is about 90 4 mechanical dewatering is one of the most appropriate ways of sludge dewatering however industrial sludge moisture content mc can only be decreased to 80 60 by traditional mechanical dewatering 5 which is unable to meet the requirements of subsequent disposal accordingly increasing interests have been attracted to search for an efficient method of sludge deep dewatering 6 7 electro dewatering edw is regarded as one of the most efficient and cost effective technical solutions for sludge deep dewatering 8 the solid surface of sludge is commonly negatively charged surrounded by a layer of liquid with opposite charges for charge neutralization which causes the sludge system to form a double electric layer thus solid liquid separation in sludge can be realized quickly under the effect of an electric field 9 10 mahmoud et al emphasized that compared with mechanical dewatering extra 10 24 water could be removed by the edw the energy consumption could be reduced by 10 25 by contrast to the thermal drying 0 617 1 2 kwh kgwater removed at the same time 11 currently most studies of edw mainly concentrate on municipal sludge such as the dewatering mechanism pollutants migration and the approaches for dewaterability improvement 12 14 a few studies of the scientific literature have established the theory of industrial sludge which extracellular polymeric substances eps content was much less than municipal sludge and contains a lot of salts and inorganic components according to the research on chemical sludge from riyou organic chemical plant 3 after edw treatment the mc of the high salt sludge can be reduced to less than 60 without additional chemical addition and it is obvious that sodium and potassium were distributed in layers wu et al 4 employed a linear model to explore the difference of edw process in food industrial sludge oil refinery industrial sludge pharmaceutical industry sludge and paint industrial sludge and the results demonstrated that the dewatering of industrial sludge increased more than 25 of the water except for pharmaceutical industrial sludge different from other sludge the steel industrial sludge is a kind of waste with high salt and metal content according to the results of xiao et al 15 increasing the salt content of sludge may have an impact on edw performance moreover much research 16 17 shows that the metal ions have considerable influence on sludge apparent electrical resistivity and electrochemical reactivity thus affecting the dewatering and energy consumption in addition for the industrial sludge with high metals content the ph and oxidation reducibility of sludge can be changed because of the electrode reaction in edw 16 which is vitally important for the metal speciation 18 the variation of metal speciation may release charged intermediates and generate precipitation 19 which is counteractive in the process of edw however previous research focuses on the metal speciation in low voltage electrokinetic technology 20 and there may be some differences in the mechanism of metal speciation variation of the industrial sludge edw so it s necessary to develop the mechanism of interaction between the edw process and metal speciation furthermore the chemical forms of metals are of significance for evaluating their mobility bioavailability reactivity and incineration characteristics 21 23 thus the study of metal speciation before and after edw can also provide theoretical support for subsequent disposal however the performance of edw applied to steel industrial sludge with high salt and metal content and the transformation of metal speciation in the edw process have not been studied therefore the major objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the edw performance for sludge from steel industry and then use the response surface method rsm to explore the optimum operating conditions thereby fulfilling the knowledge gap about the application of edw in steel industrial sludge field 2 examine the variations of physicochemical properties of steel sludge in the edw process 3 explore the mechanism of interaction between edw and metal speciation and address the cognitive gaps of metal speciation variation in edw process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sample the raw industrial sludge samples used in this study were collected from the sludge concentration tank of delong steel wastewater treatment plant in xingtai china which processing capacity is 11 000 tons daily the existing sludge dewatering process in this plant is plate frame compression dewatering which reduces the mc of sludge from 85 6 1 6 to 67 3 2 1 the sludge sample was first dewatered by vacuum filtration without chemical additives and then stored at 4 c the sludge sample returned to room temperature before edw experiments all sludge samples were used up in less than two weeks the main characteristics of raw sludge and the sludge dewatered by vacuum filtration are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental device the device for the investigation of edw of industrial sludge is shown in fig 1a this edw lab scale included i a filter chamber made from poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe 75 mm of inner diameter and 45 mm of height ii a ruthenium coated titanium anode and a stainless steel cathode plate connected with the power lines iii a direct electric current dc power supply with measuring range of 0 80 v and 0 3 a iv an air compressor to provide mechanical pressure and v a precision electronic balance to monitor the mass of filtrate the anode plate is driven by the pressure from the air compression pump and can contact closely with the sludge fig 1b the mechanical pressure supplied is controlled by a pressure regulating valve there are conductive columns on both the anode plate and the cathode plate of the compression cell the change of voltage and current is monitored by the dc power supply fig 1c displays the compression cell was detachable allowing the addition and removal of sludge easily the filtrate can be collected into the filtrate collector through the perforated cathode plate and the stainless steel filter cloth 40 μm thickness and 44 μm pore size and the filtrate mass is recorded by an electronic balance 2 3 experimental and analysis methods 2 3 1 edw procedures the steel industrial sludge was initially filtered by vacuum filtration as a mechanical dewatering method the corresponding mc of the obtained sludge was approximately 63 27 in each edw experimental 120 g dewatered sludge was made into a 21 mm thick sludge cake the current and filtrate mass was recorded every 5 s and dewatering until the filtrate flow rate was less than 0 05 g min for 5 min the dc power supply displayed the applied voltage u v and electric current i a all the time in edw running the energy consumption was calculated as follows p uidt m where p is the energy consumption kwh kgdewater t is the time for dewatering s and m is the mass of water removed g central composite design ccd which is a method for response surface analysis rsm was applied to evaluate the influence of voltage 20 60 v 12 26 and pressure 1 3 bar variables on the mc and energy consumption table 2 then the optimized edw variables of optimum dry solids content were used as operating conditions for subsequent experiments after optimization of operating conditions the hierarchical model was used to study the properties of the sludge at different distances from the electrode before edw the sludge cake is separated into three layers anode layer middle layer and cathode layer by two tightly woven titanium meshes as displayed in fig s2 the weight and thickness of each layer were 40 g and 7 mm 2 3 2 properties analysis of sludge the gravimetric method is commonly used for mc and vs ts measurement of sludge the homogeneous sludge samples were dried to a constant weight in an oven at 105 c and the dry sludge was burned in a muffle furnace at 600 c for 1 h the mc and vs ts are defined as mc m 1 m 2 m 1 100 ts m 2 v vs m 2 m 3 v vs ts m 2 m 3 m 2 100 where m1 g is the mass of dewatered sludge m2 g is the mass of dried sludge v ml is the sludge sample volume and m3 g is the mass of burned sludge the scod was measured by the dichromatic oxidation titration method for the ph conductivity and zeta potential analysis 5 g sludge samples and 50 ml deionized water were placed in a conical flask and oscillated for 6 h to obtain the suspension mixed evenly the ph and conductivity were measured by electrode method using the digital ph meter phbj 260 rex china and digital

and discussion 3 1 effect of operating conditions during the edw process the 3d surface map and contour map generated by design expert software are shown in fig 2 illustrating the effects of operating factors including voltage and pressure on the mc and energy consumption of industrial sludge edw fig 2a shows the optimal 40 09 mc could be obtained under the operating conditions of 60 v voltage and 2 6 bar pressure previous studies have found that a higher electric field brought better dewatering efficiency 11 24 and the same phenomenon was found in industrial sludge from the contour map of fig 2a moreover it is observed that the final mc decreased with the increasing pressure applied in a certain range as larger pressure brought electrodes into closer contact with the sludge cake 25 however excessive pressure had an adverse influence on filtrate removal in line with the optimized results the result is probably because the higher pressure decreased the pores between the sludge cake and blocked the outflow of filtrate 14 26 furthermore as shown in fig 2 b the energy consumption increased with the added additional voltage but decreased with the added pressure in the experimental conditions the results indicated that higher voltage was accompanied by high current and increased energy consumption 27 but higher pressure reduced the dewatering time and decreased energy consumption in the edw process steel sludge fig 2 according to the results the regress equations fitted by the quadratic formula for mc of sludge y1 and dewatering energy consumption y2 were outlined as follows y 1 62 25 0 3600 x 1 7 03 x 2 0 002467 x 1 2 1 354 x 2 2 0 0020 x 1 x 2 y 2 9 15 10 2 7 98 10 3 x 1 2 59 10 2 x 2 0 20 10 4 x 1 2 4 29 10 3 x 2 2 6 75 10 4 x 1 x 2 3 2 variation characteristics of current and filtrate mass in edw process 3 2 1 current variation fig 3 shows the current and filtrate mass variation in the edw process with different voltages when the voltage is 20 v 40 v and 60 v the dewatering limit time is 900 s 715 s and 480 s respectively which illustrated that the dewatering limit time decreased as voltage raised it is observed that the current value and filtrate mass increased as voltage raised which is consistent with previous research 28 as shown in fig 3a the current had two ascending stages at 20 v and had three ascending stages at 40 v and 60 v it can be seen that the first stage started a rise in the initial dewatering process it reached a peak at about 15 s and then began to fall the decreases in the distance between cathode and anode contribute to electric resistance declines in the early period of the edw process 11 subsequently the current decreased because the reduction of the liquid phase and the gas evolution at electrodes leads to electric resistance increases 11 29 however then the current rose again which was different from the research of other sludge 30 31 the higher voltage leads to an earlier beginning and less duration of the second and third rise stages and there was no third rise stage when the voltage was 20 v the results show that the voltage was that related to the latter two current rises moreover the current value can reflect the electrochemical reaction rate in the edw process higher current means the faster the electron transfer on the electrodes 32 and was beneficial to dewatering 3 2 2 filtrate mass variation fig 3b presented a dynamic variation of filtrate mass in the edw process under different voltage conditions the changes of filtrate mass could be divided into three stage in the initial stage the rate of filtrate mass variation gradually decreased as can be seen in fig 3b i and a the second derivative of filtrate mass time the filtrate mass was positive value which indicated the filtrate mass obtained per unit time gradually increased during the second current ascending stage in the third stage the filtrate mass slowly increased and gradually reached the limit it is evidenced that the most critical parameters of electroosmotic flow were current density 33 higher current density and the absolute value of zeta leads to electro kinetics more effective 34 therefore the filtrate mass velocity may increase with the rose of current the restrictions on the outflow of filtrate are related to the change of sludge morphology as depicted in fig 4 the microstructures of sludge changed after edw at 60 v and 2 6 bar the anode layer sludge had more pore than raw sludge fig 4a c because there were large amounts of gas produced to form pores at the anode 16 although gas was also produced at the cathode the precipitation of insoluble metallic compounds clogged the hole fig 4d e 29 which prevented the filtrate from flowing out the phenomenon led to the flow rate of the filtrate was tardy at 6 8 min and reached the dewatering limit at 8 min 3 2 3 edw of steel industrial sludge with polyacrylamide as shown in fig 5 it is worth noting that there was no second and third rise of current at 60 v and 2 6 bar when added polyelectrolytes polyacrylamide to the sludge moreover the final filtrate mass was only 20 54 g and the mc was 55 68 1 5 at 200 s previous studies indicated that polyelectrolytes had no significant influence on the electroosmotic transport of water for sludge and most surface charges inside the sludge were unaffected by polyelectrolytes 33 35 36 the sludge negative particles could be entrapped in polyelectrolytes floc when added the polyacrylamide 37 which is the main difference of sludge before and after adding flocculate therefore the encapsulation structure may hinder the current rise and dewatering in the edw process of steel industrial sludge with polyacrylamide 3 3 variation in physicochemical properties of sludge during the edw process 3 3 1 moisture content to further investigate the variation of industrial sludge property in the edw process layered experiments were performed under 60 v and 2 6 bar operating conditions fig 6a showed the characteristics of mc dynamic variation in different layers the mc of anode layer sludge was lower than that of the cathode layer sludge and the mc of the middle layer was between that of the anode layer and cathode layer in the whole experiment process which was consistent with the findings of yang et al 38 the phenomenon is because that the filtrate mass flowed from the upper to the bottom sludge at negative zeta potential fig 6d and the part of moisture flowing from the anode layer remained in the cathode layer 39 however the mc of the cathode layer decreased to 41 62 0 81 at 360 s then recovered to 43 51 0 60 at 480 s this result could be related to that filtrate mass was almost constant at 360 s to 480 s fig 3b since the cathode layer sludge had few pores 5 at 360 s which impeded the flow of filtrate mass and made the moisture accumulated at the cathode layer 3 3 2 ph the ph gradient could reflect the intensity of water electrolysis as shown in fig 6b the variation of ph gradient was greater at 85 105 s than 0 85 s which illustrated that the electrolysis reaction of water was weak at 0 85 s but the intensity at 85 105 s this result was not consistent with previous studies 3 6 40 which have shown that the change of ph gradient gradually decreased because the electrolysis of water was weakened with the removal of water the main reason for this situation may be the electrolysis intensity of water is proportional to the current and the average current of 0 85 s is less than the average current of 85 105 s moreover the ph of the anode layer increased and that of the cathode decreased fig 6b because of the common electrochemical reaction 41 at the anode 2 h 2 o 4 e o 2 4 h at the cathode 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h 3 3 3 conductivity and zeta potential as shown in fig 6c unlike previous studies the conductivity increased slightly at the range of 0 85 s it may be related to the electrolysis of metallic compounds to produce charged intermediates then the anode layer sludge conductivity increased and the cathode layer sludge conductivity declined which was consistent with existing research 13 42 43 as depicted in fig 6d the zeta potential of the anode layer increased and the zeta potential of the cathode layer decreased while changes of ph of the middle layer were unobservable the changes of zeta potential of sludge during the edw process were correlated with the ph and conductivity through correlation analysis it is found that the change of zeta potential for the anode layer was more related to conductivity r 0 988 while the change of zeta potential for the cathode layer was more related to ph r 0 972 which may be due to the anode layer had a higher conductivity and had a significant effect on zeta potential 15 the zeta potential of the anode layer increased because high conductivity means high ionic strength of sludge and the zeta potential and ion intensity are positively correlated whereas the generation of oh in the cathode layer would increase the ph and then decrease the zeta potential 33 moreover a negative increase of zeta potential can accelerate the rate of electroosmosis by improving the electro osmosis driving force 2 while the increase of zeta potential could enhance the filterability of sludge 44 3 3 4 temperature on the other hand the electrochemical reaction can also release joule heating 5 as shown in fig 6e the temperature of three layers from the top to the bottom gradually increased to 60 5 2 5 c 59 6 1 8 c and 49 5 2 7 c respectively the cathode layer sludge temperature was the lowest which may be related to the heat taken away by filtrate outflow high temperature can destroy the eps and improve dewatering performance 45 46 however the sludge contained few biological compositions in this experiment as presented in table 1 and it can be inferred that the effect of temperature on the characteristics of industrial sludge edw is mainly to reduce viscosity and enhance dewatering kinetics 47 therefore the rising temperatures facilitate water removal moreover lv et al proved that the surface cracking degree increased when the sludge temperature was higher than 50 c 48 which caused the dewaterability to improve thus the temperature of anode sludge and intermediate layer sludge above 50 c may further increase the dewatering performance of these two parts of sludge 3 4 effect of metal speciation variation on the edw of industrial sludge 3 4 1 proportion of each metal speciation variations after edw treatments the proportion of each metal speciation before and after edw treatments were presented in fig 7 after the edw treatments the percentage of exchangeable slightly raised of zn fe al which may be due to ph changes and electrochemical reactions which convert other fractions into exchangeable fractions 49 however the percentage of exchangeable fraction declined of ca it likely because there was 50 29 exchangeable ca in the original sludge which is easy to migrate and remove 19 the rise of exchangeable fraction of metals expects ca suggested that electrochemical reactions produced charged intermediates that migrated easily this phenomenon was consistent with the increase of electrical conductivity at the beginning of edw fig 7c and the increase of current 50 during the process meanwhile the percentage of oxidizable fraction for fe and al was found to decrease to a larger extent but a slight increase of the percentage of the reducible fraction it was due to the oxidizable metal being converted to exchangeable and reducible fractions at the anode by oxidation 51 however the percentage of reducible fraction for ca and zn was found to decline which may be because the removal efficiency of the reducible fraction is higher than that of the oxidized fraction 19 in addition the residual fraction percentage of these four metals increased during the edw treatments it is mainly because residual metals are the most difficult part to remove 19 and the reduction of the total amount fig s3 of metals cause the increase of the proportion of residual fraction the increase of exchangeable fraction is beneficial to the dewatering performance but the formation of residual fraction could prevent the dewatering of sludge 6 3 4 2 metal speciation in different layer as shown in fig 8 the metal speciation distribution of sludge in each layer exists differences at 6 min and 8 min in this work the layered distribution of exchangeable fraction is not obvious but the distribution of other fractions showed certain regularity as can be observed from fig 8a and c when the edw treatment lasted for 6 min the reducible fraction of ca and zn were most abundant in the cathode layer because the flow of the filtrate carries the fraction of ca and zn downward from the anode however electroosmosis 52 made oxidizable calcium flow from anode to cathode and organic migration makes oxidizable calcium flow from cathode to anode 14 30 and accumulates in the middle layer moreover oxidizable reducible and residue fraction of ca and zn were most abundant in the cathode layer when the edw treatment lasted for 8 min this indicated that the amount of calcium carried by the filtrate 53 eventually exceeded the movement of organic matter as can be seen in fig 8b and d the variations of fraction distribution for fe and al were similar different from the distribution of ca and zn there is more reducible fraction of fe and al in the anode layer than in the middle layer at 6 min it was due to the anodic oxidation of oxidizable fraction metals finally oxidizable and reducible fractions are distributed according to the oxidizing atmosphere at 8 min that is the reducible fraction decreases from the upper layer to the bottom layer and the oxidable fraction increases from the upper layer to the bottom layer which indicated that the compounds containing fe and al were more prone to redox reaction 17 these four metals deposition probability increased with the increase of ph 54 55 which was the reason why there were more residual metals in the cathode layer furthermore it should be noted that the residual state content of each metal in the anode layer was always greater than that of in middle layer the microstructures of the sludge surface in close contact with the anode were shown in fig s4 which was similar to the sem of metal doping with silica 56 indeed the sludge contained sediment from the primary sedimentation tank and had silt and contains a lot of silicon compounds it was speculated that some metal doping with silica lattice occurred at the anode resulting in the increase of residual fraction at the anode layer 3 5 the mechanism of interaction between metal speciation and edw overall the changes in ph and redox potential arising as a result of the application of an electric field could lead to changes in metal speciation the mechanism for the current to rise can be activated by the formation of exchangeable charged intermediates relating to metal and the electrochemical reaction of the metallic compound it owes to the fact that more ions migrate to balance the charge and more electrochemical reactions can take place at the electrodes which is beneficial to increase the removal of water 29 in edw process in addition the increase in ph and the electrochemical transformation can lead to the formation of non ionic metallics chemical system which could add the electrical resistance 57 and prevent the dewatering of sludge furthermore different metals have different variation regulations of oxidable fraction and reducible fraction and their redox reactions may gain or lose electrons at the electrode thus maintaining the current in the edw process 4 conclusion this study attempted to investigate the performance and metal speciation of steel industrial sludge during the edw process and explored the related mechanisms of the process the results showed that edw treatment significantly enhances dewaterability of steel industrial sludge different from the other sludge twice or three times current rises appeared in the electroosmotic dewatering process of industrial sludge it could be caused by electrolysis reactions and the formation of charged intermediates in addition metals of different speciation were interchangeable and redistributed during the edw process the speciation of ca and zn between different layers is mainly affected by electromigration and electroosmotic flow whereas the speciation of fe and al was obviously affected by oxidizing atmosphere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13127,electro dewatering edw of sludge has been regarded as an economical and efficient dewatering method in recent years there have been some studies on municipal sludge and industrial sludge however the effects of industrial sludge with high metal and salty content on the edw performance are still unclear here we investigate edw in the characteristics of steel industrial sludge which contains large amounts of salts and metals first the differences between the steel industrial sludge and the other sludge in edw treatment were explored then the mechanism of interaction between the transformation of metal speciation and dewatering performance was investigated the results indicated that the optimal 40 09 moisture content mc could be obtained under the operating conditions of 60 v voltage and 2 6 bar pressure moreover the ph variation and electro redox behavior can lead to the transformation of metal speciation and release charged intermediates relating to metal causing the rise of current in the edw process these phenomena were beneficial to continuous dewatering by contrast the speciation of ca and zn is mainly affected by electromigration and electroosmotic flow but the speciation of fe and al is more affected by the oxidizing atmosphere this work extended the application range of edw and filled the gap of edw for the industrial sludge field keywords electro dewatering steel sludge moisture content current metal speciation 1 introduction according to the china environment statistical yearbook 2018 as the by products of steel printing and dyeing metallurgy papermaking and chemical industry wastewater treatment processes 1 approximately 24 45 million tons of industrial sludge 60 moisture content were generated per year in china meanwhile the large amount of sludge poses a major threat to the environment due to the difficulties of treatment and disposal 2 3 the moisture content of non dewatering industrial sludge is about 90 4 mechanical dewatering is one of the most appropriate ways of sludge dewatering however industrial sludge moisture content mc can only be decreased to 80 60 by traditional mechanical dewatering 5 which is unable to meet the requirements of subsequent disposal accordingly increasing interests have been attracted to search for an efficient method of sludge deep dewatering 6 7 electro dewatering edw is regarded as one of the most efficient and cost effective technical solutions for sludge deep dewatering 8 the solid surface of sludge is commonly negatively charged surrounded by a layer of liquid with opposite charges for charge neutralization which causes the sludge system to form a double electric layer thus solid liquid separation in sludge can be realized quickly under the effect of an electric field 9 10 mahmoud et al emphasized that compared with mechanical dewatering extra 10 24 water could be removed by the edw the energy consumption could be reduced by 10 25 by contrast to the thermal drying 0 617 1 2 kwh kgwater removed at the same time 11 currently most studies of edw mainly concentrate on municipal sludge such as the dewatering mechanism pollutants migration and the approaches for dewaterability improvement 12 14 a few studies of the scientific literature have established the theory of industrial sludge which extracellular polymeric substances eps content was much less than municipal sludge and contains a lot of salts and inorganic components according to the research on chemical sludge from riyou organic chemical plant 3 after edw treatment the mc of the high salt sludge can be reduced to less than 60 without additional chemical addition and it is obvious that sodium and potassium were distributed in layers wu et al 4 employed a linear model to explore the difference of edw process in food industrial sludge oil refinery industrial sludge pharmaceutical industry sludge and paint industrial sludge and the results demonstrated that the dewatering of industrial sludge increased more than 25 of the water except for pharmaceutical industrial sludge different from other sludge the steel industrial sludge is a kind of waste with high salt and metal content according to the results of xiao et al 15 increasing the salt content of sludge may have an impact on edw performance moreover much research 16 17 shows that the metal ions have considerable influence on sludge apparent electrical resistivity and electrochemical reactivity thus affecting the dewatering and energy consumption in addition for the industrial sludge with high metals content the ph and oxidation reducibility of sludge can be changed because of the electrode reaction in edw 16 which is vitally important for the metal speciation 18 the variation of metal speciation may release charged intermediates and generate precipitation 19 which is counteractive in the process of edw however previous research focuses on the metal speciation in low voltage electrokinetic technology 20 and there may be some differences in the mechanism of metal speciation variation of the industrial sludge edw so it s necessary to develop the mechanism of interaction between the edw process and metal speciation furthermore the chemical forms of metals are of significance for evaluating their mobility bioavailability reactivity and incineration characteristics 21 23 thus the study of metal speciation before and after edw can also provide theoretical support for subsequent disposal however the performance of edw applied to steel industrial sludge with high salt and metal content and the transformation of metal speciation in the edw process have not been studied therefore the major objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the edw performance for sludge from steel industry and then use the response surface method rsm to explore the optimum operating conditions thereby fulfilling the knowledge gap about the application of edw in steel industrial sludge field 2 examine the variations of physicochemical properties of steel sludge in the edw process 3 explore the mechanism of interaction between edw and metal speciation and address the cognitive gaps of metal speciation variation in edw process 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge sample the raw industrial sludge samples used in this study were collected from the sludge concentration tank of delong steel wastewater treatment plant in xingtai china which processing capacity is 11 000 tons daily the existing sludge dewatering process in this plant is plate frame compression dewatering which reduces the mc of sludge from 85 6 1 6 to 67 3 2 1 the sludge sample was first dewatered by vacuum filtration without chemical additives and then stored at 4 c the sludge sample returned to room temperature before edw experiments all sludge samples were used up in less than two weeks the main characteristics of raw sludge and the sludge dewatered by vacuum filtration are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental device the device for the investigation of edw of industrial sludge is shown in fig 1a this edw lab scale included i a filter chamber made from poly tetrafluoroethylene ptfe 75 mm of inner diameter and 45 mm of height ii a ruthenium coated titanium anode and a stainless steel cathode plate connected with the power lines iii a direct electric current dc power supply with measuring range of 0 80 v and 0 3 a iv an air compressor to provide mechanical pressure and v a precision electronic balance to monitor the mass of filtrate the anode plate is driven by the pressure from the air compression pump and can contact closely with the sludge fig 1b the mechanical pressure supplied is controlled by a pressure regulating valve there are conductive columns on both the anode plate and the cathode plate of the compression cell the change of voltage and current is monitored by the dc power supply fig 1c displays the compression cell was detachable allowing the addition and removal of sludge easily the filtrate can be collected into the filtrate collector through the perforated cathode plate and the stainless steel filter cloth 40 μm thickness and 44 μm pore size and the filtrate mass is recorded by an electronic balance 2 3 experimental and analysis methods 2 3 1 edw procedures the steel industrial sludge was initially filtered by vacuum filtration as a mechanical dewatering method the corresponding mc of the obtained sludge was approximately 63 27 in each edw experimental 120 g dewatered sludge was made into a 21 mm thick sludge cake the current and filtrate mass was recorded every 5 s and dewatering until the filtrate flow rate was less than 0 05 g min for 5 min the dc power supply displayed the applied voltage u v and electric current i a all the time in edw running the energy consumption was calculated as follows p uidt m where p is the energy consumption kwh kgdewater t is the time for dewatering s and m is the mass of water removed g central composite design ccd which is a method for response surface analysis rsm was applied to evaluate the influence of voltage 20 60 v 12 26 and pressure 1 3 bar variables on the mc and energy consumption table 2 then the optimized edw variables of optimum dry solids content were used as operating conditions for subsequent experiments after optimization of operating conditions the hierarchical model was used to study the properties of the sludge at different distances from the electrode before edw the sludge cake is separated into three layers anode layer middle layer and cathode layer by two tightly woven titanium meshes as displayed in fig s2 the weight and thickness of each layer were 40 g and 7 mm 2 3 2 properties analysis of sludge the gravimetric method is commonly used for mc and vs ts

moreover the ph of the anode layer increased and that of the cathode decreased fig 6b because of the common electrochemical reaction 41 at the anode 2 h 2 o 4 e o 2 4 h at the cathode 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h 3 3 3 conductivity and zeta potential as shown in fig 6c unlike previous studies the conductivity increased slightly at the range of 0 85 s it may be related to the electrolysis of metallic compounds to produce charged intermediates then the anode layer sludge conductivity increased and the cathode layer sludge conductivity declined which was consistent with existing research 13 42 43 as depicted in fig 6d the zeta potential of the anode layer increased and the zeta potential of the cathode layer decreased while changes of ph of the middle layer were unobservable the changes of zeta potential of sludge during the edw process were correlated with the ph and conductivity through correlation analysis it is found that the change of zeta potential for the anode layer was more related to conductivity r 0 988 while the change of zeta potential for the cathode layer was more related to ph r 0 972 which may be due to the anode layer had a higher conductivity and had a significant effect on zeta potential 15 the zeta potential of the anode layer increased because high conductivity means high ionic strength of sludge and the zeta potential and ion intensity are positively correlated whereas the generation of oh in the cathode layer would increase the ph and then decrease the zeta potential 33 moreover a negative increase of zeta potential can accelerate the rate of electroosmosis by improving the electro osmosis driving force 2 while the increase of zeta potential could enhance the filterability of sludge 44 3 3 4 temperature on the other hand the electrochemical reaction can also release joule heating 5 as shown in fig 6e the temperature of three layers from the top to the bottom gradually increased to 60 5 2 5 c 59 6 1 8 c and 49 5 2 7 c respectively the cathode layer sludge temperature was the lowest which may be related to the heat taken away by filtrate outflow high temperature can destroy the eps and improve dewatering performance 45 46 however the sludge contained few biological compositions in this experiment as presented in table 1 and it can be inferred that the effect of temperature on the characteristics of industrial sludge edw is mainly to reduce viscosity and enhance dewatering kinetics 47 therefore the rising temperatures facilitate water removal moreover lv et al proved that the surface cracking degree increased when the sludge temperature was higher than 50 c 48 which caused the dewaterability to improve thus the temperature of anode sludge and intermediate layer sludge above 50 c may further increase the dewatering performance of these two parts of sludge 3 4 effect of metal speciation variation on the edw of industrial sludge 3 4 1 proportion of each metal speciation variations after edw treatments the proportion of each metal speciation before and after edw treatments were presented in fig 7 after the edw treatments the percentage of exchangeable slightly raised of zn fe al which may be due to ph changes and electrochemical reactions which convert other fractions into exchangeable fractions 49 however the percentage of exchangeable fraction declined of ca it likely because there was 50 29 exchangeable ca in the original sludge which is easy to migrate and remove 19 the rise of exchangeable fraction of metals expects ca suggested that electrochemical reactions produced charged intermediates that migrated easily this phenomenon was consistent with the increase of electrical conductivity at the beginning of edw fig 7c and the increase of current 50 during the process meanwhile the percentage of oxidizable fraction for fe and al was found to decrease to a larger extent but a slight increase of the percentage of the reducible fraction it was due to the oxidizable metal being converted to exchangeable and reducible fractions at the anode by oxidation 51 however the percentage of reducible fraction for ca and zn was found to decline which may be because the removal efficiency of the reducible fraction is higher than that of the oxidized fraction 19 in addition the residual fraction percentage of these four metals increased during the edw treatments it is mainly because residual metals are the most difficult part to remove 19 and the reduction of the total amount fig s3 of metals cause the increase of the proportion of residual fraction the increase of exchangeable fraction is beneficial to the dewatering performance but the formation of residual fraction could prevent the dewatering of sludge 6 3 4 2 metal speciation in different layer as shown in fig 8 the metal speciation distribution of sludge in each layer exists differences at 6 min and 8 min in this work the layered distribution of exchangeable fraction is not obvious but the distribution of other fractions showed certain regularity as can be observed from fig 8a and c when the edw treatment lasted for 6 min the reducible fraction of ca and zn were most abundant in the cathode layer because the flow of the filtrate carries the fraction of ca and zn downward from the anode however electroosmosis 52 made oxidizable calcium flow from anode to cathode and organic migration makes oxidizable calcium flow from cathode to anode 14 30 and accumulates in the middle layer moreover oxidizable reducible and residue fraction of ca and zn were most abundant in the cathode layer when the edw treatment lasted for 8 min this indicated that the amount of calcium carried by the filtrate 53 eventually exceeded the movement of organic matter as can be seen in fig 8b and d the variations of fraction distribution for fe and al were similar different from the distribution of ca and zn there is more reducible fraction of fe and al in the anode layer than in the middle layer at 6 min it was due to the anodic oxidation of oxidizable fraction metals finally oxidizable and reducible fractions are distributed according to the oxidizing atmosphere at 8 min that is the reducible fraction decreases from the upper layer to the bottom layer and the oxidable fraction increases from the upper layer to the bottom layer which indicated that the compounds containing fe and al were more prone to redox reaction 17 these four metals deposition probability increased with the increase of ph 54 55 which was the reason why there were more residual metals in the cathode layer furthermore it should be noted that the residual state content of each metal in the anode layer was always greater than that of in middle layer the microstructures of the sludge surface in close contact with the anode were shown in fig s4 which was similar to the sem of metal doping with silica 56 indeed the sludge contained sediment from the primary sedimentation tank and had silt and contains a lot of silicon compounds it was speculated that some metal doping with silica lattice occurred at the anode resulting in the increase of residual fraction at the anode layer 3 5 the mechanism of interaction between metal speciation and edw overall the changes in ph and redox potential arising as a result of the application of an electric field could lead to changes in metal speciation the mechanism for the current to rise can be activated by the formation of exchangeable charged intermediates relating to metal and the electrochemical reaction of the metallic compound it owes to the fact that more ions migrate to balance the charge and more electrochemical reactions can take place at the electrodes which is beneficial to increase the removal of water 29 in edw process in addition the increase in ph and the electrochemical transformation can lead to the formation of non ionic metallics chemical system which could add the electrical resistance 57 and prevent the dewatering of sludge furthermore different metals have different variation regulations of oxidable fraction and reducible fraction and their redox reactions may gain or lose electrons at the electrode thus maintaining the current in the edw process 4 conclusion this study attempted to investigate the performance and metal speciation of steel industrial sludge during the edw process and explored the related mechanisms of the process the results showed that edw treatment significantly enhances dewaterability of steel industrial sludge different from the other sludge twice or three times current rises appeared in the electroosmotic dewatering process of industrial sludge it could be caused by electrolysis reactions and the formation of charged intermediates in addition metals of different speciation were interchangeable and redistributed during the edw process the speciation of ca and zn between different layers is mainly affected by electromigration and electroosmotic flow whereas the speciation of fe and al was obviously affected by oxidizing atmosphere declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13128,lignosulfonate a byproduct from biomass pretreatment spent liquor was used to fabricate lignosulfonate n butylaniline ls nba hollow microspheres at room temperature the fabricated ls nba was used as biosorbent for remediation of hazardous cr vi when the mass fraction of ls was 10 ls nba 10 with n content of 7 73 showed the maximum adsorption capacity 840 42 mg g 1 of cr vi the adsorption process of cr vi by ls nba 10 was in line with the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetic model the calculated thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of cr vi on ls nba 10 was a spontaneously endothermic process in addition ls nba 10 exhibited splendid removal ability of cr vi in real industrial wastewater of which the residual concentration was decreased from 255 mg l 1 to 0 005 mg l 1 that is below the permission value of drinking water recommended by the environmental protection agency epa the mechanism of cr vi remediation was also discussed the results are conducive to the application of lignin based biosorbents in the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cr vi removal hollow microspheres lignosulfonate mechanism selectivity 1 introduction with the development of modern industry a large number of industrial wastes including slag and dust are discharged causing serious environmental pollution chromium waste was mainly produced during the production of elemental chromium and chromium compounds 1 2 as known cr vi contained in cr waste is a highly toxic heavy metal pollutant which is 300 times more toxic than cr iii 3 4 the existence of cr vi easily induces cancer and cell mutation which seriously threatens the health of organisms 5 6 therefore eliminating cr vi from aquatic environment or converting it into cr iii with lower toxicity plays a crucial role in protecting ecological environment and human health the currently reported methods 7 9 for eliminating cr vi ions include chemical precipitation ion exchange flocculation microbial treatment adsorption etc the chemical precipitation and flocculation methods are easy in operation and stable in performance however these methods are suitable for treating cr vi containing wastewater with high concentration and the precipitated sludge may cause secondary pollution the microbial treatment has the disadvantages of long processing cycle and low processing efficiency compared with the above technologies adsorption technology possesses unique advantages 10 11 including low cost simple operation high removal rate and low secondary pollution one of the crucial factors in cr vi containing wastewater processing by adsorption is the selection of easily prepared and eco friendly adsorbent with good adsorption performance nowadays natural polymers like cellulose agriculture byproducts lignin have aroused extensive interest lignin is the main component in lignocellulosic biomass which is second only to cellulose on earth the annual output of lignin is 70 million tons 12 nevertheless the main application of lignin is to be a low value added fuel which results in large quantities of greenhouse gases emission on the other hand lignin and its derivatives are considered as potential adsorption candidates due to its aromatic properties and various functional groups 13 14 however original lignin exhibits relatively low adsorption amount for cr vi for instance the adsorption amount was only 17 97 mg g 1 by the lignin separated from pulping black liquor 15 hence the modification of lignin is inevitable for improving the affinity to cr vi various modification methods have been developed for preparing the lignin based adsorbents the vital issue for lignin modification is the introduction of various functional groups for instance the oxygen and nitrogen containing groups amine groups were verified as the efficient functional groups of heavy metals adsorption lü et al 16 prepared poly n butylaniline lignosulfonate composite nanospheres which possessed excellent silver ion adsorption capacity the adsorption mechanism mainly involved chelation ion exchange and reduction xiao et al 17 prepared diethylenetriamine grafted lignin which showed good adsorption performance for ag i hg ii cd ii pb ii cu ii and zn ii nevertheless most of the amine modifications were focused on the remediation of cationic heavy metals the researches focused on anionic metal oxides removal by lignin composites are relatively few wang et al 18 synthesized a quaternary amine grafted organosolv lignin biosorbent to adsorb cr vi the adsorption equilibrium could be achieved within 10 min while the adsorption capacity of cr vi was only 25 1 mg g 1 therefore lignin based anionic adsorbents with high adsorption performance need to be developed urgently herein this work used the lignosulfonate extracted from sporl spent liquor as the raw material the lignosulfonate butylaniline ls nba hollow microspheres were fabricated at room temperature after modification by nba the physicochemical properties of ls nba composites were characterized through elemental analysis ftir sem tem and xps under different adsorption conditions such as initial ph initial concentration of cr vi adsorption time temperature and coexisting ions the adsorption performance of ls nba 10 was evaluated by batch adsorption experiments the reusability of the ls nba 10 was investigated ultimately the adsorption kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics were investigated and the reactive cr vi removal mechanism was provided 2 experimental 2 1 materials lignosulfonate ls was produced from the sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocellulose sporl pretreatment liquor of douglas fir 19 denoted as ls n butyl

on the previous study 16 the ls nba hollow microspheres were prepared via the following procedure fig 1 specifically dried ls 0 166 g was put into 25 ml hcl solution 1 0 mol l 1 after stirring at ambient temperature for 30 min 1 1 ml 10 mmol nba was added to the mixed solution 2 28 g aps was dissolved in 25 ml hcl solution and poured into the above solution without any stirring the solution was kept still at ambient temperature for 24 h the obtained mixture was rinsed with distilled water until the filtrate ph was stable the ls nba 10 was obtained after drying at 60 c by changing the amount of ls the composites with the mass fraction of 7 5 12 5 and 20 were prepared denoted as ls nba 7 5 ls nba 12 5 and ls nba 20 respectively 2 3 characterization the element contents were measured

a fei tecnai g2 f20 u twin at a working voltage of 200 kv 2 4 cr vi removal experiments different mass of k2cr2o7 was dissolved in deionized water to get cr vi solution with different concentrations in all of the adsorption experiments 0 05 g of ls or ls nba was added in 50 ml of cr vi solution thenceforth the solution was kept stirring at 150 rpm the ph value of the solution was adjusted by 1 0 mol l 1 hcl and naoh different initial ph 2 6 adsorption time 0 72 h adsorption temperature 25 45 c and initial cr vi concentration 800 1200 mg l 1 were studied the effect of coexisting ions 0 200 mg l 1 on the adsorption performance of ls nba was also studied the cr vi concentration in the solution was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer at 542 nm the cr vi adsorption capacity qe was calculated by eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e m v in which c0 and ce represents the original and equilibrium cr vi concentration mg l 1 respectively m means the adsorbent weight 0 05 g and v represents the solution volume 0 05 l the desorption experiments were performed to study the reusability of the ls nba 10 0 05 g of ls nba 10 was added into 50 ml cr vi solution at 35 c the recycled ls nba 10 was dealt with naoh solution 0 05 m under 35 c after desorption it was used to adsorb cr vi again 3 results and discussion ls nbas composites were prepared to remove cr vi from aqueous solution the introduced amine groups might be protonated under acid condition which can enhance the electrostatic interaction between the composite and anionic cr vi moreover the oxygen containing groups on the composites might be beneficial for the removal of cr vi the adsorption performance of ls nbas was systematically investigated under different conditions moreover the structural characterizations of ls nbas as well as the adsorption mechanism were conducted 3 1 effect of ls dosage the effect of ls dosages on the adsorption capacity of ls nbas for cr vi was conducted at cr vi concentration of 1000 mg l 1 and 35 c as observed in fig 2 grafting nba to modify ls has a positive effect on cr vi removal after 24 h of adsorption the adsorption capacity of cr vi by pure ls is only 409 3 mg g 1 while the adsorption capacity of modified ls nbas is more than 559 7 mg g 1 the improved adsorption capacity may be attributed to the introduction of amino groups and active groups on ls nbas in addition with the increasing ls dosage from 7 5 to 20 the adsorption capacity of modified ls increases first and then decreases it reaches the maximum value of 655 5 mg g 1 when the content of ls is 10 when the mass fraction of ls is relatively low excessive nba cannot be completely grafted on the surface of ls as ls dosages increase the adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 is higher than that of ls nba 7 5 610 2 mg g 1 which indicates that increasing ls content is conducive to the distribution of nba however when the ls content is increased to 12 5 or even 20 it is difficult for the complete modification of ls by limited nba molecules therefore the number of amino groups on the surface of ls reduces which results in a decrease in adsorption capacity in addition the nonmonotonic variation of the adsorption capacity of cr vi with the increase of ls content indicates that the adsorption process is the result of the combined effect of active sites 20 according to the adsorption capacity ls nba 10 was chosen as the adsorbent for the following studies 3 2 structural characterization 3 2 1 elemental analysis and ftir the elemental analysis of ls and ls nbas are listed in table 1 ls itself contains only 0 07 of n indicating that ls almost contains no element of n after modification the n content of ls nbas increases obviously which indicates that the amine groups of nba are successfully grafted on ls when the proportion of ls increases from 7 5 to 10 the content of n increases from 7 55 to 7 73 which is related to the growing amine receptor sites on ls as ls content further increases the proportion of n content decreases to less than 7 which is caused by the relatively low dosage of nba and the insufficient supply of amine functional groups for ls modification the content of other elements such as s and o also change which is related to the changes of the number of amine groups grafted on ls the ftir spectra of different adsorbents are showed in fig 3 the peak at 2940 cm 1 is attributed to ch stretching in methyl and methylene 21 22 the peak at 1503 cm 1 is typical of cc stretching vibration of aromatic group 23 compared with ls the introduction of nba increases the number of ls surface functional groups for instance the cn peak on the benzene ring represents at 1304 cm 1 24 25 the band at 1152 cm 1 is assigned to the cn stretch of the nh ch3 group 26 the strong peak at 817 cm 1 is attributed to the vibration of ch 27 the existence of these new peaks indicates that nba is successfully grafted on ls 3 2 2 sem and tem analysis sem images were taken to observe the size and morphology changes of ls before and after modification from a microscopic perspective the ls shows the dense blocky morphology with the smooth surface fig 4a while the modified ls nbas are mainly composed of clusters of microspheres fig 4 b h fig s1 the surface of the formed microspheres partially adheres to each other and some small sunken are observed on their surface which might be attributed to chemical fusion during the formation of microspheres with increasing content of ls the spherical shapes and size are almost unchanged taking ls nba 10 as an example fig 4 b f the size distribution is narrow and the average diameter of the microsphere clusters formed is about 2 31 μm however with increasing ls dosages there are increasing particles appeared at the surface of microspheres especially for the ls nba 20 fig s1 g i it suggests that ls acts as a dispersant to make the structure of the assembled microspheres looser 16 in addition the microspheres are partly hollow fig 4 g h the tem images fig 5 of ls nba 10 further confirms the microsphere structure the images show that the microspheres have obvious hollow spherical morphology its diameter is about 2 46 μm which is consistent with the sem size fig 5a in addition the surface of microspheres has a relatively thick spherical shell with uniform surface architectures the thickness of which is about 0 74 μm 3 3 adsorption of cr vi on ls nba 10 3 3 1 effect of initial ph the surface charge of the adsorbent and the chemical morphology of cr vi are highly dependent on the initial ph thus it is very important to investigate the influence of the initial ph on the adsorption process at ph 2 cr vi in solution is mainly hcro4 28 with the increase of ph the chemical morphology of cr vi gradually changes to cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 29 30 as shown in fig 6 when ph 2 0 ls nba 10 has the most excellent adsorption capacity for cr vi and the adsorption capacity and removal rate is 220 36 mg l 1 and 73 46 respectively under low ph value the active groups such as amino groups on ls nba 10 surface are easily protonated which makes the ls nba 10 surface positively charged 31 the cr vi anions in the solution are attracted to the ls nba 10 by electrostatic interaction with the increase of ph the degree of protonation on ls nba 10 surfaces decreases moreover the species of cr vi also changes therefore when ph increases from 2 to 6 the adsorption capacity and removal rate of cr vi by ls nba 10 decreases significantly to 39 85 mg l 1 and 13 28 respectively in the following adsorption experiments ph 2 0 was selected 3 3 2 effect of adsorption time in first 6 h of adsorption the amount of residual cr vi in the solution rapidly decreases from the initial 800 mg l 1 to 377 30 mg l 1 whereas the removal rate of cr vi by ls nba 10 is obviously increases to 52 84 fig s3 under the impetus of strong mass transfer at the initial adsorption stage extensive active sites on the surface of ls nba 10 are quickly occupied by cr vi in the solution with the extension of time 6 48 h the cr vi concentration in solution further decreases meanwhile the active sites gradually reaches saturation the mass transfer impetus between solid and liquid phases weakens thereby the adsorption rate slows down after 72 h of adsorption the adsorption process is close to equilibrium 3 3 3 effect of temperature three different temperatures were chosen to investigate the effect of temperature on adsorption process as displayed in fig s4 the adsorption capacity of cr vi by ls nba 10 increases with the increase of temperature at initial cr vi concentration of 800 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 increases from 662 22 mg g 1 at 25 c to 709 35 mg g 1 at 45 c the increase of temperature can enhance the collision efficiency of ls nba 10 and chromium ions and promote the binding of chromium ions and surface active sites thus improving the adsorption performance of ls nba 10 32 33 meanwhile the increase of temperature leads to the increase of adsorption capacity indicating that the adsorption of cr vi by ls nba 10 is an endothermic reaction 3 3 4 effect of initial concentration according to fig 7 the initial concentration has a great influence on the adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 at a low concentration of 800 mg l 1 the removal rate of cr vi by ls nba 10 reaches 87 3 while the cr vi adsorption capacity is 698 2 mg g 1 when the initial concentration increases to 1200 mg l 1 the removal rate is only 64 3 while the cr vi adsorption amount achieves 772 2 mg g 1 the higher the concentration of cr vi in the solution is the higher the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is the higher ion concentration has higher potential energy and driving force which helps cr vi to be adsorbed on the surface of ls nba 10 34 the removal rate decreases with the increased concentration therefore the adsorbent amount should be appropriately increased to improve the removal efficiency in practical application 3 4 adsorption kinetic study pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models were used to simulate the experimental data for better understanding the mechanism of adsorption process their equations are as follows 35 36 2 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g 1 is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min 1 is the pfo and pso rate constant respectively at the three concentrations the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 of the pfo ranges from 0 9447 to 0 9560 while that of the pso ranges from 0 9959 to 0 9972 table 2 the r2 of the pso are all larger than those of the pfo moreover the theoretical value of cr vi adsorption capacity predicted by pso is in better accordance with the experimental value for instance at cr vi concentration of 1200 mg l 1 the qe predicted by pso 781 25 mg g 1 is closer to qe exp 772 20 mg g 1 than that predicted by pfo 416 08 mg g 1 hence the kinetics of the adsorption process matches well with the pso kinetic model the results reveal that the chemisorption is possibly the rate control step during cr vi adsorption process 37 38 the chemisorption might be attributed to the chemical interaction between cr vi and functional groups on ls nba 10 such as carboxyl amine and hydroxy groups any metal ions adsorbed from the aqueous phase maybe undergo membrane diffusion and or particle internal diffusion for determining the factors controlling the adsorption diffusion the cr vi adsorption data at different initial concentrations were fitted with the internal diffusion model the equation 39 is 4 q t k id t 0 5 c in which kid mg g 1 min 0 5 means the internal diffusion rate constant of cr vi c means the internal diffusion model constant the fitted curves and detailed data are exhibited in fig s6 and table 3 as shown in fig s6 the fitting diagram is divided into three linear parts indicating that the adsorption process of cr vi on ls nba 10 at different concentrations is mainly divided into three stages i the initial sharp part 0 240 min is a fast adsorption process in this process cr vi diffuses from the solution to the surface of ls nba 10 and is adsorbed on the outer surface of ls nba 10 at this stage the high concentration of cr vi in solution results in the highest mass transfer power and adsorption rate ii this stage 240 1440 min belongs to the internal diffusion stage where cr vi gradually diffuses into the interior of ls nba 10 during this stage the ion concentration decreases the mass transfer impetus gradually decreases therefore the adsorption rate starts to decrease iii the last stage 1440 min onward represents the ultimate equilibrium stage the concentration of residual cr vi ions in the solution is lower thereby the adsorption rate and the adsorption process gradually reaches equilibrium state the rate constant of the three stages is kid 3 kid 2 kid 1 signifying that the boundary thickness gets thicker stage by stage 40 since the fitting line does not pass through the origin c 0 it reflects that the adsorption rate is not fully controlled by the internal diffusion of particles other kinetic models also participate in the process of controlling the adsorption rate 41 3 5 adsorption isotherms study langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to fit cr vi adsorption data their expressions are as follows 5 langmuir q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n where qm represents the maximum number of cr vi ions in the monomolecular layer mg g 1 kl represents the langmuir constant which is correlated with the affinity of cr vi for adsorption sites l mg 1 ce means the residual concentration of solute in solution mg l 1 kf and n represent the freundlich rate constants designated as adsorption amount l g 1 and adsorption intensity respectively the magnitude of the exponent 1 n indicates the favorability of adsorption 1 1 n 0 reflects that the adsorption is favorable the basic feature of the langmuir adsorption model is often depicted by the separation factor rl 7 r l 1 1 k l c o rl value between 0 and 1 signifies favorable adsorption in addition rl 0 rl 1 and rl 1 represents that the adsorption is irreversible unfavorable and linear respectively 42 the fitted curves are displayed in figs 8 and s7 the calculated parameters are listed in tables s2 and s3 compared with freundlich model langmuir model has a higher r2 demonstrating that the adsorption of cr vi on ls nba 10 is a monolayer adsorption at 25 35 and 45 c the value range of another parameter rl is 5 98 10 2 8 71 10 2 6 37 10 3 9 52 10 3 and 8 44 10 4 1 27 10 3 respectively rl satisfies the condition of 0 rl 1 revealing that the adsorption process of cr vi onto ls nba 10 is favorable in the concentration range studied based on the predicted value from langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount of cr vi reaches 840 42 mg g 1 at 45 c which is more superior to most of other amines modified adsorbents as listed in the table 4 3 6 adsorption thermodynamics study for deeply elucidating the properties of the adsorption process we calculated the relevant thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy change δg o entropy change δs o and enthalpy change δh o by the following equations 51 52 8 ln k d δ s o r δ h o rt 9 δ g o δ h o tδ s o where kd ml g 1 means the thermodynamic equilibrium constant r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t k represents the absolute temperature we fitted the experimental data at cr vi concentration of 800 mg g 1 the results are shown in fig s8 and table 5 according to the calculation results the value of δg o is always negative at different temperatures reflecting that the reaction is spontaneous in nature moreover with increasing temperature the value of δg o decreases from 12 314 to 27 140 kj mol 1 which demonstrates that the process is favorable at high temperature 53 the value of δs o is positive which reflects some structural changes of cr vi and ls nba 10 in this process these changes result in an increase of randomness at the solid solution interface the positive value of δh o exhibits the endothermic property of the process and the temperature increment is in favor of the adsorption which is in good accordance with the experimental results 3 7 coexistence ions study the common ions in water such as ni2 cu2 zn2 cl no3 and so4 2 were selected to elucidate the influence of different concentration of coexisting ions on cr vi removal among all types of co existing ions the effect of cations is inessential fig 9 for instance with the addition of 200 mg l 1 ni2 the adsorption amount of cr vi slightly drops from 592 59 to 570 29 mg g 1 in terms of anions different from our previous works 28 54 cl exhibits the highest inhibition of note even with addition of 200 mg l 1 of cl the adsorption amount only drops to 523 72 mg g 1 herein it fully proves the outstanding selectivity of ls nba 10 to cr vi 3 8 desorption study it is of vital economic significance to investigate the reuse of adsorbent in industrial wastewater the content of chromium generally does not exceed 300 mg l 1 55 therefore cr vi solution of 300 mg l 1 was used for cyclic testing after ls nba 10 adsorbed cr vi for 1 h it was treated with 0 05 m naoh for desorption as illustrated in fig 10 after four cycles the removal efficiency of cr vi by ls nba 10 is still kept at about 77 6 the results manifest that ls nba 10 has excellent chemical stability and reusable performance ls nba 10 is a promising adsorbent of heavy metal ions in wastewater 3 9 treatment of industrial cr vi containing wastewater fig 11 shows the change curves of adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 in industrial wastewater over time it can be seen that after just 4 h the residual cr vi concentration in wastewater is below 18 86 mg l 1 and the removal rate of cr vi is 92 60 after 12 h cr vi in the wastewater has been completely removed and the removal rate of ls nba 10 has reached 100 the residual cr vi concentration is below 0 005 mg l 1 which is far below the permission value of drinking water recommended by the environmental protection agency epa cr vi 0 05 mg l 1 56 the results demonstrate the adsorption potential of ls nba 10 in the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater 3 10 mechanism study to gain more insight of the adsorption mechanism ftir sem and xps were conducted before and after adsorption as displayed in fig 1 after cr vi adsorption the spectrum of ls nba 10 cr is significantly changed the peak intensity of the stretching vibration of methyl and methylene at 2940 cm 1 is lower than that of ls nba 10 at 1503 cm 1 the peak intensity of cc in aromatic group is weakened after adsorption meanwhile the cn peak at 1152 cm 1 and the ch peak at 817 cm 1 almost disappears the changes of these functional groups indicates that they play a vital role in cr vi adsorption process a new peak appeared at 544 cm 1 is ascribed to cro 29 in terms of the morphology the microsphere shape and hollow structure does not change significantly after the adsorption of cr vi by ls nba 10 fig 3i compared with the eds image of ls nba 10 fig s3a the signal of chromium element appears at the eds image of ls nba 10 cr fig s3b this manifests that cr vi is successfully adsorbed by ls nba 10 the surface chemical composition of the ls nba 10 before and after adsorption was determined by xps as displayed in fig 12a the chromium element is determined on ls nba 10 cr verifying that cr is adsorbed on the surface of ls nba 10 the normalized mass content of cr is 4 43 after adsorption table s1 besides the proportion of c and n decreases significantly after adsorption from 70 49 and 13 8 to 55 43 and 7 88 respectively however the content of o increases markedly from 15 4 to 32 27 which might be ascribed to the adsorbed cro the cr 2p spectrum of ls nba 10 cr is displayed in fig 12b the peak of cr 2p could be deconvoluted into two forms cr vi with cr vi o and cr iii with cr iii oh 29 moreover no matter in the peak of cr 2p1 2 or cr 2p3 2 the content of cr iii is always higher than that of cr vi indicating that adsorption reduction occupies an irreplaceable position in the reaction as observed in fig 12c the c 1s peak can be fitted into three main components after adsorption the co functional group content at 285 9 ev 57 significantly reduces from 33 6 before adsorption to 28 1 however the content of co functional group at 287 9 ev 54 increases from 0 8 before adsorption to 11 5 after adsorption indicating that co functional group is oxidized to co functional group during adsorption 58 correspondingly the high toxic cr vi is reduced to cr iii with low toxicity the changes of co and co at 533 7 ev and 531 4 ev in the o 1s xps spectra fig 12d further confirm this result 29 at the same time a new characteristic peak appears at 529 9 ev in the o 1s xps spectrum after adsorption indicating that cr vi is attached to the surface of ls nba 10 as oxygen containing particles 59 in terms of n 1s there appears a new peak at 401 6 ev which is ascribed to nh 60 it signifies that the functional groups containing n are protonated at ph 2 which enhances the adsorption of cr vi anions herein the predicted reactive removal mechanism of cr vi by ls nba 10 is displayed in fig 13 at ph 2 3 cr vi mainly exists in the form of hcro4 61 therefore under experimental conditions hcro4 ion was the dominant species in the solution moreover at low ph the adsorbent surface is protonated and adsorbs a large amount of h eq 10 so electrostatic attraction exists during the adsorption process eq 11 besides the electron donors in ls nba 10 such as co cn can reduce cr vi to cr iii eqs 12 and 13 in addition the oxygen rich groups and amino groups can adsorb cr vi and cr iii ions through complexation eqs 14 and 15 10 c

conclusions the ls nba hollow microspheres were developed for efficient remediation of cr vi in wastewater the spherical size is mainly between 1 5 3 μm the maximum adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 was 840 42 mg g 1 which was superior to the other lignin based biosorbents reported previously the ls nba 10 exhibited excellent selectivity for cr vi in addition the recycle of adsorbent provided a bright prospect for saving cost and improving economic benefit the effective removal of cr vi from wastewater by ls nba 10 was mainly attributed to the electrostatic attraction reduction and complexation owing to the abundant reserves of lignin the fabrication of lignin based composites has great prospect the ls nba has a wide application prospect in actual wastewater treatment

13128,lignosulfonate a byproduct from biomass pretreatment spent liquor was used to fabricate lignosulfonate n butylaniline ls nba hollow microspheres at room temperature the fabricated ls nba was used as biosorbent for remediation of hazardous cr vi when the mass fraction of ls was 10 ls nba 10 with n content of 7 73 showed the maximum adsorption capacity 840 42 mg g 1 of cr vi the adsorption process of cr vi by ls nba 10 was in line with the langmuir isotherm model and pseudo second order kinetic model the calculated thermodynamic parameters showed that the adsorption of cr vi on ls nba 10 was a spontaneously endothermic process in addition ls nba 10 exhibited splendid removal ability of cr vi in real industrial wastewater of which the residual concentration was decreased from 255 mg l 1 to 0 005 mg l 1 that is below the permission value of drinking water recommended by the environmental protection agency epa the mechanism of cr vi remediation was also discussed the results are conducive to the application of lignin based biosorbents in the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cr vi removal hollow microspheres lignosulfonate mechanism selectivity 1 introduction with the development of modern industry a large number of industrial wastes including slag and dust are discharged causing serious environmental pollution chromium waste was mainly produced during the production of elemental chromium and chromium compounds 1 2 as known cr vi contained in cr waste is a highly toxic heavy metal pollutant which is 300 times more toxic than cr iii 3 4 the existence of cr vi easily induces cancer and cell mutation which seriously threatens the health of organisms 5 6 therefore eliminating cr vi from aquatic environment or converting it into cr iii with lower toxicity plays a crucial role in protecting ecological environment and human health the currently reported methods 7 9 for eliminating cr vi ions include chemical precipitation ion exchange flocculation microbial treatment adsorption etc the chemical precipitation and flocculation methods are easy in operation and stable in performance however these methods are suitable for treating cr vi containing wastewater with high concentration and the precipitated sludge may cause secondary pollution the microbial treatment has the disadvantages of long processing cycle and low processing efficiency compared with the above technologies adsorption technology possesses unique advantages 10 11 including low cost simple operation high removal rate and low secondary pollution one of the crucial factors in cr vi containing wastewater processing by adsorption is the selection of easily prepared and eco friendly adsorbent with good adsorption performance nowadays natural polymers like cellulose agriculture byproducts lignin have aroused extensive interest lignin is the main component in lignocellulosic biomass which is second only to cellulose on earth the annual output of lignin is 70 million tons 12 nevertheless the main application of lignin is to be a low value added fuel which results in large quantities of greenhouse gases emission on the other hand lignin and its derivatives are considered as potential adsorption candidates due to its aromatic properties and various functional groups 13 14 however original lignin exhibits relatively low adsorption amount for cr vi for instance the adsorption amount was only 17 97 mg g 1 by the lignin separated from pulping black liquor 15 hence the modification of lignin is inevitable for improving the affinity to cr vi various modification methods have been developed for preparing the lignin based adsorbents the vital issue for lignin modification is the introduction of various functional groups for instance the oxygen and nitrogen containing groups amine groups were verified as the efficient functional groups of heavy metals adsorption lü et al 16 prepared poly n butylaniline lignosulfonate composite nanospheres which possessed excellent silver ion adsorption capacity the adsorption mechanism mainly involved chelation ion exchange and reduction xiao et al 17 prepared diethylenetriamine grafted lignin which showed good adsorption performance for ag i hg ii cd ii pb ii cu ii and zn ii nevertheless most of the amine modifications were focused on the remediation of cationic heavy metals the researches focused on anionic metal oxides removal by lignin composites are relatively few wang et al 18 synthesized a quaternary amine grafted organosolv lignin biosorbent to adsorb cr vi the adsorption equilibrium could be achieved within 10 min while the adsorption capacity of cr vi was only 25 1 mg g 1 therefore lignin based anionic adsorbents with high adsorption performance need to be developed urgently herein this work used the lignosulfonate extracted from sporl spent liquor as the raw material the lignosulfonate butylaniline ls nba hollow microspheres were fabricated at room temperature after modification by nba the physicochemical properties of ls nba composites were characterized through elemental analysis ftir sem tem and xps under different adsorption conditions such as initial ph initial concentration of cr vi adsorption time temperature and coexisting ions the adsorption performance of ls nba 10 was evaluated by batch adsorption experiments the reusability of the ls nba 10 was investigated ultimately the adsorption kinetics isotherm and thermodynamics were investigated and the reactive cr vi removal mechanism was provided 2 experimental 2 1 materials lignosulfonate ls was produced from the sulfite pretreatment to overcome recalcitrance of lignocellulose sporl pretreatment liquor of douglas fir 19 denoted as ls n butyl aniline nba ammonium persulfate aps k2cr2o7 and sym diphenylcarbazide were purchased from macklin reagent co ltd shanghai china other chemicals including ethanol hcl h2so4 cu no3 2 3h2o ni no3 2 6h2o zn no3 2 6h2o nacl na2so4 and nano3 were purchased from kelong chemical co ltd chengdu china all the above chemical reagents were analytical grade 2 2 preparation of ls nba hollow microspheres based on the previous study 16 the ls nba hollow microspheres were prepared via the following procedure fig 1 specifically dried ls 0 166 g was put into 25 ml hcl solution 1 0 mol l 1 after stirring at ambient temperature for 30 min 1 1 ml 10 mmol nba was added to the mixed solution 2 28 g aps was dissolved in 25 ml hcl solution and poured into the above solution without any stirring the solution was kept still at ambient temperature for 24 h the obtained mixture was rinsed with distilled water until the filtrate ph was stable the ls nba 10 was obtained after drying at 60 c by changing the amount of ls the composites with the mass fraction of 7 5 12 5 and 20 were prepared denoted as ls nba 7 5 ls nba 12 5 and ls nba 20 respectively 2 3 characterization the element contents were measured using an elemental analyzer elementar vario el iii flash smart germany the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra were obtained on a nicolet is50 ftir spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific in the range of 4000 to 400 cm 1 the morphological characteristics were evaluated using a scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive spectrometer eds apreo fei hillsboro usa x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was measured on a vg escalab 250xi spectrometer thermo electron with an al kα 1486 ev x ray source transmission electron microscope tem images were obtained through a fei tecnai g2 f20 u twin at a working voltage of 200 kv 2 4 cr vi removal experiments different mass of k2cr2o7 was dissolved in deionized water to get cr vi solution with different concentrations in all of the adsorption experiments 0 05 g of ls or ls nba was added in 50 ml of cr vi solution thenceforth the solution was kept stirring at 150 rpm the ph value of the solution was adjusted by 1 0 mol l 1 hcl and naoh different initial ph 2 6 adsorption time 0 72 h adsorption temperature 25 45 c and initial cr vi concentration 800 1200 mg l 1 were studied the effect of coexisting ions 0 200 mg l 1 on the adsorption performance of ls nba was also studied the cr vi concentration in the solution was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer at 542 nm the cr vi adsorption capacity qe was calculated by eq 1 1 q e c 0 c e m v in which c0 and ce represents the original and equilibrium cr vi concentration mg l 1 respectively m means the adsorbent weight 0 05 g and v represents the solution volume 0 05 l the desorption experiments were performed to study the reusability of the ls nba 10 0 05 g of ls nba 10 was added into 50 ml cr vi solution at 35 c the recycled ls nba 10 was dealt with naoh solution 0 05 m under 35 c after desorption it was used to adsorb cr vi again 3 results and discussion ls nbas composites were prepared to remove cr vi from aqueous solution the introduced amine groups might be protonated under acid condition which can enhance the electrostatic interaction between the composite and anionic cr vi moreover the oxygen containing groups on the composites might be beneficial for the removal of cr vi the adsorption performance of ls nbas was systematically investigated under different conditions moreover the structural characterizations of ls nbas as well as the adsorption mechanism were conducted 3 1 effect of ls dosage the effect of ls dosages on the adsorption capacity of ls nbas for cr vi was conducted at cr vi concentration of 1000 mg l 1 and 35 c as observed in fig 2 grafting nba to modify ls has a positive effect on cr vi removal after 24 h of adsorption the adsorption capacity of cr vi by pure ls is only 409 3 mg g 1 while the adsorption capacity of modified ls nbas is more than 559 7 mg g 1 the improved adsorption capacity may be attributed to the introduction of amino groups and active groups on ls nbas in addition with the increasing ls dosage from 7 5 to 20 the adsorption capacity of modified ls increases first and then decreases it reaches the maximum value of 655 5 mg g 1 when the content of ls is 10 when the mass fraction of ls is relatively low excessive nba cannot be completely grafted on the surface of ls as ls dosages increase the adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 is higher than that of ls nba 7 5 610 2 mg g 1 which indicates that increasing ls content is conducive to the distribution of nba however when the ls content is increased to 12 5 or even 20 it is difficult for the complete modification of ls by limited nba molecules therefore the number of amino groups on the surface of ls reduces which results in a decrease in adsorption capacity in addition the nonmonotonic variation of the adsorption capacity of cr vi with the increase of ls content indicates that the adsorption process is the result of the combined effect of active sites 20 according to the adsorption capacity ls nba 10 was chosen as the adsorbent for the following studies 3 2 structural characterization 3 2 1 elemental analysis and ftir the elemental analysis of ls and ls nbas are listed in table 1 ls itself contains only 0 07 of n indicating that ls almost contains no element of n after modification the n content of ls nbas increases obviously which indicates that the amine groups of nba are successfully grafted on ls when the proportion of ls increases from 7 5 to 10 the content of n increases from 7 55 to 7 73 which is related to the growing amine receptor sites on ls as ls content further increases the proportion of n content decreases to less than 7 which is caused by the relatively low dosage of nba and the insufficient supply of amine functional groups for ls modification the content of other elements such as s and o also change which is related to the changes of the number of amine groups grafted on ls the ftir spectra of different adsorbents are showed in fig 3 the peak at 2940 cm 1 is attributed to ch stretching in methyl and methylene 21 22 the peak at 1503 cm 1 is typical of cc stretching vibration of aromatic group 23 compared with ls the introduction of nba increases the number of ls surface functional groups for instance the cn peak on the benzene ring represents at 1304 cm 1 24 25 the band at 1152 cm 1 is assigned to the cn stretch of the nh ch3 group 26 the strong peak at 817 cm 1 is attributed to the vibration of ch 27 the existence of these new peaks indicates that nba is successfully grafted on ls 3 2 2 sem and tem analysis sem images were taken to observe the size and morphology changes of ls before and after modification from a microscopic perspective the ls shows the dense blocky morphology with the smooth surface fig 4a while the modified ls nbas are mainly composed of clusters of microspheres fig 4 b h fig s1 the surface of the formed microspheres partially adheres to each other and some small sunken are observed on their surface which might be attributed to chemical fusion during the formation of microspheres with increasing content of ls the spherical shapes and size are almost unchanged taking ls nba 10 as an example fig 4 b f the size distribution is narrow and the average diameter of the microsphere clusters formed is about 2 31 μm however with increasing ls dosages there are increasing particles appeared at the surface of microspheres especially for the ls nba 20 fig s1 g i it suggests that ls acts as a dispersant to make the structure of the assembled microspheres looser 16 in addition the microspheres are partly hollow fig 4 g h the tem images fig 5 of ls nba 10 further confirms the microsphere structure the images show that the microspheres have obvious hollow spherical morphology its diameter is about 2 46 μm which is consistent with the sem size fig 5a in addition the surface of microspheres has a relatively thick spherical shell with uniform surface architectures the thickness of which is about 0 74 μm 3 3 adsorption of cr vi on ls nba 10 3 3 1 effect of initial ph the surface charge of the adsorbent and the chemical morphology of cr vi are highly dependent on the initial ph thus it is very important to investigate the influence of the initial ph on the adsorption process at ph 2 cr vi in solution is mainly hcro4 28 with the increase of ph the chemical morphology of cr vi gradually changes to cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 29 30 as shown in fig 6 when ph 2 0 ls nba 10 has the most excellent adsorption capacity for cr vi and the adsorption capacity and removal rate is 220 36 mg l 1 and 73 46 respectively under low ph value the active groups such as amino groups on ls nba 10 surface are easily protonated which makes the ls nba 10 surface positively charged 31 the cr vi anions in the solution are attracted to the ls nba 10 by electrostatic interaction with the increase of ph the degree of protonation on ls nba 10 surfaces decreases moreover the species of cr vi also changes therefore when ph increases from 2 to 6 the adsorption capacity and removal rate of cr vi by ls nba 10 decreases significantly to 39 85 mg l 1 and 13 28 respectively in the following adsorption experiments ph 2 0 was selected 3 3 2 effect of adsorption time in first 6 h of adsorption the amount of residual cr vi in the solution rapidly decreases from the initial 800 mg l 1 to 377 30 mg l 1 whereas the removal rate of cr vi by ls nba 10 is obviously increases to 52 84 fig s3 under the impetus of strong mass transfer at the initial adsorption stage extensive active sites on the surface of ls nba 10 are quickly occupied by cr vi in the solution with the extension of time 6 48 h the cr vi concentration in solution further decreases meanwhile the active sites gradually reaches saturation the mass transfer impetus between solid and liquid phases weakens thereby the adsorption rate slows down after 72 h of adsorption the adsorption process is close to equilibrium 3 3 3 effect of temperature three different temperatures were chosen to investigate the effect of temperature on adsorption process as displayed in fig s4 the adsorption capacity of cr vi by ls nba 10 increases with the increase of temperature at initial cr vi concentration of 800 mg l 1 the adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 increases from 662 22 mg g 1 at 25 c to 709 35 mg g 1 at 45 c the increase of temperature can enhance the collision efficiency of ls nba 10 and chromium ions and promote the binding of chromium ions and surface active sites thus improving the adsorption performance of ls nba 10 32 33 meanwhile the increase of temperature leads to the increase of adsorption capacity indicating that the adsorption of cr vi by ls nba 10 is an endothermic reaction 3 3 4 effect of initial concentration according to fig 7 the initial concentration has a great influence on the adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 at a low concentration of 800 mg l 1 the removal rate of cr vi by ls nba 10 reaches 87 3 while the cr vi adsorption capacity is 698 2 mg g 1 when the initial concentration increases to 1200 mg l 1 the removal rate is only 64 3 while the cr vi adsorption amount achieves 772 2 mg g 1 the higher the concentration of cr vi in the solution is the higher the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent is the higher ion concentration has higher potential energy and driving force which helps cr vi to be adsorbed on the surface of ls nba 10 34 the removal rate decreases with the increased concentration therefore the adsorbent amount should be appropriately increased to improve the removal efficiency in practical application 3 4 adsorption kinetic study pseudo first order pfo and pseudo second order pso kinetic models were used to simulate the experimental data for better understanding the mechanism of adsorption process their equations are as follows 35 36 2 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 3 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g 1 is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent at equilibrium and time t min respectively k1 min 1 and k2 g mg min 1 is the pfo and pso rate constant respectively at the three concentrations the linear regression correlation coefficient r2 of the pfo ranges from 0 9447 to 0 9560 while that of the pso ranges from 0 9959 to 0 9972 table 2 the r2 of the pso are all larger than those of the pfo moreover the theoretical value of cr vi adsorption capacity predicted by pso is in better accordance with the experimental value for instance at cr vi concentration of 1200 mg l 1 the qe predicted by pso 781 25 mg g 1 is closer to qe exp 772 20 mg g 1 than that predicted by pfo 416 08 mg g 1 hence the kinetics of the adsorption process matches well with the pso kinetic model the results reveal that the chemisorption is possibly the rate control step during cr vi adsorption process 37 38 the chemisorption might be attributed to the chemical interaction between cr vi and functional groups on ls nba 10 such as carboxyl amine and hydroxy groups any metal ions adsorbed from the aqueous phase maybe undergo membrane diffusion and or particle internal diffusion for determining the factors controlling the adsorption diffusion the cr vi adsorption data at different initial concentrations were fitted with the internal diffusion model the equation 39 is 4 q t k id t 0 5 c in which kid mg g 1 min 0 5 means the internal diffusion rate constant of cr vi c means the internal diffusion model constant the fitted curves and detailed data are exhibited in fig s6 and table 3 as shown in fig s6 the fitting diagram is divided into three linear parts indicating that the adsorption process of cr vi on ls nba 10 at different concentrations is mainly divided into three stages i the initial sharp part 0 240 min is a fast adsorption process in this process cr vi diffuses from the solution to the surface of ls nba 10 and is adsorbed on the outer surface of ls nba 10 at this stage the high concentration of cr vi in solution results in the highest mass transfer power and adsorption rate ii this stage 240 1440 min belongs to the internal diffusion stage where cr vi gradually diffuses into the interior of ls nba 10 during this stage the ion concentration decreases the mass transfer impetus gradually decreases therefore the adsorption rate starts to decrease iii the last stage 1440 min onward represents the ultimate equilibrium stage the concentration of residual cr vi ions in the solution is lower thereby the adsorption rate and the adsorption process gradually reaches equilibrium state the rate constant of the three stages is kid 3 kid 2 kid 1 signifying that the boundary thickness gets thicker stage by stage 40 since the fitting line does not pass through the origin c 0 it reflects that the adsorption rate is not fully controlled by the internal diffusion of particles other kinetic models also participate in the process of controlling the adsorption rate 41 3 5 adsorption isotherms study langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied to fit cr vi adsorption data their expressions are as follows 5 langmuir q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n where qm represents the maximum number of cr vi ions in the monomolecular layer mg g 1 kl represents the langmuir constant which is correlated with the affinity of cr vi for adsorption sites l mg 1 ce means the residual concentration of solute in solution mg l 1 kf and n represent the freundlich rate constants designated as adsorption amount l g 1 and adsorption intensity respectively the magnitude of the exponent 1 n indicates the favorability of adsorption 1 1 n 0 reflects that the adsorption is favorable the basic feature of the langmuir adsorption model is often depicted by the separation factor rl 7 r l 1 1 k l c o rl value between 0 and 1 signifies favorable adsorption in addition rl 0 rl 1 and rl 1 represents that the adsorption is irreversible unfavorable and linear respectively 42 the fitted curves are displayed in figs 8 and s7 the calculated parameters are listed in tables s2 and s3 compared with freundlich model langmuir model has a higher r2 demonstrating that the adsorption of cr vi on ls nba 10 is a monolayer adsorption at 25 35 and 45 c the value range of another parameter rl is 5 98 10 2 8 71 10 2 6 37 10 3 9 52 10 3 and 8 44 10 4 1 27 10 3 respectively rl satisfies the condition of 0 rl 1 revealing that the adsorption process of cr vi onto ls nba 10 is favorable in the concentration range studied based on the predicted value from langmuir model the maximum adsorption amount of cr vi reaches 840 42 mg g 1 at 45 c which is more superior to most of other amines modified adsorbents as listed in the table 4 3 6 adsorption thermodynamics study for deeply elucidating the properties of the adsorption process we calculated the relevant thermodynamic parameters including gibbs free energy change δg o entropy change δs o and enthalpy change δh o by the following equations 51 52 8 ln k d δ s o r δ h o rt 9 δ g o δ h o tδ s o where kd ml g 1 means the thermodynamic equilibrium constant r is the gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t k represents the absolute temperature we fitted the experimental data at cr vi concentration of 800 mg g 1 the results are shown in fig s8 and table 5 according to the calculation results the value of δg o is always negative at different temperatures reflecting that the reaction is spontaneous in nature moreover with increasing temperature the value of δg o decreases from 12 314 to 27 140 kj mol 1 which demonstrates that the process is favorable at high temperature 53 the value of δs o is positive which reflects some structural changes of cr vi and ls nba 10 in this process these changes result in an increase of randomness at the solid solution interface the positive value of δh o exhibits the endothermic property of the process and the temperature increment is in favor of the adsorption which is in good accordance with the experimental results 3 7 coexistence ions study the common ions in water such as ni2 cu2 zn2 cl no3 and so4 2 were selected to elucidate the influence of different concentration of coexisting ions on cr vi removal among all types of co existing ions the effect of cations is inessential fig 9 for instance with the addition of 200 mg l 1 ni2 the adsorption amount of cr vi slightly drops from 592 59 to 570 29 mg g 1 in terms of anions different from our previous works 28 54 cl exhibits the highest inhibition of note even with addition of 200 mg l 1 of cl the adsorption amount only drops to 523 72 mg g 1 herein it fully proves the outstanding selectivity of ls nba 10 to cr vi 3 8 desorption study it is of vital economic significance to investigate the reuse of adsorbent in industrial wastewater the content of chromium generally does not exceed 300 mg l 1 55 therefore cr vi solution of 300 mg l 1 was used for cyclic testing after ls nba 10 adsorbed cr vi for 1 h it was treated with 0 05 m naoh for desorption as illustrated in fig 10 after four cycles the removal efficiency of cr vi by ls nba 10 is still kept at about 77 6 the results manifest that ls nba 10 has excellent chemical stability and reusable performance ls nba 10 is a promising adsorbent of heavy metal ions in wastewater 3 9 treatment of industrial cr vi containing wastewater fig 11 shows the change curves of adsorption capacity of ls nba 10 in industrial wastewater over time it can be seen that after just 4 h the residual cr vi concentration in wastewater is below 18 86 mg l 1 and the removal rate of cr vi is 92 60 after 12 h cr vi in the wastewater has been completely removed and the removal rate of ls nba 10 has reached 100 the residual cr vi concentration is below 0 005 mg l 1 which is far below the permission value of drinking water recommended by the environmental protection agency epa cr vi 0 05 mg l 1 56 the results demonstrate the adsorption potential of ls nba 10 in the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater 3 10 mechanism study to gain more insight of the adsorption mechanism ftir sem and xps were conducted before and after adsorption as displayed in fig 1 after cr vi adsorption the spectrum of ls nba 10 cr is significantly changed the peak intensity of the stretching vibration of methyl and methylene at 2940 cm 1 is lower than that of ls nba 10 at 1503 cm 1 the peak intensity of cc in aromatic group is weakened after adsorption meanwhile the cn peak at 1152 cm 1 and the ch peak at 817 cm 1 almost disappears the changes of these functional groups indicates that they play a vital role in cr vi adsorption process a new peak appeared at 544 cm 1 is ascribed to cro 29 in terms of the morphology the microsphere shape and hollow structure does not change significantly after the adsorption of cr vi by ls nba 10 fig 3i compared with the eds image of ls nba 10 fig s3a the signal of chromium element appears at the eds image of ls nba 10 cr fig s3b this manifests that cr vi is successfully adsorbed by ls nba 10 the surface chemical composition of the ls nba 10 before and after adsorption was determined by xps as displayed in fig 12a the chromium element is determined on ls nba 10 cr verifying that cr is adsorbed on the surface of ls nba 10 the normalized mass content of cr is 4 43 after adsorption table s1 besides the proportion of c and n decreases significantly after adsorption from 70 49 and 13 8 to 55 43 and 7 88 respectively however the content of o increases markedly from 15 4 to 32 27 which might be ascribed to the adsorbed cro the cr 2p spectrum of ls nba 10 cr is displayed in fig 12b the peak of cr 2p could be deconvoluted into two forms cr vi with cr vi o and cr iii with cr iii oh 29 moreover no matter in the peak of cr 2p1 2 or cr 2p3 2 the content of cr iii is always higher than that of cr vi indicating that adsorption reduction occupies an irreplaceable position in the reaction as observed in fig 12c the c 1s peak can be fitted into three main components after adsorption the co functional group content at 285 9 ev 57 significantly reduces from 33 6 before adsorption to 28 1 however the content of co functional group at 287 9 ev 54 increases from 0 8 before adsorption to 11 5 after adsorption indicating that co functional group is oxidized to co functional group during adsorption 58 correspondingly the high toxic cr vi is reduced to cr iii with low toxicity the changes of co and co at 533 7 ev and 531 4 ev in the o 1s xps spectra fig 12d further confirm this result 29 at the same time a new characteristic peak appears at 529 9 ev in the o 1s xps spectrum after adsorption indicating that cr vi is attached to the surface of ls nba 10 as oxygen containing particles 59 in terms of n 1s there appears a new peak at 401 6 ev which is ascribed to nh 60 it signifies that the functional groups containing n are protonated at ph 2 which enhances the adsorption of cr vi anions herein the predicted reactive removal mechanism of cr vi by ls nba 10 is displayed in fig 13 at ph 2 3 cr vi mainly exists in the form of hcro4 61 therefore under experimental conditions hcro4 ion was the dominant species in the solution moreover at low ph the adsorbent surface is protonated and adsorbs a large amount of h eq 10 so electrostatic attraction exists during the adsorption process eq 11 besides the electron donors in ls nba 10 such as co cn can reduce cr vi to cr iii eqs 12 and 13 in addition the oxygen rich groups and amino groups can adsorb cr vi and cr iii ions through complexation eqs 14 and 15 10 c

now there is no report about the removal of cd2 from aqueous solution using fcdi therefore fcdi is designed to treat wastewater containing heavy metal cadmium in this paper the objectives of this study are a to investigate the removal effect of cadmium ions under different solution conditions including initial cd2 concentration ph and applied voltage conditions and b to evaluate the performance of fcdi for treating target solution containing cadmium using multi cycle operation experiments the results obtained in this study would provide guidance for treating wastewater containing

millipore purification system millipore u s a 2 2 experiment designs and evaluation of cd2 removal batch experiments were carried out under different solution conditions to study the removal performance of cadmium ions by fcdi system unless otherwise stated a fcdi test was carried out with an initial cd2 concentration of 100 mg l at ph of 1 5 under an applied voltage of 1 2 v the flow rate of electrode liquid and inlet water is 20 ml min the volume of target solution and flow electrode liquid is 200 ml the detailed experiments are designed as listed in table 2 to investigate the effects of initial concentration ph and applied voltage the fcdi desalination tests i e test 1 test 2 and test 3 were carried out with a duration of 60 min under a temperature of 25 c for multi cycle fcdi experiment i e test 4 between each desalination experiment 60 min there was an interval of 10 min for reverse connect of the electrode to the graphite plate and the process contained 11 cycles when the electrode was reverse connected a reverse electric field is formed in the fcdi device and the cadmium ions previously adsorbed from the target solution in the mobile electrode slurry will return to the target solution 2 3 water quality analysis and evaluation of cd2 removal the concentration of cadmium ion is determined at the beginning and after the experiment the concentration 0 05 200 mg l of cd2 in aqueous solution was determined by icp oes optima 5300dv perkin elmer usa hno3 aladdin chemical china and naoh aladdin chemical china were used to adjust the solution ph the removal

physicochemical properties of activated carbon in flow electrode after continuous operation the electrode liquid was collected after the last desalination experiment and was dried before further measurement the surface functional groups of activated carbon powder were analyzed and the existing form of cadmium ion on activated carbon was determined to study the influence of cadmium ion treatment by fcdi on the pore structure of activated carbon the nitrogen adsorption desorption curve of activated carbon powder was measured by gas adsorption instrument asap 2020 quantachrome company usa and the pore structure distribution of activated carbon before and after the experiment was analyzed by qsdft queued solid density functional theory in this study x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kalpha thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyze the elemental composition and valence state of activated carbon powders and substances on ion exchange membranes after fcdi desalting and drying by flow electrode through membrane the functional groups of activated carbon before and after continuous desalination were analyzed by fourier infrared ftir spectrometer spectrum one perkinelmer corporation usa to study the changes of functional groups of activated carbon before and after the experiment the samples were scanned at wavenumbers of 4000 400 cm 1 for 32 times at a resolution of 1 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial concentrations of cadmium ions the removal efficiency and removal rates of cd2 in aqueous solution with different initial concentration of cd2 treated by fcdi are shown in fig 2 as presented in fig 2a during the desalting process when the initial concentration of cd2 was 0 5 10 50 100 and 200 mg l the removal efficiency of each group was 21 9 2 9 49 9 1 3 29 8 2 9 23 7 5 9 and 12 7 6 4 respectively with the increase of initial cd2 concentration in the target solution the removal efficiency of cd2 increased first and then decreased as shown in fig 2b with the increase of the initial cd2 concentration from 0 5 to 100 mg l the removal rate of each group gradually increased this phenomenon could mainly be attributed to adsorption desorption of cd2 on activated carbon in the flow electrode as well as the variation in electrical resistance and ph of the influent solution as discussed above the maximum mass of cd of the electrode solution in contact with the activated carbon is only 5 1 mg cd for the solution with the initial concentration of 200 mg l with volume of 200 ml and removal of 12 7 thus the adsorption of cd2 on activated carbon in the flow electrode was not saturated for a low initial concentration 37 moreover the electrical resistance varied significantly with different initial concentrations 0 5 200 mg l which would result in different current densities and removal efficiencies and the ph of solution ph 7 1 table 2 would also vary with different initial concentrations which would induce competitive migration between cd2 and h when the initial cd2 concentration is high the adsorption sites on the activated carbon became relatively insufficient and the adsorption process of cadmium ions on the activated carbon would quickly reach saturation 38 moreover there was no significant difference in removal rate for cd2 concentration of 100 and 200 mg l p 0 05 in addition as ph of the solution was not controlled in this test test 1 in table 1 the ph value of the target solution was greatly influenced by initial cd2 concentration in fact the ph ranged from 7 to 1 when the initial cd2 concentration increased from 0 5 to 200 mg l thus the performance of fcdi in different initial concentrations was also dependent on solution ph as discussed in section 3 2 therefore with the increase of the initial concentration of cadmium ion in the solution the removal of cadmium ion by fcdi increased first and then decreased and the removal rate increased gradually with the maximum removal efficiency 49 9 1 3 at 10 mg l and removal rate 0 32 mg min at 100 mg l 3 2 effect of solution ph fig 3 presents the cd2 removal performance of fcdi with an initial cd2 concentration of 100 mg l at different solution ph as shown in fig 3a when ph increased from 1 to 3 the removal efficiency increased from 18 6 to 53 7 and the removal efficiency decreased to 41 2 and 32 3 for ph of 5 and 7 respectively with respect to removal rate the peak of 0 67 mg min was observed at ph of 3 fig 3b at low ph e g ph 1 the concentration and activity of h are high which would compete with cd2 for the adsorption sites on the surface of activated carbon to form competitive adsorption 39 40 resulting in the low adsorption efficiency of activated carbon to cd2 meanwhile the high proton concentration would reduce the resistance and increase the current density thus h mainly migrated in this process then low ph would possibly relieve the cd oh 2 deposition on the membrane surface and improve the migration of cd2 when ph 1 5 h decreased resulting in the enhanced migration of cd2 when ph increased from 3 to 7 the concentration of h decreased and the competitive adsorption weakened the adsorption effect of activated carbon on cd2 increased leading to an increase in removal efficiency of cd2 when the h concentration became lower and the oh concentration increased cd oh 2 hydrolysis complexes were formed in the solution 41 42 this result could be confirmed by the increase of final ph in solution after operation with an increase of 1 29 0 4 0 1 and 0 07 for ph of 1 3 5 and 7 respectively the formed cd oh 2 hydrolysis complexes might block the flow channel in the fcdi system and adhere to the ion exchange membrane 39 43 resulting in the reduction of the removal efficiency of cd2 by fcdi overall with the increase of solution ph the removal of cadmium ion in the solution by fcdi first increased and then decreased with the maximum at ph of 3 3 3 effect of applied voltage and continuous operation of fcdi system in order to study the effect of voltage on the removal performance of cd2 by fcdi the role of applied different voltage in the removal rate and removal rate of cd2 in fcdi system was investigated with results presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 when the applied voltage was 0 1 2 v the driving force of ion migration gradually increased with the increase of the voltage and the greater the ion removal efficiency in this process only activated carbon transferred electrons for desalination when the applied voltage was 1 6 v the sharp increase of removal efficiency was because the voltage rise provides a greater driving force for ion migration and hydrolysis of water e g 1 23 v occurred accelerating ion migration 33 44 when the applied voltage was 1 6 2 4 v the removal efficiency did not change significantly with the increase in voltage because the ion concentration difference between the target solution and the mobile electrode decreased the resistance increased and the ion migration speed slowed down in general with the increase of voltage from 0 to 2 4 v the removal efficiency and removal rated for cd2 in solution by fcdi increased gradually as the basic principle of fcdi is electrostatic adsorption of ions the higher the applied voltage the greater the driving force of ion migration 35 thus better ion removal efficiency could be obtained under higher applied voltage 45 46 the removal efficiency at 2 4 v 47 6 was two times that at 1 2 v 24 1 demonstrating that the role of hydrolysis of the solution in cd2 removal for the investigated voltages 0 4 2 4 v was neglectable furthermore the continuous operation performance of fcdi system was investigated to determine whether excessive voltage led to solution electrolysis and decrease of desalting performance of fcdi 32 the initial concentration of cadmium ion in the inflow water was 100 mg l and the continuous desalination is carried out for 6 cycles i e 6 h at 1 2 v and 2 4 v respectively the target solution is replaced without changing the flow electrode in each experiment with results shown in fig 5 as presented in fig 5a the desalination rate was relative stable in each continuous desalination experiment under an applied voltage of 1 2 v ranging from 22 7 to 25 8 when applying an applied voltage of 2 4 v for continuous desalination experiments the desalination rate fluctuates in the range of 44 5 48 1 in each experiment these results further confirmed that the internal resistance of the fcdi system was too high resulting in the internal voltage of the system not reaching the electrolytic voltage of the target solution 47 48 at the end of the continuous experiment at 1 2 and 2 4 v the electrode liquid through the film was taken to measure the cd2 concentration after continuous experiment at 1 2 v the ratio of cd2 concentration in the electrode solution to the total removed cd2 concentration was 65 9 in comparison the ratio of cd2 concentration in electrode solution to total removed cd2 concentration after continuous experiment at 2 4 v is 82 8 the cd2 mass in the electrode liquid 27 5 mg is higher than that in the activated carbon 14 2 mg l the results indicated that the adsorption of cd2 by fcdi was continuous adsorption and desorption so that most of the adsorbed ions were desorbed and stored in the electrode liquid and the activated carbon was regenerated 26 when the flow electrode re entered the fcdi module the regenerated activated carbon had enough ion adsorption sites and good performance for removing cd2 in fcdi was expected 3 4 reusability of activated carbon electrode in fcdi system in order to investigate the regeneration and reuse performance of activated carbon after cd2 removal by fcdi the experiment was carried out for 11 times under 1 2 v voltage with the initial cd2 concentration of 100 mg l the target solution was changed every 1 h using 100 mg l cd2 aqueous solution the reusability of activated carbon electrode in fcdi systems for the removal of cd2 is presented in fig 6 during the experiment the conductivity of the target solution gradually decreased after adsorption for 1 h the conductivity reached a stable level and then the electrode was reversed and worked for 10 min the cd2 on the electrode was desorbed in the electrode solution under the action of reverse electric field as shown in fig 6a the removal efficiency of cd2 in each experiment was in the range of 24 3 28 9 after each reverse electrode operation for 10 min the cd2 concentration was used to determine the recovery rate of cd2 with results shown in fig 6b the concentration of cd2 recovering in the target solution after reverse electrode connection accounted for 26 9 40 8 of the total cd2 removal in the target solution this ion recovery rate was equal to or better than those under other similar conditions 49 50 indicating that the activated carbon can effectively adsorb and desorb cadmium ions as shown in fig 6 in the second experiment after fcdi runs for 1 h the cd2 removal efficiency in the target solution was 25 i e 25 mg when the reverse connection of the electrode was applied for 10 min the cd2 concentration in the target solution recovered to 38 i e 9 5 mg of the removed ions it is expected that the ion recovery rate would be higher when the reverse connection of the electrode was applied for a long time on one hand the increase of the interval of electrode solution concentration would lead to the increase of conductivity and the decrease of resistance which may promote the desalination performance to some extent on the other hand if the interval continues to increase and reaches a certain limit the ions would reverse diffuse leading to the decline of desalination performance more importantly there was no significant difference for desalination performance during multi cycle operation fig 6 demonstrating the little impact of reverse connection interval on desalination performance the interval of reverse connection of the electrode will be optimized in the following researches the results proved that the activated carbon had good cycle reversibility in other words the desalination performance of fcdi was stable 3 5 characterization of flow electrode and ion exchange membrane after operation the xps spectra of the precipitation on the microfiltration mf membrane on the aem after fcdi treatment of cadmium containing solution and dried activated carbon in flow electrode are presented in fig 7 it was found that the elements cd and o were found in the xps spectra of aems 51 as shown in fig 7a there is an obvious cadmium peak at the electron binding energy of 406 14 ev indicating that the precipitation on the aems was in the form of divalent cadmium 52 as xps could only irradiate the surface of activated carbon there was no cadmium on the surface of activated carbon fig 7 because the ions adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon would quickly desorb in the electrode solution after leaving the electric field while the ions adsorbed in the pores of activated carbon were partially deposited this result was confirmed by the variation of the pore size distribution of activated carbon before and after the experiment fig 8 as presented in fig 7b the o1s peak precipitated on the ion exchange membrane was decomposed and three peaks with electron binding energy of 532 7 ev 531 3 ev and 529 6 ev were obtained namely o1 o2 and o3 respectively 53 among them the chemical state of o1 o2 and o3 belongs to adsorbed oxygen cd oh 2 and cdo respectively it can be seen that cd oh 2 is the main sediment on the ion exchange membrane after the experiment therefore after several experiments diluted nitric acid could be pumped into the fcdi device to remove the sediment or replace the aem ftir was used to analyze the mechanism of cd2 removing in fcdi fig 9 presents the functional groups on the surface of activated carbon in flow electrode in the fcdi system determined by ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 9 the ftir spectra of activated carbon before and after desalination were similar compared to the ftir spectra before use intensive peaks at 3410 cm 1 oh stretching vibration 54 1630 cm 1 co vibration and 1108 cm 1 co vibration 55 56 were observed for the used activated carbon electrode meanwhile new peak at 1382 cm 1 and 2914 cm 1 indicated the occurrence of bending and stretching vibration absorption peaks of ch 54 generally the activated carbon was relatively stable and fcdi can continuously treat cd2 containing aqueous solution 3 6 comparison of fcdi with other methods and application implications the removal performance of fcdi for cd2 in aqueous solution was systematically investigated in this study the maximum cd2 removal 93 was observed for initial cd2 concentration of 100 mg l under ph of 3 for 3 h operation data not shown table 3 summarizes cd2 removal using different methods as listed in table 3 the effect of adsorbing cadmium ion with activated carbon alone was not significant 41 and the cd2 removal with fcdi device was significantly improved moderate cd2 removal by biological removal using plant microorganism was observed 57 but this method needed a quite long operation period the maximum cd2 removal by fcdi in this study was comparable to that using chemical precipitation method and ion exchange method 58 59 but secondary pollution could be avoided due to less input of chemicals as the cd2 concentration in the effluent of fcdi was still high the combination of fcdi with appropriate pre treatment or post treatment may be more suitable treatment process for high cd2 concentration as other methods will also consume energy or reagent the advantage of fcdi is that it has high removal efficiency and good regeneration performance of activated carbon which can be reused 4 conclusion in this study the removal performance of fcdi for cd2 in cadmium containing target solution under different initial ion concentration ph applied voltage and continuous operation is investigated the main concluding remarks are as follows 1 the removal efficiency of cd2 first increased when the initial concentration increased from 0 5 to 10 mg l while the removal efficiency decreased for initial cd2 from 10 to 200 mg l due to inefficient adsorption sites on activated carbon the maximum removal efficiency 49 9 1 3 was observed at 10 mg l and the highest removal rate 0 32 mg min was obtained at 100 mg l 2 the ph of the solution significantly influenced removal efficiency and the highest cd2 removal 54 was observed at ph of 3 with the increase of ph and oh concentration of the solution cd oh 2 may be generated in the solution which may block the flow channel in the fcdi system and adhere to the ion exchange membrane resulting in the reduction of the removal efficiency of cadmium ions by fcdi 3 with the increase of applied voltage from 0 4 to 2 4 v the removal performance of cadmium ions was improved the greater the voltage applied on the electrode the greater the ion migration driving force the better the ion adsorption performance the higher the desalination rate and the faster the desalination rate 4 the removal performance of each time during the continuous experiment was almost the same and the types of functional groups on the surface of activated carbon have not changed indicating that fcdi has good continuity and stability in removing cadmium ions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

fcdi experiment i e test 4 between each desalination experiment 60 min there was an interval of 10 min for reverse connect of the electrode to the graphite plate and the process contained 11 cycles when the electrode was reverse connected a reverse electric field is formed in the fcdi device and the cadmium ions previously adsorbed from the target solution in the mobile electrode slurry will return to the target solution 2 3 water quality analysis and evaluation of cd2 removal the concentration of cadmium ion is determined at the beginning and after the experiment the concentration 0 05 200 mg l of cd2 in aqueous solution was determined by icp oes optima 5300dv perkin elmer usa hno3 aladdin chemical china and naoh aladdin chemical china were used to adjust the solution ph the removal

physicochemical properties of activated carbon in flow electrode after continuous operation the electrode liquid was collected after the last desalination experiment and was dried before further measurement the surface functional groups of activated carbon powder were analyzed and the existing form of cadmium ion on activated carbon was determined to study the influence of cadmium ion treatment by fcdi on the pore structure of activated carbon the nitrogen adsorption desorption curve of activated carbon powder was measured by gas adsorption instrument asap 2020 quantachrome company usa and the pore structure distribution of activated carbon before and after the experiment was analyzed by qsdft queued solid density functional theory in this study x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps kalpha thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyze the elemental composition and valence state of activated carbon powders and substances on ion exchange membranes after fcdi desalting and

perkinelmer corporation usa to study the changes of functional groups of activated carbon before and after the experiment the samples were scanned at wavenumbers of 4000 400 cm 1 for 32 times at a resolution of 1 cm 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of initial concentrations of cadmium ions the removal efficiency and removal rates of cd2 in aqueous solution with different initial concentration of cd2 treated by fcdi are shown in fig 2 as presented in fig 2a during the desalting process when the initial concentration of cd2 was 0 5 10 50 100 and 200 mg l the removal efficiency of each group was 21 9 2 9 49 9 1 3 29 8 2 9 23 7 5 9 and 12 7 6 4 respectively with the increase of initial cd2 concentration in the target solution the removal efficiency of cd2 increased first and then decreased as shown in fig 2b with the increase of the initial cd2 concentration from 0 5 to 100 mg l the removal rate of each group gradually increased this phenomenon could mainly be attributed to adsorption desorption of cd2 on activated carbon in the flow electrode as well as the variation in electrical resistance and ph of the influent solution as discussed above the maximum mass of cd of the electrode solution in contact with the activated carbon is only 5 1 mg cd for the solution with the initial concentration of 200 mg l with volume of 200 ml and removal of 12 7 thus the adsorption of cd2 on activated carbon in the flow electrode was not saturated for a low initial concentration 37 moreover the electrical resistance varied significantly with different initial concentrations 0 5 200 mg l which would result in different current densities and removal efficiencies and the ph of solution ph 7 1 table 2 would also vary with different initial concentrations which would induce competitive migration between cd2 and h when the initial cd2 concentration is high the adsorption sites on the activated carbon became relatively insufficient and the adsorption process of cadmium ions on the activated carbon would quickly reach saturation 38 moreover there was no significant difference in removal rate for cd2 concentration of 100 and 200 mg l p 0 05 in addition as ph of the solution was not controlled in this test test 1 in table 1 the ph value of the target solution was greatly influenced by initial cd2 concentration in fact the ph ranged from 7 to 1 when the initial cd2 concentration increased from 0 5 to 200 mg l thus the performance of fcdi in different initial concentrations was also dependent on solution ph as discussed in section 3 2 therefore with the increase of the initial concentration of cadmium ion in the solution the removal of cadmium ion by fcdi increased first and then decreased and the removal rate increased gradually with the maximum removal efficiency 49 9 1 3 at 10 mg l and removal rate 0 32 mg min at 100 mg l 3 2 effect of solution ph fig 3 presents the cd2 removal performance of fcdi with an initial cd2 concentration of 100 mg l at different solution ph as shown in fig 3a when ph increased from 1 to 3 the removal efficiency increased from 18 6 to 53 7 and the removal efficiency decreased to 41 2 and 32 3 for ph of 5 and 7 respectively with respect to removal rate the peak of 0 67 mg min was observed at ph of 3 fig 3b at low ph e g ph 1 the concentration and activity of h are high which would compete with cd2 for the adsorption sites on the surface of activated carbon to form competitive adsorption 39 40 resulting in the low adsorption efficiency of activated carbon to cd2 meanwhile the high proton concentration would reduce the resistance and increase the current density thus h mainly migrated in this process then low ph would possibly relieve the cd oh 2 deposition on the membrane surface and improve the migration of cd2 when ph 1 5 h decreased resulting in the enhanced migration of cd2 when ph increased from 3 to 7 the concentration of h decreased and the competitive adsorption weakened the adsorption effect of activated carbon on cd2 increased leading to an increase in removal efficiency of cd2 when the h concentration became lower and the oh concentration increased cd oh 2 hydrolysis complexes were formed in the solution 41 42 this result could be confirmed by the increase of final ph in solution after operation with an increase of 1 29 0 4 0 1 and 0 07 for ph of 1 3 5 and 7 respectively the formed cd oh 2 hydrolysis complexes might block the flow channel in the fcdi system and adhere to the ion exchange membrane 39 43 resulting in the reduction of the removal efficiency of cd2 by fcdi overall with the increase of solution ph the removal of cadmium ion in the solution by fcdi first increased and then decreased with the maximum at ph of 3 3 3 effect of applied voltage and continuous operation of fcdi system in order to study the effect of voltage on the removal performance of cd2 by fcdi the role of applied different voltage in the removal rate and removal rate of cd2 in fcdi system was investigated with results presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 when the applied voltage was 0 1 2 v the driving force of ion migration gradually increased with the increase of the voltage and the greater the ion removal efficiency in this process only activated carbon transferred electrons for desalination when the applied voltage was 1 6 v the sharp increase of removal efficiency was because the voltage rise provides a greater driving force for ion migration and hydrolysis of water e g 1 23 v occurred accelerating ion migration 33 44 when the applied voltage was 1 6 2 4 v the removal efficiency did not change significantly with the increase in voltage because the ion concentration difference between the target solution and the mobile electrode decreased the resistance increased and the ion migration speed slowed down in general with the increase of voltage from 0 to 2 4 v the removal efficiency and removal rated for cd2 in solution by fcdi increased gradually as the basic principle of fcdi is electrostatic adsorption of ions the higher the applied voltage the greater the driving force of ion migration 35 thus better ion removal efficiency could be obtained under higher applied voltage 45 46 the removal efficiency at 2 4 v 47 6 was two times that at 1 2 v 24 1 demonstrating that the role of hydrolysis of the solution in cd2 removal for the investigated voltages 0 4 2 4 v was neglectable furthermore the continuous operation performance of fcdi system was investigated to determine whether excessive voltage led to solution electrolysis and decrease of desalting performance of fcdi 32 the initial concentration of cadmium ion in the inflow water was 100 mg l and the continuous desalination is carried out for 6 cycles i e 6 h at 1 2 v and 2 4 v respectively the target solution is replaced without changing the flow electrode in each experiment with results shown in fig 5 as presented in fig 5a the desalination rate was relative stable in each continuous desalination experiment under an applied voltage of 1 2 v ranging from 22 7 to 25 8 when applying an applied voltage of 2 4 v for continuous desalination experiments the desalination rate fluctuates in the range of 44 5 48 1 in each experiment these results further confirmed that the internal resistance of the fcdi system was too high resulting in the internal voltage of the system not reaching the electrolytic voltage of the target solution 47 48 at the end of the continuous experiment at 1 2 and 2 4 v the electrode liquid through the film was taken to measure the cd2 concentration after continuous experiment at 1 2 v the ratio of cd2 concentration in the electrode solution to the total removed cd2 concentration was 65 9 in comparison the ratio of cd2 concentration in electrode solution to total removed cd2 concentration after continuous experiment at 2 4 v is 82 8 the cd2 mass in the electrode liquid 27 5 mg is higher than that in the activated carbon 14 2 mg l the results indicated that the adsorption of cd2 by fcdi was continuous adsorption and desorption so that most of the adsorbed ions were desorbed and stored in the electrode liquid and the activated carbon was regenerated 26 when the flow electrode re entered the fcdi module the regenerated activated carbon had enough ion adsorption sites and good performance for removing cd2 in fcdi was expected 3 4 reusability of activated carbon electrode in fcdi system in order to investigate the regeneration and reuse performance of activated carbon after cd2 removal by fcdi the experiment was carried out for 11 times under 1 2 v voltage with the initial cd2 concentration of 100 mg l the target solution was changed every 1 h using 100 mg l cd2 aqueous solution the reusability of activated carbon electrode in fcdi systems for the removal of cd2 is presented in fig 6 during the experiment the conductivity of the target solution gradually decreased after adsorption for 1 h the conductivity reached a stable level and then the electrode was reversed and worked for 10 min the cd2 on the electrode was desorbed in the electrode solution under the action of reverse electric field as shown in fig 6a the removal efficiency of cd2 in each experiment was in the range of 24 3 28 9 after each reverse electrode operation for 10 min the cd2 concentration was used to determine the recovery rate of cd2 with results shown in fig 6b the concentration of cd2 recovering in the target solution after reverse electrode connection accounted for 26 9 40 8 of the total cd2 removal in the target solution this ion recovery rate was equal to or better than those under other similar conditions 49 50 indicating that the activated carbon can effectively adsorb and desorb cadmium ions as shown in fig 6 in the second experiment after fcdi runs for 1 h the cd2 removal efficiency in the target solution was 25 i e 25 mg when the reverse connection of the electrode was applied for 10 min the cd2 concentration in the target solution recovered to 38 i e 9 5 mg of the removed ions it is expected that the ion recovery rate would be higher when the reverse connection of the electrode was applied for a long time on one hand the increase of the interval of electrode solution concentration would lead to the increase of conductivity and the decrease of resistance which may promote the desalination performance to some extent on the other hand if the interval continues to increase and reaches a certain limit the ions would reverse diffuse leading to the decline of desalination performance more importantly there was no significant difference for desalination performance during multi cycle operation fig 6 demonstrating the little impact of reverse connection interval on desalination performance the interval of reverse connection of the electrode will be optimized in the following researches the results proved that the activated carbon had good cycle reversibility in other words the desalination performance of fcdi was stable 3 5 characterization of flow electrode and ion exchange membrane after operation the xps spectra of the precipitation on the microfiltration mf membrane on the aem after fcdi treatment of cadmium containing solution and dried activated carbon in flow electrode are presented in fig 7 it was found that the elements cd and o were found in the xps spectra of aems 51 as shown in fig 7a there is an obvious cadmium peak at the electron binding energy of 406 14 ev indicating that the precipitation on the aems was in the form of divalent cadmium 52 as xps could only irradiate the surface of activated carbon there was no cadmium on the surface of activated carbon fig 7 because the ions adsorbed on the surface of activated carbon would quickly desorb in the electrode solution after leaving the electric field while the ions adsorbed in the pores of activated carbon were partially deposited this result was confirmed by the variation of the pore size distribution of activated carbon before and after the experiment fig 8 as presented in fig 7b the o1s peak precipitated on the ion exchange membrane was decomposed and three peaks with electron binding energy of 532 7 ev 531 3 ev and 529 6 ev were obtained namely o1 o2 and o3 respectively 53 among them the chemical state of o1 o2 and o3 belongs to adsorbed oxygen cd oh 2 and cdo respectively it can be seen that cd oh 2 is the main sediment on the ion exchange membrane after the experiment therefore after several experiments diluted nitric acid could be pumped into the fcdi device to remove the sediment or replace the aem ftir was used to analyze the mechanism of cd2 removing in fcdi fig 9 presents the functional groups on the surface of activated carbon in flow electrode in the fcdi system determined by ftir spectroscopy as shown in fig 9 the ftir spectra of activated carbon before and after desalination were similar compared to the ftir spectra before use intensive peaks at 3410 cm 1 oh stretching vibration 54 1630 cm 1 co vibration and 1108 cm 1 co vibration 55 56 were observed for the used activated carbon electrode meanwhile new peak at 1382 cm 1 and 2914 cm 1 indicated the occurrence of bending and stretching vibration absorption peaks of ch 54 generally the activated carbon was relatively stable and fcdi can continuously treat cd2 containing aqueous solution 3 6 comparison of fcdi with other methods and application implications the removal performance of fcdi for cd2 in aqueous solution was systematically investigated in this study the maximum cd2 removal 93 was observed for initial cd2 concentration of 100 mg l under ph of 3 for 3 h operation data not shown table 3 summarizes cd2 removal using different methods as listed in table 3 the effect of adsorbing cadmium ion with activated carbon alone was not significant 41 and the cd2 removal with fcdi device was significantly improved moderate cd2 removal by biological removal using plant microorganism was observed 57 but this method needed a quite long operation period the maximum cd2 removal by fcdi in this study was comparable to that using chemical precipitation method and ion exchange method 58 59 but secondary pollution could be avoided due to less input of chemicals as the cd2 concentration in the effluent of fcdi was still high the combination of fcdi with appropriate pre treatment or post treatment may be more suitable treatment process for high cd2 concentration as other methods will also consume energy or reagent the advantage of fcdi is that it has high removal efficiency and good regeneration performance of activated carbon which can be reused 4 conclusion in this study the removal performance of fcdi for cd2 in cadmium containing target solution under different initial ion concentration ph applied voltage and continuous operation is investigated the main concluding remarks are as follows 1 the removal efficiency of cd2 first increased when the initial concentration increased from 0 5 to 10 mg l while the removal efficiency decreased for initial cd2 from 10 to 200 mg l due to inefficient adsorption sites on activated carbon the maximum removal efficiency 49 9 1 3 was observed at 10 mg l and the highest removal rate 0 32 mg min was obtained at 100 mg l 2 the ph of the solution significantly influenced removal efficiency and the highest cd2 removal 54 was observed at ph of 3 with the increase of ph and oh concentration of the solution cd oh 2 may be generated in the solution which may block the flow channel in the fcdi system and adhere to the ion exchange membrane resulting in the reduction of the removal efficiency of cadmium ions by fcdi 3 with the increase of applied voltage from 0 4 to 2 4 v the removal performance of cadmium ions was improved the greater the voltage applied on the electrode the greater the ion migration driving force the better the ion adsorption performance the higher the desalination rate and the faster the desalination rate 4 the removal performance of each time during the continuous experiment was almost the same and the types of functional groups on the surface of activated carbon have not changed indicating that fcdi has good continuity and stability in removing cadmium ions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
