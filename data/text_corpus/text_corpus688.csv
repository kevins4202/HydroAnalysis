3440,streamflow is an important hydrological factor in water resources management the fluvial acoustic tomography fat as a cutting edge river monitoring technology measures the flow velocity using the travel time of the acoustic signals the velocity is then multiplied by the river cross section to obtain accurate and continuous streamflow data similar to all acoustic instruments the fat output velocity contaminated by spike data standard deviation std as a simple method of spike removing was used in previous fat studies the disadvantages of the std method are that it not only does not replace the identified spikes with the appropriate values and therefore results in measurement discontinuity but it also requires engineering judgment that may increase the measurement error in this

overview prediction and awareness of hydrological processes particularly river behavior are essential for successful water resource management abbasi et al 2021 one of the most critical and challengingissues of river monitoring is the development of an instrument that provides real time and continuous streamflow data al sawaf et al 2021 fat is an innovative technology for continuous monitoring of rivers and estuaries kawanisi et al 2010 even in the presence of high suspended sediment concentration during passing floods al sawaf and kawanisi 2020 bahreinimotlagh et al 2020 the backbone of the fat concept is the time of travel principle which is analogous to the acoustic velocity meter avm however the fundamental benefit of the fat is that the average cross sectional velocity can be determined without any complicated post processing operations kawanisi et al 2012 fig 1 shows the conceptual model of a pair of fat stations deployed in a river fat controllers are synchronized with nanosecond accuracy by connecting to the global navigation satellite system gnss and transmitting sound waves at regular short intervals e g 30 s the system consists of two processors connected by a cable to the transducers immersed in water transmitting and receiving sound signals the range average flow velocity along the ray path is measured by determining the horizontal distance between the two transducers and recording the arrival time of the sound waves in the upstream and downstream stations the streamflow can then be obtained by multiplying the cross sectional river area by the fat measured flow velocity along the flow path considering two acoustic stations distanced by a length l in a fluid medium flowing at a velocity um the forward and reverse travel times t1 and t2 are respectively expressed by kawanisi et al 2010 1 t 1 l c m u m 2 t 2 l c m u m where cm is the sound speed in water and um represents averaged water velocity along the sound path that are respectively given by 3 c m l 2 1 t 1 1 t 2 l t m 4 u m l 2 1 t 1 1 t 2 l 2 δ t t m 2 c m 2 2 l δ t where t m t 1 t 2 2 t 1 t 2 and δ t t 1 t 2 finally the fat estimates the streamflow using eq 5 5 q fat u m a t a n θ where a is the oblique cross sectional area alog the transmission line and θ is the angle between the ray path and river flow it should be noted that other acoustic devices applied for velocity measurement e g adv 1 1 acoustic doppler velocimeter adcp 2 2 acoustic doppler current profiler and avm 3 3 acoustic velocity meter s propagate sound waves in a straight line therefore those devices can not provide information of the average velocity of the entire cross section of the river whereas the sound waves of the fat propagate the entire cross section of the river allowing the average cross sectional flow velocity to be measured in a fraction of a second al sawaf et al 2017 furthermore since the propagated sound waves are reflected from the riverbed and the water surface the geometry of the bed does not affect the measurements therefore acoustic tomography measurements are independent of the riverbed geometry and the average cross sectional velocity can be measured directly without the need for postprocessing bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 1 2 spikes in fat velocity data the presence of spike data is a problem in all acoustic measurement systems decreasing the quality and precisionof their datasets a frequently used definition for the concept spike is expressed as an observation whichdeviates significantly from other observations that it raises the possibility that it was created by a different mechanism hawkins 1980 therefore the data must be cleaned before performing data mining processes i e raw data preprocessing and preparation the primary goal of the despiking process is to identify spike data as observations that do not fall within the common behavior region defined by the despiking algorithm however it is challenging to pick a zone encompassing all normal data behaviors one of the primary challenges of such a process is determining the exact boundaries of this area moreover the precise meaning of spike data can differ across fields and disciplines minor changes in values are observed in medical science datasets for example maybe significant whereas the same amount of change in economic or engineering observations may be negligible as a result the varying concepts of spike data in different disciplines make it complicated to apply methodologies created for one field to another flow velocity measured by fat similar to other acoustic measurement systems such as adv adcp and avm contains spike data std was the simply method to despike fat data the std method considers a normal behavior region that is located around the primary trend of the signal by a certain distance this distance is determined as a specific coefficient of the signal standard deviation value data points outside the normal region are detected as spikes bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 the most crucial drawback of the std method is the ignorance of the replacement of the detected spikes data with appropriate values which results in a discontinuous measurement moreover the std is not an intelligent method and the its parameters are determined by user judgment goring and nikora 2002 developed the phase space thresholding pst despiking method to show its superiority with compared to previous despiking techniques e g rc filters and tukey 53h methods otnes and enochson 1978 acceleration thresholding method nikora and goring 2000 and wavelet thresholding method donoho and johnstone 1994 wahl 2003 proposed a modified version of pst called the three dimensional phase space thresholding method 3d pst to improve the performance of the previous model using a three dimensional space mori et al 2007 implemented wahl s modified 3d pst method on an adv contaminated dataset and compared it to the original pst method their findings revealed that the 3d pst method outperformed the pst method zhong et al 2020 developed and implemented the three dimensional rousseeuw phase space thresholding method 3d rps by optimizing the pst method and combining it with the re method through a two step filtering process improving the despiking procedure and reducing the iterations needed to implement the pst method the results showed that 3d rps is a promising method that effectively improves the accuracy of outlier detection and considerably reduces the over processing phenomenon in this study pst and 3d rps despiking methods which were previously applied to adv devices are applied to the fat data the results are compared with the output of the std method which was used in previous fat studies finally the modified fat based streamflow data using these three approaches are compared to the reference streamflow obtained from the rating curve method and the accuracy improvement in the fat measurement is assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 standard deviation method the standard deviation method is one of the most straightforward procedures for removing spikes this method was used to detect and eliminate apparent spikes in the fat bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 in this method data points within a certain distance from the signal s primary trend are identified as usual and reliable data whereas points outside this range are identified as spikes and deleted this distance is arbitrarily chosen by the operator based on the type of signal engineering judgment which can be considered as a disadvantage 2 2 phase space thresholding pst method the pst method consists of three concepts differentiating a signal enhances its high frequency portion and displays some additional features of the signal that are not otherwise visible and helps detect the spikes better the expected absolute maximum value of a random time series is calculated using the universal threshold value valid good data points form a cluster in a dense cloud of phase space these concepts are used to construct three threshold ellipsoids in three phase spaces of u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u afterwards the spikes are detected based on recognition of data points that lie outside of these ellipsoids the advantage of this method over many other developed despiking methods such as rc filters the tukey 53h method otnes and enochson 1978 and the acceleration thresholding method nikora and goring 2000 is that it does not use any parameter that needs to be specified by the operator experimentally and approximately the pst technique is an iterative approach in which spikes are iteratively recognized and replaced with more reliable and reasonable values this process continues until the number of valid points becomes constant inside the threshold ellipses in all three phase spaces between consecutive iterations the despiking process with the pst method is applied in such a manner that after removing the mean of the signal the first and second derivatives of the signal are calculated the three phase spaces of u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u are drawn and the parameters required to determine the dimensions of the three threshold ellipses which are the universal threshold and the standard deviation of the original signal and its derivatives are calculated finally data points outside these ellipses in each of the three phase spaces are detected as spikes pst method can be stepped up in the following way 1 calculation of the first and second derivatives of the input velocity signal 6 δ u i u i 1 u i 1 2 7 δ 2 u i δ u i 1 δ u i 1 2 2 calculation of standard deviation and universal threshold parameters for each u δu δ2u variables the standard deviation is calculated and the expected maximum value for a random and normal variable whose standard deviation is estimated by σ and whose mean is zero is computed using the universal threshold parameter 8 λ u 2 ln n where n is the total number of signal data points 3 calculation of the rotation angle of the threshold ellipsoid principal axis in the u δ2u space 9 θ t a n 1 u i δ 2 u i u i 2 4 dimension calculation of large and small principal axes of threshold ellipsoids for the phase space of u δu the sizes of the large and small axes of the ellipsoid are λ u σ u and λ u σ δ u respectively for the phase space of δu δ2u the sizes of the large and small axes of the ellipsoid are λ u σ δ u and λ u σ δ 2 u respectively moreover for the phase space of u δ2u the sizes of the large and small axes of the ellipsoid are obtained by solving the following equations simultaneously in which a is the large axis and b is the small axis of ellipsoid 10 λ u σ u 2 a 2 c o s 2 θ b 2 s i n 2 θ 11 λ u σ δ 2 u 2 a 2 s i n 2 θ b 2 c o s 2 θ 2 3 three dimensional rousseeuw phase space 3d rps method the 3d rps method proposed by zhong et al 2020 combines two different algorithms 3d pst of wahl 2003 and a combination of the re method of rousseeuw and leroy 1998 and the mobile window method of zou et al 2008 these methods are applied separately to the input signal and sum of the points identified as outliers in each of these two steps are considered as the final result of the despiking process the detected spikes are then replaced with a more appropriate value this algorithm attempts to use a three dimensional threshold ellipsoid instead of using the projection of three dimensional threshold ellipsoids on three planes u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u to identify spikes the other primary part of the 3d rps method includes using robust statistical parameters to develop this algorithm in a way that instead of using the mean parameter the median is used as a robust location estimator as well instead of using the standard deviation parameter the median absolute deviation mad is applied as a scale estimator the use of these robust statistical parameters makes this method more efficient than the pst method this means that the spike values do not affect the estimators while these effects on the mean and standard deviation parameters are high in addition instead of using the universal threshold value as the boundary separating the normal and outlier regions the chauvenet s criterion is applied coleman steele 1999 the three dimensional threshold is used because if the two dimensional threshold in each principal plane of u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u were to be used the process of despiking would require three comparisons to be made in every plane and spikes would ultimately be detected if they were located outside of a complex 3d shape analogous to an ellipsoid but with knobby projections in each of the eight phase space quadrants the knobs allow some data points outside the 3d ellipsoid to be retained as normal data to prevent this error a single comparison test using the 3d ellipsoid shape after removing the median of the signal and calculating the first and second derivatives of the signal similar to the pst method is implemented and the ellipsoid is defined in spherical coordinates of ρ ϕ and θ as 12 1 ρ 2 s i n φ c o s θ c o s α c o s φ s i n α 2 a 2 s i n φ c o s θ s i n α c o s φ c o s α 2 b 2 s i n φ s i n θ 2 c 2 where a and b are the large and small principal axes of the threshold ellipsoid which are projected on the u δ2u plane respectively and c is the large principal axis of the threshold ellipsoid that is projected on the δu δ2u plane α shows the rotation angle of the ellipsoid in the u δ2u plane which is calculated using eq 4 the process of identifying data points outside this 3 d threshold ellipsoid is performed in such a way that at first the position of the data points is calculated in three dimensional space of u δu δ2 u in spherical coordinates as distance from the center of coordinates ρ and two angles of ϕ and θ which are the angles between the line connecting the data point to the center of coordinates and the principal axes of δ2u and u respectively and then the value of ρ is compared to value of ρε that ρe is the distance of a point to center of coordinates which is at the surface of 3d ellipsoid and has the same angles of φ and θ with the data point that intends to specify its type finally if ρ is greater than ρ e it indicates the presence of a data point inside the threshold and if ρ is smaller than ρ e it shows that the data point is outside the threshold and is an outlier to implement the second step of this method the re algorithm combines with the mobile window method in such a manner that at first all data points are separated as different groups with a fixed width mobile window moving across the signal then with the help of median parameter location is estimated using eq 13 and with the help of mad parameter the scale estimated using eq 14 and with the use of these two parameters data points in each window are standardized using eq 15 13 m median i 1 n u i 14 s e median i 1 n u i m e mad 15 z i u i m s 16 o i z i c where n is the number of signal data points ui is the velocity value of each data point e is an estimated coefficient with the value of 1 483 zi is the standardized value of data points oi in eq 16 is the parameter that determines whether the data point is an outlier or normal and c is the threshold value between normal and outlier region the data points that have an oi greater than zero are deemed as spikes to detect spikes a threshold value is set on standardized data points and data points that lie outside this threshold are deemed as outlier data in this study chauvenet s criterion is used as the threshold chauvenet s criterion value depends on the window width and the number of data points located in every window to find the optimal value for this parameter different values for the width of windows and the best option that detects most of the spikes and flattens the input signal optimally need to be assumed and chosen the combination of these two steps in the 3d rps method increases the accuracy of the despiking process consequently due to the non iterative process of this method the occurrence of an overprocessing phenomenon is prevented flowcharts of the pst and 3drps algorithms are shown in fig 2 to demonstrate the despiking replacement steps 2 4 performance evaluation of despiking methods to evaluate the performance of the applied methods appropriate statistical parameters such as pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsc are been used the streamflow data are compared with the ones obtained from the rating curve method as the reference in addition the parameter relative discharge differences have been used to compare the output of the despiking approaches and the rating curve method using the following equation 17 relative d i s c h a r g e d i f f e r e n c e d d reference d d reference d reference 2 5 study area and fat data the fat observation is carried out in the gono river located in miyoshi city hiroshima prefecture japan the length of the gono river is approximately 194 km the saiju and basen rivers are the two main tributaries of the gono river which meet about 3 km from the data collection site the slope of the river bed in the selected reach region was measured 0 11 and the river bed is composed of sand and boulder the average annual flow rate is approximately 73 cubic meters per second kawanisi et al 2016 a 115 meter wide reach was selected for the location of the transducers to collect data at this site two 30 khz fat were diagonally deployed on both sides of the river where the horizontal distance between them was set 294 6 m the data was collected every 30 s for six days from february 1 to february 6 2015 the total amount of data is 10 600 fig 3 shows the data collection area and location of upstream and downstream stations fig 4 shows the raw flow velocity data measured by the fat there are numerous spikes that cause significant error in velocity and streamflow calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 standard deviation method results in this study data in the range of 0 05 to 1 8 m s were considered as normal data and points outside this range were assumed to be a spike fig 5 a shows the data points identified as outliers by the std method fig 5 b alsoshows a comparison of the unspiked signal with the std method output out of 10 600 data 156 data 1 47 of the total were identified as outliers although most of the obvious spikes are detected by this method it should be noted that using user judgment in flood events when the flow velocity increases significantly or even in estuaries when the tides occur tidal velocities are shown by negative values increases the error furthermore the existence of significant fluctuations in the processed signal implies that the std does not perform well in despiking acoustic tomographic output 3 2 pst method results fig 6 shows the three phase spaces for the first and fourth iterations of the pst method the values of the data points and their position relative to the threshold ellipses are specified as well the data points with scattered values and farther away from other points which have formed a dense cluster are removed during these iterations the reduction of the dimensions of the ellipses in these four iterations shows the proper identification of outlier points with this method it should be pointed out that the completion criterion of the pst iterations is that no outliers beyond these ellipses must be detected in the last iteration however in this study this criterion was not met for the fat signal in addition to the weaknesses and limitations of the pst method in despiking signals with a high percentage of outliers as previously stated in islam and zhu 2013 due to the dense spikes in the signal causing improper performance of the replacement method finally to solve this problem by examining the changes in the standard deviation value of the signal fluctuations around its average during different iterations of this method in the fourth to fifth iteration this change was tiny on the scale of less than one thousandth thus the overall dispersion of signal points relative to the mean value in these consecutive iterations did not change much due to the proper flattening of the signal after the fourth iteration this iteration was considered the last repetition it should be noted that the standard deviation value of the data fluctuations around the average signal value before the despiking process was 0 201 and after the fourth iteration reached 0 0866 fig 7 a depicts the total number of points identified as outliers in four iterations of the pst approach fig 7b shows a comparison of the input signal to the pst algorithm output out of 10 600 data 3475 data 32 78 of the total data were identified and replaced as outliers 3 3 3drps method results this method involves two steps in the first step which isthe 3dpst algorithm data points were shown in three dimensional space with a threshold ellipse after eliminating the median value from the signal and calculating the required parameters of eq 7 the data points outside the three dimensional threshold ellipsoid were identified by comparing the values of the ρ and ρ parameters out of 10 600 data 2220 20 94 of the total data were identified as outliers fig 8 a shows the position of the data points outside the three dimensional threshold ellipsoid to apply the re method in the second step the data points must first be standardized using eq 10 the mobile window method is then used to consider a window with a specific width which depends on the optimum chauvenet s criterion for the input signal it depends on the number of data points in each window and is used as the threshold value the spike data points would be identified if their standardized value be outsidethis threshold the signals are divided into 21 groups of 500 data and the threshold value which depends on the selected window width is applied chauvenet s criterion used to identify outliers is 3 29 as a threshold value for 500 data points the state of the data after the standardization and application of chauvenet s criterion is shown in fig 8b as shown this parameter does an excellent job of distinguishing between good and bad data the despiked output of this method was obtained after aggregating the spikes identified in both steps of the method and replacing these points with the average value of two data points on each side of them the signal standard deviation before despiking was 0 201 and decreased to 0 094 after the process indicating a reduction in data dispersion around the signal average fig 9 a shows the total points identified as outliers in the 3drps method fig 9b represents the output of the 3drps method and the raw signal before despiking the output signal of the 3dpst method and the output signal of the re method out of 10 600 data 1726 data 16 28 of the total data were identified and replaced as outliers by the 3drps method the re method alone outperformed the 3dpst method in most areas and their combination and aggregation produced a better result than each of them individually did 3 4 streamflow results in this section the accuracy of different despiking methods is evaluated these results are compared with the streamflow of the rating curve method as the reference as shown in fig 10 a the inadequate performance of the std method in these comparisons and the existence of sudden severe fluctuations at several points of the output signal of this method are evident interestingly the result of the std method is more consistent with the output of the rating curve than the pst method in some regions e g february 5th the reason for this error indicates the improper performance of the pst method in signals with a high percentage of the presence of outliers as a result the pst method is unsuitable for the despiking of tomographic data the comparison of the 3drps method with pst and std methods reveals a better performance of 3drps fig 10b illustrates the output fluctuations of the 3drps method around the rc reference method which are significantly reduced compared to the pst and std methods it is especially visible between 3rd and 6th february consequently the output of this method is flatter than the ones of the other two methods and involves fewer sudden fluctuations 3 5 uncertainty analysis fig 11 shows the relative difference of streamflow between the three proposed methods and the rating curve data as the reference fig 11a shows the performance of the std method the relative discharge difference of most data points is in the range of 15 however for some outliers that std is unable to identify the relative discharge difference exceeds up to 40 fig 11b illustrates the relative discharge difference of the pst method it is clear that the majority of the points have a relative discharge difference in the range of 10 to 20 with some points exceeding this range by even more than 20 furthermore when comparing this figure to the previous one it is observed that although the output of the stdmethod is morerelative in most points than the one in pstmethod the pst performed better in signal flattening fig 11c represents the relative discharge difference of the 3drps method most of the points are in the range of 10 and a few points are also seen outside this range and in the range of 15 to 18 by comparing these results the functional superiority of the 3drps method compared to other methods in comparison with the rc data can be concluded the correlation diagram of the despking methods versus the rating curve data is shown in fig 12 the reduction in data correlation with the rc methodin the case of the pst method compared to undespiked data is an exciting point that acknowledges the limitation of the pst method in the case of highly contaminated signals finally this parameter demonstrates the superiority of the 3drps method in comparison with other methods table 2 summarizes the performance of various dispiking methods that are statistically compared with the rating curve data the r2 coefficients were 0 883 0 798 and 0 913 for the std pst and 3drps methods respectively the rmse demonstrates the superiority of the 3drps method over the other existing methods the std method has a value of 5 899 m3 s which reduces to 4 676 m3 s for the 3drps technique furthermore the pst technique with the lowest performance indicates that the pst technique has a functional constraint for severely contaminated signals the functional superiority of the 3drps method was also confirmed when the mape decreased from 5 838 for the std method to 5 123 for 3drps this parameter also indicates the poor performance of the pst method as the mape of pst is even higher than the mape of the std method and itcomes to mindthat considering the level of the signal flattening with the help of the despiking techniques alone cannot help to evaluate their accuracy and performance furthermore by examining the nsc coefficient which is used to evaluate the predictive ability of hydrological models and the closer the value of this parameter to 1 the better the performance of that method the 3drps method has the best performance among the applied methods and the nsc value has increased from 0 572 for the std to 0 731 for 3drps for this parameter the pst method is still recognized as the worst method in terms of performance the computational time effort of a computer system to process the algorithms and assess the computational cost of each of them is another metric that may be used to compare the performance of algorithms the computational times of the pst and 3drps algorithms were examined using the wolfram mathematica version 12 software in acomputer system with the following specifications processor intel r core tm i7 4510u cpu 2 00 ghz 2 60 ghz ram 8 00 gb ddr3 7 90 gb useable system type 64 bit operating system x64 based processor the computational time effort was 4 min and 2 s and 1 min and 54 s for the pst and 3drps methods respectively as a result the 3drps approach is more efficient than the pst algorithm as evidenced by the results this may have been inferred even before the despiking process because the pst method is iterative the computational cost of this algorithm appears to be higher than the 3drps method due to the repetition of calculations in successive iterations 4 discussion the signal to noise ratio snr which is defined as 10 times the logarithm of the peak amplitude of received signals is one of the important factors in fat and is used as a determinant component between clean and noisy data where data with snrs less than 10 db are removed as noisy data figs 13 and 14 show the snr values for all detected spikes using the pst and 3drps methods for upstream t1 and downstream t2 stations red points respectively and compared with ones for all received signals black points it was observed that the detected spikes in both pst and 3drps methods have acceptable and sufficient snr levels to be regarded as valid in terms of the clean pulse as a result there is not any relationship between the snr value of data and the outliers it is necessary to mentionthat in the pst method no parameters must be quantified by the analyst and the process of thresholding definition for all phase spaces is completed by combining the standard deviation of the velocity signal and its derivatives with universal threshold parameter that requires no tuning and only depends on the number of data points which is the fundamentaladvantage of this algorithm over others for the 3drps method however the operator should decide on the value of the chauvenet s parameter which is the c parameter in eq 16 as the threshold for standardizedvalues because the value of chauvenet s criterion depends on the number of data points in each window this parameter was quantified using standardized data values that helped in selecting the optimal number of data points in each window whichcorresponded to an optimum chauvenet value that appropriately separated two areas of normal and spike data as shown in fig 8 the optimum value of the chauvenet s threshold that can separate the normal and spike region is approximately 3 by selecting 500 data for each window which is equivalent to the value of 3 29 for chauvenet s criterion the normal and spike regions are separated optimally and data points lie outside the normal region considered as spikes are detected by the re method furthermore another coefficient used in the 3drps method i e e in eq 14 is quantified as 1 483 due to the explanation of wahl 2003 which stated that the 1 483 coefficient is a factor that makes the scale estimator i e s in eq 14 analogous to the standard deviation the usual scale parameter of a normal distribution 5 conclusion for hydrological studies as well as water resources management it is vital to understand streamflow properties under normal and extreme climatic conditions over the short term few hours and long term several days to several years acoustic tomography technique provides such streamflow data however the presence of spikes is an issue that affects the quality and validity of streamflow data a despiking process is needed to purify the fat output signal in this study two despiking methods of phase space thresholding pst and three dimensional rousseeuw phase space thresholding 3d rps are applied to detect fat outliers in addition the results of these methods were compared with the results of the simple standard deviation method which was previously used to detect the spikes of fat data in conclusion the 3d rps method has the best performance with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 731 compared to 0 572 and 0 44 for the std and pst methods respectively the outcomes demonstrate that streamflowmeasurement accuracy is also significantly improved after the despiking process with the relative errors with rating curve data as a reference decreasing from 40 for the std approach to 15 for the 3drps approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3440,streamflow is an important hydrological factor in water resources management the fluvial acoustic tomography fat as a cutting edge river monitoring technology measures the flow velocity using the travel time of the acoustic signals the velocity is then multiplied by the river cross section to obtain accurate and continuous streamflow data similar to all acoustic instruments the fat output velocity contaminated by spike data standard deviation std as a simple method of spike removing was used in previous fat studies the disadvantages of the std method are that it not only does not replace the identified spikes with the appropriate values and therefore results in measurement discontinuity but it also requires engineering judgment that may increase the measurement error in this

horizontal distance between the two transducers and recording the arrival time of the sound waves in the upstream and downstream stations the streamflow can then be obtained by multiplying the cross sectional river area by the fat measured flow velocity along the flow path considering two acoustic stations distanced by a length l in a fluid medium flowing at a velocity um the forward and reverse travel times t1 and t2 are respectively expressed by kawanisi et al 2010 1 t 1 l c m u m 2 t 2 l c m u m where cm is the sound speed in water and um represents averaged water velocity along the sound path that are respectively given by 3 c m l 2 1 t 1 1 t 2 l t m 4 u m l 2 1 t 1 1 t 2 l 2 δ t t m 2 c m 2 2 l δ t where t m t 1 t 2 2 t 1 t 2 and δ t t 1 t 2 finally the fat estimates the streamflow using eq 5 5 q fat u m a t a n θ where a is the oblique cross sectional area alog the transmission line and θ is the angle between the ray path and river flow it should be noted that other acoustic devices applied for velocity measurement e g adv 1 1 acoustic doppler velocimeter adcp 2 2 acoustic doppler current profiler and avm 3 3 acoustic velocity meter s propagate sound waves in a straight line therefore those devices can not provide information of the average velocity of the entire cross section of the river whereas the sound waves of the fat propagate the entire cross section of the river allowing the average cross sectional flow velocity to be measured in a fraction of a second al sawaf et al 2017 furthermore since the propagated sound waves are reflected from the riverbed and the water surface the geometry of the bed does not affect the measurements therefore acoustic tomography measurements are independent of the riverbed geometry and the average cross sectional velocity can be measured directly without the need for postprocessing bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 1 2 spikes in fat velocity data the presence of spike data is a problem in all acoustic measurement systems decreasing the quality and precisionof their datasets a frequently used definition for the concept spike is expressed as an observation whichdeviates significantly from other observations that it raises the possibility that it was created by a different mechanism hawkins 1980 therefore the data must be cleaned before performing data mining processes i e raw data preprocessing and preparation the primary goal of the despiking process is to identify spike data as observations that do not fall within the common behavior region defined by the despiking algorithm however it is challenging to pick a zone encompassing all normal data behaviors one of the primary challenges of such a process is determining the exact boundaries of this area moreover the precise meaning of spike data can differ across fields and disciplines minor changes in values are observed in medical science datasets for example maybe significant whereas the same amount of change in economic or engineering observations may be negligible as a result the varying concepts of spike data in different disciplines make it complicated to apply methodologies created for one field to another flow velocity measured by fat similar to other acoustic measurement systems such as adv adcp and avm contains spike data std was the simply method to despike fat data the std method considers a normal behavior region that is located around the primary trend of the signal by a certain distance this distance is determined as a specific coefficient of the signal standard deviation value data points outside the normal region are detected as spikes bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 the most crucial drawback of the std method is the ignorance of the replacement of the detected spikes data with appropriate values which results in a discontinuous measurement moreover the std is not an intelligent method and the its parameters are determined by user judgment goring and nikora 2002 developed the phase space thresholding pst despiking method to show its superiority with compared to previous despiking techniques e g rc filters and tukey 53h methods otnes and enochson 1978 acceleration thresholding method nikora and goring 2000 and wavelet thresholding method donoho and johnstone 1994 wahl 2003 proposed a modified version of pst called the three dimensional phase space thresholding method 3d pst to improve the performance of the previous model using a three dimensional space mori et al 2007 implemented wahl s modified 3d pst method on an adv contaminated dataset and compared it to the original pst method their findings revealed that the 3d pst method outperformed the pst method zhong et al 2020 developed and implemented the three dimensional rousseeuw phase space thresholding method 3d rps by optimizing the pst method and combining it with the re method through a two step filtering process improving the despiking procedure and reducing the iterations needed to implement the pst method the results showed that 3d rps is a promising method that effectively improves the accuracy of outlier detection and considerably reduces the over processing phenomenon in this study pst and 3d rps despiking methods which were previously applied to adv devices are applied to the fat data the results are compared with the output of the std method which was used in previous fat studies finally the modified fat based streamflow data using these three approaches are compared to the reference streamflow obtained from the rating curve method and the accuracy improvement in the fat measurement is assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 standard deviation method the standard deviation method is one of the most straightforward procedures for removing spikes this method was used to detect and eliminate apparent spikes in the fat bahreinimotlagh et al 2016 in this method data points within a certain distance from the signal s primary trend are identified as usual and reliable data whereas points outside this range are identified as spikes and deleted this distance is arbitrarily chosen by the operator based on the type of signal engineering judgment which can be considered as a disadvantage 2 2 phase space thresholding pst method the pst method consists of three concepts differentiating a signal enhances its high frequency portion and displays some additional features of the signal that are not otherwise visible and helps detect the spikes better the expected absolute maximum value of a random time series is calculated using the universal threshold value valid good data points form a cluster in a dense cloud of phase space these concepts are used to construct three threshold ellipsoids in three phase spaces of u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u afterwards the spikes are detected based on recognition of data points that lie outside of these ellipsoids the advantage of this method over many other developed despiking methods such as rc filters the tukey 53h method otnes and enochson 1978 and the acceleration thresholding method nikora and goring 2000 is that it does not use any parameter that needs to be specified by the operator experimentally and approximately the pst technique is an iterative approach in which spikes are iteratively recognized and replaced with more reliable and reasonable values this process continues until the number of valid points becomes constant inside the threshold ellipses in all three phase spaces between consecutive iterations the despiking process with the pst method is applied in such a manner that after removing the mean of the signal the first and second derivatives of the signal are calculated the three phase spaces of u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u are drawn and the parameters required to determine the dimensions of the three threshold ellipses which are the universal threshold and the standard deviation of the original signal and its derivatives are calculated finally data points outside these ellipses in each of the three phase spaces are detected as spikes pst method can be stepped up in the following way 1 calculation of the first and second derivatives of the input velocity signal 6 δ u i u i 1 u i 1 2 7 δ 2 u i δ u i 1 δ u i 1 2 2 calculation of standard deviation and universal threshold parameters for each u δu δ2u variables the standard deviation is calculated and the expected maximum value for a random and normal variable whose standard deviation is estimated by σ and whose mean is zero is computed using the universal threshold parameter 8 λ u 2 ln n where n is the total number of signal data points 3 calculation of the rotation angle of the threshold ellipsoid principal axis in the u δ2u space 9 θ t a n 1 u i δ 2 u i u i 2 4 dimension calculation of large and small principal axes of threshold ellipsoids for the phase space of u δu the sizes of the large and small axes of the ellipsoid are λ u σ u and λ u σ δ u respectively for the phase space of δu δ2u the sizes of the large and small axes of the ellipsoid are λ u σ δ u and λ u σ δ 2 u respectively moreover for the phase space of u δ2u the sizes of the large and small axes of the ellipsoid are obtained by solving the following equations simultaneously in which a is the large axis and b is the small axis of ellipsoid 10 λ u σ u 2 a 2 c o s 2 θ b 2 s i n 2 θ 11 λ u σ δ 2 u 2 a 2 s i n 2 θ b 2 c o s 2 θ 2 3 three dimensional rousseeuw phase space 3d rps method the 3d rps method proposed by zhong et al 2020 combines two different algorithms 3d pst of wahl 2003 and a combination of the re method of rousseeuw and leroy 1998 and the mobile window method of zou et al 2008 these methods are applied separately to the input signal and sum of the points identified as outliers in each of these two steps are considered as the final result of the despiking process the detected spikes are then replaced with a more appropriate value this algorithm attempts to use a three dimensional threshold ellipsoid instead of using the projection of three dimensional threshold ellipsoids on three planes u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u to identify spikes the other primary part of the 3d rps method includes using robust statistical parameters to develop this algorithm in a way that instead of using the mean parameter the median is used as a robust location estimator as well instead of using the standard deviation parameter the median absolute deviation mad is applied as a scale estimator the use of these robust statistical parameters makes this method more efficient than the pst method this means that the spike values do not affect the estimators while these effects on the mean and standard deviation parameters are high in addition instead of using the universal threshold value as the boundary separating the normal and outlier regions the chauvenet s criterion is applied coleman steele 1999 the three dimensional threshold is used because if the two dimensional threshold in each principal plane of u δu u δ2u and δu δ2u were to be used the process of despiking would require three comparisons to be made in every plane and spikes would ultimately be detected if they were located outside of a complex 3d shape analogous to an ellipsoid but with knobby projections in each of the eight phase space quadrants the knobs allow some data points outside the 3d ellipsoid to be retained as normal data to prevent this error a single comparison test using the 3d ellipsoid shape after removing the median of the signal and calculating the first and second derivatives of the signal similar to the pst method is implemented and the ellipsoid is defined in spherical coordinates of ρ ϕ and θ as 12 1 ρ 2 s i n φ c o s θ c o s α c o s φ s i n α 2 a 2 s i n φ c o s θ s i n α c o s φ c o s α 2 b 2 s i n φ s i n θ 2 c 2 where a and b are the large and small principal axes of the threshold ellipsoid which are projected on the u δ2u plane respectively and c is the large principal axis of the threshold ellipsoid that is projected on the δu δ2u plane α shows the rotation angle of the ellipsoid in the u δ2u plane which is calculated using eq 4 the process of identifying data points outside this 3 d threshold ellipsoid is performed in such a way that at first the position of the data points is calculated in three dimensional space of u δu δ2 u in spherical coordinates as distance from the center of coordinates ρ and two angles of ϕ and θ which are the angles between the line connecting the data point to the center of coordinates and the principal axes of δ2u and u respectively and then the value of ρ is compared to value of ρε that ρe is the distance of a point to center of coordinates which is at the surface of 3d ellipsoid and has the same angles of φ and θ with the data point that intends to specify its type finally if ρ is greater than ρ e it indicates the presence of a data point inside the threshold and if ρ is smaller than ρ e it shows that the data point is outside the threshold and is an outlier to implement the second step of this method the re algorithm combines with the mobile window method in such a manner that at first all data points are separated as different groups with a fixed width mobile window moving across the signal then with the help of median parameter location is estimated using eq 13 and with the help of mad parameter the scale estimated using eq 14 and with the use of these two parameters data points in each window are standardized using eq 15 13 m median i 1 n u i 14 s e median i 1 n u i m e mad 15 z i u i m s 16 o i z i c where n is the number of signal data points ui is the velocity value of each data point e is an estimated coefficient with the value of 1 483 zi is the standardized value of data points oi in eq 16 is the parameter that determines whether the data point is an outlier or normal and c is the threshold value between normal and outlier region the data points that have an oi greater than zero are deemed as spikes to detect spikes a threshold value is set on standardized data points and data points that lie outside this threshold are deemed as outlier data in this study chauvenet s criterion is used as the threshold chauvenet s criterion value depends on the window width and the number of data points located in every window to find the optimal value for this parameter different values for the width of windows and the best option that detects most of the spikes and flattens the input signal optimally need to be assumed and chosen the combination of these two steps in the 3d rps method increases the accuracy of the despiking process consequently due to the non iterative process of this method the occurrence of an overprocessing phenomenon is prevented flowcharts of the pst and 3drps algorithms are shown in fig 2 to demonstrate the despiking replacement steps 2 4 performance evaluation of despiking methods to evaluate the performance of the applied methods appropriate statistical parameters such as pearson correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsc are been used the streamflow data are compared with the ones obtained from the rating curve method as the reference in addition the parameter relative discharge differences have been used to compare the output of the despiking approaches and the rating curve method using the following equation 17 relative d i s c h a r g e d i f f e r e n c e d d reference d d reference d reference 2 5 study area and fat data the fat observation is carried out in the gono river located in miyoshi city hiroshima prefecture japan the length of the gono river is approximately 194 km the saiju and basen rivers are the two main tributaries of the gono river which meet about 3 km from the data collection site the slope of the river bed in the selected reach region was measured 0 11 and the river bed is composed of sand and boulder the average annual flow rate is approximately 73 cubic meters per second kawanisi et al 2016 a 115 meter wide reach was selected for the location of the transducers to collect data at this site two 30 khz fat were diagonally deployed on both sides of the river where the horizontal distance between them was set 294 6 m the data was collected every 30 s for six days from february 1 to february 6 2015 the total amount of data is 10 600 fig 3 shows the data collection area and location of upstream and downstream stations fig 4 shows the raw flow velocity data measured by the fat there are numerous spikes that cause significant error in velocity and streamflow calculations 3 results and discussion 3 1 standard deviation method results in this study data in the range of 0 05 to 1 8 m s were considered as normal data and points outside this range were assumed to be a spike fig 5 a shows the data points identified as outliers by the std method fig 5 b alsoshows a comparison of the unspiked signal with the std method output out of 10 600 data 156 data 1 47 of the total were identified as outliers although most of the obvious spikes are detected by this method it should be noted that using user judgment in flood events when the flow velocity increases significantly or even in estuaries when the tides occur tidal velocities are shown by negative values increases the error furthermore the existence of significant fluctuations in the processed signal implies that the std does not perform well in despiking acoustic tomographic output 3 2 pst method results fig 6 shows the three phase spaces for the first and fourth iterations of the pst method the values of the data points and their position relative to the threshold ellipses are specified as well the data points with scattered values and farther away from other points which have formed a dense cluster are removed during these iterations the reduction of the dimensions of the ellipses in these four iterations shows the proper identification of outlier points with this method it should be pointed out that the completion criterion of the pst iterations is that no outliers beyond these ellipses must be detected in the last iteration however in this study this criterion was not met for the fat signal in addition to the weaknesses and limitations of the pst method in despiking signals with a high percentage of outliers as previously stated in islam and zhu 2013 due to the dense spikes in the signal causing improper performance of the replacement method finally to solve this problem by examining the changes in the standard deviation value of the signal fluctuations around its average during different iterations of this method in the fourth to fifth iteration this change was tiny on the scale of less than one thousandth thus the overall dispersion of signal points relative to the mean value in these consecutive iterations did not change much due to the proper flattening of the signal after the fourth iteration this iteration was considered the last repetition it should be noted that the standard deviation value of the data fluctuations around the average signal value before the despiking process was 0 201 and after the fourth iteration reached 0 0866 fig 7 a depicts the total number of points identified as outliers in four iterations of the pst approach fig 7b shows a comparison of the input signal to the pst algorithm output out of 10 600 data 3475 data 32 78 of the total data were identified and replaced as outliers 3 3 3drps method results this method involves two steps in the first step which isthe 3dpst algorithm data points were shown in three dimensional space with a threshold ellipse after eliminating the median value from the signal and calculating the required parameters of eq 7 the data points outside the three dimensional threshold ellipsoid were identified by comparing the values of the ρ and ρ parameters out of 10 600 data 2220 20 94 of the total data were identified as outliers fig 8 a shows the position of the data points outside the three dimensional threshold ellipsoid to apply the re method in the second step the data points must first be standardized using eq 10 the mobile window method is then used to consider a window with a specific width which depends on the optimum chauvenet s criterion for the input signal it depends on the number of data points in each window and is used as the threshold value the spike data points would be identified if their standardized value be outsidethis threshold the signals are divided into 21 groups of 500 data and the threshold value which depends on the selected window width is applied chauvenet s criterion used to identify outliers is 3 29 as a threshold value for 500 data points the state of the data after the standardization and application of chauvenet s criterion is shown in fig 8b as shown this parameter does an excellent job of distinguishing between good and bad data the despiked output of this method was obtained after aggregating the spikes identified in both steps of the method and replacing these points with the average value of two data points on each side of them the signal standard deviation before despiking was 0 201 and decreased to 0 094 after the process indicating a reduction in data dispersion around the signal average fig 9 a shows the total points identified as outliers in the 3drps method fig 9b represents the output of the 3drps method and the raw signal before despiking the output signal of the 3dpst method and the output signal of the re method out of 10 600 data 1726 data 16 28 of the total data were identified and replaced as outliers by the 3drps method the re method alone outperformed the 3dpst method in most areas and their combination and aggregation produced a better result than each of them individually did 3 4 streamflow results in this section the accuracy of different despiking methods is evaluated these results are compared with the streamflow of the rating curve method as the reference as shown in fig 10 a the inadequate performance of the std method in these comparisons and the existence of sudden severe fluctuations at several points of the output signal of this method are evident interestingly the result of the std method is more consistent with the output of the rating curve than the pst method in some regions e g february 5th the reason for this error indicates the improper performance of the pst method in signals with a high percentage of the presence of outliers as a result the pst method is unsuitable for the despiking of tomographic data the comparison of the 3drps method with pst and std methods reveals a better performance of 3drps fig 10b illustrates the output fluctuations of the 3drps method around the rc reference method which are significantly reduced compared to the pst and std methods it is especially visible between 3rd and 6th february consequently the output of this method is flatter than the ones of the other two methods and involves fewer sudden fluctuations 3 5 uncertainty analysis fig 11 shows the relative difference of streamflow between the three proposed methods and the rating curve data as the reference fig 11a shows the performance of the std method the relative discharge difference of most data points is in the range of 15 however for some outliers that std is unable to identify the relative discharge difference exceeds up to 40 fig 11b illustrates the relative discharge difference of the pst method it is clear that the majority of the points have a relative discharge difference in the range of 10 to 20 with some points exceeding this range by even more than 20 furthermore when comparing this figure to the previous one it is observed that although the output of the stdmethod is morerelative in most points than the one in pstmethod the pst performed better in signal flattening fig 11c represents the relative discharge difference of the 3drps method most of the points are in the range of 10 and a few points are also seen outside this range and in the range of 15 to 18 by comparing these results the functional superiority of the 3drps method compared to other methods in comparison with the rc data can be concluded the correlation diagram of the despking methods versus the rating curve data is shown in fig 12 the reduction in data correlation with the rc methodin the case of the pst method compared to undespiked data is an exciting point that acknowledges the limitation of the pst method in the case of highly contaminated signals finally this parameter demonstrates the superiority of the 3drps method in comparison with other methods table 2 summarizes the performance of various dispiking methods that are statistically compared with the rating curve data the r2 coefficients were 0 883 0 798 and 0 913 for the std pst and 3drps methods respectively the rmse demonstrates the superiority of the 3drps method over the other existing methods the std method has a value of 5 899 m3 s which reduces to 4 676 m3 s for the 3drps technique furthermore the pst technique with the lowest performance indicates that the pst technique has a functional constraint for severely contaminated signals the functional superiority of the 3drps method was also confirmed when the mape decreased from 5 838 for the std method to 5 123 for 3drps this parameter also indicates the poor performance of the pst method as the mape of pst is even higher than the mape of the std method and itcomes to mindthat considering the level of the signal flattening with the help of the despiking techniques alone cannot help to evaluate their accuracy and performance furthermore by examining the nsc coefficient which is used to evaluate the predictive ability of hydrological models and the closer the value of this parameter to 1 the better the performance of that method the 3drps method has the best performance among the applied methods and the nsc value has increased from 0 572 for the std to 0 731 for 3drps for this parameter the pst method is still recognized as the worst method in terms of performance the computational time effort of a computer system to process the algorithms and assess the computational cost of each of them is another metric that may be used to compare the performance of algorithms the computational times of the pst and 3drps algorithms were examined using the wolfram mathematica version 12 software in acomputer system with the following specifications processor intel r core tm i7 4510u cpu 2 00 ghz 2 60 ghz ram 8 00 gb ddr3 7 90 gb useable system type 64 bit operating system x64 based processor the computational time effort was 4 min and 2 s and 1 min and 54 s for the pst and 3drps methods respectively as a result the 3drps approach is more efficient than the pst algorithm as evidenced by the results this may have been inferred even before the despiking process because the pst method is iterative the computational cost of this algorithm appears to be higher than the 3drps method due to the repetition of calculations in successive iterations 4 discussion the signal to noise ratio snr which is defined as 10 times the logarithm of the peak amplitude of received signals is one of the important factors in fat and is used as a determinant component between clean and noisy data where data with snrs less than 10 db are removed as noisy data figs 13 and 14 show the snr values for all detected spikes using the pst and 3drps methods for upstream t1 and downstream t2 stations red points respectively and compared with ones for all received signals black points it was observed that the detected spikes in both pst and 3drps methods have acceptable and sufficient snr levels to be regarded as valid in terms of the clean pulse as a result there is not any relationship between the snr value of data and the outliers it is necessary to mentionthat in the pst method no parameters must be quantified by the analyst and the process of thresholding definition for all phase spaces is completed by combining the standard deviation of the velocity signal and its derivatives with universal threshold parameter that requires no tuning and only depends on the number of data points which is the fundamentaladvantage of this algorithm over others for the 3drps method however the operator should decide on the value of the chauvenet s parameter which is the c parameter in eq 16 as the threshold for standardizedvalues because the value of chauvenet s criterion depends on the number of data points in each window this parameter was quantified using standardized data values that helped in selecting the optimal number of data points in each window whichcorresponded to an optimum chauvenet value that appropriately separated two areas of normal and spike data as shown in fig 8 the optimum value of the chauvenet s threshold that can separate the normal and spike region is approximately 3 by selecting 500 data for each window which is equivalent to the value of 3 29 for chauvenet s criterion the normal and spike regions are separated optimally and data points lie outside the normal region considered as spikes are detected by the re method furthermore another coefficient used in the 3drps method i e e in eq 14 is quantified as 1 483 due to the explanation of wahl 2003 which stated that the 1 483 coefficient is a factor that makes the scale estimator i e s in eq 14 analogous to the standard deviation the usual scale parameter of a normal distribution 5 conclusion for hydrological studies as well as water resources management it is vital to understand streamflow properties under normal and extreme climatic conditions over the short term few hours and long term several days to several years acoustic tomography technique provides such streamflow data however the presence of spikes is an issue that affects the quality and validity of streamflow data a despiking process is needed to purify the fat output signal in this study two despiking methods of phase space thresholding pst and three dimensional rousseeuw phase space thresholding 3d rps are applied to detect fat outliers in addition the results of these methods were compared with the results of the simple standard deviation method which was previously used to detect the spikes of fat data in conclusion the 3d rps method has the best performance with a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of 0 731 compared to 0 572 and 0 44 for the std and pst methods respectively the outcomes demonstrate that streamflowmeasurement accuracy is also significantly improved after the despiking process with the relative errors with rating curve data as a reference decreasing from 40 for the std approach to 15 for the 3drps approach declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3441,the migration of salt marshes into forests along coastal regions is nowadays well documented sea level rise and storms threaten coastal forests by increasing groundwater levels and salinity salinization is the main cause of forest conversion to salt marsh in north america in this paper we study groundwater levels and salinity in two wells installed at the border between forest and salt marsh in the lower delmarva peninsula usa the upper well is located in the regenerative forest where recruitment is still possible while the lower well is located in the persistent forest where only mature trees survive groundwater in the upper well is fresh at the root depth while in the lower well the mean salinity is 8 ppt our data suggest that rainfall has an instantaneous effect on salinity and groundwater levels but it does not affect salinity and groundwater levels on longer periods weeks to months groundwater levels and salinity reflect the hydraulic gradient toward the marsh a proxy for outgoing water fluxes the uphill hydraulic gradient a proxy for incoming water fluxes and temperature a proxy for evapotranspiration salinity increases when groundwater levels are high to explain this result we put forward the hypothesis that a high water table favors the flux of surficial fresh water to the marsh and loss of freshwater by evapotranspiration these losses are likely replenished by saltier water moving at depth 1 introduction freshwater availability flooding and soil salinity can be considered the main drivers of ecological zonation in many coastal regions thibodeau et al 1998 gardner et al 2002 wilson et al 2015 in temperate areas these factors play a crucial role in structuring the salt marsh forest interface desantis et al 2007 fagherazzi et al 2019a kirwan and gedan 2019 williams et al 1999 being either not salt tolerant or not flood tolerant coastal trees can be killed by increasing tidal flooding leading to forest retreat and marsh expansion coastal forest retreat is generally driven by sea level rise and storm events that affect the marsh upland boundary at different spatial and temporal scales sea level rise progressively increases the salinity of costal zones thus influencing vegetation recruitment see fagherazzi et al 2019a for a review salt intrusion in aquifers can also be exacerbated by water withdrawals in populated areas barlow and reichard 2010 strong winds and storm surges usually associated with tropical cyclones can cause short term damages and killing of trees making space available for new vegetation according to duryea et al 2007 strong winds are responsible for defoliation breakage and uprooting of trees storm surges cause saltwater intrusion that suppresses seed germination suffocates and inhibits root formation and tree survival fernandes et al 2018 in general tree seedlings are more susceptible to salt and flooding than mature trees whereas storm events directly affect the survival of all trees kearney et al 2019 rainfall events can have a positive effect on the forest bordering a salt marsh reducing groundwater salinity by dilution sumner and belaineh 2005 however as sea level increases rainfalls could flood soils causing tree mortality from anoxia stanturf et al 2007 when occurring simultaneously rainfall and salt intrusion events result in specific dynamics if the soil was already saturated with fresh water before a storm surge it is unlikely that groundwater salinity increases allen et al 1998 gardner et al 1992 flooding events affect the available oxygen content in the soil decrease the soil redox potential and consequently slow the photosynthetic activity in flood intolerant vegetation species anderson and pezeshki 1999 salt intrusion in the soil undermines the growth of new leaves and accelerate the senescence of mature trees munns and tester 2008 poljakoff mayber and gale 1975 evapotranspiration is also a main hydrological driver in coastal forests evapotranspiration creates an upward soil water flow with solute concentrating or precipitating near the soil surface making salt ions available to be absorbed by roots mohamed et al 2000 the relationship among precipitation evapotranspiration and tidal oscillations is fundamental to characterize groundwater levels and salinity in a forest and adjacent salt marsh tidal inputs directly affect groundwater discharge li et al 1999 when large storm surges occur flooding often augment the salinity of the soil affecting vegetation growth salt intrusion can also reach deep ground layers and the aquifer robinson et al 2007 all hydrological inputs should be considered to determine groundwater dynamics during a storm although many studies have focused on the marsh upland boundary dynamics fagherazzi et al 2019a b or have analyzed and interpreted salinity data for these regions gardner et al 2002 carter et al 2008 the salinity dynamics at the marsh upland interface remain unclear the goal of this paper is to characterize variations in groundwater level and salinity in a coastal forest bordering a salt marsh we will explore how rainfall evapotranspiration and storm surges might control both water level and salinity for two wells our preliminary results indicate that groundwater dynamics at the marsh forest interface can be complex and therefore will require extensive field campaigns in the future 2 study area we focus our study on a coastal forest in the eastern shore of virginia national wildlife refuge on the southern tip of the delmarva peninsula in virginia united states fig 1 the delmarva peninsula is bordered by the atlantic ocean on the eastern side and by chesapeake bay on the western and southern sides this area is experiencing particularly high rates of sea level rise around 5 mm yr sallenger et al 2012 the forest is dominated by loblolly pine pinus taeda particularly common in the southeastern regions of the united states at the salt marsh boundary the forest changes to a woody shrubs zone characterized by juniperus virginiana iva frutescens baccharis halimifolia and myrica cerifera fernandes et al 2018 this zone borders in turn a salt marsh ecosystem where spartina alterniflora is the most representative species the delmarva peninsula climate varies between humid subtropical to the south characteristic of eastern virginia to humid continental to the north characteristic of northern delaware and north eastern maryland the average annual maximum daily temperature in cape charles close to our study area is 19 4 c while the average annual minimum daily

cm on msl at kiptopeke station the delmarva peninsula is often affected by tropical cyclones and winter nor easters that can cause coastal flooding according to the virginia department of emergency management the delmarva peninsula has been hit by some of the strongest storm events since 2003 on september 18th 2003 during hurricane isabel sea level reached 1 34 m on navd88 at the noaa kiptopeke station on november 13th 2009 during tropical depression ida and nor easter sea level reached 1 50 m on august 27th 2011 during hurricane irene sea level reached 1 35 m and on october 29th 2012 during hurricane sandy sea level reached 1 48 m over the years storm events along with sea level rise have affected the ecological zonation of the marsh forest interface establishing a higher regenerative zone rich of saplings and a lower persistent forested zone where only mature trees survive kearney et al 2019 sea level rise advances the salt marsh in the forest while storm events move the lower boundary of the regenerative zone towards the upland this ecological ratchet was fully described in fagherazzi et al 2019 3 data water level and conductivity were measured in two groundwater wells along a transect fig 1b the transect starts at the marsh boundary to the north and ends in the middle of the forest it was chosen to be perpendicular to the gently sloping hillside reaching the regeneration zone a schlumberger water service ctd diver able to measure conductivity temperature and water depth was installed in each well a first well was placed at the lowest boundary of the pine forest in the persistent zone where adult trees can survive but not saplings the well is at 1 16 m 0 14 m lower well and at a depth of 0 80 cm below the ground surface elevation of 0 334 m on nadv88 the second well was placed at the line of sapling at the beginning of the regenerative zone at 1 24 m 0 13 m upper well and at a depth of 0 90 m below the ground surface elevation of 0 507 m on nadv88 the wells were screened to the surface according to mcfarland and scott 2006 the approximate altitude of the top of bedrock basement is between 1500 m and 1800 m on ngvd29 navd88 in the virginia eastern shore well positions on a slope inclination angle estimated 0 86 deg suggest the general flow direction from the upper site to the marsh in 2013 mean chesapeake forest age ranged from 16 to 40 years according to fire effects information system feis pinus taeda taproots grow between 1 2 and 1 5 m in depth therefore the ctd depth of around 0 80 m in the lower well corresponds to the mean root depth hourly water level data were collected from 08 january 2014 to 07 january 2015 and referenced to north american vertical datum 1988 navd88 hourly conductivity data were converted into hourly water salinity data using the conductivity salinity algorithm provided by fofonoff and millard 1983 where data are reported in practical salinity scale 1978 pss78 the soil of the study area has been characterized on the basis of cores collected in january 2014 for both lower well site and upper well site six soil samples at depth of 0 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 95 cm were taken the particles size was analyzed using a ro tap sieve shaker equipped with sieves of 2000 μm 1000 μm 500 μm 250 μm 125 μm and 63 μm finally obtained data were processed using gradistatv8 program blott and pye 2001 soil can be homogeneously classified as moderately sorted medium fine sandy in the study area fig 2 available hourly precipitation data cm hr were collected by the virginia coast reserve long term ecological research vcr lter at the hog island station vcr97018 because of the 38 kilometer distance between hog island station and the eastern shore of virginia national wildlife refuge precipitation data collected at this station might not capture all rainfall events daily temperature data collected at the same station are used to assess evapotranspiration effects on groundwater levels evapotranspiration was estimated using temperature based approaches domec et al 2012 hargreaves and allen 2003 thornthwaite 1948 trajkovic 2005 yates and strzepek 1994 which might result in an overestimation in such humid conditions if the model used is not correctly calibrated trajkovic 2007 sea level data were obtained from the noaa kiptopeke station identifier 8632200 kiptopeke station is located 5 km from the study site and the data are referred to navd88 tidal data also capture storm surges 4 results the groundwater table dynamics in both wells are similar fig 3 d while salinity values indicate a significant difference fig 3e according to kearney et al 2019 the groundwater table fig 3d is generally below the ground surface except for few days when either occasional heavy rainfalls or long rainy periods occur fig 3a this happens several times during the year at the lower well on 11 january 13 february 16 april 16 may 8 september and 24 december when the water level reaches the ground surface at 102 cm on navd88 on the other hand flooding only occurs in the upper well on 8 september when the groundwater level reaches the ground surface at 124 cm on navd88 overall groundwater table elevations vary from 36 9 cm to 112 6 cm above navd88 in the lower well and from 35 5 cm to 137 8 cm in the upper well in the lower well closer to the salt marsh the salinity values are much higher than the values in the upper well in particular in the lower well the salinity ranges from 0 13 to 11 48 ppt while in the upper well the salinity ranges from 0 01 to 0 29 ppt fig 3e a moving average carried out considering a window of 800 h highlights the seasonal trend of groundwater table and groundwater salinity fig 3d e the most conspicuous precipitation events occur from april to september and range from a minimum of around 1 cm hr in april to a maximum of 2 2 cm h on september 7 the largest storm surge events of 69 7 cm occurred on november 2 and on december 9 other storm surges events of around 50 cm occurred over the year fig 3b the corresponding moving average for observed sea water level range from a maximum of 31 cm in october to a minimum of 35 cm in november four temporal windows are selected to better analyze the most important features of the dataset fig 4 5 4 1 precipitation and groundwater levels in general precipitation events are reflected in the groundwater level dataset as instantaneous increases fig 6 a cumulative rainfall is calculated for each precipitation event neglecting the rainfall that moved as runoff when the soil was fully saturated in both wells groundwater level significantly increases r2 0 311p 0 05 in the lower well and r2 0 497p 0 05 in the upper well as the rainfall amount increases a consistent increase in water level from few centimeters to around 40 cm occurs when rainfall amounts are above 1 cm from september 7 to september 9 precipitation events between 3 and 8 cm along with storm surges between 10 and 40 cm cause a water level increase of around 70 cm in the lower well and of around 100 cm in the upper well exceeding the ground surface respectively of 10 6 cm and of 13 8 cm fig 5d a precipitation event of 2 62 cm occurred between february 12 and february 13 and it is reflected as an increase of 22 cm in the lower well and of 27 30 cm in the upper well fig 4a d this event floods the ground surface at the lower location with 3 3 cm a precipitation event of around 1 cm causes a groundwater increase of 3 cm in window d fig 5f i in window b fig 4f 1 a similar precipitation events cause groundwater increases between 5 cm and 12 cm therefore groundwater level response to precipitation is not always the same this can be explained by the presence of lateral water fluxes affecting the water table elevation and antecedent soil moisture conditions some precipitation events in windows a fig 4a d c fig 5a d and d fig 5f i are not reflected in the groundwater level this discrepancy might be due to the location of the weather station which is several kilometers away after each precipitation event water level tends to decrease due to hydrologic recession dynamics 4 2 evaporation and groundwater levels according to gardner et al 2002 evapotranspiration triggers a daily step like decrease in the elevation of the groundwater table this typical trend can be seen during the warmer summer season for example in window b fig 4i during sunlight hours evapotranspiration is higher due to the combined effects of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation the higher the external air temperature the higher the decrease in groundwater level the groundwater level in both wells remains quite constant during the nighttime hours the daylight decrease is between 3 cm and 4 cm an overall drop of 30 cm can be reached in this period if the instantaneous increments due to precipitation are not strong enough to increase the average groundwater level fig 4i the evapotranspiration effect is reduced in the fall season in window c fig 5d the groundwater level drops only 1 cm during the daylight hours the step like decrease associated to evapotranspiration is not present during the winter season 4 3 salinity in the upper well salinity is around zero and not related to precipitation events fig 6b here groundwater can be considered freshwater fig 3e in the lower well the salinity trend is strictly connected to lateral fluxes of water precipitation events are reflected in the salinity record as instantaneous drops due to dilution effects of the additional rainfall water the decrease in salinity is not correlated to rainfall amount fig 6b in window a and window b fig 4a e f l two similar rainfall amounts 2 62 cm and 2 35 cm cause very different decreases in salinity 6 64 ppt and 0 20 ppt respectively the second precipitation event in window c fig 5a e is not felt in the salinity record instantaneous drops in salinity are instead correlated to water level r2 0 345p 0 05 fig 6c once again the salinity drops are related to water level increases calculated neglecting runoff effects in particular when water level increases from 0 cm to 15 cm the absolute value of salinity drops increase linearly from 0 ppt to 3 ppt the highest values of 6 64 ppt in terms of salinity drop is reached during the precipitation event on 12 february fig 4e after each precipitation event salinity value increases fast tending to reach the value before rainfall dilution and sometimes surpassing it in window a c and d the salinity increase after storms seems to be associated to surge events in window a fig 4b e a storm surge event of 51 7 cm increased the salinity of 1 69 ppt compared to the value before the storm while in window c fig 5b e a storm surge event of 45 9 cm slowly increased the salinity of 4 55 ppt after this increase the salinity level remains higher a storm surge event of 69 7 cm occurred on december 8 increases the groundwater level and salinity respectively of 20 cm and 1 67 ppt in the lower well fig 5i l this event leads groundwater level in the lower well to reach level higher than in the upper well inverting the groundwater flux negative hydraulic gradient rainfall events are not detected over this time salinity increases when storm surge occurs but the variables are not significantly correlated fig 7 a storm surge effects on salinity are tested considering maximum storm surges and their time duration when no precipitation events occur fig 7b a significant correlation is found between storm surge duration and salinity increase for storm surge events higher than 40 cm fig 7b in window b fig 4l we detect a diurnal salinity oscillation due to evapotranspiration in a time period not affected by precipitation events during sunlight hours when evapotranspiration is higher and water level is decreasing salinity tends to decrease while during the nighttime when evapotranspiration is low and groundwater levels are constant salinity tends to increase moreover in this time window neap spring tidal modulation seems to affect variations in salinity during the neap tide the average salinity is around 3 ppt while during the spring tide the salinity is around 4 ppt 4 4 weekly and monthly relationships among groundwater level groundwater salinity evapotranspiration sea level and rainfall the relationships between groundwater level salinity rainfall seawater level and evapotranspiration are analyzed using a linear regression analysis the variables are correlated considering a temporal window spanning from 1 h to 2 months all variables are averaged across the temporal windows monthly salinity is significantly correlated to monthly groundwater level in the lower well fig 8 a the correlation is also significantly positive for all temporal windows with r2 values ranging from 0 475 to 0 832 fig 8d the relationships between groundwater level and rainfall temperature upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients are presented in fig 9 10 and 11 the hydraulic gradients are considered here as a proxy for the flux of water reaching the lower well from upstream or discharging toward the marsh monthly groundwater levels are significantly correlated to temperature upstream discharge from the upper well and downstream discharge to sea fig 9 a significant negative correlation is present between groundwater level and temperature with a r2 ranging from 0 336 for a one week window to 0 533 for a one month window on a yearly scale fig 11a therefore upstream hydraulic gradient has the strongest control on groundwater level while rainfall is weakly correlated to groundwater levels on a seasonal scale correlation between groundwater level and upstream hydraulic gradient is always significantly positive for all seasons with r2 values higher than 0 385 fig 11 b c d e the temperature effect is significant during summer fig 11 c reaching r2 values of 0 771 for a two week window groundwater level is significantly correlated to downstream discharge in spring and summer with r2 values higher than 0 331 for one day and one month temporal windows fig 11 b c in fig 11 we report the determination coefficients between salinity rainfall temperature upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients fig 11 f g h i l monthly groundwater salinity is significantly correlated to temperature upstream discharge from the upper well and downstream discharge to the marsh fig 10 the correlation between salinity and hydraulic gradients is significantly positive with r2 values higher than 0 315 for temporal windows ranging from 1 day to 1 month on a yearly scale fig 11f salinity is negative correlated to temperature with r2 values ranging from 0 341 to 0 461 for temporal windows from 1 h to 1 month fig 11f on a yearly scale salinity and upstream hydraulic gradient are significantly correlated in summer and fall fig 11 h i downstream hydraulic gradient has the most remarkable effect on salinity during spring and summer fig 11 g h temperature variations are significantly felt in the salinity trend during winter and fall season fig 11 i l a multiple regression analysis is conducted considering only independent variables leading to significant effects on the dependent variables of groundwater level and salinity on a yearly scale table 1 2 groundwater level is correlated to temperature upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients while groundwater salinity is correlated to groundwater level upstream and downstream gradients and temperature a first model considering all variables is proposed to describe groundwater level and salinity trends table 1 2 multicollinearity leads to non significant coefficients for some independent variables even if the regression as a whole is significant redundant information is provided by different variables after looking for the best combinations among variables two other models are proposed both salinity and groundwater level are analyzed in a multivariate space firstly with upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients and then with upstream hydraulic gradients and temperature for each temporal window adjusted r2 values increase in comparison to single regressions analysis of residuals confirm that removing one or more variables from the multivariate dataset leads to information lost and that the model well represents the groundwater level trend parameters obtained in the sub models are significant p 0 05 and give a positive effect on the analysis 5 discussion the data collected at the two wells shed light on the groundwater dynamics in the forested area of the eastern shore of virginia national wildlife refuge in 2014 in particular the four temporal windows and the correlation analysis among hydrological variables enable to draw important conclusions about the effects of external drivers on water table elevation and groundwater salinity which in turn control vegetation cover 5 1 water levels rainfall events evapotranspiration groundwater fluxes from the uphill and toward the marsh control groundwater level in different ways across short and long temporal scales fig 12 a rainfall causes instantaneous increases in the groundwater level the larger is the cumulative rainfall in a single event the higher is the increment in groundwater level this occurs at both wells suggesting a significant positive correlation between the two variables at the event scale fig 6a after every water level peak due to rainfall the water level values decrease approaching the mean water level as consequence of the deep water recharge process cumulative rainfall does not have a direct effect on the groundwater level in the lower well on a long timescale fig 9a e 11a b c d r2 values are not significant the inter storm periods are on average around 2 days for all seasons fig 3a during spring and summer the precipitation events are more intense on average around 0 4 cm while during winter and fall precipitation is around 0 2 cm for each event the longer the inter storm periods are the more likely is the groundwater level to decrease under the same inter storm conditions if the precipitation event is conspicuous ponding and surface runoff will likely occur assouline et al 2007 during summer mainly in july and august precipitation is abundant but the water level is decreasing due to evapotranspiration in the four temporal windows it is possible to see how in correspondence of particular precipitation events groundwater levels reach values higher than the ground surface at both wells this happens in window a fig 4d and c fig 5d in the lower well and in windows c in the upper well fig 5d during these events the soil can be considered saturated and water in excess accumulates over the ground level in correspondence of the wells additional water might flow along the slope as runoff according to the data reported in the four windows it takes between 7 h fig 4d to 2 days fig 5d to terminate water ponding and resume water infiltration depending on quantity and frequency of external precipitation inputs flooding events are dangerous for pinus taeda survival reduced oxygen availability and a significant decrease in soil redox potential directly affect water uptake from the soil anderson and pezeshki 1999 pezeshki 1992 intermittent flooding can cause different results on stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic activity in seedling of different species reaching the worst scenario when the reduction is so large that plants cannot recover any more anderson and pezeshki 1999 pezeshki 1992 indicates that a reduction in soil redox potential of 100 mv occurs in 10 days of flooding over a treatment period of 30 days flooding resulted in a substantial reduction of soil redox potential stomatal conductance and biomass pezeshki 1992 evapotranspiration is one of the most significant drivers of groundwater level at longer temporal scales evapotranspiration mostly occurs during summer fig 4i when air temperature in the daylight hours is high and photosynthesis takes place during this period trees fully foliated transpire to maintain their inner temperature this results in a decrease of mean water level of about 30 cm in both wells over the summer period evapotranspiration dominates over the other hydrological fluxes the role of evapotranspiration is confirmed in the single regression analysis for the lower well fig 11a b c d e over the year the maximum correlation between groundwater level and temperature is reached on a temporal window of one month fig 9b 11a the hydraulic gradient between the lower well and sea level is the other chief variable controlling groundwater levels the higher is the groundwater level the more abundant is the downhill flux of water fig 11a during spring and summer the groundwater level is positively correlated to discharge toward the marsh fig 11b c this suggests that low groundwater levels are more affected by the discharge to the marsh during winter and fall high groundwater levels are not significantly affected by the discharge to the marsh the existence of groundwater discharge to the sea has been already investigated in coastal regions li et al 1999 robinson et al 2007 werner et al 2013 taniguchi et al 2002 michael et al 2005 both fresh and salt groundwater discharges are present the saline flow involves the deeper zone while the fresh groundwater flow moves closer to the ground on the basis of our analysis we can suppose the presence of a fresh groundwater flow to the marsh affecting the groundwater level at our site storm surges are not significantly correlated to increments in groundwater level although in windows a c and d fig 4b d 5b d g i storm surge events do increase mean groundwater values the storm surge events occur in correspondence to significant rainfalls that usually saturate the soil fig 4a fig 5a f they do not lead to an instantaneous change in water level but they likely magnify the water level increase note that during the study period there was not a major storm surge able to flood the entire forest the hydraulic gradient from uphill to the lower well significantly affects groundwater levels over the year the correlation between the two variables is significantly positive reaching r2 values higher than 0 4 fig 11a the homogenous and sandy soil justifies this relation favoring groundwater flow downhill a multiple regression analysis yields adjusted r2 values higher than 0 56 considering a model where upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients are dependent variables and higher than 0 71 considering a model where upstream hydraulic discharge and temperature are dependent variables an analysis on their correlation confirm they are negative linked a model considering all dependent variables suggest that temperature and downstream discharge carry a redundant information making multiple regression parameters not significant table 1 overall the multiple regression provides better results in comparison to single regression 5 2 salinity groundwater salinity is not significantly correlated to precipitation events even if it is possible to recognize an instantaneous decrease in salinity as the rainfall amount increases fig 6b as soon as the rainfall stops the salinity increases to values similar to the pre event conditions as temperature increases evapotranspiration increases and salinity decreases fig 11 during fall the correlation between salinity and temperature is significantly positive fig 11i in september an intense rainfall event occurred along with a large storm surge and groundwater levels increased until reaching the soil fig 3a b d 5a b d a water table near the surface leads to higher evaporation when this occurs salt ions are likely to accumulate near the ground surface moving upwards along with water in the unsaturated zone and leaving the original depth mohamed et al 2000 this could justify lower salinity values collected by ctd at a fixed deeper position the groundwater flux to the sea is positively correlated to salinity in the lower well fig 11f this occurs mainly during spring and summer fig 11g h a net freshwater discharge can justify this trend when groundwater is high in the lower well water from the top fresh layer flows toward the marsh and it is replenished by saltier water coming from below fig 12b a release of freshwater from the ground decreases the dilution of salt water and salinity increases the maximum increase of salinity is reached in september when sea level was around 85 cm on nadv88 fig 6b in that month a significant storm surge event fig 5b acted along with high temperatures and groundwater discharge from uphill to increase salinity the conspicuous amount of rainfall that occurred during the storm was unable to infiltrate the saturated soil and moved away as runoff a similar event occurred in window a fig 4b in this period most of the rainfall infiltrated a storm surge occurred after some hours from the rainfall event salinity first rapidly decreased as a consequence of rainfall and then increased because of mixing with the saline water salinity kept increasing until it surpassed the value before the event due to storm surge effects storm surge events can be recognized as a slow increase in salinity in comparison to the steep increase after rainfall dilution when no precipitation events occur salinity increases are positively correlated to storm surge duration if storm surges are higher than 40 cm fig 7b the hydraulic gradient between the upper and lower well is positively correlated to salinity over the year and in each season fig 11f g h i l therefore a large groundwater discharge from uphill augments groundwater salinity we suppose that the discharge from uphill becomes more saline during its infiltration path reaching deeper saline areas and recharging the lower well from below groundwater salinity is strongly correlated to groundwater level in the lower well for all temporal windows ranging from 1 h to 2 months fig 8a c d as the groundwater level increases the salinity increases and vice versa the groundwater level is directly linked to the recharge from uphill the discharge toward the marsh and evapotranspiration a multiple regression analysis yields adjusted r2 values higher than 0 35 considering a model where upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients are independent variables and higher than 0 57 considering a model where upstream hydraulic discharge and temperature are independent variables a model considering all independent variables suggest that groundwater level temperature and downstream discharge carry redundant information making multiple regression parameters not significant table 2 the models proposed are those leading to the best results in terms of significance as a whole and for each parameter overall the multiple regression provides better results in comparison to single regressions we put forward the hypothesis that the discharge toward the marsh and evapotranspiration are depleting the surficial freshwater layer while the uphill groundwater flux brings saltier water an increase in water table elevation would therefore expose the freshwater layer to more evapotranspiration and fluxes to the marsh reducing salinity when the water table is low more freshwater can be safely stored in the ground and in the root zone the sharp geotechnical boundary between forest and the marsh can also accentuate these dynamics the impermeable marsh soils rich in silt and clay might prevent deep groundwater fluxes forcing the water to move superficially from the forest to the marsh as return flow or runoff fig 12b this surficial flux would deplete the freshwater stored in shallow layers increasing salinity in the sandy hillslope water from uphill can infiltrate and move in deeper layers mixing with saltier water and thus bringing salt to the downhill location our results indicate that higher groundwater levels would trigger evapotranspiration and fluxes to the marsh removing freshwater and increasing salinity at the roots depth this negative effect can be magnified by sea level rise which would further increase the water table elevation and deplete freshwater in the roots area encouraging salt water intrusion from deeper layers on long timescale the maximum correlation among all variables is reached using monthly averages we therefore conclude that drivers of groundwater hydrology act at temporal scale of weeks and not instantaneously for example the average sea level in a month has more effect on the water table elevation than the instantaneous water level sandy soils can faster drain water infiltrating from the unsaturated zone to recharge the groundwater systems kutílek and nielsen 1994 in clay soils water movement is slower and the effect of rainfall inputs on groundwater level is likely felt in a weaker way cao et al 2012 in low lying areas dominated by shallow water an upward discharge from below tend to pond the ground surface in clay soils the evaporation losses are usually smaller due to the capacity of the medium to retain more water kutílek and nielsen 1994 or and lehmann 2019 moreover sandy soils are less prone to salinization than clay soils because salts attach to small particles while they are easily leached in sand when flow is faster high hydraulic conductivity advection dominates batany et al 2019 so that groundwater flow from the upper to the lower sites can bring salts leached in deeper zones plants that tolerate osmotic stress can adapt to new salinity conditions these plants exclude na from leaf blades and roots or compartmentalize na and cl at the cellular and intracellular level munns and tester 2008 the latter method is less efficient because the accumulation space is limited hasegawa et al 2000 pinus taeda is unable to use one of these approaches pezeshki 1992 and salt water disturbs its roots environment undermining photosynthetic activity nawaz et al 2010 in the lower zone of the forest new salt tolerant plant species can encroach where pinus taeda trees die because of salinization ultimately expanding the marsh environment first invasive species like phragmites australis chambers et al 1999 tend to expand finding better light condition in the gaps of the dying forest this species can tolerate low salinities 5 ppt hellings and gallagher 1992 lissner et al 1997 but can be soon replaced by extremely salt tolerant marsh species like spartina patens juncus gerardi and spartina alterniflora very common in the lower area of chesapeake bay rice et al 2000 hester et al 2001 in the regenerative zone we did not detect a significant increase in salinity here freshwater enables the forest to regenerate with saplings 6 implications for sea level rise and coastal forests our results can provide critical insight on the effect of sea level rise on coastal forests our data indicate that an increase in groundwater levels at the marsh boundary might trigger an increase in salinity in the root zone sea level rise is likely to increase water levels in coastal aquifers in some coastal locations the percentage of flooded area by groundwater has already expanded due to climate change rotzoll and fletcher 2013 the percentage could be higher in topography limited systems like north atlantic coast gleeson et al 2011 where sea level rise is accelerating church and white 2006 miller et al 2013 sallenger et al 2012 this increase in groundwater levels will likely trigger an increase in salinity similar results were presented by michael et al 2013 using numerical simulations in low lying areas where groundwater recharge is topographically limited an increase in sea level results in the intersection of the groundwater table with the ground surface favoring runoff and reducing the amount of freshwater that can be stored in the soil as a result the freshwater hydraulic head landward cannot balance slr seaward causing salinization of the aquifer moreover michael et al 2013 simulations show that the salinization rate is higher in isotropic soils with high permeability like those present at our study site our measurements confirm this hypothesis and provide a quantitative relationship between water level and salinity that can be used to forecast the effect of sea level rise on forest ecosystems 7 conclusions high resolution hydrological measurements in a coastal forest bordering a salt marsh indicate that the groundwater is fresh in the higher regenerative zone where tree saplings are present while it is brackish in the lower persistence zone where only mature trees survive in the short term timescale of hours groundwater levels significantly increase after a rainfall while salinity decreases storm surges are felt in the salinity trend as slow increments as compared to the instantaneous steep decrease caused by rainfall and subsequent increase due to mixing with saline water in the medium term timescales of weeks and months temperature a proxy for evapotranspiration uphill and downhill hydraulic gradients a proxy for lateral groundwater fluxes significantly influence groundwater levels and salinity statistical analysis suggests that rainfall is not a direct driver of water level and salinity at the monthly timescale surprisingly salinity at the root depth is high when the water table is high we ascribe this counterintuitive result to depletion of the top freshwater layer caused by surficial and sub surficial fluxes to the marsh and increased evapotranspiration when water levels are high we hypothesize that the lost freshwater is replaced by more saline water flowing at depth from uphill sea level rise by increasing the water table could therefore augment the salinity of the groundwater at the root depth triggering forest dieback finally although our results confirm that sea level rise and storm surge events increase groundwater salinity according to already published works in the root zone they suggest complex dynamics we would need more field data to corroborate our hypothesis but just showing groundwater complexities using our two datasets is in our view a good starting point for future

3441,the migration of salt marshes into forests along coastal regions is nowadays well documented sea level rise and storms threaten coastal forests by increasing groundwater levels and salinity salinization is the main cause of forest conversion to salt marsh in north america in this paper we study groundwater levels and salinity in two wells installed at the border between forest and salt marsh in the lower delmarva peninsula usa the upper well is located in the regenerative forest where recruitment is still possible while the lower well is located in the persistent forest where only mature trees survive groundwater in the upper well is fresh at the root depth while in the lower well the mean salinity is 8 ppt our data suggest that rainfall has an instantaneous effect on salinity and groundwater levels but it does not affect salinity and groundwater levels on longer periods weeks to months groundwater levels and salinity reflect the hydraulic gradient toward the marsh a proxy for outgoing water fluxes the uphill hydraulic gradient a proxy for incoming water fluxes and temperature a proxy for evapotranspiration salinity increases when groundwater levels are high to explain this result we put forward the hypothesis that a high water table favors the flux of surficial fresh water to the marsh and loss of freshwater by evapotranspiration these losses are likely replenished by saltier water moving at depth 1 introduction freshwater availability flooding and soil salinity can be considered the main drivers of ecological zonation in many coastal regions thibodeau et al 1998 gardner et al 2002 wilson et al 2015 in temperate areas these factors play a crucial role in structuring the salt marsh forest interface desantis et al 2007 fagherazzi et al 2019a kirwan and gedan 2019 williams et al 1999 being either not salt tolerant or not flood tolerant coastal trees can be killed by increasing tidal flooding leading to forest retreat and marsh expansion coastal forest retreat is generally driven by sea level rise and storm events that affect the marsh upland boundary at different spatial and temporal scales sea level rise progressively increases the salinity of costal zones thus influencing vegetation recruitment see fagherazzi et al 2019a for a review salt intrusion in aquifers can also be exacerbated by water withdrawals in populated areas barlow and reichard 2010 strong winds and storm surges usually associated with tropical cyclones can cause short term damages and killing of trees making space available for new vegetation according to duryea et al 2007 strong winds are responsible for defoliation breakage and uprooting of trees storm surges cause saltwater intrusion that suppresses seed germination suffocates and inhibits root formation and tree survival fernandes et al 2018 in general tree seedlings are more susceptible to salt and flooding than mature trees whereas storm events directly affect the survival of all trees kearney et al 2019 rainfall events can have a positive effect on the forest bordering a salt marsh reducing groundwater salinity by dilution sumner and belaineh 2005 however as sea level increases rainfalls could flood soils causing tree mortality from anoxia stanturf et al 2007 when occurring simultaneously rainfall and salt intrusion events result in specific dynamics if the soil was already saturated with fresh water before a storm surge it is unlikely that groundwater salinity increases allen et al 1998 gardner et al 1992 flooding events affect the available oxygen content in the soil decrease the soil redox potential and consequently slow the photosynthetic activity in flood intolerant vegetation species anderson and pezeshki 1999 salt intrusion in the soil undermines the growth of new leaves and accelerate the senescence of mature trees munns and tester 2008 poljakoff mayber and gale 1975 evapotranspiration is also a main hydrological driver in coastal forests evapotranspiration creates an upward soil water flow with solute concentrating or precipitating near the soil surface making salt ions available to be absorbed by roots mohamed et al 2000 the relationship among precipitation evapotranspiration and tidal oscillations is fundamental to characterize groundwater levels and salinity in a forest and adjacent salt marsh tidal inputs directly affect groundwater discharge li et al 1999 when large storm surges occur flooding often augment the salinity of the soil affecting vegetation growth salt intrusion can also reach deep ground layers and the aquifer robinson et al 2007 all hydrological inputs should be considered to determine groundwater dynamics during a storm although many studies have focused on the marsh upland boundary dynamics fagherazzi et al 2019a b or have analyzed and interpreted salinity data for these regions gardner et al 2002 carter et al 2008 the salinity dynamics at the marsh upland interface remain unclear the goal of this paper is to characterize variations in groundwater level and salinity in a coastal forest bordering a salt marsh we will explore how rainfall evapotranspiration and storm surges might control both water level and salinity for two wells our preliminary results indicate that groundwater dynamics at the marsh forest interface can be complex and therefore will require extensive field campaigns in the future 2 study area we focus our study on a coastal forest in the eastern shore of virginia national wildlife refuge on the southern tip of the delmarva peninsula in virginia united states fig 1 the delmarva peninsula is bordered by the atlantic ocean on the eastern side and by chesapeake bay on the western and southern sides this area is experiencing particularly high rates of sea level rise around 5 mm yr sallenger et al 2012 the forest is dominated by loblolly pine pinus taeda particularly common in the southeastern regions of the united states at the salt marsh boundary the forest changes to a woody shrubs zone characterized by juniperus virginiana iva frutescens baccharis halimifolia and myrica cerifera fernandes et al 2018 this zone borders in turn a salt marsh ecosystem where spartina alterniflora is the most representative species the delmarva peninsula climate varies between humid subtropical to the south characteristic of eastern virginia to humid continental to the north characteristic of northern delaware and north eastern maryland the average annual maximum daily temperature in cape charles close to our study area is 19 4 c while the average annual minimum daily temperature is 10 6 c the average annual rainfall is around 1140 mm the delmarva peninsula experiences a semidiurnal tidal cycle with a mean low tide mlw of 0 40 cm and a mean high tide mhw of 0 393 cm on msl at kiptopeke station the delmarva peninsula is often affected by tropical cyclones and winter nor easters that can cause coastal flooding according to the virginia department of emergency management the delmarva peninsula has been hit by some of the strongest storm events since 2003 on september 18th 2003 during hurricane isabel sea level reached 1 34 m on navd88 at the noaa kiptopeke station on november 13th 2009 during tropical depression ida and nor easter sea level reached 1 50 m on august 27th 2011 during hurricane irene sea level reached 1 35 m and on october 29th 2012 during hurricane sandy sea level reached 1 48 m over the years storm events along with sea level rise have affected the ecological zonation of the marsh forest interface establishing a higher regenerative zone rich of saplings and a lower persistent forested zone where only mature trees survive kearney et al 2019 sea level rise advances the salt marsh in the forest while storm events move the lower boundary of the regenerative zone towards the upland this ecological ratchet was fully described in fagherazzi et al 2019 3 data water level and conductivity were measured in two groundwater wells along a transect fig 1b the transect starts at the marsh boundary to the north and ends in the middle of the forest it was chosen to be perpendicular to the gently sloping hillside reaching the regeneration zone a schlumberger water service ctd diver able to measure conductivity temperature and water depth was installed in each well a first well was placed at the lowest boundary of the pine forest in the persistent zone where adult trees can survive but not saplings the well is at 1 16 m 0 14 m lower well and at a depth of 0 80 cm below the ground surface elevation of 0 334 m on nadv88 the second well was placed at the line of sapling at the beginning of the regenerative zone at 1 24 m 0 13 m upper well and at a depth of 0 90 m below the ground surface elevation of 0 507 m on nadv88 the wells were screened to the surface according to mcfarland and scott 2006 the approximate altitude of the top of bedrock basement is between 1500 m and 1800 m on ngvd29 navd88 in the virginia eastern shore well positions on a slope inclination angle estimated 0 86 deg suggest the general flow direction from the upper site to the marsh in 2013 mean chesapeake forest age ranged from 16 to 40 years according to fire effects information system feis pinus taeda taproots grow between 1 2 and 1 5 m in depth therefore the ctd depth of around 0 80 m in the lower well corresponds to the mean root depth hourly water level data were collected from 08 january 2014 to 07 january 2015 and referenced to north american vertical datum 1988 navd88 hourly conductivity data were converted into hourly water salinity data using the conductivity salinity algorithm provided by fofonoff and millard 1983 where data are reported in practical salinity scale 1978 pss78 the soil of the study area has been characterized on the basis of cores collected in january 2014 for both lower well site and upper well site six soil samples at depth of 0 cm 20 cm 40 cm 60 cm 80 cm and 95 cm were taken the particles size was analyzed using a ro tap sieve shaker equipped with sieves of 2000 μm 1000 μm 500 μm 250 μm 125 μm and 63 μm finally obtained data were processed using gradistatv8 program blott and pye 2001 soil can be homogeneously classified as moderately sorted medium fine sandy in the study area fig 2 available hourly precipitation data cm hr were collected by the virginia coast reserve long term ecological research vcr lter at the hog island station vcr97018 because of the 38 kilometer distance between hog island station and the eastern shore of virginia national wildlife refuge precipitation data collected at this station might not capture all rainfall events daily temperature data collected at the same station are used to assess evapotranspiration effects on groundwater levels evapotranspiration was estimated using temperature based approaches domec et al 2012 hargreaves and allen 2003 thornthwaite 1948 trajkovic 2005 yates and strzepek 1994 which might result in an overestimation in such humid conditions if the model used is not correctly calibrated trajkovic 2007 sea level data were obtained from the noaa kiptopeke station identifier 8632200 kiptopeke station is located 5 km from the study site and the data are referred to navd88 tidal data also capture storm surges 4 results the groundwater table dynamics in both wells are similar fig 3 d while salinity values indicate a significant difference fig 3e according to kearney et al 2019 the groundwater table fig 3d is generally below the ground surface except for few days when either occasional heavy rainfalls or long rainy periods occur fig 3a this happens several times during the year at the lower well on 11 january 13 february 16 april 16 may 8 september and 24 december when the water level reaches the ground surface at 102 cm on navd88 on the other hand flooding only occurs in the upper well on 8 september when the groundwater level reaches the ground surface at 124 cm on navd88 overall groundwater table elevations vary from 36 9 cm to 112 6 cm above navd88 in the lower well and from 35 5 cm to 137 8 cm in the upper well in the lower well closer to the salt marsh the salinity values are much higher than the values in the upper well in particular in the lower well the salinity ranges from 0 13 to 11 48 ppt while in the upper well the salinity ranges from 0 01 to 0 29 ppt fig 3e a moving average carried out considering a window of 800 h highlights the seasonal trend of groundwater table and groundwater salinity fig 3d e the most conspicuous precipitation events occur from april to september and range from a minimum of around 1 cm hr in april to a maximum of 2 2 cm h on september 7 the largest storm surge events of 69 7 cm occurred on november 2 and on december 9 other storm surges events of around 50 cm occurred over the year fig 3b the corresponding moving average for observed sea water level range from a maximum of 31 cm in october to a minimum of 35 cm in november four temporal windows are selected to better analyze the most important features of the dataset fig 4 5 4 1 precipitation and groundwater levels in general precipitation events are reflected in the groundwater level dataset as instantaneous increases fig 6 a cumulative rainfall is calculated for each precipitation event neglecting the rainfall that moved as runoff when the soil was fully saturated in both wells groundwater level significantly increases r2 0 311p 0 05 in the lower well and r2 0 497p 0 05 in the upper well as the rainfall amount increases a consistent increase in water level from few centimeters to around 40 cm occurs when rainfall amounts are above 1 cm from september 7 to september 9 precipitation events between 3 and 8 cm along with storm surges between 10 and 40 cm cause a water level increase of around 70 cm in the lower well and of around 100 cm in the upper well exceeding the ground surface respectively of 10 6 cm and of 13 8 cm fig 5d a precipitation event of 2 62 cm occurred between february 12 and february 13 and it is reflected as an increase of 22 cm in the lower well and of 27 30 cm in the upper well fig 4a d this event floods the ground surface at the lower location with 3 3 cm a precipitation event of around 1 cm causes a groundwater increase of 3 cm in window d fig 5f i in window b fig 4f 1 a similar precipitation events cause groundwater increases between 5 cm and 12 cm therefore groundwater level response to precipitation is not always the same this can be explained by the presence of lateral water fluxes affecting the water table elevation and antecedent soil moisture conditions some precipitation events in windows a fig 4a d c fig 5a d and d fig 5f i are not reflected in the groundwater level this discrepancy might be due to the location of the weather station which is several kilometers away after each precipitation event water level tends to decrease due to hydrologic recession dynamics 4 2 evaporation and groundwater levels according to gardner et al 2002 evapotranspiration triggers a daily step like decrease in the elevation of the groundwater table this typical trend can be seen during the warmer summer season for example in window b fig 4i during sunlight hours evapotranspiration is higher due to the combined effects of vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation the higher the external air temperature the higher the decrease in groundwater level the groundwater level in both wells remains quite constant during the nighttime hours the daylight decrease is between 3 cm and 4 cm an overall drop of 30 cm can be reached in this period if the instantaneous increments due to precipitation are not strong enough to increase the average groundwater level fig 4i the evapotranspiration effect is reduced in the fall season in window c fig 5d the groundwater level drops only 1 cm during the daylight hours the step like decrease associated to evapotranspiration is not present during the winter season 4 3 salinity in the upper well salinity is around zero and not related to precipitation events fig 6b here groundwater can be considered freshwater fig 3e in the lower well the salinity trend is strictly connected to lateral fluxes of water precipitation events are reflected in the salinity record as instantaneous drops due to dilution effects of the additional rainfall water the decrease in salinity is not correlated to rainfall amount fig 6b in window a and window b fig 4a e f l two similar rainfall amounts 2 62 cm and 2 35 cm cause very different decreases in salinity 6 64 ppt and 0 20 ppt respectively the second precipitation event in window c fig 5a e is not felt in the salinity record instantaneous drops in salinity are instead correlated to water level r2 0 345p 0 05 fig 6c once again the salinity drops are related to water level increases calculated neglecting runoff effects in particular when water level increases from 0 cm to 15 cm the absolute value of salinity drops increase linearly from 0 ppt to 3 ppt the highest values of 6 64 ppt in terms of salinity drop is reached during the precipitation event on 12 february fig 4e after each precipitation event salinity value increases fast tending to reach the value before rainfall dilution and sometimes surpassing it in window a c and d the salinity increase after storms seems to be associated to surge events in window a fig 4b e a storm surge event of 51 7 cm increased the salinity of 1 69 ppt compared to the value before the storm while in window c fig 5b e a storm surge event of 45 9 cm slowly increased the salinity of 4 55 ppt after this increase the salinity level remains higher a storm surge event of 69 7 cm occurred on december 8 increases the groundwater level and salinity respectively of 20 cm and 1 67 ppt in the lower well fig 5i l this event leads groundwater level in the lower well to reach level higher than in the upper well inverting the groundwater flux negative hydraulic gradient rainfall events are not detected over this time salinity increases when storm surge occurs but the variables are not significantly correlated fig 7 a storm surge effects on salinity are tested considering maximum storm surges and their time duration when no precipitation events occur fig 7b a significant correlation is found between storm surge duration and salinity increase for storm surge events higher than 40 cm fig 7b in window b fig 4l we detect a diurnal salinity oscillation due to evapotranspiration in a time period not affected by precipitation events during sunlight hours when evapotranspiration is higher and water level is decreasing salinity tends to decrease while during the nighttime when evapotranspiration is low and groundwater levels are constant salinity tends to increase moreover in this time window neap spring tidal modulation seems to affect variations in salinity during the neap tide the average salinity is around 3 ppt while during the spring tide the salinity is around 4 ppt 4 4 weekly and monthly relationships among groundwater level groundwater salinity evapotranspiration sea level and rainfall the relationships between groundwater level salinity rainfall seawater level and evapotranspiration are analyzed using a linear regression analysis the variables are correlated considering a temporal window spanning from 1 h to 2 months all variables are averaged across the temporal windows monthly salinity is significantly correlated to monthly groundwater level in the lower well fig 8 a the correlation is also significantly positive for all temporal windows with r2 values ranging from 0 475 to 0 832 fig 8d the relationships between groundwater level and rainfall temperature upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients are presented in fig 9 10 and 11 the hydraulic gradients are considered here as a proxy for the flux of water reaching the lower well from upstream or discharging toward the marsh monthly groundwater levels are significantly correlated to temperature upstream discharge from the upper well and downstream discharge to sea fig 9 a significant negative correlation is present between groundwater level and temperature with a r2 ranging from 0 336 for a one week window to 0 533 for a one month window on a yearly scale fig 11a therefore upstream hydraulic gradient has the strongest control on groundwater level while rainfall is weakly correlated to groundwater levels on a seasonal scale correlation between groundwater level and upstream hydraulic gradient is always significantly positive for all seasons with r2 values higher than 0 385 fig 11 b c d e the temperature effect is significant during summer fig 11 c reaching r2 values of 0 771 for a two week window groundwater level is significantly correlated to downstream discharge in spring and summer with r2 values higher than 0 331 for one day and one month temporal windows fig 11 b c in fig 11 we report the determination coefficients between salinity rainfall temperature upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients fig 11 f g h i l monthly groundwater salinity is significantly correlated to temperature upstream discharge from the upper well and downstream discharge to the marsh fig 10 the correlation between salinity and hydraulic gradients is significantly positive with r2 values higher than 0 315 for temporal windows ranging from 1 day to 1 month on a yearly scale fig 11f salinity is negative correlated to temperature with r2 values ranging from 0 341 to 0 461 for temporal windows from 1 h to 1 month fig 11f on a yearly scale salinity and upstream hydraulic gradient are significantly correlated in summer and fall fig 11 h i downstream hydraulic gradient has the most remarkable effect on salinity during spring and summer fig 11 g h temperature variations are significantly felt in the salinity trend during winter and fall season fig 11 i l a multiple regression analysis is conducted considering only independent variables leading to significant effects on the dependent variables of groundwater level and salinity on a yearly scale table 1 2 groundwater level is correlated to temperature upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients while groundwater salinity is correlated to groundwater level upstream and downstream gradients and temperature a first model considering all variables is proposed to describe groundwater level and salinity trends table 1 2 multicollinearity leads to non significant coefficients for some independent variables even if the regression as a whole is significant redundant information is provided by different variables after looking for the best combinations among variables two other models are proposed both salinity and groundwater level are analyzed in a multivariate space firstly with upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients and then with upstream hydraulic gradients and temperature for each temporal window adjusted r2 values increase in comparison to single regressions analysis of residuals confirm that removing one or more variables from the multivariate dataset leads to information lost and that the model well represents the groundwater level trend parameters obtained in the sub models are significant p 0 05 and give a positive effect on the analysis 5 discussion the data collected at the two wells shed light on the groundwater dynamics in the forested area of the eastern shore of virginia national wildlife refuge in 2014 in particular the four temporal windows and the correlation analysis among hydrological variables enable to draw important conclusions about the effects of external drivers on water table elevation and groundwater salinity which in turn control vegetation cover 5 1 water levels rainfall events evapotranspiration groundwater fluxes from the uphill and toward the marsh control groundwater level in different ways across short and long temporal scales fig 12 a rainfall causes instantaneous increases in the groundwater level the larger is the cumulative rainfall in a single event the higher is the increment in groundwater level this occurs at both wells suggesting a significant positive correlation between the two variables at the event scale fig 6a after every water level peak due to rainfall the water level values decrease approaching the mean water level as consequence of the deep water recharge process cumulative rainfall does not have a direct effect on the groundwater level in the lower well on a long timescale fig 9a e 11a b c d r2 values are not significant the inter storm periods are on average around 2 days for all seasons fig 3a during spring and summer the precipitation events are more intense on average around 0 4 cm while during winter and fall precipitation is around 0 2 cm for each event the longer the inter storm periods are the more likely is the groundwater level to decrease under the same inter storm conditions if the precipitation event is conspicuous ponding and surface runoff will likely occur assouline et al 2007 during summer mainly in july and august precipitation is abundant but the water level is decreasing due to evapotranspiration in the four temporal windows it is possible to see how in correspondence of particular precipitation events groundwater levels reach values higher than the ground surface at both wells this happens in window a fig 4d and c fig 5d in the lower well and in windows c in the upper well fig 5d during these events the soil can be considered saturated and water in excess accumulates over the ground level in correspondence of the wells additional water might flow along the slope as runoff according to the data reported in the four windows it takes between 7 h fig 4d to 2 days fig 5d to terminate water ponding and resume water infiltration depending on quantity and frequency of external precipitation inputs flooding events are dangerous for pinus taeda survival reduced oxygen availability and a significant decrease in soil redox potential directly affect water uptake from the soil anderson and pezeshki 1999 pezeshki 1992 intermittent flooding can cause different results on stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic activity in seedling of different species reaching the worst scenario when the reduction is so large that plants cannot recover any more anderson and pezeshki 1999 pezeshki 1992 indicates that a reduction in soil redox potential of 100 mv occurs in 10 days of flooding over a treatment period of 30 days flooding resulted in a substantial reduction of soil redox potential stomatal conductance and biomass pezeshki 1992 evapotranspiration is one of the most significant drivers of groundwater level at longer temporal scales evapotranspiration mostly occurs during summer fig 4i when air temperature in the daylight hours is high and photosynthesis takes place during this period trees fully foliated transpire to maintain their inner temperature this results in a decrease of mean water level of about 30 cm in both wells over the summer period evapotranspiration dominates over the other hydrological fluxes the role of evapotranspiration is confirmed in the single regression analysis for the lower well fig 11a b c d e over the year the maximum correlation between groundwater level and temperature is reached on a temporal window of one month fig 9b 11a the hydraulic gradient between the lower well and sea level is the other chief variable controlling groundwater levels the higher is the groundwater level the more abundant is the downhill flux of water fig 11a during spring and summer the groundwater level is positively correlated to discharge toward the marsh fig 11b c this suggests that low groundwater levels are more affected by the discharge to the marsh during winter and fall high groundwater levels are not significantly affected by the discharge to the marsh the existence of groundwater discharge to the sea has been already investigated in coastal regions li et al 1999 robinson et al 2007 werner et al 2013 taniguchi et al 2002 michael et al 2005 both fresh and salt groundwater discharges are present the saline flow involves the deeper zone while the fresh groundwater flow moves closer to the ground on the basis of our analysis we can suppose the presence of a fresh groundwater flow to the marsh affecting the groundwater level at our site storm surges are not significantly correlated to increments in groundwater level although in windows a c and d fig 4b d 5b d g i storm surge events do increase mean groundwater values the storm surge events occur in correspondence to significant rainfalls that usually saturate the soil fig 4a fig 5a f they do not lead to an instantaneous change in water level but they likely magnify the water level increase note that during the study period there was not a major storm surge able to flood the entire forest the hydraulic gradient from uphill to the lower well significantly affects groundwater levels over the year the correlation between the two variables is significantly positive reaching r2 values higher than 0 4 fig 11a the homogenous and sandy soil justifies this relation favoring groundwater flow downhill a multiple regression analysis yields adjusted r2 values higher than 0 56 considering a model where upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients are dependent variables and higher than 0 71 considering a model where upstream hydraulic discharge and temperature are dependent variables an analysis on their correlation confirm they are negative linked a model considering all dependent variables suggest that temperature and downstream discharge carry a redundant information making multiple regression parameters not significant table 1 overall the multiple regression provides better results in comparison to single regression 5 2 salinity groundwater salinity is not significantly correlated to precipitation events even if it is possible to recognize an instantaneous decrease in salinity as the rainfall amount increases fig 6b as soon as the rainfall stops the salinity increases to values similar to the pre event conditions as temperature increases evapotranspiration increases and salinity decreases fig 11 during fall the correlation between salinity and temperature is significantly positive fig 11i in september an intense rainfall event occurred along with a large storm surge and groundwater levels increased until reaching the soil fig 3a b d 5a b d a water table near the surface leads to higher evaporation when this occurs salt ions are likely to accumulate near the ground surface moving upwards along with water in the unsaturated zone and leaving the original depth mohamed et al 2000 this could justify lower salinity values collected by ctd at a fixed deeper position the groundwater flux to the sea is positively correlated to salinity in the lower well fig 11f this occurs mainly during spring and summer fig 11g h a net freshwater discharge can justify this trend when groundwater is high in the lower well water from the top fresh layer flows toward the marsh and it is replenished by saltier water coming from below fig 12b a release of freshwater from the ground decreases the dilution of salt water and salinity increases the maximum increase of salinity is reached in september when sea level was around 85 cm on nadv88 fig 6b in that month a significant storm surge event fig 5b acted along with high temperatures and groundwater discharge from uphill to increase salinity the conspicuous amount of rainfall that occurred during the storm was unable to infiltrate the saturated soil and moved away as runoff a similar event occurred in window a fig 4b in this period most of the rainfall infiltrated a storm surge occurred after some hours from the rainfall event salinity first rapidly decreased as a consequence of rainfall and then increased because of mixing with the saline water salinity kept increasing until it surpassed the value before the event due to storm surge effects storm surge events can be recognized as a slow increase in salinity in comparison to the steep increase after rainfall dilution when no precipitation events occur salinity increases are positively correlated to storm surge duration if storm surges are higher than 40 cm fig 7b the hydraulic gradient between the upper and lower well is positively correlated to salinity over the year and in each season fig 11f g h i l therefore a large groundwater discharge from uphill augments groundwater salinity we suppose that the discharge from uphill becomes more saline during its infiltration path reaching deeper saline areas and recharging the lower well from below groundwater salinity is strongly correlated to groundwater level in the lower well for all temporal windows ranging from 1 h to 2 months fig 8a c d as the groundwater level increases the salinity increases and vice versa the groundwater level is directly linked to the recharge from uphill the discharge toward the marsh and evapotranspiration a multiple regression analysis yields adjusted r2 values higher than 0 35 considering a model where upstream and downstream hydraulic gradients are independent variables and higher than 0 57 considering a model where upstream hydraulic discharge and temperature are independent variables a model considering all independent variables suggest that groundwater level temperature and downstream discharge carry redundant information making multiple regression parameters not significant table 2 the models proposed are those leading to the best results in terms of significance as a whole and for each parameter overall the multiple regression provides better results in comparison to single regressions we put forward the hypothesis that the discharge toward the marsh and evapotranspiration are depleting the surficial freshwater layer while the uphill groundwater flux brings saltier water an increase in water table elevation would therefore expose the freshwater layer to more evapotranspiration and fluxes to the marsh reducing salinity when the water table is low more freshwater can be safely stored in the ground and in the root zone the sharp geotechnical boundary between forest and the marsh can also accentuate these dynamics the impermeable marsh soils rich in silt and clay might prevent deep groundwater fluxes forcing the water to move superficially from the forest to the marsh as return flow or runoff fig 12b this surficial flux would deplete the freshwater stored in shallow layers increasing salinity in the sandy hillslope water from uphill can infiltrate and move in deeper layers mixing with saltier water and thus bringing salt to the downhill location our results indicate that higher groundwater levels would trigger evapotranspiration and fluxes to the marsh removing freshwater and increasing salinity at the roots depth this negative effect can be magnified by sea level rise which would further increase the water table elevation and deplete freshwater in the roots area encouraging salt water intrusion from deeper layers on long timescale the maximum correlation among all variables is reached using monthly averages we therefore conclude that drivers of groundwater hydrology act at temporal scale of weeks and not instantaneously for example the average sea level in a month has more effect on the water table elevation than the instantaneous water level sandy soils can faster drain water infiltrating from the unsaturated zone to recharge the groundwater systems kutílek and nielsen 1994 in clay soils water movement is slower and the effect of rainfall inputs on groundwater level is likely felt in a weaker way cao et al 2012 in low lying areas dominated by shallow water an upward discharge from below tend to pond the ground surface in clay soils the evaporation losses are usually smaller due to the capacity of the medium to retain more water kutílek and nielsen 1994 or and lehmann 2019 moreover sandy soils are less prone to salinization than clay soils because salts attach to small particles while they are easily leached in sand when flow is faster high hydraulic conductivity advection dominates batany et al 2019 so that groundwater flow from the upper to the lower sites can bring salts leached in deeper zones plants that tolerate osmotic stress can adapt to new salinity conditions these plants exclude na from leaf blades and roots or compartmentalize na and cl at the cellular and intracellular level munns and tester 2008 the latter method is less efficient because the accumulation space is limited hasegawa et al 2000 pinus taeda is unable to use one of these approaches pezeshki 1992 and salt water disturbs its roots environment undermining photosynthetic activity nawaz et al 2010 in the lower zone of the forest new salt tolerant plant species can encroach where pinus taeda trees die because of salinization ultimately expanding the marsh environment first invasive species like phragmites australis chambers et al 1999 tend to expand finding better light condition in the gaps of the dying forest this species can tolerate low salinities 5 ppt hellings and gallagher 1992 lissner et al 1997 but can be soon replaced by extremely salt tolerant marsh species like spartina patens juncus gerardi and spartina alterniflora very common in the lower area of chesapeake bay rice et al 2000 hester et al 2001 in the regenerative zone we did not detect a significant increase in salinity here freshwater enables the forest to regenerate with saplings 6 implications for sea level rise and coastal forests our results can provide critical insight on the effect of sea level rise on coastal forests our data indicate that an increase in groundwater levels at the marsh boundary might trigger an increase in salinity in the root zone sea level rise is likely to increase water levels in coastal aquifers in some coastal locations the percentage of flooded area by groundwater has already expanded due to climate change rotzoll and fletcher 2013 the percentage could be higher in topography limited systems like north atlantic coast gleeson et al 2011 where sea level rise is accelerating church and white 2006 miller et al 2013 sallenger et al 2012 this increase in groundwater levels will likely trigger an increase in salinity similar results were presented by michael et al 2013 using numerical simulations in low lying areas where groundwater recharge is topographically limited an increase in sea level results in the intersection of the groundwater table with the ground surface favoring runoff and reducing the amount of freshwater that can be stored in the soil as a result the freshwater hydraulic head landward cannot balance slr seaward causing salinization of the aquifer moreover michael et al 2013 simulations show that the salinization rate is higher in isotropic soils with high permeability like those present at our study site our measurements confirm this hypothesis and provide a quantitative relationship between water level and salinity that can be used to forecast the effect of sea level rise on forest ecosystems 7 conclusions high resolution hydrological measurements in a coastal forest bordering a salt marsh indicate that the groundwater is fresh in the higher regenerative zone where tree saplings are present while it is brackish in the lower persistence zone where only mature trees survive in the short term timescale of hours groundwater levels significantly increase after a rainfall while salinity decreases storm surges are felt in the salinity trend as slow increments as compared to the instantaneous steep decrease caused by rainfall and subsequent increase due to mixing with saline water in the medium term timescales of weeks and months temperature a proxy for evapotranspiration uphill and downhill hydraulic gradients a proxy for lateral groundwater fluxes significantly influence groundwater levels and salinity statistical analysis suggests that rainfall is not a direct driver of water level and salinity at the monthly timescale surprisingly salinity at the root depth is high when the water table is high we ascribe this counterintuitive result to depletion of the top freshwater layer caused by surficial and sub surficial fluxes to the marsh and increased evapotranspiration when water levels are high we hypothesize that the lost freshwater is replaced by more saline water flowing at depth from uphill sea level rise by increasing the water table could therefore augment the salinity of the groundwater at the root depth triggering forest dieback finally although our results confirm that sea level rise and storm surge events increase groundwater salinity according to already published works in the root zone they suggest complex dynamics we would need more field data to corroborate our hypothesis but just showing groundwater complexities using our two datasets is in our view a good starting point for future

3442,transpiration t is a key hydrological process delivering water essential for plant metabolism and thus affecting productivity a major challenge in estimating stand t is how to accurately scale sap flow data from individual trees to the stand in shrub ecosystems various scaling up methods have been used to extrapolate tree level sap flow measurements to stand level t these include leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches however the performances of different scaling up methods have not been fully explored for shrubs in this study we measured sap flow of a xerophytic shrub salix psammophila and scaled up using measures of leaf area cross sectional area and numbers of branches in order to estimate stand t during the rainy seasons in 2019 and 2020 on the northern loess plateau china in addition we measured precipitation throughfall stemflow soil evaporation surface runoff and 0 200 cm soil water content to calculate actual stand t on the basis of soil water balance method the results revealed that daily stand t differed according to the scaling up methods used for the estimation daily estimated stand t based on measures of leaf area 0 1 13 1 mm d 1 was consistently higher than those based on cross sectional area 0 2 8 6 mm d 1 and number of branches 0 4 8 9 mm d 1 p 0 05 during the two rainy seasons the actual daily mean stand t 2 5 1 6 mm d 1 was significantly lower than the estimation by the three scaling up methods p 0 05 the method based on cross sectional area appeared to be most suitable for scaling up because it had the lowest root mean square error and bias values 0 939 mm d 1 and 0 633 mm d 1 respectively this study highlights the wide variations of stand t upon which scaling up method was chosen and these differences need to be considered when converting tree level sap flow to stand level t in shrub and other ecosystems keywords sap flow scaling up transpiration shrub drylands 1 introduction transpiration t is the process of water moving from soil through the roots stem and leaves of a plant into the atmosphere jones and tardieu 1998 in general t is the desired component with the water being used to enhance plant productivity kool et al 2014 it also controls land surface energy balance determines catchment hydrological responses and influences regional and global climate bonan 2008 poyatos et al 2016 many studies have found that global scale t is by far the largest water flux on the earth s land masses and it dominates terrestrial evapotranspiration et coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 thus accurate measurements of stand t at the ecosystem scale are important for validating regional water balance simulations resolving issues of water resource management and improving our understanding the role of stand t in catchment level hydrological cycles delzon and loustau 2005 ford et al 2007 jiao et al 2018 loustau et al 1996 plant water use has been determined using multiple methods for example by lysimeters liu et al 2002 chambers stannard and weltz 2006 eddy covariance methods wilson et al 2001 and sap flow sf methods shen et al 2015 sf is water flux across a given section of trunk diameter over specified periods it is an important indicator to reflect water movement in plants liu et al 2012 sf measurement methods are thermally based techniques allowing water flow through the stem to be assessed kool et al 2014 given the relatively low costs long term measurement potential easy replication and automation of sf probes sf methods have become the most widely used approach to estimate stand t dudley et al 2018 gwenzi et al 2014 hayat et al 2020 peng et al 2015 when using sf methods to estimate stand t uncertainty in the results may be related to sf variability which is compounded when scaling up both within trees and from tree level to stand level čermák et al 2004 hatton et al 1995 hernandez santana et al 2015 many scaling up methods have been developed and compared to estimate stand t for trees vertessy et al 1997 found that the estimated stand t of large mountain ash trees using stem diameter is more time consuming to apply but yields more robust estimates than leaf area jung et al 2011 found that compared to sapwood area diameter at breast height is a better scaling up method to estimate stand t for mixed deciduous forests quiñonez piñón and valeo 2020 used effective leaf area and actual leaf area to estimate stand t at a coniferous site and found that stand t values based on effective leaf area are more meaningful due to the close relationship with the total amount of leaves as mentioned above additional uncertainty in estimation of stand t may result from the selection of scaling up methods the scaling relationships for different biometric parameters canopy coverage basal area sapwood area and leaf area index can also vary widely poyatos et al 2016 therefore the choice of method to use for scaling sf up to stand level requires careful consideration and it is necessary to explore the effects of different scaling up methods on estimates of stand t in different ecosystems shrubs are the representative plant functional type in drylands and sf methods especially heat balance methods have been widely used to determine water movement dynamics in shrubs domingo et al 1999 mirck and volk 2009 naithani et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 szutu and papuga 2019 in shrubs different methods such as leaf area domingo et al 1999 ji et al 2016 cross sectional area cavanaugh et al 2011 scott et al 2006 and number of branches huang et al 2015 have been used to scale up sf from the tree level to estimate stand level t assuming that sf is measured consistently using the same sf method variations in estimates of stand t may be the result of which methods has been chosen to scale up the values allen and grime 1995 found that the estimated stand t of guiera senegalensis on the basis of cross sectional area was generally more variable than those based on leaf area however few studies have thoroughly explored differences in estimation of stand t resulting from the use of different scaling up methods and compared the estimated results with actual stand t for shrubs in this study we measured sf of a xerophytic shrub salix psammophila and precipitation throughfall stemflow soil evaporation surface runoff and soil water content swc in the stand during the 2019 and 2020 rainy seasons in the northern loess plateau china the stand level t was scaled up from tree level sf using different methods leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches the actual s psammophila stand t was determined using soil water balance method the detailed objectives of this study were to 1 detect the variations of the actual and estimated stand t and 2 compare the performances of the three scaling up methods to estimate the stand t and evaluate the effects of each method on the estimation of stand t for s psammophila 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in liudaogou catchment 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n 1274 m a s l 6 89 km2 which is 14 km from shenmu district on the northern loess plateau china the catchment is in the transitional zone between the loess plateau and the mu us desert and is characterized by many deep gullies and undulating slopes and hills this area has a moderate temperate continental climate with well defined rainy and dry seasons and has a mean annual temperature of 8 4 c range 9 7 c to 23 7 c mean annual precipitation is 437 mm 1971 2013 of which 70 falls in intense rainstorms between july and september the mean annual grass reference evapotranspiration calculated by the fao 56 penman monteith equation is approximately 1200 mm the dominant soil types in this area are sandy loess and sand the groundwater table is more than 20 m below the surface and precipitation is the most important source of available water zhao et al 2021 the original vegetation has been almost completely destroyed as a result of long term human activities in the area the currently dominant shrub species is s psammophila which was planted decades ago s psammophila has an inverted cone shaped crown and no trunk and multiple branches radiate from the base s psammophila usually grows to a height of 3 4 m and has alternate strap shaped leaves with 2 4 mm wide and 40 80 mm long yuan et al 2016 the vertical roots of s psammophila mainly grew in the 0 150 cm layer liu et al 2010a and the horizontal roots were predominantly distributed in the 0 40 cm from the base of shrub zhao et al 2021 2 2 measurements of soil water balance components the measurements were conducted during the rainy seasons from may to september in 2019 and 2020 in this study we selected a representative site with a s psammophila community about 25 years old in the southwest corner of the liudaogou catchment fig 1 a the stand area was 10 m 10 m and there were nine individual s psammophila trees within the experimental site during the study periods canopy height canopy area branch diameter branch angle and leaf area index of the shrubs were measured the morphological characteristics of the s psammophila stand are shown in table 1 soil water balance method can be used to estimate evapotranspiration 1 p i w et r d δs where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm w is the contribution from upward movement of moisture from the water table mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm r is surface runoff mm d is drainage mm and δ s is the change in soil water storage mm in this unirrigated area precipitation is the only source of water the upward movement of water from the water table can be considered to be negligible because the water table is so deep at 20 m liu et al 2010b she et al 2013 drainage can also be ignored because there is a layer of impermeable clay at about 200 cm depth yuan et al 2016 in this shrub stand et can be expressed as follows 2 et t a e i c where ta is actual stand transpiration mm e is stand soil evaporation mm and ic is stand canopy interception mm thus the actual stand t was calculated using the following equation 3 t a p e i c r δ s the measurements and calculations for each of the water balance components in eq 3 are described in detail in the following sections 2 2 1 precipitation a tipping bucket rainfall gauge rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa with a resolution of 0 2 mm was installed in an open area nearby the experimental stand to record the amount and timing of precipitation three standard rain gauges inner diameter 20 cm were also installed to provide data for adjusting the recorded value because the rg3 m rainfall gauge inherently underestimates precipitation groisman and legates 1994 2 2 2 soil evaporation soil evaporation was measured using four automatic weighing lysimeters fig 1b we selected two typical s psammophila shrubs within the experimental stand and installed two weighing lysimeters adjacent to each selected shrub one below the canopy and the other in the gap between shrubs the weighing lysimeter consists of a weighing system and lysimeter vessel comprising a stainless steel cylinder with a cross sectional area of 314 cm2 and a height of 25 cm the lysimeters were calibrated with known mass and were able to detect small changes at a resolution of 10 g m 2 ground surface 0 01 mm the lysimeter weight was taken once every minute and recorded as a value for each 10 min interval with a cr 200 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa the daily stand soil evaporation was the sum of the hourly mean stand soil evaporation of the four weighing lysimeters measurement in a day 2 2 3 canopy interception the canopy interception for the experimental stand of s psammophila was estimated by subtracting stemflow and throughfall from daily precipitation carlyle moses and price 1999 based on branch diameter distribution we selected 42 branches within the experimental stand to measure stemflow stemflow data were collected using aluminum foil collars that were fitted around the entire circumference of branches and sealed using neutral silicone sealant fig 1b the collars were periodically checked for any leakage more detailed information about stemflow measurement can be found in yuan et al 2019 sixteen tipping bucket rainfall gauges were randomly placed under the canopies of s psammophila to collect throughfall within the experimental stand fig 1b the data for stemflow volume and throughfall volume were automatically recorded the daily stand stemflow was calculated as follows yuan et al 2016 4 sf d n sf v a s 10 3 where sf d mm d 1 is the daily stand stemflow n is the total number of branches in the experimental stand n 412 sf v ml is the mean volume for the 42 selected branches used to measure stemflow in a day as m2 is the land surface area of the experimental stand the daily stand throughfall was calculated as the average values for the 16 tipping bucket rainfall gauges used to measure throughfall each day 2 2 4 surface runoff surface runoff in the stand was collected after each rainfall event a 20 cm high boundary was constructed around the stand using plastic ridging to prevent exfiltration inside and outside the boundary a weir was installed level with the natural surface at the bottom of the experimental stand through which surface runoff flowing into a tank surface runoff was determined immediately after each rainfall runoff event via measuring the water volume in the tank after each measurement the runoff depth was obtained by dividing the event runoff volume by the stand area and the collecting tank was cleaned for next rainfall event in the study area lateral inflow and outflow were negligibly small fang et al 2019 jin et al 2007 thus we thought during the study periods there was no exfiltration inside and outside the boundary of the stand 2 2 5 soil water storage the volumetric swc cm3 cm 3 was monitored along two replicate profiles within and between the shrub canopy using ec 5 soil moisture probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa buried at eight depths below the soil surface 10 20 40 60 80 120 160 and 200 cm the data were recorded at 30 min intervals with a hobo logger h21 onset computer corp bource ma usa the swc in the profile was calculated by averaging the swc values obtained at different depths for the two monitoring profiles in the stand the soil water storage in the profile was calculated using the following equation 5 sws 200 cm h 10 200 10 θ δ h where sws200 cm is 0 200 cm soil water storage mm 10 is a unit conversion factor mm cm 1 θ is swc cm3 cm 3 and δ h is the thickness of the soil layer cm 2 3 measurements of vegetation characteristics morphological characteristics of all 412 branches of the nine individual shrubs inside the experimental stand were measured as follows branch basal diameter bd mm was determined using a vernier caliper model 7d 01150 forgestar inc germany and branch angle ba was measured using a pocket geological compass model dql 8 harbin optical instrument factory china the frequency distribution of bd in 3 mm classes for all 412 branches is shown in fig 2 the leaf area index m2 m 2 for the experimental stand was measured using a lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer licor biosciences inc lincoln ne usa at 0 5 m above ground approximately twice a month during the study periods leaf area cannot be obtained directly without destructive harvesting for continuous long term measurement a total of 40 branches was selected from neighboring s psammophila plants based on the frequency distribution of bd classes in the experimental stand there were 4 15 10 6 2 2 and 1 branches at bd classes of 3 6 6 9 9 12 12 15 15 18 18 21 and 21 mm respectively image processing and analysis were conducted in java to determine the leaf area of each branch following scanning with a lide110 scanner canon inc japan yuan et al 2016 the average leaf area per branch based on the 40 sampled branches was multiplied by the total number of branches n 412 to obtain the total leaf area of the s psammophila stand 2 4 measurement of sap flow the sf of the s psammophila was continuously monitored using heat balance sap flow gauges flow 32 dynamax inc houston tx usa from may to september in 2019 and 2020 sf gauges which work on the basis of the energy balance method were adapted to measure sf in small diameter stems kool et al 2014 the theory behind the functioning of sf gauges and the method for using them have been described in detail elsewhere smith and allen 1996 sf was measured in 14 selected branches using fourteen gauges in total and the branches were randomly selected within the experimental stand the main criteria to select branch for sf measurements was bd and the gauge equipped branches were selected based on the range of bd of the experimental stand fig 2 the basal diameter of the gauge equipped branches ranged from 5 6 to 25 7 mm and they represented the range of diameters of more than 94 2 of all 412 branches in this experimental stand thus reflecting the stand s sf characteristics the diameter and cross sectional area of the selected branches and the used gauge models are shown in table 2 all selected branches were in good condition and able to support the weight of the gauges and survive throughout the study periods chabot et al 2005 gauges were carefully installed following the manufacturer s recommendations and more detailed information on the installation can be found in wang et al 2020 after the installation of the sensor the heater input voltage was monitored and adjusted based on the sensor voltage requirements the signal output from the gauges was recorded at 10 s intervals and stored as 30 min averages using a cr 1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa 2 5 estimation of stand transpiration using scaling up methods to estimate stand t various methods can be used to scale up from sf measures for individual branches for shrub ecosystems leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches have been used in this study stand t was scaled up from sf on the basis of the following methods and the estimated daily stand t based on each of the methods was calculated as the sum of the hourly estimates for that day 1 leaf area in the experimental stand a relatively sparse and open shrubland in which the majority of leaves are not shaded and a strong dependence of stand t on leaf area could be expected if sf in all branches is assumed to be proportional to leaf area then the mean daily stand transpiration tla mm d 1 for the experimental stand 100 m2 in area can be estimated from the sf measured for gauged branch as follows allen and grime 1995 jian et al 2015 yue et al 2008 6 t la 1000 l ρ a s i 1 n f i l i n where l m2 is the total leaf area in the experimental stand fi kg d 1 is the sap flow in the ith branch li m2 is the leaf area of the ith branch ρ kg m 3 is the density of water and n is the number of branch in which sf was measured n 14 2 cross sectional area the branch basal cross sectional area was used to estimate stand t from scaling up sf as follows cavanaugh et al 2011 scott et al 2006 zhao et al 2016 7 t ca 1000 a ρ a s i 1 n f i a i n where tca mm d 1 is the mean daily stand transpiration a cm2 is the total basal cross sectional area in the experimental stand ai cm2 is the basal cross sectional area of the ith branch 3 number of branches the sf of the s psammophila shows diurnal fluctuation patterns in the selected 14 branches as the distribution of sf is positively skewed the harmonic mean of sf of the selected 14 branches was used as a representative average huang et al 2015 the calculation of the mean daily stand transpiration tnb mm d 1 is as follows 8 t nb 1000 n ρ a s n i 1 n 1 f i 2 6 statistical analyses summary statistics such as means standard deviation and coefficient of variation for the actual stand t and the estimated stand t were calculated anova was performed to evaluate the statistical differences between actual daily stand t and estimated daily stand t by the different methods we evaluated the performances of the different methods using the root mean square error rmse and bias bias between the estimated and actual daily stand t values all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 variations of soil water balance components as shown in fig 3 46 and 44 rainfall events were recorded in the experimental stand during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 respectively the amount of daily rainfall was notably higher in 2019 than 2020 ranging from 0 1 68 8 mm and 0 1 33 9 mm respectively fig 3 a cumulative gross precipitation in the stand during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 was 389 1 and 245 6 mm respectively no obvious patterns could be detected for canopy interception during the study periods in each year fig 3b daily canopy interception ranged from 0 1 to 14 9 mm and 0 1 8 4 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively with mean daily canopy interception of 2 3 3 3 mm and 1 8 2 2 mm total canopy interception in the stand during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 was 106 1 and 77 5 mm respectively there were 113 and 81 days that soil evaporation was recorded during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 3c daily soil evaporation was 1 5 0 8 mm d 1 with a coefficient of variation of 56 9 in 2019 the corresponding daily soil evaporation in 2020 was 1 7 0 6 mm d 1 with a coefficient of variation of 36 6 daily soil evaporation in 2019 varied more than in 2020 and total soil evaporation during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 was 163 8 and 136 9 mm respectively when the amount of rainfall reached 3 6 and 4 1 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively in general there was surface runoff during rainfall events fig 3d there were 19 and 14 daily surface runoff events during the rainy seasons in 2019 and 2020 respectively daily surface runoff ranged from 0 006 to 0 386 mm and 0 004 0 142 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively the values were so low that we considered it unnecessary to take it into account in either year amounting to only about 2 6 mm during the study periods in both years during the study periods daily swc at different layers exhibited different patterns and the swc along the soil profile fluctuated more obvious in 2019 than in 2020 fig 3e daily swc0 40 cm had high temporal variations during the two rainy seasons due to rainfall events while daily swc in the lower layers fluctuated little during the rainy seasons particularly in 2020 daily swc0 40 cm ranged from 0 023 0 126 cm3 cm 3 and 0 033 0 124 cm3 cm 3 during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 respectively with corresponding coefficient of variation of 48 7 and 36 5 daily swc40 120 cm and swc120 200 cm ranged from 0 035 to 0 058 cm3 cm 3 and 0 052 to 0 059 cm3 cm 3 during the rainy seasons in 2020 with corresponding coefficient of variation of 14 4 and 2 9 3 2 variations of actual and estimated stand transpiration as shown in fig 4 actual and estimated daily stand t scaled up using different methods showed obvious seasonal variations during the study periods there were 141 and 113 days of actual stand t during the rainy season in 2019 and 2020 respectively actual daily stand t ranged from 0 2 to 7 2 mm d 1 in the two rainy seasons with coefficient of variation of 67 1 over the two rainy seasons total actual stand t was about 623 7 mm and we measured the highest actual daily stand t on july 21th 2020 different estimations of daily stand t were produced by the different scaling up methods from the sf data in the study period fig 4 for both years estimated daily stand t was generally higher when leaf area was used for scaling up than that when cross sectional area or number of branches was used the estimated values using leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches were in the ranges of 0 1 13 1 mm d 1 0 2 8 6 mm d 1 and 0 4 8 9 mm d 1 respectively during the study periods in both years the maximum coefficient of variation for the daily estimation was about 73 6 and was produced when using leaf area for scaling up irrespective of the method used the maximum daily estimate occurred on the same day july 26th in 2019 and july 21th in 2020 total estimated stand t based on leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches was 1135 6 789 5 and 954 3 mm respectively during the two study periods in 2019 and 2020 3 3 comparisons between actual and estimated stand transpiration actual daily mean stand t differed from the estimations based on the different scaling up methods fig 5 the actual t value 2 5 1 6 mm d 1 was significantly lower p 0 05 than the values estimated on the basis of leaf area 4 3 3 2 mm d 1 cross sectional area 3 0 2 1 mm d 1 and number of branches 3 6 2 1 mm d 1 estimated daily mean stand t also differed according to the method used for scaling up with leaf area producing significantly higher estimations than cross sectional area and number of branches p 0 05 over the two growing seasons the estimated daily mean values based on leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches were 1 8 1 2 and 1 5 times higher than the actual daily mean stand t the scatter plots of estimated daily stand t based on the different methods and the actual daily stand t along with the values for rmse and bias are shown in fig 6 compared with actual daily stand t estimated daily stand t was overestimated regardless of the method used for scaling up the rmse and bias values indicated that estimates based on cross sectional area provided a better estimate than leaf area or number of branches for the experimental stand the rmse and bias values 0 939 mm d 1 and 0 633 mm d 1 respectively associated with the estimates of stand t based on cross sectional area were lower than for the two other methods estimates using leaf area produced the largest rmse and bias values 2 634 mm d 1 and 2 014 mm d 1 respectively 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have explored the effects of using different methods leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches to estimate stand t nor have there been any comparisons between actual stand t and the various estimates for shrub ecosystems in drylands in this study actual s psammophila stand t was calculated by subtracting the sum of soil evaporation and canopy interception from actual stand et in previous studies the soil water balance method has been widely used to calculate actual stand et qiu et al 2015 russelll 2010 yan et al 2017 although the depth of swc measurements only extended down to about 200 cm in the current study this was considered appropriate because most fine roots of s psammophila are in the 0 150 cm layer liu et al 2010a and it acquires more than 76 of its water from shallow soil layers yang et al 2018 we found that estimated daily mean stand t differed according to the method used for scaling up p 0 05 in the current study estimated daily stand t based on leaf area was consistently higher than when based on cross sectional area or number of branches allen and grime 1995 used leaf area and cross sectional area of g senegalensis to estimate stand t they also found that using leaf area produced higher values than cross sectional area when scaling up although stand t estimates obtained by sf methods have provided reasonable results when compared against independent estimates of et components rafi et al 2019 shimizu et al 2015 soubie et al 2016 the error associated with the choice of scaling up methods will influence the precision of estimates of stand t quionez pión and valeo 2019 many studies have found that relationships for multiple scaling up methods such as sapwood area stem diameter and leaf area also differed within and between trees of different ages heights various shrub species and different slope positions domec et al 2012 jaskierniak et al 2015 kumagai et al 2007 yuan et al 2017 differences in the relationship between total cross sectional area and total leaf area among shrub species can make it difficult to choose the most suitable method to use for scaling up for example caragana korshinskii and s psammophila are dominant shrub species widely distributed in our study region she et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 although they are modular organisms and multi stemmed shrubs differences in basal diameter leaf area and number of branches occur within the same basal diameter category yuan et al 2017 thus method selection for shrub ecosystems should be carefully considered when scaling up from tree level sf to stand level t in the s psammophila stand estimated daily mean stand t based on leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches was always higher than the actual value p 0 05 suggesting consistent overestimation this result is not consistent with the general perception that sf measurements gave stand t values similar to those obtained by other t measurements granier 1987 yue et al 2008 merlin et al 2020 in this study the consistent overestimation between actual and estimated stand t based on different methods might be due to that sf measurements largely suffered from different potential sources of error related to intrinsic limitation of the sf methods and or to how these methods are applied mitchell et al 2009 steppe et al 2015 vandegehuchte and steppe 2013 fuchs et al 2017 compared different sf methods for diffuse porous trees and also found that the heat field deformation method overestimated gravimetric flow by 11 in this study the sf of the s psammophila was measured using the heat balance method and this method measures the absolute mass flow rate of sap in stems baker and van bavel 1987 steinberg et al 1989 kool et al 2014 as sap flow rates increase the temperature distribution in the stem and gauge is altered to the point that the one dimensional fourier equations may be no longer applicable and the individual heat fluxes in the heat balance system are poorly estimated baker and nieber 1989 however the systematic errors are largely self compensating and it is reasonable to assume that heat balance estimates of sap flow are reliable heilman et al 1989 the systematic errors of the heat balance method if present are of minor significance baker and nieber 1989 and the accuracy of this method has also been confirmed in field experiments allen and grime 1995 hall et al 1998 yue et al 2008 flo et al 2019 found that all sf methods showed high precision allowing potential correlation of the sf measurements when a study specific calibration is performed therefore more validation work should be considered to further improve the accuracy of the heat balance method in the field shackel et al 1992 compared with actual stand t estimated stand t with the three scaling up methods may be overestimated but nevertheless indicated comparative differences among different methods although previous studies found that estimates of stand t using cross sectional area were generally more variable and time consuming allen and grime 1995 vertessy et al 1997 the values of rmse and bias led us to conclude that cross sectional area is the best method to use for scaling up in this vegetation in fact scaling up sf measurements to the stand scale is highly uncertain and quite challenging in drylands sun et al 2019 when converting tree branch level sf to stand level t it is essential that the sf measurements are representative and accurate granier et al 1996 kumagai et al 2005 meng et al 2013 besides plants of different functional types have different phenological stages wang et al 2014 yepez et al 2003 thus to fully understand the effects method selection on the estimation of stand t in shrub and other ecosystems more tree and shrub species under different conditions need to be studied in the future study 5 conclusions in this study we explored the effect of using different methods to scale up sf measurements in order to estimate s psammophila stand t on the loess plateau we found that estimates of stand t differed depending on whether the method used was leaf area cross sectional area or number of branches estimated daily mean stand t based on leaf area was significantly higher than that based on either cross sectional area or number of branches during the two growing seasons actual daily mean s psammophila stand t was 2 5 1 6 mm d 1 which was significantly lower than the estimated values thus we conclude that s psammophlia stand t may be overestimated when using any of the methods considered for scaling up estimated daily mean stand t that based on cross sectional area provides the best figure according to rmse and bias our investigation into the effects of using different methods to scale up from sf measurements to s psammophila stand t estimates highlights that care is needed when selecting appropriate methods further work is required to clarify the effects of scaling up methods on estimates of stand t in more

3442,transpiration t is a key hydrological process delivering water essential for plant metabolism and thus affecting productivity a major challenge in estimating stand t is how to accurately scale sap flow data from individual trees to the stand in shrub ecosystems various scaling up methods have been used to extrapolate tree level sap flow measurements to stand level t these include leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches however the performances of different scaling up methods have not been fully explored for shrubs in this study we measured sap flow of a xerophytic shrub salix psammophila and scaled up using measures of leaf area cross sectional area and numbers of branches in order to estimate stand t during the rainy seasons in 2019 and 2020 on the northern loess plateau china in addition we measured precipitation throughfall stemflow soil evaporation surface runoff and 0 200 cm soil water content to calculate actual stand t on the basis of soil water balance method the results revealed that daily stand t differed according to the scaling up methods used for the estimation daily estimated stand t based on measures of leaf area 0 1 13 1 mm d 1 was consistently higher than those based on cross sectional area 0 2 8 6 mm d 1 and number of branches 0 4 8 9 mm d 1 p 0 05 during the two rainy seasons the actual daily mean stand t 2 5 1 6 mm d 1 was significantly lower than the estimation by the three scaling up methods p 0 05 the method based on cross sectional area appeared to be most suitable for scaling up because it had the lowest root mean square error and bias values 0 939 mm d 1 and 0 633 mm d 1 respectively this study highlights the wide variations of stand t upon which scaling up method was chosen and these differences need to be considered when converting tree level sap flow to stand level t in shrub and other ecosystems keywords sap flow scaling up transpiration shrub drylands 1 introduction transpiration t is the process of water moving from soil through the roots stem and leaves of a plant into the atmosphere jones and tardieu 1998 in general t is the desired component with the water being used to enhance plant productivity kool et al 2014 it also controls land surface energy balance determines catchment hydrological responses and influences regional and global climate bonan 2008 poyatos et al 2016 many studies have found that global scale t is by far the largest water flux on the earth s land masses and it dominates terrestrial evapotranspiration et coenders gerrits et al 2014 jasechko et al 2013 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wang et al 2014 thus accurate measurements of stand t at the ecosystem scale are important for validating regional water balance simulations resolving issues of water resource management and improving our understanding the role of stand t in catchment level hydrological cycles delzon and loustau 2005 ford et al 2007 jiao et al 2018 loustau et al 1996 plant water use has been determined using multiple methods for example by lysimeters liu et al 2002 chambers stannard and weltz 2006 eddy covariance methods wilson et al 2001 and sap flow sf methods shen et al 2015 sf is water flux across a given section of trunk diameter over specified periods it is an important indicator to reflect water movement in plants liu et al 2012 sf measurement methods are thermally based techniques allowing water flow through the stem to be assessed kool et al 2014 given the relatively low costs long term measurement potential easy replication and automation of sf probes sf methods have become the most widely used approach to estimate stand t dudley et al 2018 gwenzi et al 2014 hayat et al 2020 peng et al 2015 when using sf methods to estimate stand t uncertainty in the results may be related to sf variability which is compounded when scaling up both within trees and from tree level to stand level čermák et al 2004 hatton et al 1995 hernandez santana et al 2015 many scaling up methods have been developed and compared to estimate stand t for trees vertessy et al 1997 found that the estimated stand t of large mountain ash trees using stem diameter is more time consuming to apply but yields more robust estimates than leaf area jung et al 2011 found that compared to sapwood area diameter at breast height is a better scaling up method to estimate stand t for mixed deciduous forests quiñonez piñón and valeo 2020 used effective leaf area and actual leaf area to estimate stand t at a coniferous site and found that stand t values based on effective leaf area are more meaningful due to the close relationship with the total amount of leaves as mentioned above additional uncertainty in estimation of stand t may result from the selection of scaling up methods the scaling relationships for different biometric parameters canopy coverage basal area sapwood area and leaf area index can also vary widely poyatos et al 2016 therefore the choice of method to use for scaling sf up to stand level requires careful consideration and it is necessary to explore the effects of different scaling up methods on estimates of stand t in different ecosystems shrubs are the representative plant functional type in drylands and sf methods especially heat balance methods have been widely used to determine water movement dynamics in shrubs domingo et al 1999 mirck and volk 2009 naithani et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 szutu and papuga 2019 in shrubs different methods such as leaf area domingo et al 1999 ji et al 2016 cross sectional area cavanaugh et al 2011 scott et al 2006 and number of branches huang et al 2015 have been used to scale up sf from the tree level to estimate stand level t assuming that sf is measured consistently using the same sf method variations in estimates of stand t may be the result of which methods has been chosen to scale up the values allen and grime 1995 found that the estimated stand t of guiera senegalensis on the basis of cross sectional area was generally more variable than those based on leaf area however few studies have thoroughly explored differences in estimation of stand t resulting from the use of different scaling up methods and compared the estimated results with actual stand t for shrubs in this study we measured sf of a xerophytic shrub salix psammophila and precipitation throughfall stemflow soil evaporation surface runoff and soil water content swc in the stand during the 2019 and 2020 rainy seasons in the northern loess plateau china the stand level t was scaled up from tree level sf using different methods leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches the actual s psammophila stand t was determined using soil water balance method the detailed objectives of this study were to 1 detect the variations of the actual and estimated stand t and 2 compare the performances of the three scaling up methods to estimate the stand t and evaluate the effects of each method on the estimation of stand t for s psammophila 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in liudaogou catchment 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n 1274 m a s l 6 89 km2 which is 14 km from shenmu district on the northern loess plateau china the catchment is in the transitional zone between the loess plateau and the mu us desert and is characterized by many deep gullies and undulating slopes and hills this area has a moderate temperate continental climate with well defined rainy and dry seasons and has a mean annual temperature of 8 4 c range 9 7 c to 23 7 c mean annual precipitation is 437 mm 1971 2013 of which 70 falls in intense rainstorms between july and september the mean annual grass reference evapotranspiration calculated by the fao 56 penman monteith equation is approximately 1200 mm the dominant soil types in this area are sandy loess and sand the groundwater table is more than 20 m below the surface and precipitation is the most important source of available water zhao et al 2021 the original vegetation has been almost completely destroyed as a result of long term human activities in the area the currently dominant shrub species is s psammophila which was planted decades ago s psammophila has an inverted cone shaped crown and no trunk and multiple branches radiate from the base s psammophila usually grows to a height of 3 4 m and has alternate strap shaped leaves with 2 4 mm wide and 40 80 mm long yuan et al 2016 the vertical roots of s psammophila mainly grew in the 0 150 cm layer liu et al 2010a and the horizontal roots were predominantly distributed in the 0 40 cm from the base of shrub zhao et al 2021 2 2 measurements of soil water balance components the measurements were conducted during the rainy seasons from may to september in 2019 and 2020 in this study we selected a representative site with a s psammophila community about 25 years old in the southwest corner of the liudaogou catchment fig 1 a the stand area was 10 m 10 m and there were nine individual s psammophila trees within the experimental site during the study periods canopy height canopy area branch diameter branch angle and leaf area index of the shrubs were measured the morphological characteristics of the s psammophila stand are shown in table 1 soil water balance method can be used to estimate evapotranspiration 1 p i w et r d δs where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm w is the contribution from upward movement of moisture from the water table mm et is the actual evapotranspiration mm r is surface runoff mm d is drainage mm and δ s is the change in soil water storage mm in this unirrigated area precipitation is the only source of water the upward movement of water from the water table can be considered to be negligible because the water table is so deep at 20 m liu et al 2010b she et al 2013 drainage can also be ignored because there is a layer of impermeable clay at about 200 cm depth yuan et al 2016 in this shrub stand et can be expressed as follows 2 et t a e i c where ta is actual stand transpiration mm e is stand soil evaporation mm and ic is stand canopy interception mm thus the actual stand t was calculated using the following equation 3 t a p e i c r δ s the measurements and calculations for each of the water balance components in eq 3 are described in detail in the following sections 2 2 1 precipitation a tipping bucket rainfall gauge rg3 m onset computer corp bourne ma usa with a resolution of 0 2 mm was installed in an open area nearby the experimental stand to record the amount and timing of precipitation three standard rain gauges inner diameter 20 cm were also installed to provide data for adjusting the recorded value because the rg3 m rainfall gauge inherently underestimates precipitation groisman and legates 1994 2 2 2 soil evaporation soil evaporation was measured using four automatic weighing lysimeters fig 1b we selected two typical s psammophila shrubs within the experimental stand and installed two weighing lysimeters adjacent to each selected shrub one below the canopy and the other in the gap between shrubs the weighing lysimeter consists of a weighing system and lysimeter vessel comprising a stainless steel cylinder with a cross sectional area of 314 cm2 and a height of 25 cm the lysimeters were calibrated with known mass and were able to detect small changes at a resolution of 10 g m 2 ground surface 0 01 mm the lysimeter weight was taken once every minute and recorded as a value for each 10 min interval with a cr 200 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa the daily stand soil evaporation was the sum of the hourly mean stand soil evaporation of the four weighing lysimeters measurement in a day 2 2 3 canopy interception the canopy interception for the experimental stand of s psammophila was estimated by subtracting stemflow and throughfall from daily precipitation carlyle moses and price 1999 based on branch diameter distribution we selected 42 branches within the experimental stand to measure stemflow stemflow data were collected using aluminum foil collars that were fitted around the entire circumference of branches and sealed using neutral silicone sealant fig 1b the collars were periodically checked for any leakage more detailed information about stemflow measurement can be found in yuan et al 2019 sixteen tipping bucket rainfall gauges were randomly placed under the canopies of s psammophila to collect throughfall within the experimental stand fig 1b the data for stemflow volume and throughfall volume were automatically recorded the daily stand stemflow was calculated as follows yuan et al 2016 4 sf d n sf v a s 10 3 where sf d mm d 1 is the daily stand stemflow n is the total number of branches in the experimental stand n 412 sf v ml is the mean volume for the 42 selected branches used to measure stemflow in a day as m2 is the land surface area of the experimental stand the daily stand throughfall was calculated as the average values for the 16 tipping bucket rainfall gauges used to measure throughfall each day 2 2 4 surface runoff surface runoff in the stand was collected after each rainfall event a 20 cm high boundary was constructed around the stand using plastic ridging to prevent exfiltration inside and outside the boundary a weir was installed level with the natural surface at the bottom of the experimental stand through which surface runoff flowing into a tank surface runoff was determined immediately after each rainfall runoff event via measuring the water volume in the tank after each measurement the runoff depth was obtained by dividing the event runoff volume by the stand area and the collecting tank was cleaned for next rainfall event in the study area lateral inflow and outflow were negligibly small fang et al 2019 jin et al 2007 thus we thought during the study periods there was no exfiltration inside and outside the boundary of the stand 2 2 5 soil water storage the volumetric swc cm3 cm 3 was monitored along two replicate profiles within and between the shrub canopy using ec 5 soil moisture probes decagon devices inc pullman wa usa buried at eight depths below the soil surface 10 20 40 60 80 120 160 and 200 cm the data were recorded at 30 min intervals with a hobo logger h21 onset computer corp bource ma usa the swc in the profile was calculated by averaging the swc values obtained at different depths for the two monitoring profiles in the stand the soil water storage in the profile was calculated using the following equation 5 sws 200 cm h 10 200 10 θ δ h where sws200 cm is 0 200 cm soil water storage mm 10 is a unit conversion factor mm cm 1 θ is swc cm3 cm 3 and δ h is the thickness of the soil layer cm 2 3 measurements of vegetation characteristics morphological characteristics of all 412 branches of the nine individual shrubs inside the experimental stand were measured as follows branch basal diameter bd mm was determined using a vernier caliper model 7d 01150 forgestar inc germany and branch angle ba was measured using a pocket geological compass model dql 8 harbin optical instrument factory china the frequency distribution of bd in 3 mm classes for all 412 branches is shown in fig 2 the leaf area index m2 m 2 for the experimental stand was measured using a lai 2200c plant canopy analyzer licor biosciences inc lincoln ne usa at 0 5 m above ground approximately twice a month during the study periods leaf area cannot be obtained directly without destructive harvesting for continuous long term measurement a total of 40 branches was selected from neighboring s psammophila plants based on the frequency distribution of bd classes in the experimental stand there were 4 15 10 6 2 2 and 1 branches at bd classes of 3 6 6 9 9 12 12 15 15 18 18 21 and 21 mm respectively image processing and analysis were conducted in java to determine the leaf area of each branch following scanning with a lide110 scanner canon inc japan yuan et al 2016 the average leaf area per branch based on the 40 sampled branches was multiplied by the total number of branches n 412 to obtain the total leaf area of the s psammophila stand 2 4 measurement of sap flow the sf of the s psammophila was continuously monitored using heat balance sap flow gauges flow 32 dynamax inc houston tx usa from may to september in 2019 and 2020 sf gauges which work on the basis of the energy balance method were adapted to measure sf in small diameter stems kool et al 2014 the theory behind the functioning of sf gauges and the method for using them have been described in detail elsewhere smith and allen 1996 sf was measured in 14 selected branches using fourteen gauges in total and the branches were randomly selected within the experimental stand the main criteria to select branch for sf measurements was bd and the gauge equipped branches were selected based on the range of bd of the experimental stand fig 2 the basal diameter of the gauge equipped branches ranged from 5 6 to 25 7 mm and they represented the range of diameters of more than 94 2 of all 412 branches in this experimental stand thus reflecting the stand s sf characteristics the diameter and cross sectional area of the selected branches and the used gauge models are shown in table 2 all selected branches were in good condition and able to support the weight of the gauges and survive throughout the study periods chabot et al 2005 gauges were carefully installed following the manufacturer s recommendations and more detailed information on the installation can be found in wang et al 2020 after the installation of the sensor the heater input voltage was monitored and adjusted based on the sensor voltage requirements the signal output from the gauges was recorded at 10 s intervals and stored as 30 min averages using a cr 1000 data logger campbell scientific logan ut usa 2 5 estimation of stand transpiration using scaling up methods to estimate stand t various methods can be used to scale up from sf measures for individual branches for shrub ecosystems leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches have been used in this study stand t was scaled up from sf on the basis of the following methods and the estimated daily stand t based on each of the methods was calculated as the sum of the hourly estimates for that day 1 leaf area in the experimental stand a relatively sparse and open shrubland in which the majority of leaves are not shaded and a strong dependence of stand t on leaf area could be expected if sf in all branches is assumed to be proportional to leaf area then the mean daily stand transpiration tla mm d 1 for the experimental stand 100 m2 in area can be estimated from the sf measured for gauged branch as follows allen and grime 1995 jian et al 2015 yue et al 2008 6 t la 1000 l ρ a s i 1 n f i l i n where l m2 is the total leaf area in the experimental stand fi kg d 1 is the sap flow in the ith branch li m2 is the leaf area of the ith branch ρ kg m 3 is the density of water and n is the number of branch in which sf was measured n 14 2 cross sectional area the branch basal cross sectional area was used to estimate stand t from scaling up sf as follows cavanaugh et al 2011 scott et al 2006 zhao et al 2016 7 t ca 1000 a ρ a s i 1 n f i a i n where tca mm d 1 is the mean daily stand transpiration a cm2 is the total basal cross sectional area in the experimental stand ai cm2 is the basal cross sectional area of the ith branch 3 number of branches the sf of the s psammophila shows diurnal fluctuation patterns in the selected 14 branches as the distribution of sf is positively skewed the harmonic mean of sf of the selected 14 branches was used as a representative average huang et al 2015 the calculation of the mean daily stand transpiration tnb mm d 1 is as follows 8 t nb 1000 n ρ a s n i 1 n 1 f i 2 6 statistical analyses summary statistics such as means standard deviation and coefficient of variation for the actual stand t and the estimated stand t were calculated anova was performed to evaluate the statistical differences between actual daily stand t and estimated daily stand t by the different methods we evaluated the performances of the different methods using the root mean square error rmse and bias bias between the estimated and actual daily stand t values all statistical analyses were performed with spss 16 0 spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 variations of soil water balance components as shown in fig 3 46 and 44 rainfall events were recorded in the experimental stand during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 respectively the amount of daily rainfall was notably higher in 2019 than 2020 ranging from 0 1 68 8 mm and 0 1 33 9 mm respectively fig 3 a cumulative gross precipitation in the stand during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 was 389 1 and 245 6 mm respectively no obvious patterns could be detected for canopy interception during the study periods in each year fig 3b daily canopy interception ranged from 0 1 to 14 9 mm and 0 1 8 4 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively with mean daily canopy interception of 2 3 3 3 mm and 1 8 2 2 mm total canopy interception in the stand during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 was 106 1 and 77 5 mm respectively there were 113 and 81 days that soil evaporation was recorded during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 3c daily soil evaporation was 1 5 0 8 mm d 1 with a coefficient of variation of 56 9 in 2019 the corresponding daily soil evaporation in 2020 was 1 7 0 6 mm d 1 with a coefficient of variation of 36 6 daily soil evaporation in 2019 varied more than in 2020 and total soil evaporation during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 was 163 8 and 136 9 mm respectively when the amount of rainfall reached 3 6 and 4 1 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively in general there was surface runoff during rainfall events fig 3d there were 19 and 14 daily surface runoff events during the rainy seasons in 2019 and 2020 respectively daily surface runoff ranged from 0 006 to 0 386 mm and 0 004 0 142 mm in 2019 and 2020 respectively the values were so low that we considered it unnecessary to take it into account in either year amounting to only about 2 6 mm during the study periods in both years during the study periods daily swc at different layers exhibited different patterns and the swc along the soil profile fluctuated more obvious in 2019 than in 2020 fig 3e daily swc0 40 cm had high temporal variations during the two rainy seasons due to rainfall events while daily swc in the lower layers fluctuated little during the rainy seasons particularly in 2020 daily swc0 40 cm ranged from 0 023 0 126 cm3 cm 3 and 0 033 0 124 cm3 cm 3 during the study periods in 2019 and 2020 respectively with corresponding coefficient of variation of 48 7 and 36 5 daily swc40 120 cm and swc120 200 cm ranged from 0 035 to 0 058 cm3 cm 3 and 0 052 to 0 059 cm3 cm 3 during the rainy seasons in 2020 with corresponding coefficient of variation of 14 4 and 2 9 3 2 variations of actual and estimated stand transpiration as shown in fig 4 actual and estimated daily stand t scaled up using different methods showed obvious seasonal variations during the study periods there were 141 and 113 days of actual stand t during the rainy season in 2019 and 2020 respectively actual daily stand t ranged from 0 2 to 7 2 mm d 1 in the two rainy seasons with coefficient of variation of 67 1 over the two rainy seasons total actual stand t was about 623 7 mm and we measured the highest actual daily stand t on july 21th 2020 different estimations of daily stand t were produced by the different scaling up methods from the sf data in the study period fig 4 for both years estimated daily stand t was generally higher when leaf area was used for scaling up than that when cross sectional area or number of branches was used the estimated values using leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches were in the ranges of 0 1 13 1 mm d 1 0 2 8 6 mm d 1 and 0 4 8 9 mm d 1 respectively during the study periods in both years the maximum coefficient of variation for the daily estimation was about 73 6 and was produced when using leaf area for scaling up irrespective of the method used the maximum daily estimate occurred on the same day july 26th in 2019 and july 21th in 2020 total estimated stand t based on leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches was 1135 6 789 5 and 954 3 mm respectively during the two study periods in 2019 and 2020 3 3 comparisons between actual and estimated stand transpiration actual daily mean stand t differed from the estimations based on the different scaling up methods fig 5 the actual t value 2 5 1 6 mm d 1 was significantly lower p 0 05 than the values estimated on the basis of leaf area 4 3 3 2 mm d 1 cross sectional area 3 0 2 1 mm d 1 and number of branches 3 6 2 1 mm d 1 estimated daily mean stand t also differed according to the method used for scaling up with leaf area producing significantly higher estimations than cross sectional area and number of branches p 0 05 over the two growing seasons the estimated daily mean values based on leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches were 1 8 1 2 and 1 5 times higher than the actual daily mean stand t the scatter plots of estimated daily stand t based on the different methods and the actual daily stand t along with the values for rmse and bias are shown in fig 6 compared with actual daily stand t estimated daily stand t was overestimated regardless of the method used for scaling up the rmse and bias values indicated that estimates based on cross sectional area provided a better estimate than leaf area or number of branches for the experimental stand the rmse and bias values 0 939 mm d 1 and 0 633 mm d 1 respectively associated with the estimates of stand t based on cross sectional area were lower than for the two other methods estimates using leaf area produced the largest rmse and bias values 2 634 mm d 1 and 2 014 mm d 1 respectively 4 discussion to the best of our knowledge no previous studies have explored the effects of using different methods leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches to estimate stand t nor have there been any comparisons between actual stand t and the various estimates for shrub ecosystems in drylands in this study actual s psammophila stand t was calculated by subtracting the sum of soil evaporation and canopy interception from actual stand et in previous studies the soil water balance method has been widely used to calculate actual stand et qiu et al 2015 russelll 2010 yan et al 2017 although the depth of swc measurements only extended down to about 200 cm in the current study this was considered appropriate because most fine roots of s psammophila are in the 0 150 cm layer liu et al 2010a and it acquires more than 76 of its water from shallow soil layers yang et al 2018 we found that estimated daily mean stand t differed according to the method used for scaling up p 0 05 in the current study estimated daily stand t based on leaf area was consistently higher than when based on cross sectional area or number of branches allen and grime 1995 used leaf area and cross sectional area of g senegalensis to estimate stand t they also found that using leaf area produced higher values than cross sectional area when scaling up although stand t estimates obtained by sf methods have provided reasonable results when compared against independent estimates of et components rafi et al 2019 shimizu et al 2015 soubie et al 2016 the error associated with the choice of scaling up methods will influence the precision of estimates of stand t quionez pión and valeo 2019 many studies have found that relationships for multiple scaling up methods such as sapwood area stem diameter and leaf area also differed within and between trees of different ages heights various shrub species and different slope positions domec et al 2012 jaskierniak et al 2015 kumagai et al 2007 yuan et al 2017 differences in the relationship between total cross sectional area and total leaf area among shrub species can make it difficult to choose the most suitable method to use for scaling up for example caragana korshinskii and s psammophila are dominant shrub species widely distributed in our study region she et al 2013 yuan et al 2016 although they are modular organisms and multi stemmed shrubs differences in basal diameter leaf area and number of branches occur within the same basal diameter category yuan et al 2017 thus method selection for shrub ecosystems should be carefully considered when scaling up from tree level sf to stand level t in the s psammophila stand estimated daily mean stand t based on leaf area cross sectional area and number of branches was always higher than the actual value p 0 05 suggesting consistent overestimation this result is not consistent with the general perception that sf measurements gave stand t values similar to those obtained by other t measurements granier 1987 yue et al 2008 merlin et al 2020 in this study the consistent overestimation between actual and estimated stand t based on different methods might be due to that sf measurements largely suffered from different potential sources of error related to intrinsic limitation of the sf methods and or to how these methods are applied mitchell et al 2009 steppe et al 2015 vandegehuchte and steppe 2013 fuchs et al 2017 compared different sf methods for diffuse porous trees and also found that the heat field deformation method overestimated gravimetric flow by 11 in this study the sf of the s psammophila was measured using the heat balance method and this method measures the absolute mass flow rate of sap in stems baker and van bavel 1987 steinberg et al 1989 kool et al 2014 as sap flow rates increase the temperature distribution in the stem and gauge is altered to the point that the one dimensional fourier equations may be no longer applicable and the individual heat fluxes in the heat balance system are poorly estimated baker and nieber 1989 however the systematic errors are largely self compensating and it is reasonable to assume that heat balance estimates of sap flow are reliable heilman et al 1989 the systematic errors of the heat balance method if present are of minor significance baker and nieber 1989 and the accuracy of this method has also been confirmed in field experiments allen and grime 1995 hall et al 1998 yue et al 2008 flo et al 2019 found that all sf methods showed high precision allowing potential correlation of the sf measurements when a study specific calibration is performed therefore more validation work should be considered to further improve the accuracy of the heat balance method in the field shackel et al 1992 compared with actual stand t estimated stand t with the three scaling up methods may be overestimated but nevertheless indicated comparative differences among different methods although previous studies found that estimates of stand t using cross sectional area were generally more variable and time consuming allen and grime 1995 vertessy et al 1997 the values of rmse and bias led us to conclude that cross sectional area is the best method to use for scaling up in this vegetation in fact scaling up sf measurements to the stand scale is highly uncertain and quite challenging in drylands sun et al 2019 when converting tree branch level sf to stand level t it is essential that the sf measurements are representative and accurate granier et al 1996 kumagai et al 2005 meng et al 2013 besides plants of different functional types have different phenological stages wang et al 2014 yepez et al 2003 thus to fully understand the effects method selection on the estimation of stand t in shrub and other ecosystems more tree and shrub species under different conditions need to be studied in the future study 5 conclusions in this study we explored the effect of using different methods to scale up sf measurements in order to estimate s psammophila stand t on the loess plateau we found that estimates of stand t differed depending on whether the method used was leaf area cross sectional area or number of branches estimated daily mean stand t based on leaf area was significantly higher than that based on either cross sectional area or number of branches during the two growing seasons actual daily mean s psammophila stand t was 2 5 1 6 mm d 1 which was significantly lower than the estimated values thus we conclude that s psammophlia stand t may be overestimated when using any of the methods considered for scaling up estimated daily mean stand t that based on cross sectional area provides the best figure according to rmse and bias our investigation into the effects of using different methods to scale up from sf measurements to s psammophila stand t estimates highlights that care is needed when selecting appropriate methods further work is required to clarify the effects of scaling up methods on estimates of stand t in more

3443,water transfers have been implemented globally as important and effective ecological restoration tools over the last several decades however the periodic impacts of large scale ecological water transport projects ewtp on ecohydrological systems have been neglected in this study wavelet analysis was used to evaluate the effect of flow regimes of ewtps on the dynamics of ecohydrological systems through real data from a megaproject in the tarim river basin china the results reveal that comparing with natural stream the restoration flow exhibits seasonal periodicities in the winter instead of flood season and exhibits unstable yearly periodicities these characteristics created a distinct groundwater dynamics which are not coincident with the growth rhythm of riparian vegetation to optimize the ewtp two designed flow schemes based on the time lags between flow and vegetation growth which was estimated using the wavelet analysis at seasonal and annual scales were proposed to improve the ecosystem restoration efficiency the narx network was used to predict the ecological restoration result the predicting results show an up to 40 increase comparing to original restoration flow with the same total water volume these results provide a new insight on ecohydrological system dynamics under ewtp from the periodic perspective and also quantitatively prove that the designed flows based on wavelet analysis can improve ecosystem restoration efficiency in ewtps the methodologies used in this research are mathematical rigorous and can be widely applied to other ewtps 1 introduction the conveyance of water over intra and inter river basins to restore degraded ecosystems in water deficient areas is known as ecological water transport project ewtp shumilova et al 2018 ewtps are particularly common in arid and semi arid areas as water demand usually exceeds supply in these regions and many ecosystems now rely entirely on such imported water tao et al 2008 cheng et al 2014 shen et al 2017 arthington and pusey 2003 for example ewtps have been implemented to restore riparian ecosystems in the tarim river basin tao et al 2008 heihe river basin cheng et al 2014 shen et al 2017 and shiyanghe river basin chunyu et al 2019 of china the oldman river rood et al 1998 and st mary river of canada rood and mahoney 2000 the lower truckee river rood et al 2003 middle truckee river rood et al 2005 and colorado river delta of the usa shafroth et al 2017 and the middle ebro river gonzález et al 2010 of spain furthermore five future ewtps are planned around the globe three in north america one in africa and one in asia shumilova et al 2018 ecosystem restoration through ewtps will continue to be a popular option numerous studies have been conducted to understand the complicated relations between ewtps and ecohydrological processes these studies were generally focused on the changing character of groundwater depth and quality the ecological responses such as structure and diversity of plant communities the minimum ecological water demand of natural vegetation and the suitable groundwater level for vegetation huang and pang 2010 ye et al 2010 hao et al 2010 wang et al 2011 shen et al 2017 however these studies have concentrated more on the relationships from the perspective of the trend change the periodic impacts of ewtps on ecohydrological systems have been neglected from an ecological point of view the flow regime of imported water can alter the water cycle in water receiving areas with potential beneficial or negative effects for ecosystems in the water receiving areas chen and olden 2017 for example unnatural flow regimes from dam operations and other stressors can alters the natural hydrological cycle tongal et al 2016 francis et al 2010 alters the structure of riparian plant networks tonkin et al 2018 promotes the invasion of non native organisms ruhí et al 2016 and reduces biodiversity palmer and ruhi 2019 zhang et al 2016 consequently many dam operations endeavour to emulate historical flow conditions that native plants and animals are adapted to chen and olden 2017 while some studies seek to design hydrologic conditions that may deviate from natural flow rhythms but promote critical ecosystem processes or biological consequences of interest sabo et al 2017 chen et al 2017 overall this raises the question of whether flow regimes of ewtps are natural in magnitude frequency duration and timing the question of whether native vegetation are adapted to the current flow regimes of ewtps and the question of whether the flow regimes of ewtps can be designed to promote the growth of native vegetation a better understanding of the relationships between ewtps and ecohydrological processes from the periodic perspective is needed flow regimes of ewtps can shift temporally with changes in flow management although time scales of flow variation plays a vital role in determining the species abundance stability and structure of riparian vegetation communities bolpagni and piotti 2016 huston 1994 studying the impacts of time varying flow cycles is still rare palmer and ruhi 2019 we still do not know which time scales of flow variation in ewtps may benefit organismal phenology and which may simply be a negative disturbance in this work wavelet analysis was used to understand this issue compared with the conventional fourier analysis that only applies to stationary series in frequency domain wavelet analysis has gained widespread acceptance due to its usefulness in analysing the structure of nonstationary signals in time and frequency domain cazelles et al 2008 biswas si 2011 liu et al 2017 wavelet analysis is specifically applicable to the time varying flow regimes of ewtps which is not possible with traditional fourier analysis first the wavelet power spectrum method can detect and track changes on the periodicity components of flow variation in ewtps over time second the cross wavelet power spectrum and wavelet coherence can provide a more complete correlation structure between flow regimes of ewtps and ecohydrological systems in time and frequency domain furthermore time lags between the diversion flow of ewtps and riparian vegetation growth at different timescales may help to determine the specific diversion time mathematical models based on riparian vegetation and ewtp transfer water may help in predicting the consequences of changing frequencies of flow fluctuations on riverine ecosystem processes because of the complexity of flow fluctuations with respect to geochemical hydrological and biological variables fleming and gupta 2020 moradkhani et al 2004 it is very difficult to use traditional physics based modelling to predict the specific responses of riverine communities to flow dynamics therefore in this work a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx neural network was used to simulate the ecosystem restoration effects of diversion schedules among the data driven artificial neural network approaches the narx neural network for predicting hydrological time series has gained popularity in the last few years due to its accuracy flexibility and long term memory chang et al 2015 singh and chakrapani 2015 especially when only small amounts of training data are available the narx network can clearly outperform long short term memory lstm wunsch et al 2021 the narx neural network shows powerful performance that can approximate various nonlinear function guzman et al 2017 and could be a requisite element for modelling the complex relations between restoration flow of ewtp and riparian vegetation growth among existing ewtps projects in the tarim river basin in northwest china are water transfer megaprojects that serve catchment scale ecosystem rehabilitation around the globe shumilova et al 2018 and then considered as our study area tarim river basin is one of the world s largest endorheic river its lower reaches is known as the green corridor since it is located between the taklamakan desert and kuruke desert chen et al 2010 but in the 1970s the green corridor has disappeared as the downstream surface runoff and terminal lakes dried out due to dramatically increased water demand in the upper and middle reaches cheng et al 2014 chunyu et al 2019 to restore the degenerated ecological systems of the lower tarim river basin at the end of the 20th century the central chinese government invested approximately 10 7 billion rmb to transport fresh water from the upper tarim river and neighbouring bosten lake to the lower reaches along the river channel to date over 77 006 10 8 m 3 of water has been transported the transfer distance has exceeded 400 km per year and the project duration has exceeded 20 years similarly the downstream surface runoff and terminal lakes of some other inland river basins such as heihe river basin shiyang river basin in northwest china and aral sea basin in central asia all dried out in the 1970s due to the same reason because the ewtp for the tarim river restored the severely degraded ecosystem heihe river basin and shiyang river basin in northwest china have subsequently adopted ewtps to restore the degraded ecosystems shen et al 2017 chunyu et al 2019 a water transfer megaproject has also been planned for the aral sea basin in central asia to support ecosystem restoration shumilova et al 2018 although the ewtp was carried out for 20 years the recovery of the riparian zone in the lower reaches of the tarim river has been slower and remained over a narrower width than originally anticipated bao et al 2017 glenn et al 2017 many studies have proposed that the transfer scheme of the ewtp of the tarim river basin is unreasonable bao et al 2017 tao et al 2008 chen et al 2010 ye et al 2010 applicable methodologies for the evaluation and optimazition of ewtp from the periodic perspective are still lacking in the megaproject of the tarim river basin various monitoring datasets such as flow discharge soil moisture groundwater depth and quality and the growth of natural vegetation have been monitored for more than 20 years along the river course tao et al 2008 these field monitoring and satellite observation datasets of the tarim river basin provide us with a robust foundation to understand the impacts of ewtp flow regimes on the ecohydrological system this study presents a wavelet based method to evaluate and optimize the impact of ewtp on ecohydrological systems from the periodic perspective and demonstrates its implementation to a realistic example for comprehensive analysis of ewtps the continuous wavelet power spectrum was used to dissect and compare the periodicity components of historical flow and transfers flow of ewtps and the wavelet coherence was used to analyse the correlation structure between transfers flow of ewtps and riverine ecohydrological systems in time and frequency domain through wavelet analysis furthermore the transfer schedules of ewtps were optimized based on mimicking historical flow and designed flow to improve ecological restoration efficiency the designed flow was based on the ecological water demand of natural vegetation the time lags between diversion water and riparian vegetation growth at different timescales were calculated through cross wavelet transform to determine the diversion times of designed flow this new and flexible evaluation and optimization method provides water resources managers with the novel capability of analysing ewtp groundwater vegetation interactions in water receiving area from the periodic viewpoint and allocating optimal water diversion scheme for further ecosystem restoration the specific questions that we addressed included the following 1 is there any difference between the flow regimes of natural flow and ewtps in water receiving areas 2 if differences exist do the change in flow regime influence the local ecohydrological rhythm and meet the water requirements for vegetation growth 3 can we optimize the water delivery scheme to promote the growth of natural vegetation if the current delivery mode is not reasonable the results can facilitate the water resources management and ecological restoration in tarim river basin and provide references to other existing and future ewtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the tarim river basin is located in north western china and covers an area of 102 10 4 km 2 the tarim river runs along the northern edge of the taklamakan desert and it is one of the world s longest inland rivers its lower reaches act as a green corridor between the taklamakan desert and kuruk desert tao et al 2008 the basin is a considerably flat desert with a continental extreme arid climate its mean annual precipitation is less than 50 mm and its mean annual evaporation is above 2500 mm the natural vegetation here mainly relies on rivers and groundwater as precipitation obviously cannot meet the requirements of vegetation the spatial distribution of plants predominantly shows belt distribution patterns along rivers the main plant species is populus euphratica for trees which is a constructive species of inland riparian forests and is a forest genetic resource that needs to be urgently protected tamarix ramosissima tamarix hispida and lycium ruthenicum are the primary shrub species and phragmites communis alhagi sparsifolia apocynum venetum karelinia capsica and glyzyrrhiza inflate are the dominant herb species historically nine tributaries have hydraulic connections with the tarim river yang et al 2018 due to climate changes and human activities the water resources of the tarim river are now mainly recharged by three headwaters i e the aksu river the hotan river and the yarkant river through permanent glacier meltwater seasonal snow meltwater and precipitation duethmann et al 2015 stretching the tarim river from xiaojiake the mainstream is 1321 km long and can be divided into three sections fig 1 a alar to yingbaza as the upstream region with a length of 495 km yingbaza to qiala as the midstream region with a length of 398 km and qiala to taitema lake as the downstream region with a length of 428 km additionally two natural river channels the old tarim river channel and the qiwenkur river channel stretch from the daxihaizi reservoir to alagan in the lower reaches fig 1b however since the 1960s with the population increase and the continuously increasing irrigated area in the upper and middle reaches of the tarim river basin the consumption of water resources has increased dramatically the streamflow in the lower reaches and the terminal lake taitema lake hereafter completely dried up in 1972 as the daxihaizi reservoir intercepted almost all the water for anthropogenic activities song et al 1999 this drying fatally dropped the downstream groundwater table and severely destroyed the ecosystems and many herbaceous and non herbaceous plants decreased extensively fig 2 a and b the green corridor has disappeared and the kuruk desert and the taklamakan desert which are located on the east and west sides of the river have tended to converge land desertification has intensified and many catastrophic climatic events such as sand storms have increased 2 2 ecological water transport project and monitoring dataset until may 2000 the desiccated downstream flows again as the management bureau of the tarim river basin started implementing the ewtp water was intermittently transferred from the upper tarim river and neighbouring bosten lake to the daxihaizi reservoir and then discharged to the qiwenkur river channel and the old tarim river channel and finally to taitemar lake fig 1a and b the water diversion mainly has a single line i e qiwenkur river channel or old tarim river channel and a double line i e qiwenkur river channel and old tarim river channel with two modes the first few water conveyances mainly adopted single line style water conveyance to revive the desiccated terminus of the lake of the tarim river and the latest transportation projects mainly adopted double line style water conveyance to enlarge the restored area tao et al 2008 to date the central chinese government has invested 10 7 billion rmb to support the ewtp of the tarim river basin and a total volume of 77 006 10 8 m 3 water was transported downstream of the tarim river by 2018 the transfer distance has exceeded 400 km per year the ewtp reconnected fragmental hydro ecosystems the terminal lake of taitema lake is recovered again and the groundwater is recharged to lift the water table to meet the demand of natural vegetation growth many herbaceous plants such as apocynum venetum and karelinia capsica reappeared along the riverbank and some drought tolerant trees and shrubs were revived the species composition of natural vegetation changed from 17 species before water conveyance 2000 to 46 species after conveyance deng et al 2016 along the river course of the tarim river basin several experimental monitoring sections have been established to monitor the discharge soil moisture salt content groundwater table and groundwater mineralization degree at different distances of the riverbank more details can be found in tao et al 2008 the spatial coverage of the dataset is at the catchment scale some of these datasets have been monitored for more than 20 years with temporal resolutions ranging from 15 minute time steps for groundwater to 1 day time steps for stream discharge because the upstream channel is recharged by natural streams without human interference the qiwenkur river channel and the old tarim river channel in downstream are recharged by intermittent artificial water delivery of ewtps fig 1a to compare the periodic impact of nature and man controlled flow on the ecohydrological system the flow discharge normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and groundwater table data at the experimental transect of alar in the free flowing upstream reach yinsu of the qiwenkur river channel and old yinsu of the old tarim river channel in the human altered downstream reach were collected daily streamflow data were collected from the alar hydrological station in upstream over the period of 1977 to 2013 ecological water transport data for the qiwenkur river channel and old tarim river channel over the period 2000 to 2018 were obtained from the tarim river basin administration eleven groundwater monitoring wells along the yinsu and old yinsu transects were set up in april 2009 fig 1c while six monitoring wells along the alar transect were set up in august 2012 along each aforementioned transect the monitoring wells are located 50 150 300 500 750 and 1050 m from the river channel in the transverse direction in this study the daily groundwater table datasets in yinsu and old yinsu were collected from april 2009 to december 2018 while the daily groundwater table datasets in alar were collected from august 2012 to december 2018 in the transverse direction the daily mean groundwater table within 50 to 300 m and 500 to 1050 m distances from the river channel at each transect were used in this study to derive the ndvi time series landsat 4 5 thematic mapper tm landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli scenes of alar yinsu and old yinsu with 30 m spatial resolution 16 day temporal resolution and cloud covers less than 1 during 2000 2018 were obtained from the us geological survey earth resources observation and science center http earthexplorer usgs gov these images were processed by using software envi5 3 image clipping radiometric correction atmospheric correction and geometric correction were performed on each scene moravec et al 2021 ndvi were calculated based on the near infrared nir and red r bands of each sensor moravec et al 2021 as follows 1 ndvi nir r nir r as vegetation communities in the lower reaches mainly occurred within 1000 m of the riverbank chen et al 2010 the mean ndvi values with 16 day temporal resolution within 1000 m of the riverbank at the alar yinsu and old yinsu transects were used in this study in addition the total ecological water demand of natural vegetation in the lower reaches of the tarim river was collected from the studies of ye et al 2010 and liu et al 2013 and used 2 3 methods we propose a data driven approach to evaluate and optimize the ecological water diversion project in the tarim river as described in the flowchart fig 3 we employ the wavelet power spectrum to dissect and compare the fluctuation periodic components of free flowing runoff upstream and man controlled flow downstream of the tarim river the correlation structure between natural and man controlled flow groundwater and riparian vegetation growth was obtained by wavelet coherence one historical mimic flow scheme and two designed flow schemes are proposed to optimize ecological water diversion schemes designed flow is designed based on the water demand of natural riparian vegetation and the time lag between restoration flow and the ndvi at different timescales the time lags between diversion water and riparian vegetation growth at different periodicities are calculated through the cross wavelet power spectrum then the narx neural network was used to simulate the growth of vegetation of different diversion schedules fig 3 in section 2 3 1 the wavelet power spectrum is introduced wavelet coherence and time lag are introduced in section 2 3 2 section 2 3 3 includes the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural network 2 3 1 continuous wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform cwt is a useful tool to identify the dominant oscillations of nonstationary time series in time frequency space the cwt of time series x n n 1 n is defined as the convolution of x n and scaled and translated wavelet ψ 0 t 2 w n x a δ t a n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t a where ψ 0 denotes the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet function ψ 0 detailed introductions of the mother wavelet function are given by torrence and compo 1998 the parameters a and n can be interpreted as a scale expansion factor and a time shift factor respectively to adjust the scale and location of the wavelet in the time frequency domain δ t is the time step of series x n the selection of the mother wavelet function is very important in the wavelet transform kharate et al 2007 neupauer et al 2006 there are many mother wavelet functions such as the haar paul and morlet wavelets the morlet wavelet is good for feature extraction dillin and neupauer 2010 grinsted et al 2004 thus the morlet wavelet was selected in this study the morlet wavelet is defined as follows 3 ψ 0 t π 1 4 e i ω 0 t e t 2 2 where ω 0 and t are the dimensionless frequency and dimensionless time respectively the relationship between frequency f and scale a of the morlet wavelet is as follows 4 1 f 4 π a ω 0 2 ω 0 2 ω 0 6 was chosen in this study because eq 3 becomes 1 f 1 033 a when ω 0 6 the period is roughly equal to the scale and the wavelet provides a good balance between time and frequency localization torrence and compo 1998 because the morlet wavelet function ψ 0 t is a complex exponential function the wavelet transform w n x a is complex and can also be written as follows 5 w n x a w n x a e i tan 1 i w n x a r w n x a where w n x a is the amplitude and a r c t a n i w n x a r w n y a is the phase w n x a 2 denotes the wavelet power spectrum wps which represents the energy distribution of the time series over a given wavelet scale and time domain labat 2005 in this study the normalized wps i e w n x a 2 σ x 2 where σ x 2 is the variance of the time series x n was used to facilitate the comparison of different series as it diminished the influence of dimension torrence and compo 1998 the significance testing for the wps was performed against red noise which was serially correlated in time and could be used to test whether the ecohydrological series deviated from red noise like behaviours grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2017 the 95 confidence level was used to test the true features of the series the wavelet transform assumes the data are cyclic therefore there are some errors at the beginning and end of the wavelet power spectrum as a result of edge effects the cone of influence coi was introduced to represent the area affected by the edge effect torrence and compo 1998 in the area outside the coi edge effects can be neglected the region in the coi which may be distorted by the edge effect is covered by a light shadow in the figure 2 3 2 wavelet coherence and time lag for two time series cross wavelet transform xwt was constructed as the complex multiplication of their cwts and denoted their high common power and relative phase angle grinsted et al 2004 the xwt of the two series x n and y n can be defined as follows 6 w n xy a w n x a w n y a w n xy a is the cross wavelet power spectrum and reveals the cross covariance between the two time series torrence and compo 1998 wavelet coherence wtc can be used to measure the local correlation degree of two time series in the time frequency domain even in the low energy region of the crossed wavelet power spectrum the correlation of two series in the wtc may also be significant torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 defined the wtc between time series x n and y n as follows 7 r n 2 a s a 1 w n xy a 2 s a 1 w n x a 2 s a 1 w n y a 2 where w n xy a denotes the cross wavelet spectrum s is a smoothing operator and a 1 is used to convert to energy density detailed introductions of the xwt and the smoothing operator s are given in torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 torrence and webster 1999 the definition of the wavelet coherence coefficient is similar to that of the correlation coefficient the value of r n 2 a is between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 1 the greater the correlations between time series x n and y n at scale a are and when the value is 0 it means that the two series are without relation monte carlo methods were used to test the significance level of the wtc see details in grinsted et al 2004 the available real and imaginary parts of w n xy a were used to calculate the phase angle θ between two series x n and y n which could describe the local relative phase relationship between the two time series in the time frequency domain torrence and compo 1998 the phase angle can be calculated as follows 8 θ arctan i s a 1 w n xy a r s a 1 w n xy a where i and r denote the imaginary and real parts respectively in the time frequency domain grinsted et al 2004 then the corresponding time lag t at period t can be calculated by t t θ 2 π the global coherence coefficient gcc at scale a is the average of the wtc at that scale and can be written as follows 9 r 2 a 1 n n 1 n r n 2 a where n is the length of the time series a is the scale expansion factor and n is the time shift factor torrence and compo 1998 despite the loss of temporal information global coherence intuitively expresses the wavelet coherence coefficient distribution of two series at different scales 2 3 3 narx neural network considering the difficulty of conventional conceptual physical and numerical based hydrological modelling data based black box artificial intelligence models are greatly suited to dynamical characteristic system predictions because of their simplicity and efficiency daliakopoulos et al 2005 rajaee et al 2019 there are various artificial intelligence techniques such as feedforward neural networks multilayer perceptron networks and recurrent neural networks among these the narx neural network lin et al 1996 was used in this study as it is a common tool for long term nonlinear time series analysis wunsch et al 2018 lin et al 1996 the narx network is a type of recurrent neural network that modelling the process based on lagged input and output variables and prediction errors guzman et al 2017 narx network has become popular for its performance in the prediction of nonlinear time series guzman et al 2017 wunsch et al 2021 the narx neural network generates a global feedback connection between the output and input layers and can keep information up to three times longer than conventional recurrent neural networks lin et al 1996 wunsch et al 2018 wunsch et al 2021 for small sample sizes the narx network can clearly outperform lstm which is widely known to perform well on sequential data wunsch et al 2021 lstm may perform better with a large sample size where deeper network can fully shows its strength shen 2018 wunsch et al 2021 however since the sample size here is not large enough the narx network was used in this study to predict the growth of vegetation the narx neural network can be mathematically presented as follows 10 y t f y t 1 y t d y x t 1 x t d x where f is the nonlinear function obtained by a learning algorithm y t and x t denote the model output and input of the network at time step t respectively d y and d x are the output and input memory orders respectively lin et al 1996 in this work the narx neural network was used to simulate the growth of vegetation at different diversion schedules and the target y t is the ndvi mean value in 1000 m ranges around the river channel downstream in the tarim river basin as precipitation in the mainstream of tarim river has little effect on either groundwater recharge or vegetation growth tao et al 2008 the volume of transferred water in the lower reaches is chosen as a predictor x t the time series were randomly divided into three parts 70 for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing in addition to converge faster and prevent local extremes from affecting training the input series were normalized to the range of 1 to 1 before training and then rescaled to the original values after training the narx network was trained with the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm which combines the advantages of gauss newton and steepest descent methods wunsch et al 2018 there are many optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms ga ant colony algorithms aco and particle swarm algorithms pso to optimize the network structure however considering the number of parameters of shallow narx network are not large the number of hidden nodes and the transfer function of the narx model here were obtained by trial and error processes to relieve the burden of executing a long trial and error process some preliminary analyses were implemented to narrow down the range therefore cross correlation and autocorrelation statistics of the time series were used to determine the range of the input and output time delays rajaee et al 2019 and the empirical equation given by wanas et al 1998 i e hn log n where hn and n denote the number of maximum hidden neurons and the training sample numbers respectively was used to approximate the hidden neuron number in this work the optimal architecture of the narx model was obtained by 1 hidden layer 10 hidden neurons and 1 year delays the performance of the narx model is evaluated by the mean square error mse 11 mse 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 where y t and y t are the observed value and estimated value at the time step t respectively n is the number of data points the mse value is low if the narx model performs well 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluctuation periodicities of natural and man controlled flow in this work wet dry or normal years were classified by using the degree of deviation of the year s stream from the long term mean annual stream for a given year if the deviation rate was larger than 15 it was a wet year if it was less than 15 it was a dry year the remaining years were normal years the stream in the upper tarim river basin naturally flows without human interference the monthly stream volume and deviation of the long term mean annual stream at alar station in upstream are shown in fig 4 a and b from january 1977 to december 2013 the upstream runoff diverged greatly at interannual scales for example the total water volume of upstream runoff at the alar transect was 69 59 10 8 m 3 in the extreme wet year 1978 and only 13 58 10 8 m 3 in the extreme dry year 2009 fig 4a hydrologic dry and wet events appeared alternately and each event often continued for several years during the study period fig 4b the continuous wps of the daily stream reflects the temporal variability of the stream in the time frequency domain for the free flowing stream upstream the continuous wps of the daily stream shows a periodicity of 12 month over the entire study period except for some extremely dry years fig 4c the wps of the upstream flow also showed periodicities from 0 125 to 1 month in each flood season i e from june to september the periodicities at the 3 to 6 month scales were obvious in the flood season of wet years fig 4c these high frequencies were mainly result from the heavy flow in flood season this was intuitive since the runoff in the upper tarim river is dominated by seasonal snow and glacier meltwater in headwater mountainous catchments duethmann et al 2015 and the volume of upstream rivers in the flood season accounts for 70 to 80 of that of the whole year fig 4a the flows through the qiwenkur river channel and old tarim river channel downstream of the tarim river are man controlled flows of ewtps since the ewtp initiated in 2000 water has been intermittently transferred from the daxihaizi reservoir downstream of the tarim river basin through a single river channel i e qiwenkur river or old tarim river channel or through double channels the monthly volume of diversion water in the old tarim river channel and qiwenkur river channel in the lower tarim river are shown in fig 5 a 5b until 2018 there were 19 water diversions with a total volume of 77 006 10 8 m 3 water transported fig 5a and b however the date duration and volume of each water conveyance were not fixed ewtp was mainly conducted in winter earlier in some wet years or not at all in extremely dry years watering duration ranged from 1 month to 10 months and most durations were 3 months fig 5a and b the watering volume ranged from 0 07 10 8 m 3 to 6 79 10 8 m 3 in the old tarim river channel and qiwenkur river channel the continuous wps of daily volume of diversion water showed periodicities from 0 125 to 1 month in each water diversion year fig 5c and d periodicities with bandwidths from 1 to 3 months 3 to 6 months and 12 months were also evident in large watering volumes or long watering duration years there was no periodicity in no flow years such as 2008 and 2009 compared with flow in the old tarim river channel flow in the qiwenkur river channel exhibited more monthly to yearly oscillations from 2001 to 2003 while monthly scale oscillations occurred less frequently from 2011 to 2018 fig 5b the continuous wps of natural and man controlled flow in upper and lower reaches reflects the spatiotemporal variability of surface flow in the tarim river basin low frequency yearly periodicity across the study period was captured in high flow years irrespective of upper or lower reaches figs 4 and 5 in this study we mainly focus on the intra annual variability and periodicity since the stream flow in the upper tarim river is dominated by seasonal snow and glacier melting in headwaters duethmann et al 2015 and the succession process of the riparian vegetation in the tarim river basin is highly dependent on the interplay between flood events and groundwater fluctuation wang et al 2018 indeed the lower reaches will still followed the same hydrological regularity as the upper reaches if they did not dry up however after the implementation of the ewtp the free flowing stream in the upper reaches was characterized by high frequency weekly to monthly periodicities during the flood season fig 4c while the completely man controlled discrete flow in the lower reaches exhibited high frequency weekly to monthly periodicities during winter or early spring rather than during the flood season fig 5c and d the spatiotemporal regularity change was mainly caused by the divergence of the water allocation mode between natural and human controlled flow unlike the free flowing runoff upstream that was dominated by seasonal snow and glacier meltwater in headwater mountainous catchments duethmann et al 2015 the human dominated diversion flow downstream was always implemented in winter instead of the flood season because a large amount of water is utilized for irrigation in the mainstream during the growing season i e march to october and low temperatures in winter can prevent excessive water consumption of evaporation during transportation chen et al 2010 although the dried up downstream became moist again by the diversion flow of ewtps the flow regimes of ewtps in lower tarim river basin are unnatural 3 2 periodic impacts of natural and man controlled flow on ecohydrological systems in this section the wps and wtc are employed to investigate the periodic responses of groundwater and riparian vegetation growth to free flowing rivers and man controlled flow the daily value of groundwater table natural and man controlled flow in the upper and lower reaches were used in the following analysis the wps of the groundwater table at different distances from the river channel reflects the spatiotemporal variability of the groundwater table fig 6 a and b in general periodicities from 0 125 to 1 month 3 to 6 months and 12 months were observed for the groundwater table irrespective of the upper and lower reaches of the tarim river basin fig 6a and b irrespective at the seasonal or inter annual time scales the groundwater table near the river channel exhibited more periodicities than the groundwater table far from the river channel fig 6a and b it is not difficult to understand this because compared with groundwater far from the river channel the groundwater near the river channel is relatively susceptible to water recharge and evaporative loss and transpiration loss chen et al 2010 furthermore in the completely man controlled lower reaches compared with the old yinsu transect of the old tarim river channel the water table in the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel exhibited fewer oscillations from 2010 to 2018 fig 6a and b because the old tarim river channel implemented water conveyance more frequently than the qiwenkur river channel from 2010 to 2018 fig 5 the wtc coefficient between the flow and groundwater table reflects the intrinsic resonance of water flow with groundwater in time and frequency domains fig 6c and d the larger the coefficient is the stronger the correlation between water flow and groundwater is irrespective of upper or lower reaches the wtc between water flow and the groundwater table was also consistent with a greater correlation in the location near the river channel while the far location exhibited a lower correlation fig 6c and d this is intuitive since increases in groundwater depth near the river course are relatively immediate to water recharge while the groundwater depth far from the river course is buffered by thicker soil and is less susceptible to water recharge tao et al 2008 consistent with results of the continuous wps of natural and man controlled flow in upper and lower reaches figs 4 and 5 the groundwater table at the alar transect of the free flowing upstream exhibited periodicities of 0 125 to 6 months in the flood season of each year while the groundwater table at the yinsu and old yinsu transects of the man controlled downstream showed fewer periodicities and mainly occurred in winter fig 6a and b similarly the high frequency weekly to monthly correlations between water flow and the groundwater table were intermittent in general and occurred in the flood season in the free flowing upper stream while they occurred in the winter in human controlled downstream fig 6c and d this result is intuitive since precipitation is extremely scarce and leakage from natural runoff and transfers water of ewtps is the dominant process for groundwater recharge in the upper and lower reaches of the tarim river basin respectively hao et al 2010 however approximately 80 of annual runoff in the free flowing upstream is occurs in the period from june to september tao et al 2011 duethmann et al 2015 while diversion flow of ewtps in the downstream is usually implemented in winter chen et al 2010 this divergence played an important role in the inconsistent groundwater fluctuation cycle between the upper and lower tarim river basin therefore it can be concluded that although ewtps in the lower reaches of the tarim river played an important role in recharging groundwater and lifting the water table tao et al 2008 the ewtps also caused unnatural fluctuating characteristics of groundwater in downstream due to their unnatural flow regimes the ndvi is a standardized way to measure healthy vegetation and it reflects the vegetation density and changes in plant health over time the ndvi with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the analysis in general ndvi in each transect shows an increasing trend in the period from january to july while shows decreasing trend in the period from to july to december fig 7 a compared with ndvi in the upper reaches ndvi was lower in the lower reaches and mainly ranges from 0 06 to 0 24 fig 7a ndvi at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect in the downstream river channel were clearly lower in the period from 2008 to 2011 since no water was delivered in 2007 2009 while higher in the period from 2006 to 2007 and 2017 to 2018 as the watering volume and duration were both higher in previous years figs 5 and 7a overall ndvi in the downstream exhibits an increasing trend over 2000 to 2018 suggesting that the ewtp indeed helped vegetation recovery as they lifted the water table to meet natural vegetation water demand tao et al 2008 notably consistent with other researches hao and li 2014 fu et al 2021 a time lag effect may exists between the vegetation growth and ewtp for example ndvi at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect in the downstream were both higher in year 2007 but ewtps were only implemented in previous years and no water was imported in this year figs 5 and 7a in addition ndvi was higher in year 2014 than in year 2015 at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect while the ewtp was not implemented in 2014 and reactivated in 2015 figs 5 and 7a these results suggested that approximately 1 year lag may exists between ewtps and vegetation growth in the lower tarim river fig 7b presents the wps of the ndvi in 1000 m ranges around the river channel upstream and downstream of the tarim river the continuous wps of the ndvi reflects the spatiotemporal variability in riparian vegetation density and health fig 7b the ndvi with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the following analysis due to temporal resolution limitations of the ndvi data variability at weekly to monthly scales cannot be observed however compared with the variability at weekly to monthly timescales the variability of the ndvi at seasonal and inter annual scales is of most interest for the vegetation recovery of ewtps since it exhibits a general trend of vegetation density and health from 2000 to 2018 the wps of the ndvi within 1000 m of the river channel exhibited 1 to 6 month and 12 month periodicities in the upper and lower reaches of the tarim river fig 7b however a periodicity of 12 months was observed continuously for the ndvi in the alar transect of the free flowing upper reaches and intermittently in the yinsu and old yinsu transects in the human controlled lower reaches fig 7b for example the periodicity of ndvi at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect in the downstream river channel were both interrupted in the period from 2008 to 2011 this is intuitive since no water was delivered in 2007 2009 fig 5 and there is almost no other form of water supply except ewtp tao et al 2008 the wtc coefficient between the surface water groundwater and the ndvi reflects the intrinsic resonance of the vegetation growth with surface water and groundwater in time and frequency domain fig 7c and d the ndvi groundwater table natural and man controlled flow with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the following analysis both the wtc between the surface water groundwater table and ndvi within 1000 m distances of the riverbank showed a significant correlation at the 1 to 6 month and 12 month scales fig 7c and d the annual scale variation revealed the alternately increasing and decreasing trend of the correlation in different years while the seasonal scale variation revealed the correlation changes within a year on inter annual time scales consistent with the result of the continuous wps of ndvi fig 7b both the wtc between the river flow groundwater table and ndvi within 1000 m distances of the river channel in the upper reaches had a continuously strong correlation at the 12 month scale while the correlation in the lower reaches had an apparent interruption due to several consecutive years of no ewtp fig 7c and d on seasonal scales compared with that in the free flowing upstream both the wtc between the surface water groundwater table and ndvi in the human controlled downstream areas exhibited fewer and fragmentary correlations at the 1 to 6 month periodicities fig 7c and d this is intuitive since at seasonal scales the flood season upstream coincided more with the seed ripening and dispersal periods of native vegetation such as populus euphratica tamarix ramosissima tamarix hispida and alhagi sparsifolia cheng et al 2007 chen et al 2010 high frequency fluctuations in natural streams in the flood season have a profound effect on the composition structure and spatial distribution pattern of riparian forests cheng et al 2007 riis and hawes 2002 the overbank water caused by flood events will assist the spreading germinating and natural regeneration of seeds along water channel margins cheng et al 2007 furthermore since the seedlings of some drought and salinity resistant trees and shrubs such as populus euphratica are generally not drought or salinity tolerant wang et al 2018 floods could supply soil water effectively and reduce soil salinity to maintain the normal growth of seedlings through flood irrigation and infiltration cheng et al 2007 however the diversion time of etwps in the tarim river basin is always during winter and the lack of high frequency fluctuations in the flood season hampers long term riparian forest development in the lower reaches of the tarim river basin this result is consistent with the research by tao et al 2008 and chen et al 2010 who found that some degraded populus euphratica was rejuvenated after water conveyance but the quantitative characteristics and spatial distribution of populus euphratica remained almost unchanged although some herbaceous vegetation drought resistant trees and shrubs regrew along the river channel of the lower reaches after water conveyance since the correlations among the diversion flow of ewtps groundwater table and ndvi in the human controlled downstream of the tarim river basin were large at 12 month and 6 month time scales fig 7c and d the time lags between the diversion flow of ewtps groundwater table and ndvi were calculated at these scales through xwt table 1 from table 1 both the groundwater behavior and vegetation growth are expected to be influenced by antecedent surface water the ndvi at the old yinsu and yinsu transects in the downstream river channel approximately lagged diversion flow of ewtps by 10 months with a 0 6 month deviation at 12 month timescales and 3 to 3 9 months with a 0 1 to 0 3 month deviation at 6 month timescales table 1 this result was consistent with the previous result that a time lag effect is exists between the vegetation growth and ewtp fig 7a in general the sum of the time difference between the diversion flow and groundwater table and the time difference between the groundwater table and ndvi was approximately the time difference between the diversion water and ndvi table 1 this result is intuitive since the riparian ecosystems in the mainstream arid tarim river basin are groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems wang et al 2011 while the ewtp controls the downstream groundwater recharge without other interference like precipitation and pumping tao et al 2011 the diversion flow of ewtps in the lower tarim river basin major contains signals at seasonal and inter annual scales fig 5 identify the time lags between surface flow groundwater and vegetation may help to obtain more information about the surface flow groundwater vegetation interactions at specific frequencies the quantified timing of vegetation responses to ewtp at different frequencies may help to design the duration of water diversion the gccs between the ndvi groundwater table and surface water reflect the correlation of each other in the frequency domain fig 8 the ndvi groundwater table natural and man controlled flow with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the analysis in the human controlled downstream the gccs between the ndvi and diversion flow were relatively consistent with higher gccs in the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel than in the old yinsu transect of the old tarim river channel from 2000 to 2013 fig 8a the divergence of gccs between the ndvi and the groundwater table was not significant in the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel or in the old yinsu transect of the old tarim river channel from 2013 to 2018 fig 8b because both the water volume and duration were larger in the qiwenkur river channel than that in the old tarim river channel in the period from 2000 to 2013 while the water volume and duration in the two river channels were almost the same in the period from 2013 to 2018 fig 5 from the gccs between the ndvi and waterflow or groundwater table there was an apparent separation in gccs between natural flow and human controlled flow with apparently high gccs in the free flowing upstream area irrespective at the seasonal or inter annual scales fig 8 this result is intuitive since the recharge from the stream and groundwater table upstream are relatively immediate to the vegetation water demand while the recharge from the ewtp in the downstream are usually in winter and not immediate chen et al 2010 ewtp plays an important role in ecosystem rehabilitation in arid regions however most ewtps were implemented at microhabitat scale and usually focus on object specific and site specific restoration polvi et al 2020 tao et al 2008 or have primarily implemented only simple flow recommendations on the basis of single flow events chen and olden 2017 as a catchment scale ecosystem rehabilitation megaproject which has operated over 20 years ewtp in tarim river basin in northwest china is representative around the globe shumilova et al 2018 from the above analysis in tarim river basin this study provides a new insight of the relationships between ewtps and ecohydrological processes from the periodic perspective although ewtp plays a key role in lifting the groundwater level to meet the water demand of vegetation tao et al 2008 its unnatural regimes also changes the hydrological fluctuation cycle of the water receiving areas fig 6 regions where groundwater is mainly fed by ewtps such as tarim river basin heihe river basin and shiyang river basin in northwest china and aral sea basin in central asia should also pay more attention to the flow regimes of ewtp in water resources management changes in dominant frequencies in the surface flow can have strong impacts on vegetation communities palmer and ruhi 2019 for example fluctuations at seasonal time scales directly influence annual species vegetation lifecycle and perennial species must adapt the entire conditions proposed by seasonal fluctuations to occupy a site during a growing season keddy and reznicek 1986 camporeale and ridolfi 2006 jansson et al 2000 while in where fluctuation is predominantly among a period at years or decades time scales some species might only exist as buried seeds and others are survive in current conditions on a relatively long term basis riis and hawes 2002 from an ecological standpoint excessive or not enough stream fluctuations would result in a decline of biodiversity huston 1994 flow variability have been critical drivers in regulating biodiversity and ecosystem functioning palmer and ruhi 2019 sabo et al 2017 long term unstable flow regimes of ewtps are not conducive to stable vegetation recovery and needs to be improved at inter annual scales the maintenance of reasonable groundwater level to which vegetation can growth normally need persistent water delivery at seasonal timescales high frequency fluctuations in flood season will assist the spreading germinating and natural regeneration of the seeds and have a profound effect on the composition structure and spatial distribution pattern of riparian forests cheng et al 2007 riis and hawes 2002 the role of flow regimes of ewtp in dryland ecosystem restoration has been largely underestimated even if the trial water release program became a permanent river management practice in many regions like tarim river basin heihe river basin and shiyang river basin in northwest china and aral sea basin in central asia a focus on future ewtp restoration should shift the conversation from how much water does the ecological system need to when does the ecosystem need it the most and when can we transfer it 3 3 optimization and simulation of diversion schedules in this section three diversion schedules are proposed to improve the ecosystem restoration efficiency of ewtps in the tarim river table 2 one diversion schedule is a mimicry of historical flow which follows the natural flow regimes two diversion schedules are designed flows that are based on the water demand of natural vegetation growth then the narx neural network model was used to predict the restoration effects under different diversion schedules by simulating the nonlinear function of diversion water and its corresponding ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges of the riverbank diversion schedule a mimics the natural runoff in the free flowing upstream of tarim river basin which follows the same hydrologic regularity of the stream i e continuously transferred water and the volume of water conveyed in the flood season accounted for 70 to 80 of the water of the whole year table 2 on the other hand considering the ecological water demand of riparian vegetation over the growing season accounted for 87 of the whole year s total vegetation water demand ye et al 2010 the water delivery schedule could be targeted according to the water demand of vegetation growth to reduce water consumption thus schedules b and c were designed based on the ecological water demand of natural vegetation and the diversion ratios of schedules b and c were calculated by the water demand in a specific month divided by the total water demand in the growth season table 2 the diversion times of schedules b and c were divided based on the time difference between the ndvi and diversion water since the correlation between the ewtp and ndvi in the human controlled lower tarim river was large at the 12 month and 6 month timescales fig 7b the time lag between the ewtp and ndvi in the human controlled downstream region at these two periodicities was selected to design the water delivery scheme schedule b was designed to transfer water from may to december to satisfy the ecological water demand of riparian vegetation in the growing season since the ndvi lagged behind the water diversion by 10 months at a 12 month periodicity table 2 schedule c was designed to transfer water from december to june since the ndvi lagged behind the water transfer by 4 months at a 6 month periodicity table 2 considering that the ecological water demand of native vegetation was calculated by the area of vegetation at a certain groundwater depth ye et al 2010 instead of providing a specific diversion water volume the study provides only a diversion ratio by using the water delivery ratio table 2 the specific monthly diversion volume could be calculated based on the vegetation water demand in that year to verify the validity of these diversion schemes as mentioned before a narx neural network was used to predict the riparian vegetation growth under the designed diversion schedules the ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges around the river channel downstream was the target the volume of transferred water in the lower reaches was chosen as the predictor the ndvi and volume of transferred water with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the analysis the narx neural network model was trained validated and tested with realistic water diversion conditions and its realistic mean ndvi value within 1000 m ranged around the yinsu transect in the qiwenkur river channel from 2000 to 2013 fig 9 then water management schedules a b and c were implemented from 2014 to 2016 fig 10 a1 a3 and the corresponding ndvi mean values within 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel downstream were predicted through the calibrated narx neural network model fig 10b1 b3 to ensure fair competition the annual total transfer water volume of the reallocated scheme was equal to reality the original realistic ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect from 2014 to 2016 were used as the control group dataset the years 2014 to 2016 were hydrologically arid normal and wet years respectively and the gap in the annual total volume of transferred water was wide fig 10a1 a3 the narx model performs satisfactorily with the mse value less than 0 009 in testing dataset and is able to capture the complex trending changes in ndvi affected by the ewtp fig 9b through the calibrated narx neural network model the predicted ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect in the period from 2014 to 2016 fluctuated seasonally and reached a maximum in the growing season fig 10b1 b3 although the annual volumes of transferred water were equal the simulated ndvi was higher in all schemes than the original ndvi and the relative improvement in the ndvi was larger in each scheme fig 10c1 c3 especially in schedules b and c their simulated results could yield up to 40 increase in the ndvi mean value in 1000 m ranges around river channel relative to the original value fig 10c1 c3 the simulated ndvi results and their improvement rates resulted in schedules a b and c fig 10b1 c3 that showed that under constant water volume rational allocation of water conveyance was indeed capable of improving vegetation recovery performance fig 10d1 d3 shows the wtc between transferred water and the ndvi mean value in 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect under different schemes the wtc between the ndvi and diversion water of these ewtp diversion schemes exhibited fewer high frequency relations and continuous low frequency correlations fig 10d1 d3 compared with schedule a schedules b and c performed better irrespective of the improved magnitude or duration fig 10c1 c3 a mimicry of historical flow scheme and two designed flow schemes were proposed to improve ecosystem restoration it is intuitive that mimicking the natural stream flow rhythm has a better performance than the current water delivery scheme since the native vegetation are adapted to the flow regimes of nature stream chen and olden 2017 palmer and ruhi 2019 however the lower reaches of the endorheic tarim river basin dry up at most times and can ensure only intermittent water conveyance because of the increasing water demand conflicts between the upper middle reaches and lower reaches tao et el 2008 furthermore climate change is intensifying the conflict between water supply and demand as droughts increase in both frequency and severity in many regions of the world yuan et al 2019 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 innovative strategies are needed to efficiently restore degraded ecosystems with a limited water supply the simulated ndvi results in schemes b and c illustrate that instead of continuously transferring water like natural stream constructing an ecological water demand of vegetation dominated new flow regimes of ewtp could also improve vegetation recovery and can perform better than natural flow regimes fig 10 because under limited water resources the discrete water transfer schedule that based on vegetation growth water demand could use water more efficiently and reduce water consumptions like evaporation and infiltration these results provide a quantitative illustration that under limited water resources designed flows can effectively improve vegetation recovery in ewtps as a representative ewtp around the world the ewtp for the tarim river successful restored the severely degraded ecosystem however the recovery of the riparian zone in the lower reaches of the tarim river started to slow down and remained over a narrower width even if the ewtp was carried out for 20 years bao et al 2017 glenn et al 2017 many studies have proposed that the transfer scheme of the ewtp of the tarim river basin is unreasonable bao et al 2017 tao et al 2008 chen et al 2010 ye et al 2010 yang et al 2018 and chen et al 2008 suggested that the duration of water transportation should be divided into two stages the first stage involves raising the groundwater table during periods with abundant water and less evaporation for the growth of plants while the period in the second stage should be consistent with the seed falling time of riparian plants chen et al 2008 yang et al 2018 however applicable methodologies for the evaluation and optimazition of ewtp are still lacking the wavelet based method proposed in this paper is designed to integrate the utility of wps and wtc with variability detection and diversion time calculation in evaluating and optimizing the water diversion scheme of ewtps on the evaluation aspect irrespective nature stream or diversion flow of ewtps irregular surface water fluctuations possess signals of different amplitudes and frequencies fig 4c fig 5c and d the role of flow regularity in dryland ecosystem restoration has been largely underestimated even if the trial water release program became a permanent river management practice long term unstable regularity may induce frequent extinctions of some riparian vegetation populations and they need to iteratively establish new populations to rescue the decreasing populations camporeale and ridolfi 2006 jansson et al 2000 this study proves that wavelet analysis can be used to identify dominant frequencies in the diversion flow of ewtp fig 5 to assess correlations between ewtp groundwater and the growth of vegetation in a certain frequency band figs 6 8 and to quantify time lags between two time series in multiple frequencies table 1 wavelet analysis grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2017 provide a broad insight into the evaluation of the ecohydrological restoration project on the optimization aspect this study provides an important basis for designing flow regimes of ewtp under limited water resources first the diversion time of ewtp can be quantitatively divided based on the time lags between transferring water and the ndvi at timescales with strong correlations second the volume of monthly diversion water can be allocated based on the ratio of monthly ecological water demand of vegetation in fact wavelet analysis should be a requisite element for designing and assessing the strategies of ewtps to increase the restoration effects the wavelet based method proposed in this paper can serve as a reference for decision making in water resources management and sustainable ecological development of ewtps in the arid and semiarid regions such as tarim river basin heihe river basin and shiyang river basin of china tao et al 2008 cheng et al 2014 chunyu et al 2019 oldman river and st mary river of canada rood et al 1998 rood and mahoney 2000 lower truckee river middle truckee river and colorado river delta of usa rood et al 2003 2005 shafroth et al 2017 the middle ebro river gonzález et al 2010 of spain and five future ewtps three in north america one in africa and one in asia however due to the lack of vegetation community surveys in field data a clear understanding of the periodic impact of ewtp on different native species is still insufficient the responses of different species to periodic changes in ewtp may be different for example fluctuations at seasonal timescales directly influence the annual species vegetation lifecycle and perennial species must adapt to the entire conditions proposed by seasonal fluctuations to occupy a site during a growing season keddy and reznicek 1986 in areas where fluctuation predominantly occurs within a period with timescales of years or decades some species might exist only as buried seeds and others survive under current conditions on a relatively long term basis riis and hawes 2002 the dominant plant species may change after long term unnatural water delivery moreover in water receiving areas that contain other water supplies such as surface runoff or springs periodic interference and superposition of different water source signals may lead to a more complex periodic response of groundwater and vegetation and deserves further study more research to improve regional water management and ecosystem restoration is expected in future studies 4 conclusions ewtps have become common forms of ecosystem restoration in recent years we evaluated the hydrological regimes of restoration flow and its periodic impact on ecohydrological systems using the wavelet power spectrum for the ewtp of the endorheic tarim river basin china we reported that compared with the free flowing stream in the upper tarim river the water transferred downstream in the tarim river exhibited weekly to monthly periodicities in the winter of each year rather than in the flood season unlike the free flowing runoff upstream that is dominated by seasonal snow and glacier meltwater in headwater mountainous catchments the human dominated diversion flow downstream is always implemented in winter this divergence induced an unsynchronized fluctuation cycle of groundwater in the upper and lower tarim river basin regions at weekly to monthly timescales the groundwater in the human controlled lower reaches exhibited strong coherence with restoration flow in winter while the groundwater in the free flowing upper reaches exhibited strong coherence with water flow in the flood season coherence between the ndvi and transferred water was observed intermittently at the inter annual scale in the human controlled lower tarim river basin ewtps indeed help native vegetation growth but unstable inter annual water conveyance leads to unstable vegetation recovery native riparian vegetation downstream exhibits intermittent yearly periodicities with no periodicity in no flow years in addition the seasonally fluctuating period of water transfer was not coincident with the growing rhythm of riparian vegetation such as seed ripening and dispersal an inter annual stable transfer regularity that is consistent with native riparian species growth is needed for ewtps from a long term perspective this result suggests that changes in flow regimes of ewtps alter the resonance of restoration flow and riparian vegetation and groundwater a focus on ewtps should shift the conversation from how much water does ecosystem restoration need to when does the ecosystem need water the most and when can we transfer it two designed flow diversion schedules based on the water demand of natural vegetation and the time lags between the transferred water and ndvi at 12 month and 6 month timescales and one natural flow mimicry diversion schedule were proposed to improve ecosystem restoration through the narx neural network the predicted ndvi of these optimized diversion schedules indicated significant opportunities to improve native riparian ecosystem restoration under limited water resources the predicted benefits of designed flow surpassed those generated by original and natural flow while keeping the total water volume constant managing the required flow variability component would lead to greater efficiency in ecosystem restoration and water resource utilization which is particularly important in water scarce drylands wavelet analysis and artificial neural networks provide new insights into translating the periodic influence of human dominated hydrological dynamics to restoration practices and designing major flow variability components to improve ecosystem restoration in ewtps future ewtps should be focused on identifying the vegetation growth rhythm of water receiving areas and rationally quantifying diversion schemes to improve vegetation recovery more effectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

3443,water transfers have been implemented globally as important and effective ecological restoration tools over the last several decades however the periodic impacts of large scale ecological water transport projects ewtp on ecohydrological systems have been neglected in this study wavelet analysis was used to evaluate the effect of flow regimes of ewtps on the dynamics of ecohydrological systems through real data from a megaproject in the tarim river basin china the results reveal that comparing with natural stream the restoration flow exhibits seasonal periodicities in the winter instead of flood season and exhibits unstable yearly periodicities these characteristics created a distinct groundwater dynamics which are not coincident with the growth rhythm of riparian vegetation to optimize the ewtp two designed flow schemes based on the time lags between flow and vegetation growth which was estimated using the wavelet analysis at seasonal and annual scales were proposed to improve the ecosystem restoration efficiency the narx network was used to predict the ecological restoration result the predicting results show an up to 40 increase comparing to original restoration flow with the same total water volume these results provide a new insight on ecohydrological system dynamics under ewtp from the periodic perspective and also quantitatively prove that the designed flows based on wavelet analysis can improve ecosystem restoration efficiency in ewtps the methodologies used in this research are mathematical rigorous and can be widely applied to other ewtps 1 introduction the conveyance of water over intra and inter river basins to restore degraded ecosystems in water deficient areas is known as ecological water transport project ewtp shumilova et al 2018 ewtps are particularly common in arid and semi arid areas as water demand usually exceeds supply in these regions and many ecosystems now rely entirely on such imported water tao et al 2008 cheng et al 2014 shen et al 2017 arthington and pusey 2003 for example ewtps have been implemented to restore riparian ecosystems in the tarim river basin tao et al 2008 heihe river basin cheng et al 2014 shen et al 2017 and shiyanghe river basin chunyu et al 2019 of china the oldman river rood et al 1998 and st mary river of canada rood and mahoney 2000 the lower truckee river rood et al 2003 middle truckee river rood et al 2005 and colorado river delta of the usa shafroth et al 2017 and the middle ebro river gonzález et al 2010 of spain furthermore five future ewtps are planned around the globe three in north america one in africa and one in asia shumilova et al 2018 ecosystem restoration through ewtps will continue to be a popular option numerous studies have been conducted to understand the complicated relations between ewtps and ecohydrological processes these studies were generally focused on the changing character of groundwater depth and quality the ecological responses such as structure and diversity of plant communities the minimum ecological water demand of natural vegetation and the suitable groundwater level for vegetation huang and pang 2010 ye et al 2010 hao et al 2010 wang et al 2011 shen et al 2017 however these studies have concentrated more on the relationships from the perspective of the trend change the periodic impacts of ewtps on ecohydrological systems have been neglected from an ecological point of view the flow regime of imported water can alter the water cycle in water receiving areas with potential beneficial or negative effects for ecosystems in the water receiving areas chen and olden 2017 for example unnatural flow regimes from dam operations and other stressors can alters the natural hydrological cycle tongal et al 2016 francis et al 2010 alters the structure of riparian plant networks tonkin et al 2018 promotes the invasion of non native organisms ruhí et al 2016 and reduces biodiversity palmer and ruhi 2019 zhang et al 2016 consequently many dam operations endeavour to emulate historical flow conditions that native plants and animals are adapted to chen and olden 2017 while some studies seek to design hydrologic conditions that may deviate from natural flow rhythms but promote critical ecosystem processes or biological consequences of interest sabo et al 2017 chen et al 2017 overall this raises the question of whether flow regimes of ewtps are natural in magnitude frequency duration and timing the question of whether native vegetation are adapted to the current flow regimes of ewtps and the question of whether the flow regimes of ewtps can be designed to promote the growth of native vegetation a better understanding of the relationships between ewtps and ecohydrological processes from the periodic perspective is needed flow regimes of ewtps can shift temporally with changes in flow management although time scales of flow variation plays a vital role in determining the species abundance stability and structure of riparian vegetation communities bolpagni and piotti 2016 huston 1994 studying the impacts of time varying flow cycles is still rare palmer and ruhi 2019 we still do not know which time scales of flow variation in ewtps may benefit organismal phenology and which may simply be a negative disturbance in this work wavelet analysis was used to understand this issue compared with the conventional fourier analysis that only applies to stationary series in frequency domain wavelet analysis has gained widespread acceptance due to its usefulness in analysing the structure of nonstationary signals in time and frequency domain cazelles et al 2008 biswas si 2011 liu et al 2017 wavelet analysis is specifically applicable to the time varying flow regimes of ewtps which is not possible with traditional fourier analysis first the wavelet power spectrum method can detect and track changes on the periodicity components of flow variation in ewtps over time second the cross wavelet power spectrum and wavelet coherence can provide a more complete correlation structure between flow regimes of ewtps and ecohydrological systems in time and frequency domain furthermore time lags between the diversion flow of ewtps and riparian vegetation growth at different timescales may help to determine the specific diversion time mathematical models based on riparian vegetation and ewtp transfer water may help in predicting the consequences of changing frequencies of flow fluctuations on riverine ecosystem processes because of the complexity of flow fluctuations with respect to geochemical hydrological and biological variables fleming and gupta 2020 moradkhani et al 2004 it is very difficult to use traditional physics based modelling to predict the specific responses of riverine communities to flow dynamics therefore in this work a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs narx neural network was used to simulate the ecosystem restoration effects of diversion schedules among the data driven artificial neural network approaches the narx neural network for predicting hydrological time series has gained popularity in the last few years due to its accuracy flexibility and long term memory chang et al 2015 singh and chakrapani 2015 especially when only small amounts of training data are available the narx network can clearly outperform long short term memory lstm wunsch et al 2021 the narx neural network shows powerful performance that can approximate various nonlinear function guzman et al 2017 and could be a requisite element for modelling the complex relations between restoration flow of ewtp and riparian vegetation growth among existing ewtps projects in the tarim river basin in northwest china are water transfer megaprojects that serve catchment scale ecosystem rehabilitation around the globe shumilova et al 2018 and then considered as our study area tarim river basin is one of the world s largest endorheic river its lower reaches is known as the green corridor since it is located between the taklamakan desert and kuruke desert chen et al 2010 but in the 1970s the green corridor has disappeared as the downstream surface runoff and terminal lakes dried out due to dramatically increased water demand in the upper and middle reaches cheng et al 2014 chunyu et al 2019 to restore the degenerated ecological systems of the lower tarim river basin at the end of the 20th century the central chinese government invested approximately 10 7 billion rmb to transport fresh water from the upper tarim river and neighbouring bosten lake to the lower reaches along the river channel to date over 77 006 10 8 m 3 of water has been transported the transfer distance has exceeded 400 km per year and the project duration has exceeded 20 years similarly the downstream surface runoff and terminal lakes of some other inland river basins such as heihe river basin shiyang river basin in northwest china and aral sea basin in central asia all dried out in the 1970s due to the same reason because the ewtp for the tarim river restored the severely degraded ecosystem heihe river basin and shiyang river basin in northwest china have subsequently adopted ewtps to restore the degraded ecosystems shen et al 2017 chunyu et al 2019 a water transfer megaproject has also been planned for the aral sea basin in central asia to support ecosystem restoration shumilova et al 2018 although the ewtp was carried out for 20 years the recovery of the riparian zone in the lower reaches of the tarim river has been slower and remained over a narrower width than originally anticipated bao et al 2017 glenn et al 2017 many studies have proposed that the transfer scheme of the ewtp of the tarim river basin is unreasonable bao et al 2017 tao et al 2008 chen et al 2010 ye et al 2010 applicable methodologies for the evaluation and optimazition of ewtp from the periodic perspective are still lacking in the megaproject of the tarim river basin various monitoring datasets such as flow discharge soil moisture groundwater depth and quality and the growth of natural vegetation have been monitored for more than 20 years along the river course tao et al 2008 these field monitoring and satellite observation datasets of the tarim river basin provide us with a robust foundation to understand the impacts of ewtp flow regimes on the ecohydrological system this study presents a wavelet based method to evaluate and optimize the impact of ewtp on ecohydrological systems from the periodic perspective and demonstrates its implementation to a realistic example for comprehensive analysis of ewtps the continuous wavelet power spectrum was used to dissect and compare the periodicity components of historical flow and transfers flow of ewtps and the wavelet coherence was used to analyse the correlation structure between transfers flow of ewtps and riverine ecohydrological systems in time and frequency domain through wavelet analysis furthermore the transfer schedules of ewtps were optimized based on mimicking historical flow and designed flow to improve ecological restoration efficiency the designed flow was based on the ecological water demand of natural vegetation the time lags between diversion water and riparian vegetation growth at different timescales were calculated through cross wavelet transform to determine the diversion times of designed flow this new and flexible evaluation and optimization method provides water resources managers with the novel capability of analysing ewtp groundwater vegetation interactions in water receiving area from the periodic viewpoint and allocating optimal water diversion scheme for further ecosystem restoration the specific questions that we addressed included the following 1 is there any difference between the flow regimes of natural flow and ewtps in water receiving areas 2 if differences exist do the change in flow regime influence the local ecohydrological rhythm and meet the water requirements for vegetation growth 3 can we optimize the water delivery scheme to promote the growth of natural vegetation if the current delivery mode is not reasonable the results can facilitate the water resources management and ecological restoration in tarim river basin and provide references to other existing and future ewtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the tarim river basin is located in north western china and covers an area of 102 10 4 km 2 the tarim river runs along the northern edge of the taklamakan desert and it is one of the world s longest inland rivers its lower reaches act as a green corridor between the taklamakan desert and kuruk desert tao et al 2008 the basin is a considerably flat desert with a continental extreme arid climate its mean annual precipitation is less than 50 mm and its mean annual evaporation is above 2500 mm the natural vegetation here mainly relies on rivers and groundwater as precipitation obviously cannot meet the requirements of vegetation the spatial distribution of plants predominantly shows belt distribution patterns along rivers the main plant species is populus euphratica for trees which is a constructive species of inland riparian forests and is a forest genetic resource that needs to be urgently protected tamarix ramosissima tamarix hispida and lycium ruthenicum are the primary shrub species and phragmites communis alhagi sparsifolia apocynum venetum karelinia capsica and glyzyrrhiza inflate are the dominant herb species historically nine tributaries have hydraulic connections with the tarim river yang et al 2018 due to climate changes and human activities the water resources of the tarim river are now mainly recharged by three headwaters i e the aksu river the hotan river and the yarkant river through permanent glacier meltwater seasonal snow meltwater and precipitation duethmann et al 2015 stretching the tarim river from xiaojiake the mainstream is 1321 km long and can be divided into three sections fig 1 a alar to yingbaza as the upstream region with a length of 495 km yingbaza to qiala as the midstream region with a length of 398 km and qiala to taitema lake as the downstream region with a length of 428 km additionally two natural river channels the old tarim river channel and the qiwenkur river channel stretch from the daxihaizi reservoir to alagan in the lower reaches fig 1b however since the 1960s with the population increase and the continuously increasing irrigated area in the upper and middle reaches of the tarim river basin the consumption of water resources has increased dramatically the streamflow in the lower reaches and the terminal lake taitema lake hereafter completely dried up in 1972 as the daxihaizi reservoir intercepted almost all the water for anthropogenic activities song et al 1999 this drying fatally dropped the downstream groundwater table and severely destroyed the ecosystems and many herbaceous and non herbaceous plants decreased extensively fig 2 a and b the green corridor has disappeared and the kuruk desert and the taklamakan desert which are located on the east and west sides of the river have tended to converge land desertification has intensified and many catastrophic climatic events such as sand storms have increased 2 2 ecological water transport project and monitoring dataset until may 2000 the desiccated downstream flows again as the management bureau of the tarim river basin started implementing the ewtp water was intermittently transferred from the upper tarim river and neighbouring bosten lake to the daxihaizi reservoir and then discharged to the qiwenkur river channel and the old tarim river channel and finally to taitemar lake fig 1a and b the water diversion mainly has a single line i e qiwenkur river channel or old tarim river channel and a double line i e qiwenkur river channel and old tarim river channel with two modes the first few water conveyances mainly adopted single line style water conveyance to revive the desiccated terminus of the lake of the tarim river and the latest transportation projects mainly adopted double line style water conveyance to enlarge the restored area tao et al 2008 to date the central chinese government has invested 10 7 billion rmb to support the ewtp of the tarim river basin and a total volume of 77 006 10 8 m 3 water was transported downstream of the tarim river by 2018 the transfer distance has exceeded 400 km per year the ewtp reconnected fragmental hydro ecosystems the terminal lake of taitema lake is recovered again and the groundwater is recharged to lift the water table to meet the demand of natural vegetation growth many herbaceous plants such as apocynum venetum and karelinia capsica reappeared along the riverbank and some drought tolerant trees and shrubs were revived the species composition of natural vegetation changed from 17 species before water conveyance 2000 to 46 species after conveyance deng et al 2016 along the river course of the tarim river basin several experimental monitoring sections have been established to monitor the discharge soil moisture salt content groundwater table and groundwater mineralization degree at different distances of the riverbank more details can be found in tao et al 2008 the spatial coverage of the dataset is at the catchment scale some of these datasets have been monitored for more than 20 years with temporal resolutions ranging from 15 minute time steps for groundwater to 1 day time steps for stream discharge because the upstream channel is recharged by natural streams without human interference the qiwenkur river channel and the old tarim river channel in downstream are recharged by intermittent artificial water delivery of ewtps fig 1a to compare the periodic impact of nature and man controlled flow on the ecohydrological system the flow discharge normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and groundwater table data at the experimental transect of alar in the free flowing upstream reach yinsu of the qiwenkur river channel and old yinsu of the old tarim river channel in the human altered downstream reach were collected daily streamflow data were collected from the alar hydrological station in upstream over the period of 1977 to 2013 ecological water transport data for the qiwenkur river channel and old tarim river channel over the period 2000 to 2018 were obtained from the tarim river basin administration eleven groundwater monitoring wells along the yinsu and old yinsu transects were set up in april 2009 fig 1c while six monitoring wells along the alar transect were set up in august 2012 along each aforementioned transect the monitoring wells are located 50 150 300 500 750 and 1050 m from the river channel in the transverse direction in this study the daily groundwater table datasets in yinsu and old yinsu were collected from april 2009 to december 2018 while the daily groundwater table datasets in alar were collected from august 2012 to december 2018 in the transverse direction the daily mean groundwater table within 50 to 300 m and 500 to 1050 m distances from the river channel at each transect were used in this study to derive the ndvi time series landsat 4 5 thematic mapper tm landsat 7 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm and landsat 8 operational land imager oli scenes of alar yinsu and old yinsu with 30 m spatial resolution 16 day temporal resolution and cloud covers less than 1 during 2000 2018 were obtained from the us geological survey earth resources observation and science center http earthexplorer usgs gov these images were processed by using software envi5 3 image clipping radiometric correction atmospheric correction and geometric correction were performed on each scene moravec et al 2021 ndvi were calculated based on the near infrared nir and red r bands of each sensor moravec et al 2021 as follows 1 ndvi nir r nir r as vegetation communities in the lower reaches mainly occurred within 1000 m of the riverbank chen et al 2010 the mean ndvi values with 16 day temporal resolution within 1000 m of the riverbank at the alar yinsu and old yinsu transects were used in this study in addition the total ecological water demand of natural vegetation in the lower reaches of the tarim river was collected from the studies of ye et al 2010 and liu et al 2013 and used 2 3 methods we propose a data driven approach to evaluate and optimize the ecological water diversion project in the tarim river as described in the flowchart fig 3 we employ the wavelet power spectrum to dissect and compare the fluctuation periodic components of free flowing runoff upstream and man controlled flow downstream of the tarim river the correlation structure between natural and man controlled flow groundwater and riparian vegetation growth was obtained by wavelet coherence one historical mimic flow scheme and two designed flow schemes are proposed to optimize ecological water diversion schemes designed flow is designed based on the water demand of natural riparian vegetation and the time lag between restoration flow and the ndvi at different timescales the time lags between diversion water and riparian vegetation growth at different periodicities are calculated through the cross wavelet power spectrum then the narx neural network was used to simulate the growth of vegetation of different diversion schedules fig 3 in section 2 3 1 the wavelet power spectrum is introduced wavelet coherence and time lag are introduced in section 2 3 2 section 2 3 3 includes the nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs neural network 2 3 1 continuous wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform cwt is a useful tool to identify the dominant oscillations of nonstationary time series in time frequency space the cwt of time series x n n 1 n is defined as the convolution of x n and scaled and translated wavelet ψ 0 t 2 w n x a δ t a n 1 n x n ψ 0 n n δ t a where ψ 0 denotes the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet function ψ 0 detailed introductions of the mother wavelet function are given by torrence and compo 1998 the parameters a and n can be interpreted as a scale expansion factor and a time shift factor respectively to adjust the scale and location of the wavelet in the time frequency domain δ t is the time step of series x n the selection of the mother wavelet function is very important in the wavelet transform kharate et al 2007 neupauer et al 2006 there are many mother wavelet functions such as the haar paul and morlet wavelets the morlet wavelet is good for feature extraction dillin and neupauer 2010 grinsted et al 2004 thus the morlet wavelet was selected in this study the morlet wavelet is defined as follows 3 ψ 0 t π 1 4 e i ω 0 t e t 2 2 where ω 0 and t are the dimensionless frequency and dimensionless time respectively the relationship between frequency f and scale a of the morlet wavelet is as follows 4 1 f 4 π a ω 0 2 ω 0 2 ω 0 6 was chosen in this study because eq 3 becomes 1 f 1 033 a when ω 0 6 the period is roughly equal to the scale and the wavelet provides a good balance between time and frequency localization torrence and compo 1998 because the morlet wavelet function ψ 0 t is a complex exponential function the wavelet transform w n x a is complex and can also be written as follows 5 w n x a w n x a e i tan 1 i w n x a r w n x a where w n x a is the amplitude and a r c t a n i w n x a r w n y a is the phase w n x a 2 denotes the wavelet power spectrum wps which represents the energy distribution of the time series over a given wavelet scale and time domain labat 2005 in this study the normalized wps i e w n x a 2 σ x 2 where σ x 2 is the variance of the time series x n was used to facilitate the comparison of different series as it diminished the influence of dimension torrence and compo 1998 the significance testing for the wps was performed against red noise which was serially correlated in time and could be used to test whether the ecohydrological series deviated from red noise like behaviours grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2017 the 95 confidence level was used to test the true features of the series the wavelet transform assumes the data are cyclic therefore there are some errors at the beginning and end of the wavelet power spectrum as a result of edge effects the cone of influence coi was introduced to represent the area affected by the edge effect torrence and compo 1998 in the area outside the coi edge effects can be neglected the region in the coi which may be distorted by the edge effect is covered by a light shadow in the figure 2 3 2 wavelet coherence and time lag for two time series cross wavelet transform xwt was constructed as the complex multiplication of their cwts and denoted their high common power and relative phase angle grinsted et al 2004 the xwt of the two series x n and y n can be defined as follows 6 w n xy a w n x a w n y a w n xy a is the cross wavelet power spectrum and reveals the cross covariance between the two time series torrence and compo 1998 wavelet coherence wtc can be used to measure the local correlation degree of two time series in the time frequency domain even in the low energy region of the crossed wavelet power spectrum the correlation of two series in the wtc may also be significant torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 defined the wtc between time series x n and y n as follows 7 r n 2 a s a 1 w n xy a 2 s a 1 w n x a 2 s a 1 w n y a 2 where w n xy a denotes the cross wavelet spectrum s is a smoothing operator and a 1 is used to convert to energy density detailed introductions of the xwt and the smoothing operator s are given in torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 torrence and webster 1999 the definition of the wavelet coherence coefficient is similar to that of the correlation coefficient the value of r n 2 a is between 0 and 1 the closer the value is to 1 the greater the correlations between time series x n and y n at scale a are and when the value is 0 it means that the two series are without relation monte carlo methods were used to test the significance level of the wtc see details in grinsted et al 2004 the available real and imaginary parts of w n xy a were used to calculate the phase angle θ between two series x n and y n which could describe the local relative phase relationship between the two time series in the time frequency domain torrence and compo 1998 the phase angle can be calculated as follows 8 θ arctan i s a 1 w n xy a r s a 1 w n xy a where i and r denote the imaginary and real parts respectively in the time frequency domain grinsted et al 2004 then the corresponding time lag t at period t can be calculated by t t θ 2 π the global coherence coefficient gcc at scale a is the average of the wtc at that scale and can be written as follows 9 r 2 a 1 n n 1 n r n 2 a where n is the length of the time series a is the scale expansion factor and n is the time shift factor torrence and compo 1998 despite the loss of temporal information global coherence intuitively expresses the wavelet coherence coefficient distribution of two series at different scales 2 3 3 narx neural network considering the difficulty of conventional conceptual physical and numerical based hydrological modelling data based black box artificial intelligence models are greatly suited to dynamical characteristic system predictions because of their simplicity and efficiency daliakopoulos et al 2005 rajaee et al 2019 there are various artificial intelligence techniques such as feedforward neural networks multilayer perceptron networks and recurrent neural networks among these the narx neural network lin et al 1996 was used in this study as it is a common tool for long term nonlinear time series analysis wunsch et al 2018 lin et al 1996 the narx network is a type of recurrent neural network that modelling the process based on lagged input and output variables and prediction errors guzman et al 2017 narx network has become popular for its performance in the prediction of nonlinear time series guzman et al 2017 wunsch et al 2021 the narx neural network generates a global feedback connection between the output and input layers and can keep information up to three times longer than conventional recurrent neural networks lin et al 1996 wunsch et al 2018 wunsch et al 2021 for small sample sizes the narx network can clearly outperform lstm which is widely known to perform well on sequential data wunsch et al 2021 lstm may perform better with a large sample size where deeper network can fully shows its strength shen 2018 wunsch et al 2021 however since the sample size here is not large enough the narx network was used in this study to predict the growth of vegetation the narx neural network can be mathematically presented as follows 10 y t f y t 1 y t d y x t 1 x t d x where f is the nonlinear function obtained by a learning algorithm y t and x t denote the model output and input of the network at time step t respectively d y and d x are the output and input memory orders respectively lin et al 1996 in this work the narx neural network was used to simulate the growth of vegetation at different diversion schedules and the target y t is the ndvi mean value in 1000 m ranges around the river channel downstream in the tarim river basin as precipitation in the mainstream of tarim river has little effect on either groundwater recharge or vegetation growth tao et al 2008 the volume of transferred water in the lower reaches is chosen as a predictor x t the time series were randomly divided into three parts 70 for training 15 for validation and 15 for testing in addition to converge faster and prevent local extremes from affecting training the input series were normalized to the range of 1 to 1 before training and then rescaled to the original values after training the narx network was trained with the levenberg marquardt optimization algorithm which combines the advantages of gauss newton and steepest descent methods wunsch et al 2018 there are many optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms ga ant colony algorithms aco and particle swarm algorithms pso to optimize the network structure however considering the number of parameters of shallow narx network are not large the number of hidden nodes and the transfer function of the narx model here were obtained by trial and error processes to relieve the burden of executing a long trial and error process some preliminary analyses were implemented to narrow down the range therefore cross correlation and autocorrelation statistics of the time series were used to determine the range of the input and output time delays rajaee et al 2019 and the empirical equation given by wanas et al 1998 i e hn log n where hn and n denote the number of maximum hidden neurons and the training sample numbers respectively was used to approximate the hidden neuron number in this work the optimal architecture of the narx model was obtained by 1 hidden layer 10 hidden neurons and 1 year delays the performance of the narx model is evaluated by the mean square error mse 11 mse 1 n t 1 n y t y t 2 where y t and y t are the observed value and estimated value at the time step t respectively n is the number of data points the mse value is low if the narx model performs well 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluctuation periodicities of natural and man controlled flow in this work wet dry or normal years were classified by using the degree of deviation of the year s stream from the long term mean annual stream for a given year if the deviation rate was larger than 15 it was a wet year if it was less than 15 it was a dry year the remaining years were normal years the stream in the upper tarim river basin naturally flows without human interference the monthly stream volume and deviation of the long term mean annual stream at alar station in upstream are shown in fig 4 a and b from january 1977 to december 2013 the upstream runoff diverged greatly at interannual scales for example the total water volume of upstream runoff at the alar transect was 69 59 10 8 m 3 in the extreme wet year 1978 and only 13 58 10 8 m 3 in the extreme dry year 2009 fig 4a hydrologic dry and wet events appeared alternately and each event often continued for several years during the study period fig 4b the continuous wps of the daily stream reflects the temporal variability of the stream in the time frequency domain for the free flowing stream upstream the continuous wps of the daily stream shows a periodicity of 12 month over the entire study period except for some extremely dry years fig 4c the wps of the upstream flow also showed periodicities from 0 125 to 1 month in each flood season i e from june to september the periodicities at the 3 to 6 month scales were obvious in the flood season of wet years fig 4c these high frequencies were mainly result from the heavy flow in flood season this was intuitive since the runoff in the upper tarim river is dominated by seasonal snow and glacier meltwater in headwater mountainous catchments duethmann et al 2015 and the volume of upstream rivers in the flood season accounts for 70 to 80 of that of the whole year fig 4a the flows through the qiwenkur river channel and old tarim river channel downstream of the tarim river are man controlled flows of ewtps since the ewtp initiated in 2000 water has been intermittently transferred from the daxihaizi reservoir downstream of the tarim river basin through a single river channel i e qiwenkur river or old tarim river channel or through double channels the monthly volume of diversion water in the old tarim river channel and qiwenkur river channel in the lower tarim river are shown in fig 5 a 5b until 2018 there were 19 water diversions with a total volume of 77 006 10 8 m 3 water transported fig 5a and b however the date duration and volume of each water conveyance were not fixed ewtp was mainly conducted in winter earlier in some wet years or not at all in extremely dry years watering duration ranged from 1 month to 10 months and most durations were 3 months fig 5a and b the watering volume ranged from 0 07 10 8 m 3 to 6 79 10 8 m 3 in the old tarim river channel and qiwenkur river channel the continuous wps of daily volume of diversion water showed periodicities from 0 125 to 1 month in each water diversion year fig 5c and d periodicities with bandwidths from 1 to 3 months 3 to 6 months and 12 months were also evident in large watering volumes or long watering duration years there was no periodicity in no flow years such as 2008 and 2009 compared with flow in the old tarim river channel flow in the qiwenkur river channel exhibited more monthly to yearly oscillations from 2001 to 2003 while monthly scale oscillations occurred less frequently from 2011 to 2018 fig 5b the continuous wps of natural and man controlled flow in upper and lower reaches reflects the spatiotemporal variability of surface flow in the tarim river basin low frequency yearly periodicity across the study period was captured in high flow years irrespective of upper or lower reaches figs 4 and 5 in this study we mainly focus on the intra annual variability and periodicity since the stream flow in the upper tarim river is dominated by seasonal snow and glacier melting in headwaters duethmann et al 2015 and the succession process of the riparian vegetation in the tarim river basin is highly dependent on the interplay between flood events and groundwater fluctuation wang et al 2018 indeed the lower reaches will still followed the same hydrological regularity as the upper reaches if they did not dry up however after the implementation of the ewtp the free flowing stream in the upper reaches was characterized by high frequency weekly to monthly periodicities during the flood season fig 4c while the completely man controlled discrete flow in the lower reaches exhibited high frequency weekly to monthly periodicities during winter or early spring rather than during the flood season fig 5c and d the spatiotemporal regularity change was mainly caused by the divergence of the water allocation mode between natural and human controlled flow unlike the free flowing runoff upstream that was dominated by seasonal snow and glacier meltwater in headwater mountainous catchments duethmann et al 2015 the human dominated diversion flow downstream was always implemented in winter instead of the flood season because a large amount of water is utilized for irrigation in the mainstream during the growing season i e march to october and low temperatures in winter can prevent excessive water consumption of evaporation during transportation chen et al 2010 although the dried up downstream became moist again by the diversion flow of ewtps the flow regimes of ewtps in lower tarim river basin are unnatural 3 2 periodic impacts of natural and man controlled flow on ecohydrological systems in this section the wps and wtc are employed to investigate the periodic responses of groundwater and riparian vegetation growth to free flowing rivers and man controlled flow the daily value of groundwater table natural and man controlled flow in the upper and lower reaches were used in the following analysis the wps of the groundwater table at different distances from the river channel reflects the spatiotemporal variability of the groundwater table fig 6 a and b in general periodicities from 0 125 to 1 month 3 to 6 months and 12 months were observed for the groundwater table irrespective of the upper and lower reaches of the tarim river basin fig 6a and b irrespective at the seasonal or inter annual time scales the groundwater table near the river channel exhibited more periodicities than the groundwater table far from the river channel fig 6a and b it is not difficult to understand this because compared with groundwater far from the river channel the groundwater near the river channel is relatively susceptible to water recharge and evaporative loss and transpiration loss chen et al 2010 furthermore in the completely man controlled lower reaches compared with the old yinsu transect of the old tarim river channel the water table in the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel exhibited fewer oscillations from 2010 to 2018 fig 6a and b because the old tarim river channel implemented water conveyance more frequently than the qiwenkur river channel from 2010 to 2018 fig 5 the wtc coefficient between the flow and groundwater table reflects the intrinsic resonance of water flow with groundwater in time and frequency domains fig 6c and d the larger the coefficient is the stronger the correlation between water flow and groundwater is irrespective of upper or lower reaches the wtc between water flow and the groundwater table was also consistent with a greater correlation in the location near the river channel while the far location exhibited a lower correlation fig 6c and d this is intuitive since increases in groundwater depth near the river course are relatively immediate to water recharge while the groundwater depth far from the river course is buffered by thicker soil and is less susceptible to water recharge tao et al 2008 consistent with results of the continuous wps of natural and man controlled flow in upper and lower reaches figs 4 and 5 the groundwater table at the alar transect of the free flowing upstream exhibited periodicities of 0 125 to 6 months in the flood season of each year while the groundwater table at the yinsu and old yinsu transects of the man controlled downstream showed fewer periodicities and mainly occurred in winter fig 6a and b similarly the high frequency weekly to monthly correlations between water flow and the groundwater table were intermittent in general and occurred in the flood season in the free flowing upper stream while they occurred in the winter in human controlled downstream fig 6c and d this result is intuitive since precipitation is extremely scarce and leakage from natural runoff and transfers water of ewtps is the dominant process for groundwater recharge in the upper and lower reaches of the tarim river basin respectively hao et al 2010 however approximately 80 of annual runoff in the free flowing upstream is occurs in the period from june to september tao et al 2011 duethmann et al 2015 while diversion flow of ewtps in the downstream is usually implemented in winter chen et al 2010 this divergence played an important role in the inconsistent groundwater fluctuation cycle between the upper and lower tarim river basin therefore it can be concluded that although ewtps in the lower reaches of the tarim river played an important role in recharging groundwater and lifting the water table tao et al 2008 the ewtps also caused unnatural fluctuating characteristics of groundwater in downstream due to their unnatural flow regimes the ndvi is a standardized way to measure healthy vegetation and it reflects the vegetation density and changes in plant health over time the ndvi with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the analysis in general ndvi in each transect shows an increasing trend in the period from january to july while shows decreasing trend in the period from to july to december fig 7 a compared with ndvi in the upper reaches ndvi was lower in the lower reaches and mainly ranges from 0 06 to 0 24 fig 7a ndvi at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect in the downstream river channel were clearly lower in the period from 2008 to 2011 since no water was delivered in 2007 2009 while higher in the period from 2006 to 2007 and 2017 to 2018 as the watering volume and duration were both higher in previous years figs 5 and 7a overall ndvi in the downstream exhibits an increasing trend over 2000 to 2018 suggesting that the ewtp indeed helped vegetation recovery as they lifted the water table to meet natural vegetation water demand tao et al 2008 notably consistent with other researches hao and li 2014 fu et al 2021 a time lag effect may exists between the vegetation growth and ewtp for example ndvi at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect in the downstream were both higher in year 2007 but ewtps were only implemented in previous years and no water was imported in this year figs 5 and 7a in addition ndvi was higher in year 2014 than in year 2015 at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect while the ewtp was not implemented in 2014 and reactivated in 2015 figs 5 and 7a these results suggested that approximately 1 year lag may exists between ewtps and vegetation growth in the lower tarim river fig 7b presents the wps of the ndvi in 1000 m ranges around the river channel upstream and downstream of the tarim river the continuous wps of the ndvi reflects the spatiotemporal variability in riparian vegetation density and health fig 7b the ndvi with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the following analysis due to temporal resolution limitations of the ndvi data variability at weekly to monthly scales cannot be observed however compared with the variability at weekly to monthly timescales the variability of the ndvi at seasonal and inter annual scales is of most interest for the vegetation recovery of ewtps since it exhibits a general trend of vegetation density and health from 2000 to 2018 the wps of the ndvi within 1000 m of the river channel exhibited 1 to 6 month and 12 month periodicities in the upper and lower reaches of the tarim river fig 7b however a periodicity of 12 months was observed continuously for the ndvi in the alar transect of the free flowing upper reaches and intermittently in the yinsu and old yinsu transects in the human controlled lower reaches fig 7b for example the periodicity of ndvi at the old yinsu transect and yinsu transect in the downstream river channel were both interrupted in the period from 2008 to 2011 this is intuitive since no water was delivered in 2007 2009 fig 5 and there is almost no other form of water supply except ewtp tao et al 2008 the wtc coefficient between the surface water groundwater and the ndvi reflects the intrinsic resonance of the vegetation growth with surface water and groundwater in time and frequency domain fig 7c and d the ndvi groundwater table natural and man controlled flow with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the following analysis both the wtc between the surface water groundwater table and ndvi within 1000 m distances of the riverbank showed a significant correlation at the 1 to 6 month and 12 month scales fig 7c and d the annual scale variation revealed the alternately increasing and decreasing trend of the correlation in different years while the seasonal scale variation revealed the correlation changes within a year on inter annual time scales consistent with the result of the continuous wps of ndvi fig 7b both the wtc between the river flow groundwater table and ndvi within 1000 m distances of the river channel in the upper reaches had a continuously strong correlation at the 12 month scale while the correlation in the lower reaches had an apparent interruption due to several consecutive years of no ewtp fig 7c and d on seasonal scales compared with that in the free flowing upstream both the wtc between the surface water groundwater table and ndvi in the human controlled downstream areas exhibited fewer and fragmentary correlations at the 1 to 6 month periodicities fig 7c and d this is intuitive since at seasonal scales the flood season upstream coincided more with the seed ripening and dispersal periods of native vegetation such as populus euphratica tamarix ramosissima tamarix hispida and alhagi sparsifolia cheng et al 2007 chen et al 2010 high frequency fluctuations in natural streams in the flood season have a profound effect on the composition structure and spatial distribution pattern of riparian forests cheng et al 2007 riis and hawes 2002 the overbank water caused by flood events will assist the spreading germinating and natural regeneration of seeds along water channel margins cheng et al 2007 furthermore since the seedlings of some drought and salinity resistant trees and shrubs such as populus euphratica are generally not drought or salinity tolerant wang et al 2018 floods could supply soil water effectively and reduce soil salinity to maintain the normal growth of seedlings through flood irrigation and infiltration cheng et al 2007 however the diversion time of etwps in the tarim river basin is always during winter and the lack of high frequency fluctuations in the flood season hampers long term riparian forest development in the lower reaches of the tarim river basin this result is consistent with the research by tao et al 2008 and chen et al 2010 who found that some degraded populus euphratica was rejuvenated after water conveyance but the quantitative characteristics and spatial distribution of populus euphratica remained almost unchanged although some herbaceous vegetation drought resistant trees and shrubs regrew along the river channel of the lower reaches after water conveyance since the correlations among the diversion flow of ewtps groundwater table and ndvi in the human controlled downstream of the tarim river basin were large at 12 month and 6 month time scales fig 7c and d the time lags between the diversion flow of ewtps groundwater table and ndvi were calculated at these scales through xwt table 1 from table 1 both the groundwater behavior and vegetation growth are expected to be influenced by antecedent surface water the ndvi at the old yinsu and yinsu transects in the downstream river channel approximately lagged diversion flow of ewtps by 10 months with a 0 6 month deviation at 12 month timescales and 3 to 3 9 months with a 0 1 to 0 3 month deviation at 6 month timescales table 1 this result was consistent with the previous result that a time lag effect is exists between the vegetation growth and ewtp fig 7a in general the sum of the time difference between the diversion flow and groundwater table and the time difference between the groundwater table and ndvi was approximately the time difference between the diversion water and ndvi table 1 this result is intuitive since the riparian ecosystems in the mainstream arid tarim river basin are groundwater dependent terrestrial ecosystems wang et al 2011 while the ewtp controls the downstream groundwater recharge without other interference like precipitation and pumping tao et al 2011 the diversion flow of ewtps in the lower tarim river basin major contains signals at seasonal and inter annual scales fig 5 identify the time lags between surface flow groundwater and vegetation may help to obtain more information about the surface flow groundwater vegetation interactions at specific frequencies the quantified timing of vegetation responses to ewtp at different frequencies may help to design the duration of water diversion the gccs between the ndvi groundwater table and surface water reflect the correlation of each other in the frequency domain fig 8 the ndvi groundwater table natural and man controlled flow with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the analysis in the human controlled downstream the gccs between the ndvi and diversion flow were relatively consistent with higher gccs in the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel than in the old yinsu transect of the old tarim river channel from 2000 to 2013 fig 8a the divergence of gccs between the ndvi and the groundwater table was not significant in the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel or in the old yinsu transect of the old tarim river channel from 2013 to 2018 fig 8b because both the water volume and duration were larger in the qiwenkur river channel than that in the old tarim river channel in the period from 2000 to 2013 while the water volume and duration in the two river channels were almost the same in the period from 2013 to 2018 fig 5 from the gccs between the ndvi and waterflow or groundwater table there was an apparent separation in gccs between natural flow and human controlled flow with apparently high gccs in the free flowing upstream area irrespective at the seasonal or inter annual scales fig 8 this result is intuitive since the recharge from the stream and groundwater table upstream are relatively immediate to the vegetation water demand while the recharge from the ewtp in the downstream are usually in winter and not immediate chen et al 2010 ewtp plays an important role in ecosystem rehabilitation in arid regions however most ewtps were implemented at microhabitat scale and usually focus on object specific and site specific restoration polvi et al 2020 tao et al 2008 or have primarily implemented only simple flow recommendations on the basis of single flow events chen and olden 2017 as a catchment scale ecosystem rehabilitation megaproject which has operated over 20 years ewtp in tarim river basin in northwest china is representative around the globe shumilova et al 2018 from the above analysis in tarim river basin this study provides a new insight of the relationships between ewtps and ecohydrological processes from the periodic perspective although ewtp plays a key role in lifting the groundwater level to meet the water demand of vegetation tao et al 2008 its unnatural regimes also changes the hydrological fluctuation cycle of the water receiving areas fig 6 regions where groundwater is mainly fed by ewtps such as tarim river basin heihe river basin and shiyang river basin in northwest china and aral sea basin in central asia should also pay more attention to the flow regimes of ewtp in water resources management changes in dominant frequencies in the surface flow can have strong impacts on vegetation communities palmer and ruhi 2019 for example fluctuations at seasonal time scales directly influence annual species vegetation lifecycle and perennial species must adapt the entire conditions proposed by seasonal fluctuations to occupy a site during a growing season keddy and reznicek 1986 camporeale and ridolfi 2006 jansson et al 2000 while in where fluctuation is predominantly among a period at years or decades time scales some species might only exist as buried seeds and others are survive in current conditions on a relatively long term basis riis and hawes 2002 from an ecological standpoint excessive or not enough stream fluctuations would result in a decline of biodiversity huston 1994 flow variability have been critical drivers in regulating biodiversity and ecosystem functioning palmer and ruhi 2019 sabo et al 2017 long term unstable flow regimes of ewtps are not conducive to stable vegetation recovery and needs to be improved at inter annual scales the maintenance of reasonable groundwater level to which vegetation can growth normally need persistent water delivery at seasonal timescales high frequency fluctuations in flood season will assist the spreading germinating and natural regeneration of the seeds and have a profound effect on the composition structure and spatial distribution pattern of riparian forests cheng et al 2007 riis and hawes 2002 the role of flow regimes of ewtp in dryland ecosystem restoration has been largely underestimated even if the trial water release program became a permanent river management practice in many regions like tarim river basin heihe river basin and shiyang river basin in northwest china and aral sea basin in central asia a focus on future ewtp restoration should shift the conversation from how much water does the ecological system need to when does the ecosystem need it the most and when can we transfer it 3 3 optimization and simulation of diversion schedules in this section three diversion schedules are proposed to improve the ecosystem restoration efficiency of ewtps in the tarim river table 2 one diversion schedule is a mimicry of historical flow which follows the natural flow regimes two diversion schedules are designed flows that are based on the water demand of natural vegetation growth then the narx neural network model was used to predict the restoration effects under different diversion schedules by simulating the nonlinear function of diversion water and its corresponding ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges of the riverbank diversion schedule a mimics the natural runoff in the free flowing upstream of tarim river basin which follows the same hydrologic regularity of the stream i e continuously transferred water and the volume of water conveyed in the flood season accounted for 70 to 80 of the water of the whole year table 2 on the other hand considering the ecological water demand of riparian vegetation over the growing season accounted for 87 of the whole year s total vegetation water demand ye et al 2010 the water delivery schedule could be targeted according to the water demand of vegetation growth to reduce water consumption thus schedules b and c were designed based on the ecological water demand of natural vegetation and the diversion ratios of schedules b and c were calculated by the water demand in a specific month divided by the total water demand in the growth season table 2 the diversion times of schedules b and c were divided based on the time difference between the ndvi and diversion water since the correlation between the ewtp and ndvi in the human controlled lower tarim river was large at the 12 month and 6 month timescales fig 7b the time lag between the ewtp and ndvi in the human controlled downstream region at these two periodicities was selected to design the water delivery scheme schedule b was designed to transfer water from may to december to satisfy the ecological water demand of riparian vegetation in the growing season since the ndvi lagged behind the water diversion by 10 months at a 12 month periodicity table 2 schedule c was designed to transfer water from december to june since the ndvi lagged behind the water transfer by 4 months at a 6 month periodicity table 2 considering that the ecological water demand of native vegetation was calculated by the area of vegetation at a certain groundwater depth ye et al 2010 instead of providing a specific diversion water volume the study provides only a diversion ratio by using the water delivery ratio table 2 the specific monthly diversion volume could be calculated based on the vegetation water demand in that year to verify the validity of these diversion schemes as mentioned before a narx neural network was used to predict the riparian vegetation growth under the designed diversion schedules the ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges around the river channel downstream was the target the volume of transferred water in the lower reaches was chosen as the predictor the ndvi and volume of transferred water with 16 day temporal resolution were used in the analysis the narx neural network model was trained validated and tested with realistic water diversion conditions and its realistic mean ndvi value within 1000 m ranged around the yinsu transect in the qiwenkur river channel from 2000 to 2013 fig 9 then water management schedules a b and c were implemented from 2014 to 2016 fig 10 a1 a3 and the corresponding ndvi mean values within 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect of the qiwenkur river channel downstream were predicted through the calibrated narx neural network model fig 10b1 b3 to ensure fair competition the annual total transfer water volume of the reallocated scheme was equal to reality the original realistic ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect from 2014 to 2016 were used as the control group dataset the years 2014 to 2016 were hydrologically arid normal and wet years respectively and the gap in the annual total volume of transferred water was wide fig 10a1 a3 the narx model performs satisfactorily with the mse value less than 0 009 in testing dataset and is able to capture the complex trending changes in ndvi affected by the ewtp fig 9b through the calibrated narx neural network model the predicted ndvi mean value within 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect in the period from 2014 to 2016 fluctuated seasonally and reached a maximum in the growing season fig 10b1 b3 although the annual volumes of transferred water were equal the simulated ndvi was higher in all schemes than the original ndvi and the relative improvement in the ndvi was larger in each scheme fig 10c1 c3 especially in schedules b and c their simulated results could yield up to 40 increase in the ndvi mean value in 1000 m ranges around river channel relative to the original value fig 10c1 c3 the simulated ndvi results and their improvement rates resulted in schedules a b and c fig 10b1 c3 that showed that under constant water volume rational allocation of water conveyance was indeed capable of improving vegetation recovery performance fig 10d1 d3 shows the wtc between transferred water and the ndvi mean value in 1000 m ranges around the yinsu transect under different schemes the wtc between the ndvi and diversion water of these ewtp diversion schemes exhibited fewer high frequency relations and continuous low frequency correlations fig 10d1 d3 compared with schedule a schedules b and c performed better irrespective of the improved magnitude or duration fig 10c1 c3 a mimicry of historical flow scheme and two designed flow schemes were proposed to improve ecosystem restoration it is intuitive that mimicking the natural stream flow rhythm has a better performance than the current water delivery scheme since the native vegetation are adapted to the flow regimes of nature stream chen and olden 2017 palmer and ruhi 2019 however the lower reaches of the endorheic tarim river basin dry up at most times and can ensure only intermittent water conveyance because of the increasing water demand conflicts between the upper middle reaches and lower reaches tao et el 2008 furthermore climate change is intensifying the conflict between water supply and demand as droughts increase in both frequency and severity in many regions of the world yuan et al 2019 madadgar and moradkhani 2013 innovative strategies are needed to efficiently restore degraded ecosystems with a limited water supply the simulated ndvi results in schemes b and c illustrate that instead of continuously transferring water like natural stream constructing an ecological water demand of vegetation dominated new flow regimes of ewtp could also improve vegetation recovery and can perform better than natural flow regimes fig 10 because under limited water resources the discrete water transfer schedule that based on vegetation growth water demand could use water more efficiently and reduce water consumptions like evaporation and infiltration these results provide a quantitative illustration that under limited water resources designed flows can effectively improve vegetation recovery in ewtps as a representative ewtp around the world the ewtp for the tarim river successful restored the severely degraded ecosystem however the recovery of the riparian zone in the lower reaches of the tarim river started to slow down and remained over a narrower width even if the ewtp was carried out for 20 years bao et al 2017 glenn et al 2017 many studies have proposed that the transfer scheme of the ewtp of the tarim river basin is unreasonable bao et al 2017 tao et al 2008 chen et al 2010 ye et al 2010 yang et al 2018 and chen et al 2008 suggested that the duration of water transportation should be divided into two stages the first stage involves raising the groundwater table during periods with abundant water and less evaporation for the growth of plants while the period in the second stage should be consistent with the seed falling time of riparian plants chen et al 2008 yang et al 2018 however applicable methodologies for the evaluation and optimazition of ewtp are still lacking the wavelet based method proposed in this paper is designed to integrate the utility of wps and wtc with variability detection and diversion time calculation in evaluating and optimizing the water diversion scheme of ewtps on the evaluation aspect irrespective nature stream or diversion flow of ewtps irregular surface water fluctuations possess signals of different amplitudes and frequencies fig 4c fig 5c and d the role of flow regularity in dryland ecosystem restoration has been largely underestimated even if the trial water release program became a permanent river management practice long term unstable regularity may induce frequent extinctions of some riparian vegetation populations and they need to iteratively establish new populations to rescue the decreasing populations camporeale and ridolfi 2006 jansson et al 2000 this study proves that wavelet analysis can be used to identify dominant frequencies in the diversion flow of ewtp fig 5 to assess correlations between ewtp groundwater and the growth of vegetation in a certain frequency band figs 6 8 and to quantify time lags between two time series in multiple frequencies table 1 wavelet analysis grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2017 provide a broad insight into the evaluation of the ecohydrological restoration project on the optimization aspect this study provides an important basis for designing flow regimes of ewtp under limited water resources first the diversion time of ewtp can be quantitatively divided based on the time lags between transferring water and the ndvi at timescales with strong correlations second the volume of monthly diversion water can be allocated based on the ratio of monthly ecological water demand of vegetation in fact wavelet analysis should be a requisite element for designing and assessing the strategies of ewtps to increase the restoration effects the wavelet based method proposed in this paper can serve as a reference for decision making in water resources management and sustainable ecological development of ewtps in the arid and semiarid regions such as tarim river basin heihe river basin and shiyang river basin of china tao et al 2008 cheng et al 2014 chunyu et al 2019 oldman river and st mary river of canada rood et al 1998 rood and mahoney 2000 lower truckee river middle truckee river and colorado river delta of usa rood et al 2003 2005 shafroth et al 2017 the middle ebro river gonzález et al 2010 of spain and five future ewtps three in north america one in africa and one in asia however due to the lack of vegetation community surveys in field data a clear understanding of the periodic impact of ewtp on different native species is still insufficient the responses of different species to periodic changes in ewtp may be different for example fluctuations at seasonal timescales directly influence the annual species vegetation lifecycle and perennial species must adapt to the entire conditions proposed by seasonal fluctuations to occupy a site during a growing season keddy and reznicek 1986 in areas where fluctuation predominantly occurs within a period with timescales of years or decades some species might exist only as buried seeds and others survive under current conditions on a relatively long term basis riis and hawes 2002 the dominant plant species may change after long term unnatural water delivery moreover in water receiving areas that contain other water supplies such as surface runoff or springs periodic interference and superposition of different water source signals may lead to a more complex periodic response of groundwater and vegetation and deserves further study more research to improve regional water management and ecosystem restoration is expected in future studies 4 conclusions ewtps have become common forms of ecosystem restoration in recent years we evaluated the hydrological regimes of restoration flow and its periodic impact on ecohydrological systems using the wavelet power spectrum for the ewtp of the endorheic tarim river basin china we reported that compared with the free flowing stream in the upper tarim river the water transferred downstream in the tarim river exhibited weekly to monthly periodicities in the winter of each year rather than in the flood season unlike the free flowing runoff upstream that is dominated by seasonal snow and glacier meltwater in headwater mountainous catchments the human dominated diversion flow downstream is always implemented in winter this divergence induced an unsynchronized fluctuation cycle of groundwater in the upper and lower tarim river basin regions at weekly to monthly timescales the groundwater in the human controlled lower reaches exhibited strong coherence with restoration flow in winter while the groundwater in the free flowing upper reaches exhibited strong coherence with water flow in the flood season coherence between the ndvi and transferred water was observed intermittently at the inter annual scale in the human controlled lower tarim river basin ewtps indeed help native vegetation growth but unstable inter annual water conveyance leads to unstable vegetation recovery native riparian vegetation downstream exhibits intermittent yearly periodicities with no periodicity in no flow years in addition the seasonally fluctuating period of water transfer was not coincident with the growing rhythm of riparian vegetation such as seed ripening and dispersal an inter annual stable transfer regularity that is consistent with native riparian species growth is needed for ewtps from a long term perspective this result suggests that changes in flow regimes of ewtps alter the resonance of restoration flow and riparian vegetation and groundwater a focus on ewtps should shift the conversation from how much water does ecosystem restoration need to when does the ecosystem need water the most and when can we transfer it two designed flow diversion schedules based on the water demand of natural vegetation and the time lags between the transferred water and ndvi at 12 month and 6 month timescales and one natural flow mimicry diversion schedule were proposed to improve ecosystem restoration through the narx neural network the predicted ndvi of these optimized diversion schedules indicated significant opportunities to improve native riparian ecosystem restoration under limited water resources the predicted benefits of designed flow surpassed those generated by original and natural flow while keeping the total water volume constant managing the required flow variability component would lead to greater efficiency in ecosystem restoration and water resource utilization which is particularly important in water scarce drylands wavelet analysis and artificial neural networks provide new insights into translating the periodic influence of human dominated hydrological dynamics to restoration practices and designing major flow variability components to improve ecosystem restoration in ewtps future ewtps should be focused on identifying the vegetation growth rhythm of water receiving areas and rationally quantifying diversion schemes to improve

3444,several versions of the complementary relationship cr between actual regional evaporation and apparent potential evaporation have recently been proposed few studies have compared multiple cr versions side by side using datasets spanning various climates and land surfaces filling this lack is one purpose of this project it also investigates how various cr versions respond to changes in spatial and temporal averaging this study uses multiple years of data from seven eddy covariance flux stations in australia representing a wide range of biomes along with global era5 reanalysis data products daily and monthly averages were used for both datasets and the australian observations also used weekly and yearly averages the era5 data represent a scale of about 30 km much larger than the scale represented by the flux station data a set of five questions regarding the impact of spatial and temporal scaling on cr parameter values and performance are asked and assessed using the two datasets four recent cr versions are considered in answering the questions due to important differences between fluxnet and era5 data questions regarding temporal scaling were answered with greater confidence than those regarding spatial scaling with these data rescaled versions of the cr performed best overall keywords evaporation scaling potential evaporation complementary relationship 1 introduction the complementary relationship cr bouchet 1963 between actual regional evaporation or latent heat flux le and apparent potential evaporation evaporation under actual radiation temperature humidity and wind conditions but with a saturated surface le p has taken many forms over the years brutsaert 1982 2005 in all of them the main idea is that the humidity of the atmospheric boundary layer abl over a region will reflect the rate of humidity entering the abl through surface evaporation such that surfaces with a high evaporation rate tend to have high humidity and those with low evaporation rates tend to have low humidity recently brutsaert 2015 introduced the concept of a generalized complementary relationship based on physical analysis of the saturated and desiccated regional surface boundary conditions since then new versions of the cr adapted from brutsaert s 2015 work have appeared in the literature including those by han and tian 2018 2020 crago et al 2016 and szilagyi et al 2016 2017 while each of these cr versions has undergone a validation process a more comprehensive side by side comparison of these versions under a range of climate and land surface conditions is needed the primary goal of this study however is to investigate how changes in temporal averaging periods and spatial averaging scales affects each of the cr versions it is clear that spatial and temporal scaling play an important role in the physical processes behind the cr so that slightly different formulations are appropriate for different spatial and temporal scales for example crago et al 2016 and szilagyi et al 2016 both used versions of the rescaled cr proposed by crago et al 2016 but fit the data with different functional forms szilagyi et al 2017 and han and tian 2020 have speculated that these scaling issues could be important if so then different data sets might have different behavior depending on their spatial and temporal scales resulting in different cr versions for the different scales an understanding of how cr models behave at various spatial and temporal scales is essential for the reliable and routine application of global estimates of evaporation using a cr model the feasibility of global estimates using cr models has been clearly established as has the ability of these models to illuminate global spatial and temporal evaporation trends brutsaert et al 2020 ma et al 2021 a key assumption behind the cr is that the atmosphere is well adjusted to the evaporation rate of the underlying surface but many of the forcing variables change considerably over the diurnal cycle furthermore atmospheric stability and the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer abl also have a pronounced diurnal cycle e g stull 1988 brutsaert 2005 it might be reasonable to assume that the abl is well adjusted to the underlying surface for a day as a whole e g brutsaert 2015 but many of the equations that make up the cr are non linear so it is not entirely clear what role different averaging periods might have with respect to spatial averaging monin obukhov similarity theory requires a homogeneous surface upwind of a measurement for a sufficient fetch e g stull 1988 thus flux measurement sites should ideally be carefully chosen to have sufficient fetch in the direction of the prevailing wind so that the measured fluxes represent a fairly clearly defined surface area however in hilly terrain or regions with complex patterns of vegetation cover it is not always clear how to choose a measurement site representative of the varied regional surface since many natural and managed landscapes have these complex patterns point measurements of latent heat fluxes typically representative of footprints over length scales of order 102 to 103 m may not be representative over a larger region such as a watershed or a cell in a numerical atmospheric model this study is a preliminary assessment of five questions regarding the cr applied at different spatial and temporal scales 1 as either the spatial or temporal scale increases will the averaging process reduce the effect of extreme values so that cr model errors decrease 2 as the temporal scale increases will the range of data values be compressed by the averaging process so that cr model estimates of evaporation also have a compressed range 3 as spatial scales increase will the impact of small scale advection due to inhomogeneous surfaces decrease 4 do the cr versions that provide the best estimates of dimensionless evaporation evaporation divided by apparent potential evaporation also provide the best predictions of dimensional actual evaporation 5 are there cr versions that perform particularly well and if so are there characteristics that these specific cr versions have in common in order to address these questions data derived from four temporal averaging periods daily weekly monthly and yearly and two different spatial scales will be used to estimate actual evaporation using four different cr formulations versions the different spatial scales will be obtained by using eddy covariance fluxes from surface stations along side global reanalysis data and temporal scales will be obtained through different averaging periods trends of parameter values e g the priestley taylor 1972 parameter α and model performance statistics with different averaging periods and areas will be analyzed to address the five questions 2 materials and methods an overview of the cr the underlying equations and several recent cr formulations will be presented first and then the data sources will be discussed 2 1 equations the land surface energy budget can be written brutsaert 1982 2005 1 r n g h l e where r n is the net radiation input g is

mcilroy 1961 priestley and taylor 1972 noted that even for very large saturated surfaces the air rarely reaches saturation so they introduced α 1 to account for warm dry advection 7 le pt α le e priestley and taylor 1972 found an average of α 1 26 from a number of large wet surfaces originally priestley and taylor 1972 δ in eq 10 was taken to be the slope de dt evaluated at the wet environment air temperature t wa szilagyi and jozsa 2008 argued that t wa is usually close to the wet surface temperature t ws szilagyi and schepers 2014 demonstrated that t ws remains nearly constant in space and time for a wet surface independent of areal extent within a drying region if the wind speed and r n g have little variability this way t ws can be found for a small wet patch by setting

surface having a regional extent allowing it to influence the air temperature over it via surface cooling in this study versions of equilibrium evaporation 6 will make use of δ calculated at t ws and at t a which will be denoted δ t ws and δ t a respectively the cr versions considered herein find their root in the work of brutsaert 2015 he developed a generalized complementary relationship given by 9 y b 2 x 2 x 3 where x le w le p y le le p y b is an estimate of y le w is the evaporation rate of a large saturated surface usually taken to be le pt see brutsaert and stricker 1979 and le p is the apparent potential evaporation rate given by 2 the functional form of 9 is the simplest polynomial that can satisfy the four boundary conditions proposed by brutsaert 2015 namely x 0 at y 0 x 1 at y 1 dy dx 0 at y 0 and dy dx 1 at y 1 note that all the cr versions tested here are formulated in dimensionless form that is in terms of x and y crago et al 2016 noted that y 0 does not imply x 0 because even for a completely dry region le p cannot go to infinity see 2 they suggested that y 0 at xmin le w le max where le max is the value of le p expected for a desiccated regional surface since le p is found with 2 this same equation should also be used to estimate le max following szilagyi et al 2016 le max is defined using 2 where e a 0 e t a is replaced by e t dry δ is replaced by δ d e dt evaluated at t dry and t dry t a e a γ thus x min is found from le pt divided by this le max thus x does not range from 0 to 1 but only from x min to 1 crago et al 2016 suggested rescaling x to x 10 x x x min 1 x min which does range from 0 to 1 crago et al 2016 suggested the cr could be represented as 11 y x since le max is different for each data point so is x min so that data plotted on an x y graph are rearranged horizontally when plotted on an x y plot szilagyi et al 2016 suggested the use of 9 with x replaced by x from 10 combining the boundary conditions proposed by brutsaert 2015 with the rescaling of 10 han and tian 2018 proposed a sigmoid shaped curve in x y space 12 y ht 1 1 m x max x x x min n where 13 n 4 α 1 1 b ht x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 x max x min and 14 x 0 5 0 5 1 b ht α 1 1 b ht with b ht a second model parameter and 15 m x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 n in practice han and tian 2018 2020 recommend x min 0 and x max 1 their parameter α is loosely related to the priestley taylor parameter but it primarily establishes the slope of the sigmoid curve at the center of the graph both α and b ht must be specified or calibrated equation 12 is explicitly based on the two terms of penman s equation so in their model x is taken as le e ta le pen and y is le le pen the focus of this study is on the different broader versions of the cr i e strategies for finding y

variable x 10 to replace x in 9 giving estimates x b and han and tian s 2018 method based on equations 12 15 giving estimates y ht research regarding the cr is evolving rapidly each of the cr versions presented here has been the subject of debate in the literature e g see ma and zhang 2017 ma and szilagyi 2019 szilagyi and crago 2019 han and tian 2020 liu et al 2020 crago et al 2017 crago et al 2020a crago et al 2020b crago et al 2021 thus there is a need for studies testing multiple versions of the cr with a variety of datasets from a variety of sites around the world this project is intended to partly fill this gap these four versions and the notation used in defining them are found in table 1 dimensional evaporation le x le b le xb and le ht in w m 2 is derived from dimensionless evaporation x y b x b and y ht respectively by multiplying the dimensionless rate by le pen reference values will be described in the next section but dimensional reference evaporation values are denoted le r and dimensionless values are denoted y r table 1 also indicates which temperature is used to calculate δ in 6 for each version 2 2 data sources data from two sources were used in this study as described below 2 2 1 fluxnet data from seven fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 sites in australia see crago and qualls 2018 for details of the sites were used here these eddy covariance flux stations measured net radiation sensible heat flux and latent heat flux ground heat flux atmospheric pressure air temperature vapor pressure deficit wind speed and friction velocity crago and qualls 2018 used the friction velocity values to find an optimum value of z 0 for each site these are the values used here the sites ranged from tropical to temporal arid to humid and included a large seasonal wetland a tropical savannah and tall temporal forests daily weekly monthly and yearly average data products are available from fluxnet http fluxnet fluxdata org the energy budget closure problem was resolved by forcing the measured bowen ratio to hold and finding reference values of h r and le r that satisfy the energy budget 1 because averaging periods up to a year were used gap filling techniques provided by fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 were applied 2 2 2 era5 era5 is a reanalysis product produced by ecmwf hersbach et al 2020 it is the successor to era interim dee et al 2011 reanalysis data products combine observations e g radar satellite and station data and model analysis to arrive at the most probable state of the atmosphere era5 data are on a 30 km grid covering the globe a land sea mask is available to select only land surfaces in this study land surfaces are those with 99 9 land within the grid cell era5 data can be downloaded from ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu monthly average data from 2017 and 2018 for the odd numbered months january march etc were downloaded from ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu search text era5 type dataset as were hourly data from january 1 april 1 july 1 and october 1 in 1999 which were used to find daily average values for these four days downloaded data include latent and sensible heat fluxes 2 m air temperature 10 m wind speed 2 m dewpoint temperature z 0 and a land sea mask layer for each cell across the globe available energy was taken to be the same as the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes 3 calculations section 3 1 will describe calculations and assumptions for the eddy covariance data and section 3 2 will describe them for the era5 data 3 1 calculations for flux station data separate data files are provided by fluxnet for daily weekly monthly and yearly averaging times in each averaging periods were removed for which h 0 le 0 or r n g 0 t a 0 or for times when no data were available for any of the mentioned variables or for pressure or vapor pressure deficit data with time averaged wind speeds 1 m s 1 were omitted because there may be poor connection between the state of the land surface and the lower atmosphere when turbulence is weak or absent violating a basic assumption of the cr e g crago and qualls 2018 under such conditions le is likely small so impact of the removal of these data points is minimal it was assumed that d0 z0 4 8 and z 0v z 0 15 c f brutsaert 1982 2005 zhang et al 2017 the momentum roughness length was taken as the log average value of z 0 found by crago and qualls 2018 for each site from the measured values of u optimal parameter values α and for 12 b ht were those values that minimized root mean square error rmse between estimates and reference values reference values for dimensionless evaporation rates were found using y le r le pen parameters were fit using a trial and error procedure note that the han and tian formulation 12 15 required fitting of two parameters since both parameters have significant effects on the rmse satisfactory results came from searching the entire range of parameter values to find optimal parameters 3 2 calculations for era5 data technical documentation on the ecmwf website https www ecmwf int en publications ifs documentation ifs documentation cy41r2 part iv physical processes explains that surface air temperatures wind speeds are located at a height of z 2 m 10 m z 0 should be 0 03 m or the given z 0 for the cell whichever is less and z 0v should be 1 10 of the resulting z 0 displacement height is ignored in this procedure for calibration of parameter values a procedure similar to the one described above for the flux station data was used however with 1 4 million land cells available during the 12 months calibration was streamlined by using a random sample drawn without replacement of 100 000 cells drawn from all twelve months of data a sample of 100 000 daily cell values was also drawn from the four days in 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 results the results are presented graphically in figs 1 14 statistics relating estimates to reference values are provided inside the graphs statistics include rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error nse nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 r correlation coefficient and the slope and intercept of the linear regression between model and reference values figs 1 through 14 all suggest that all four cr versions adequately estimate latent heat fluxes at these sites at daily weekly monthly and yearly time scales this is the case with flux station as well era5 reanalysis data section 4 2 will discuss questions 1 through 5 in turn 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 discussion of question 1 question 1 asks whether greater spatial and temporal averaging will result in smaller model errors this can be addressed by looking at panels a and b of both figs 13 and 14 in both figures the left column panels a c and e considers dimensionless evaporation le le p and the right column panels b d and f considers actual dimensional evaporation le the top rows consider rmse the second rows consider α and the third rows consider correlation coefficient r panels a and b of figs 13 and 14 show that all the versions have a clear trend towards lower rmse with longer averaging times moving from daily to weekly fig 13 panel a y b y ht and e ht have a slight increase in rmse with the flux station data but each of these versions still has a clear trend of decreasing rmse overall mcmahon et al 2013 note that evaporation methods using potential evaporation tend to work best with averaging times around a month their observation is consistent with this result although there is continued improvement from monthly to yearly rmse values fig 13 evaluation of changes in rmse with increasing spatial scale requires comparison of era5 and flux station results this direct comparison is not straightforward while reanalysis data might often be considered more accurate than either model results or measurements alone e g szilagyi et al 2014 the era interim the predecessor data product to era5 see dee et al 2011 land surface evaporation rates compared more poorly with the long term water balance estimate of evaporation precipitation minus streamflow for huc 6 and huc 8 watersheds in the contiguous united states than one of the cr methods ma and szilagyi 2019 specifically they compared a version related to the present e xb formulation to multiple other models and data products including the era interim gridded evaporation product they found that era interim tended to systematically overestimate the water balance based evaporation estimates while the cr based approach had the lowest rmse and smallest relative bias of all the models or products they tested ma et al 2019 noted similar problems with era interim evaporation estimates in china in ma and szilagyi 2019 and ma et al 2019 the input variables temperature wind speed net radiation etc came from different sources than the evaporation rates in this study era5 derived data are used to try to predict era5 evaporation rates the reanalysis process in era5 ensures that there will at least be internal consistency between the driving variables and the fluxes which was not necessarily the case with the ma and szilagyi 2019 and ma et al 2019 studies because they derived driving variables from multiple sources other than era interim it should be possible to glean at least some information about the effects of spatial scaling on the cr by comparing performance of cr versions from surface station data with that from era5 data where both datasets used the same averaging time with this caveat regarding direct comparison examination of fig 14 panels a and b shows that dimensionless evaporation fig 14 panel a and dimensional evaporation fig 14 panel b have opposite trends with increasing averaging times that is dimensionless evaporation rmse increases and dimensional evaporation rmse decreases when moving from flux station to era5 data this is true at both daily and monthly time steps and for all four versions however le b had only very small decreases between daily flux station and daily era5 rmse values in summary with respect to increasing temporal averaging time rmse does seem to decrease with greater averaging with all the of the cr versions with respect to increasing spatial averaging errors increase for era5 compared to flux station data for dimensionless evaporation but they decrease for dimensional evaporation 4 2 2 discussion of question 2 question 2 asked if the range of the input variables would be compressed with increased averaging time resulting in a compressed range of output values as well comparison of the range of data points in the corresponding plots in figs 1 12 supports this hypothesis this is particularly striking when comparing figs 1 and 7 dimensionless and 2 and 8 dimensional which are at daily and yearly time scales respectively both dimensional and dimensionless evaporation rates for all the cr versions show wider ranges in fig 1 than in 7 the compression is more obvious in the dimensional evaporation than in the dimensionless it is also apparent in comparing daily figs 9 and 10 with monthly figs 11 and 12 era5 data this might explain why r values trend generally upward with increasing averaging time dimensionless evaporation in fig 13 panel e or have no clear pattern dimensional evaporation in fig 13 panel f while rmse values in fig 13 generally trend downward with increasing time scales for both dimensional panel a and dimensionless panel b evaporation while the scatter of the values might be reduced lower rmse in panels a and b that doesn t necessarily result in a stronger linear relationship if the range of values is reduced fig 13 panels e and f note that the present datasets do not provide a good way to test whether similar compression of values occurs when spatial averaging increases this is because the flux station data come from seven specific sites which limits the range of fluxes expected while the era5 data span the globe and thus have considerably greater range in both input and output variables 4 2 3 discussion of question 3 question 3 asks whether the effects of advection will be smaller at larger spatial scales fig 14 panels c and d can be used to address this question this figure shows that at both the daily and monthly averaging times α does in fact decrease when moving from the flux station data to the larger spatial scale era5 data while this is the finding predicted by the hypothesis the substantial differences between the nature of the flux station datasets and the era5 dataset discussed earlier makes it difficult to conclude that the hypothesis is supported furthermore the role of α in the context of the cr is not obvious note that the calibrated value of α is at the physically realistic lower bound of 1 see priestley taylor 1972 for many of the versions this value of α corresponds to zero advection effect even with much larger spatial averaging areas it is expected that some advection will be present due to entrainment of free atmospheric air into the abl e g mcnaughton and spriggs 1989 lhomme and guilioni 2006 lhomme and guilioni 2010 raupach 2001 this suggests that the reanalysis data might be consistent with the specific land surface evaporation model used in the reanalysis but that model may not fully describe the physical process of evaporation particularly over inhomogeneous surfaces at the opposite extreme values of α exceeding 1 4 near the upper limit of the typical range for α are found for x b and lle xb versions with both flux station and era5 data note that these values of α are much lower for x b and lle xb when the original penman 1948 wind function is used in place of 5 brutsaert et al 2016 stated that α as used in cr formulations is not quite the priestley taylor parameter but merely a weak analog of it thus α could be viewed simply as a tunable parameter such that values of α 1 are viewed as acceptable however the present authors take the view that α in the cr should be treated as a close analog to the priestley taylor parameter for this reason α 1 was taken as the minimum allowed value in this study thus the direction of the trends in α with increasing spatial scale are those expected if advection is in fact less pronounced at larger spatial scales however the very low values of α with era5 and large values of α with the x b le xb version make these results rather uncertain 4 2 4 question 4 question 4 asks whether the same cr versions that work well at predicting dimensionless evaporation rates will also work well predicting dimensional rates all the cr versions considered here are formulated in terms of the dimensionless variables x αle e le p and y le le p except for y ht and lle ht which are formulated in terms of x α and y for example brutsaert s 2015 version follows a prescribed third order polynomial across the x y space and the other versions all use another algorithm to translate from a value of xx to a value of y thus it is legitimate to verify these cr versions in terms of how well predicted values of y match reference values of y dimensional evaporation is found by multiplying the predicted y by lep so this question asks whether the same versions that best predict y also accurately predict le in order to incorporate several different statistics into a holistic index of cr version performance rmse r and slope specifically the absolute difference between the regression slope and 1 were chosen as key performance variables for each dataset i e flux station or era5 and each averaging time versions were ranked from best rank 1 to worst rank 4 for each of these performance variables and then the ranks of these three variables were summed for all the time scales first flux station data were considered separately from era5 data and then the two sets were combined the results are shown in table 2 to address question four model versions based on the same underlying equation relating x and y for example x and le x will be denoted x lle x based on table 2 for both flux station and era5 data the x le x and the x b le xb versions are always ranked 1 or 2 and the y b le b and y ht lle ht versions are always ranked 3 or 4 for both dimensional and dimensionless evaporation this is true for each of the last three columns of table 2 in fact the overall rankings for dimensionless and dimensional evaporation last column of table 2 both follow the same pattern from ranks 1 to 4 x le x x b le xb y b le b y ht le ht the exception is that le b and le ht tie with a rank of 3 thus with the versions tested in table 2 a version s skill at predicting dimensionless evaporation corresponds well to skill also in predicting dimensional evaporation versions were also tested detailed results not included in which le p was calculated in two different ways one method is based on qualls and crago 2020 see also crago and qualls 2021 for an application to cr versions who noted that a variable similar to t ws can be derived from 1 in which h and le are written as energy and mass transfer equations driven by the difference in potential temperature and vapor pressure respectively between the ground and the measurement height when available energy wind speed air temperature air humidity z0 d0 and z0v are all known the equation can be solved numerically for the unknown surface temperature t 0w an apparent wet surface evaporation rate le 0w can then be found by using t 0w as the ground temperature in the mass transfer equation le max can be found from the mass transfer equation with e a 0 when this method is used to develop x in the y x version rmse is the smallest of all the models however le x is then ranked in the bottom half of the methods another method to calculate le p is to use the penman equation 2 with the original wind function proposed by penman 1948 of the form f u a b u where a and b are constants the le max is then estimated using 2 with the penman wind function and using t dry as discussed below equation 9 when these le p and le max values are used in the y ht version the results were relatively poor but the same version produced lle ht values that ranked near the top actually the dimensionless evaporation for the cr versions considered was nearly always improved by estimating le p with le 0w but at the cost of lower performance with dimensional evaporation similarly cr performance could be improved for dimensional evaporation by using the le p with the original penman wind function but at the expense of relatively poor dimensionless estimates it is clearly desirable that versions that have skill in predicting dimensionless evaporation also have skill in predicting dimensional evaporation while the current versions in which le p is given by penman s equation with the mos wind function has this desirable property it cannot be taken for granted the four basic versions examined here do not seem in themselves to be biased in favor of either dimensional or dimensionless evaporation but some methods of estimating le p and le max do seem to favor one or the other detailed results are not presented here in order to maintain a focus on the four basic cr versions rather than on different le p equations 4 2 5 question 5 question 5 asks whether some versions of the cr are consistently better at predicting evaporation reference to table 1 suggests that the two versions based on the rescaling of the cr suggested by crago et al 2016 x le x and x b le xb do perform better overall than the other two versions note that in a previous draft of this paper le p was taken either to be equal to le 0w described in section 4 2 4 or it was given by 2 with the original penman 1948 wind function in this case the x b le xb version with the le p given by 2 with the penman 1948 wind function and the y ht le ht model with the same le p both performed well for dimensional evaporation in fact that particular configuration of x b le xb ranked highest overall while this study focuses on four basic cr versions clearly the formulation of the le p used is also important 5 conclusions measurements from eddy covariance flux stations averaged over daily weekly monthly and yearly time scales and global data downloaded from the era5 reanalysis at daily and monthly averaging times were used to evaluate several cr versions the purpose was to determine whether the temporal and spatial averaging has a significant impact on the results and on the relative performance of the various models the study was conducted to evaluate the five questions asked in the introduction question 1 asked whether averaging over larger time and space scales should reduce rmse values in the case of time averaging this was in fact the case for each of the cr versions for both flux station and era5 data for spatial averaging the study results were inconclusive question 2 asked whether larger averaging times would also reduce the range of the input variables and of the cr model evaporation rates the results suggest this is the case question 3 asked whether at larger spatial scales advection would be weaker so that the priestley taylor parameter α would be smaller at larger spatial scales while cr model results using flux station data i e smaller scales and era5 data i e larger scale cannot easily be compared directly the α values at daily and monthly averaging times were both smaller for the era5 data than for the surface station data while this is the finding predicted by the hypothesis further study is needed to fully address this question question 4 asked whether cr versions that best predict dimensionless evaporation are the same as those that best predict dimensional evaporation the basic cr models y x y 2x 2 x 3 y 2x 2 x 3 and y ht themselves do not seem to inherently favor either dimensional or dimensionless evaporation however variations on how le p is calculated can bias versions toward skill in either dimensionless or dimensional evaporation prediction question 5 asked whether any cr versions regularly outperformed the other versions study results support that the rescaled versions x le x x b le xb outperformed the other versions for both dimensional and dimensionless evaporation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

3444,several versions of the complementary relationship cr between actual regional evaporation and apparent potential evaporation have recently been proposed few studies have compared multiple cr versions side by side using datasets spanning various climates and land surfaces filling this lack is one purpose of this project it also investigates how various cr versions respond to changes in spatial and temporal averaging this study uses multiple years of data from seven eddy covariance flux stations in australia representing a wide range of biomes along with global era5 reanalysis data products daily and monthly averages were used for both datasets and the australian observations also used weekly and yearly averages the era5 data represent a scale of about 30 km much larger than the scale represented by the flux station data a set of five questions regarding the impact of spatial and temporal scaling on cr parameter values and performance are asked and assessed using the two datasets four recent cr versions are considered in answering the questions due to important differences between fluxnet and era5 data questions regarding temporal scaling were answered with greater confidence than those regarding spatial scaling with these data rescaled versions of the cr performed best overall keywords evaporation scaling potential evaporation complementary relationship 1 introduction the complementary relationship cr bouchet 1963 between actual regional evaporation or latent heat flux le and apparent potential evaporation evaporation under actual radiation temperature humidity and wind conditions but with a saturated surface le p has taken many forms over the years brutsaert 1982 2005 in all of them the main idea is that the humidity of the atmospheric boundary layer abl over a region will reflect the rate of humidity entering the abl through surface evaporation such that surfaces with a high evaporation rate tend to have high humidity and those with low evaporation rates tend to have low humidity recently brutsaert 2015 introduced the concept of a generalized complementary relationship based on physical analysis of the saturated and desiccated regional surface boundary conditions since then new versions of the cr adapted from brutsaert s 2015 work have appeared in the literature including those by han and tian 2018 2020 crago et al 2016 and szilagyi et al 2016 2017 while each of these cr versions has undergone a validation process a more comprehensive side by side comparison of these versions under a range of climate and land surface conditions is needed the primary goal of this study however is to investigate how changes in temporal averaging periods and spatial averaging scales affects each of the cr versions it is clear that spatial and temporal scaling play an important role in the physical processes behind the cr so that slightly different formulations are appropriate for different spatial and temporal scales for example crago et al 2016 and szilagyi et al 2016 both used versions of the rescaled cr proposed by crago et al 2016 but fit the data with different functional forms szilagyi et al 2017 and han and tian 2020 have speculated that these scaling issues could be important if so then different data sets might have different behavior depending on their spatial and temporal scales resulting in different cr versions for the different scales an understanding of how cr models behave at various spatial and temporal scales is essential for the reliable and routine application of global estimates of evaporation using a cr model the feasibility of global estimates using cr models has been clearly established as has the ability of these models to illuminate global spatial and temporal evaporation trends brutsaert et al 2020 ma et al 2021 a key assumption behind the cr is that the atmosphere is well adjusted to the evaporation rate of the underlying surface but many of the forcing variables change considerably over the diurnal cycle furthermore atmospheric stability and the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer abl also have a pronounced diurnal cycle e g stull 1988 brutsaert 2005 it might be reasonable to assume that the abl is well adjusted to the underlying surface for a day as a whole e g brutsaert 2015 but many of the equations that make up the cr are non linear so it is not entirely clear what role different averaging periods might have with respect to spatial averaging monin obukhov similarity theory requires a homogeneous surface upwind of a measurement for a sufficient fetch e g stull 1988 thus flux measurement sites should ideally be carefully chosen to have sufficient fetch in the direction of the prevailing wind so that the measured fluxes represent a fairly clearly defined surface area however in hilly terrain or regions with complex patterns of vegetation cover it is not always clear how to choose a measurement site representative of the varied regional surface since many natural and managed landscapes have these complex patterns point measurements of latent heat fluxes typically representative of footprints over length scales of order 102 to 103 m may not be representative over a larger region such as a watershed or a cell in a numerical atmospheric model this study is a preliminary assessment of five questions regarding the cr applied at different spatial and temporal scales 1 as either the spatial or temporal scale increases will the averaging process reduce the effect of extreme values so that cr model errors decrease 2 as the temporal scale increases will the range of data values be compressed by the averaging process so that cr model estimates of evaporation also have a compressed range 3 as spatial scales increase will the impact of small scale advection due to inhomogeneous surfaces decrease 4 do the cr versions that provide the best estimates of dimensionless evaporation evaporation divided by apparent potential evaporation also provide the best predictions of dimensional actual evaporation 5 are there cr versions that perform particularly well and if so are there characteristics that these specific cr versions have in common in order to address these questions data derived from four temporal averaging periods daily weekly monthly and yearly and two different spatial scales will be used to estimate actual evaporation using four different cr formulations versions the different spatial scales will be obtained by using eddy covariance fluxes from surface stations along side global reanalysis data and temporal scales will be obtained through different averaging periods trends of parameter values e g the priestley taylor 1972 parameter α and model performance statistics with different averaging periods and areas will be analyzed to address the five questions 2 materials and methods an overview of the cr the underlying equations and several recent cr formulations will be presented first and then the data sources will be discussed 2 1 equations the land surface energy budget can be written brutsaert 1982 2005 1 r n g h l e where r n is the net radiation input g is the heat flux into the ground h is the sensible heat flux into the atmosphere and le is the latent heat flux into the atmosphere which will often be denoted as evaporation penman 1948 derived an

karman s constant r d is the ideal gas constant for dry air d is the displacement height z 0v is the scalar roughness length for water vapor and z 0 is the momentum roughness length other formulations for f u will be considered later le pen is considered to be a good estimate of apparent potential evaporation le p e g brutsaert 2015 brutsaert and stricker 1979 han and tian 2018 brutsaert 1982 brutsaert 2005 if the vapor pressure deficit e t a e a over a large saturated surface goes to 0 2 implies le pen le e where 6 le e δ δ γ r n g this le e is known as equilibrium evaporation slatyer and mcilroy 1961 priestley and taylor 1972 noted that even for very large saturated surfaces the air rarely reaches saturation so they introduced α 1 to account for warm dry advection 7 le pt α le e priestley and taylor 1972 found an average of α 1 26 from a number of large wet surfaces originally priestley and taylor 1972 δ in eq 10 was taken to be the slope de dt evaluated at the wet environment air temperature t wa szilagyi and jozsa 2008 argued that t wa is usually close to the wet surface temperature t ws szilagyi and schepers 2014 demonstrated that t ws remains nearly constant in space and time for a wet surface independent of areal extent within a drying region if the wind speed and r n g have little variability this way t ws can be found for a small wet patch by setting two expressions for the wet surface bowen ratio equal to each other e g szilagyi 2015 and solving using a numerical equation solver for tws 8 b o r n g le pen le pen γ t ws t a e t ws e t a then t wa

surface having a regional extent allowing it to influence the air temperature over it via surface cooling in this study versions of equilibrium evaporation 6 will make use of δ calculated at t ws and at t a which will be denoted δ t ws and δ t a respectively the cr versions considered herein find their root in the work of brutsaert 2015 he developed a generalized complementary relationship given by 9 y b 2 x 2 x 3 where x le w le p y le le p y b is an estimate of y le w is the evaporation rate of a large saturated surface usually taken to be le pt see brutsaert and stricker 1979 and le p is the apparent potential evaporation rate given by 2 the functional form of 9 is the simplest polynomial that can satisfy the four boundary conditions proposed by brutsaert 2015 namely x 0 at y 0 x 1 at y 1 dy dx 0 at y 0 and dy dx 1 at y 1 note that all the cr versions tested here are formulated in dimensionless form that is in terms of x and y crago et al 2016 noted that y 0 does not imply x 0 because even for a completely dry region le p cannot go to infinity see 2 they suggested that y 0 at xmin le w le max where le max is the value of le p expected for a desiccated regional surface since le p is found with 2 this same equation should also be used to estimate le max following szilagyi et al 2016 le max is defined using 2 where e a 0 e t a is replaced by e t dry δ is replaced by δ d e dt evaluated at t dry and t dry t a e a γ thus x min is found from le pt divided by this le max thus x does not range from 0 to 1 but only from x min to 1 crago et al 2016 suggested rescaling x to x 10 x x x min 1 x min which does range from 0 to 1 crago et al 2016 suggested the cr could be represented as 11 y x since le max is different for each data point so is x min so that data plotted on an x y graph are rearranged horizontally when plotted on an x y plot szilagyi et al 2016 suggested the use of 9 with x replaced by x from 10 combining the boundary conditions proposed by brutsaert 2015 with the rescaling of 10 han and tian 2018 proposed a sigmoid shaped curve in x y space 12 y ht 1 1 m x max x x x min n where 13 n 4 α 1 1 b ht x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 x max x min and 14 x 0 5 0 5 1 b ht α 1 1 b ht with b ht a second model parameter and 15 m x 0 5 x min x max x 0 5 n in practice han and tian 2018 2020 recommend x min 0 and x max 1 their parameter α is loosely related to the priestley taylor parameter but it primarily establishes the slope of the sigmoid curve at the center of the graph both α and b ht must be specified or calibrated equation 12 is explicitly based on the two terms of penman s equation so in their model x is taken as le e ta le pen and y is le le pen the focus of this study is on the different broader versions of the cr i e strategies for finding y

presented here has been the subject of debate in the literature e g see ma and zhang 2017 ma and szilagyi 2019 szilagyi and crago 2019 han and tian 2020 liu et al 2020 crago et al 2017 crago et al 2020a crago et al 2020b crago et al 2021 thus there is a need for studies testing multiple versions of the cr with a variety of datasets from a variety of sites around the world this project is intended to partly fill this gap these four versions and the notation used in defining them are found in table 1 dimensional evaporation le x le b le xb and le ht in w m 2 is derived from dimensionless evaporation x y b x b and y ht respectively by multiplying the dimensionless rate by le pen reference values will be described in the next section but dimensional reference evaporation values are denoted le r and dimensionless values are denoted y r table 1 also indicates which temperature is used to calculate δ in 6 for each version 2 2 data sources data from two sources were used in this study as described below 2 2 1 fluxnet data from seven fluxnet baldocchi et al 2001 sites in australia see crago and qualls 2018 for details of the sites were used here these eddy covariance flux stations measured net radiation sensible heat flux and latent heat flux ground heat flux atmospheric pressure air temperature vapor pressure deficit wind speed and friction velocity crago and qualls 2018 used the friction velocity values to find an optimum value of z 0 for each site these are the values used here the sites ranged from tropical to temporal arid to humid and included a large seasonal wetland a tropical savannah and tall temporal forests daily weekly monthly and yearly average data products are available from fluxnet http fluxnet fluxdata org the energy budget closure problem was resolved by forcing the measured bowen ratio to hold and finding reference values of h r and le r that satisfy the energy budget 1 because averaging periods up to a year were used gap filling techniques provided by fluxnet pastorello et al 2020 were applied 2 2 2 era5 era5 is a reanalysis product produced by ecmwf hersbach et al 2020 it is the successor to era interim dee et al 2011 reanalysis data products combine observations e g radar satellite and station data and model analysis to arrive at the most probable state of the atmosphere era5 data are on a 30 km grid covering the globe a land sea mask is available to select only land surfaces in this study land surfaces are those with 99 9 land within the grid cell era5 data can be downloaded from ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu monthly average data from 2017 and 2018 for the odd numbered months january march etc were downloaded from ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu search text era5 type dataset as were hourly data from january 1 april 1 july 1 and october 1 in 1999 which were used to find daily average values for these four days downloaded data include latent and sensible heat fluxes 2 m air temperature 10 m wind speed 2 m dewpoint temperature z 0 and a land sea mask layer for each cell across the globe available energy was taken to be the same as the sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes 3 calculations section 3 1 will describe calculations and assumptions for the eddy covariance data and section 3 2 will describe them for the era5 data 3 1 calculations for flux station data separate data files are provided by fluxnet for daily weekly monthly and yearly averaging times in each averaging periods were removed for which h 0 le 0 or r n g 0 t a 0 or for times when no data were available for any of the mentioned variables or for pressure or vapor pressure deficit data with time averaged wind speeds 1 m s 1 were omitted because there may be poor connection between the state of the land surface and the lower atmosphere when turbulence is weak or absent violating a basic assumption of the cr e g crago and qualls 2018 under such conditions le is likely small so impact of the removal of these data points is minimal it was assumed that d0 z0 4 8 and z 0v z 0 15 c f brutsaert 1982 2005 zhang et al 2017 the momentum roughness length was taken as the log average value of z 0 found by crago and qualls 2018 for each site from the measured values of u optimal parameter values α and for 12 b ht were those values that minimized root mean square error rmse between estimates and reference values reference values for dimensionless evaporation rates were found using y le r le pen parameters were fit using a trial and error procedure note that the han and tian formulation 12 15 required fitting of two parameters since both parameters have significant effects on the rmse satisfactory results came from searching the entire range of parameter values to find optimal parameters 3 2 calculations for era5 data technical documentation on the ecmwf website https www ecmwf int en publications ifs documentation ifs documentation cy41r2 part iv physical processes explains that surface air temperatures wind speeds are located at a height of z 2 m 10 m z 0 should be 0 03 m or the given z 0 for the cell whichever is less and z 0v should be 1 10 of the resulting z 0 displacement height is ignored in this procedure for calibration of parameter values a procedure similar to the one described above for the flux station data was used however with 1 4 million land cells available during the 12 months calibration was streamlined by using a random sample drawn without replacement of 100 000 cells drawn from all twelve months of data a sample of 100 000 daily cell values was also drawn from the four days in 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 results the results are presented graphically in figs 1 14 statistics relating estimates to reference values are provided inside the graphs statistics include rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error nse nash sutcliffe efficiency nash and sutcliffe 1970 r correlation coefficient and the slope and intercept of the linear regression between model and reference values figs 1 through 14 all suggest that all four cr versions adequately estimate latent heat fluxes at these sites at daily weekly monthly and yearly time scales this is the case with flux station as well era5 reanalysis data section 4 2 will discuss questions 1 through 5 in turn 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 discussion of question 1 question 1 asks whether greater spatial and temporal averaging will result in smaller model errors this can be addressed by looking at panels a and b of both figs 13 and 14 in both figures the left column panels a c and e considers dimensionless evaporation le le p and the right column panels b d and f considers actual dimensional evaporation le the top rows consider rmse the second rows consider α and the third rows consider correlation coefficient r panels a and b of figs 13 and 14 show that all the versions have a clear trend towards lower rmse with longer averaging times moving from daily to weekly fig 13 panel a y b y ht and e ht have a slight increase in rmse with the flux station data but each of these versions still has a clear trend of decreasing rmse overall mcmahon et al 2013 note that evaporation methods using potential evaporation tend to work best with averaging times around a month their observation is consistent with this result although there is continued improvement from monthly to yearly rmse values fig 13 evaluation of changes in rmse with increasing spatial scale requires comparison of era5 and flux station results this direct comparison is not straightforward while reanalysis data might often be considered more accurate than either model results or measurements alone e g szilagyi et al 2014 the era interim the predecessor data product to era5 see dee et al 2011 land surface evaporation rates compared more poorly with the long term water balance estimate of evaporation precipitation minus streamflow for huc 6 and huc 8 watersheds in the contiguous united states than one of the cr methods ma and szilagyi 2019 specifically they compared a version related to the present e xb formulation to multiple other models and data products including the era interim gridded evaporation product they found that era interim tended to systematically overestimate the water balance based evaporation estimates while the cr based approach had the lowest rmse and smallest relative bias of all the models or products they tested ma et al 2019 noted similar problems with era interim evaporation estimates in china in ma and szilagyi 2019 and ma et al 2019 the input variables temperature wind speed net radiation etc came from different sources than the evaporation rates in this study era5 derived data are used to try to predict era5 evaporation rates the reanalysis process in era5 ensures that there will at least be internal consistency between the driving variables and the fluxes which was not necessarily the case with the ma and szilagyi 2019 and ma et al 2019 studies because they derived driving variables from multiple sources other than era interim it should be possible to glean at least some information about the effects of spatial scaling on the cr by comparing performance of cr versions from surface station data with that from era5 data where both datasets used the same averaging time with this caveat regarding direct comparison examination of fig 14 panels a and b shows that dimensionless evaporation fig 14 panel a and dimensional evaporation fig 14 panel b have opposite trends with increasing averaging times that is dimensionless evaporation rmse increases and dimensional evaporation rmse decreases when moving from flux station to era5 data this is true at both daily and monthly time steps and for all four versions however le b had only very small decreases between daily flux station and daily era5 rmse values in summary with respect to increasing temporal averaging time rmse does seem to decrease with greater averaging with all the of the cr versions with respect to increasing spatial averaging errors increase for era5 compared to flux station data for dimensionless evaporation but they decrease for dimensional evaporation 4 2 2 discussion of question 2 question 2 asked if the range of the input variables would be compressed with increased averaging time resulting in a compressed range of output values as well comparison of the range of data points in the corresponding plots in figs 1 12 supports this hypothesis this is particularly striking when comparing figs 1 and 7 dimensionless and 2 and 8 dimensional which are at daily and yearly time scales respectively both dimensional and dimensionless evaporation rates for all the cr versions show wider ranges in fig 1 than in 7 the compression is more obvious in the dimensional evaporation than in the dimensionless it is also apparent in comparing daily figs 9 and 10 with monthly figs 11 and 12 era5 data this might explain why r values trend generally upward with increasing averaging time dimensionless evaporation in fig 13 panel e or have no clear pattern dimensional evaporation in fig 13 panel f while rmse values in fig 13 generally trend downward with increasing time scales for both dimensional panel a and dimensionless panel b evaporation while the scatter of the values might be reduced lower rmse in panels a and b that doesn t necessarily result in a stronger linear relationship if the range of values is reduced fig 13 panels e and f note that the present datasets do not provide a good way to test whether similar compression of values occurs when spatial averaging increases this is because the flux station data come from seven specific sites which limits the range of fluxes expected while the era5 data span the globe and thus have considerably greater range in both input and output variables 4 2 3 discussion of question 3 question 3 asks whether the effects of advection will be smaller at larger spatial scales fig 14 panels c and d can be used to address this question this figure shows that at both the daily and monthly averaging times α does in fact decrease when moving from the flux station data to the larger spatial scale era5 data while this is the finding predicted by the hypothesis the substantial differences between the nature of the flux station datasets and the era5 dataset discussed earlier makes it difficult to conclude that the hypothesis is supported furthermore the role of α in the context of the cr is not obvious note that the calibrated value of α is at the physically realistic lower bound of 1 see priestley taylor 1972 for many of the versions this value of α corresponds to zero advection effect even with much larger spatial averaging areas it is expected that some advection will be present due to entrainment of free atmospheric air into the abl e g mcnaughton and spriggs 1989 lhomme and guilioni 2006 lhomme and guilioni 2010 raupach 2001 this suggests that the reanalysis data might be consistent with the specific land surface evaporation model used in the reanalysis but that model may not fully describe the physical process of evaporation particularly over inhomogeneous surfaces at the opposite extreme values of α exceeding 1 4 near the upper limit of the typical range for α are found for x b and lle xb versions with both flux station and era5 data note that these values of α are much lower for x b and lle xb when the original penman 1948 wind function is used in place of 5 brutsaert et al 2016 stated that α as used in cr formulations is not quite the priestley taylor parameter but merely a weak analog of it thus α could be viewed simply as a tunable parameter such that values of α 1 are viewed as acceptable however the present authors take the view that α in the cr should be treated as a close analog to the priestley taylor parameter for this reason α 1 was taken as the minimum allowed value in this study thus the direction of the trends in α with increasing spatial scale are those expected if advection is in fact less pronounced at larger spatial scales however the very low values of α with era5 and large values of α with the x b le xb version make these results rather uncertain 4 2 4 question 4 question 4 asks whether the same cr versions that work well at predicting dimensionless evaporation rates will also work well predicting dimensional rates all the cr versions considered here are formulated in terms of the dimensionless variables x αle e le p and y le le p except for y ht and lle ht which are formulated in terms of x α and y for example brutsaert s 2015 version follows a prescribed third order polynomial across the x y space and the other versions all use another algorithm to translate from a value of xx to a value of y thus it is legitimate to verify these cr versions in terms of how well predicted values of y match reference values of y dimensional evaporation is found by multiplying the predicted y by lep so this question asks whether the same versions that best predict y also accurately predict le in order to incorporate several different statistics into a holistic index of cr version performance rmse r and slope specifically the absolute difference between the regression slope and 1 were chosen as key performance variables for each dataset i e flux station or era5 and each averaging time versions were ranked from best rank 1 to worst rank 4 for each of these performance variables and then the ranks of these three variables were summed for all the time scales first flux station data were considered separately from era5 data and then the two sets were combined the results are shown in table 2 to address question four model versions based on the same underlying equation relating x and y for example x and le x will be denoted x lle x based on table 2 for both flux station and era5 data the x le x and the x b le xb versions are always ranked 1 or 2 and the y b le b and y ht lle ht versions are always ranked 3 or 4 for both dimensional and dimensionless evaporation this is true for each of the last three columns of table 2 in fact the overall rankings for dimensionless and dimensional evaporation last column of table 2 both follow the same pattern from ranks 1 to 4 x le x x b le xb y b le b y ht le ht the exception is that le b and le ht tie with a rank of 3 thus with the versions tested in table 2 a version s skill at predicting dimensionless evaporation corresponds well to skill also in predicting dimensional evaporation versions were also tested detailed results not included in which le p was calculated in two different ways one method is based on qualls and crago 2020 see also crago and qualls 2021 for an application to cr versions who noted that a variable similar to t ws can be derived from 1 in which h and le are written as energy and mass transfer equations driven by the difference in potential temperature and vapor pressure respectively between the ground and the measurement height when available energy wind speed air temperature air humidity z0 d0 and z0v are all known the equation can be solved numerically for the unknown surface temperature t 0w an apparent wet surface evaporation rate le 0w can then be found by using t 0w as the ground temperature in the mass transfer equation le max can be found from the mass transfer equation with e a 0 when this method is used to develop x in the y x version rmse is the smallest of all the models however le x is then ranked in the bottom half of the methods another method to calculate le p is to use the penman equation 2 with the original wind function proposed by penman 1948 of the form f u a b u where a and b are constants the le max is then estimated using 2 with the penman wind function and using t dry as discussed below equation 9 when these le p and le max values are used in the y ht version the results were relatively poor but the same version produced lle ht values that ranked near the top actually the dimensionless evaporation for the cr versions considered was nearly always improved by estimating le p with le 0w but at the cost of lower performance with dimensional evaporation similarly cr performance could be improved for dimensional evaporation by using the le p with the original penman wind function but at the expense of relatively poor dimensionless estimates it is clearly desirable that versions that have skill in predicting dimensionless evaporation also have skill in predicting dimensional evaporation while the current versions in which le p is given by penman s equation with the mos wind function has this desirable property it cannot be taken for granted the four basic versions examined here do not seem in themselves to be biased in favor of either dimensional or dimensionless evaporation but some methods of estimating le p and le max do seem to favor one or the other detailed results are not presented here in order to maintain a focus on the four basic cr versions rather than on different le p equations 4 2 5 question 5 question 5 asks whether some versions of the cr are consistently better at predicting evaporation reference to table 1 suggests that the two versions based on the rescaling of the cr suggested by crago et al 2016 x le x and x b le xb do perform better overall than the other two versions note that in a previous draft of this paper le p was taken either to be equal to le 0w described in section 4 2 4 or it was given by 2 with the original penman 1948 wind function in this case the x b le xb version with the le p given by 2 with the penman 1948 wind function and the y ht le ht model with the same le p both performed well for dimensional evaporation in fact that particular configuration of x b le xb ranked highest overall while this study focuses on four basic cr versions clearly the formulation of the le p used is also important 5 conclusions measurements from eddy covariance flux stations averaged over daily weekly monthly and yearly time scales and global data downloaded from the era5 reanalysis at daily and monthly averaging times were used to evaluate several cr versions the purpose was to determine whether the temporal and spatial averaging has a significant impact on the results and on the relative performance of the various models the study was conducted to evaluate the five questions asked in the introduction question 1 asked whether averaging over larger time and space scales should reduce rmse values in the case of time averaging this was in fact the case for each of the cr versions for both flux station and era5 data for spatial averaging the study results were inconclusive question 2 asked whether larger averaging times would also reduce the range of the input variables and of the cr model evaporation rates the results suggest this is the case question 3 asked whether at larger spatial scales advection would be weaker so that the priestley taylor parameter α would be smaller at larger spatial scales while cr model results using flux station data i e smaller scales and era5 data i e larger scale cannot easily be compared directly the α values at daily and monthly averaging times were both smaller for the era5 data than for the surface station data while this is the finding predicted by the hypothesis further study is needed to fully address this question question 4 asked whether cr versions that best predict dimensionless evaporation are the same as those that best predict dimensional evaporation the basic cr models y x y 2x 2 x 3 y 2x 2 x 3 and y ht themselves do not seem to inherently favor either dimensional or dimensionless evaporation however variations on how le p is calculated can bias versions toward skill in either dimensionless or dimensional evaporation prediction question 5 asked whether any cr versions regularly outperformed the other versions study results support that the rescaled versions x le x x b le xb outperformed the other versions for both dimensional and dimensionless evaporation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
