arabica coffee coffea arabica in yunnan province and the planting area and yield of arabica coffee in this province were about 1 18 105 ha and 1 39 105 t in 2016 hao et al 2017 in dry and hot regions of southwest china there is abundant sunshine low rainfall large evaporation and long duration of dry season and no irrigation or flood irrigation in local planting restricts high efficient production of arabica coffee cai et al 2007 regulated deficit irrigation rdi can save much irrigation water maintain or increase crop yield and improve quality marsal et al 2016 kang et al 2000 patanè et al 2011 santesteban et al 2011 compared with full irrigation fi mild deficit irrigation 80 of full irrigation amount decreases the yield of arabica coffee only by 6 4 while it enhances the contents of protein

currently it is unclear if it is possible to achieve sufficient yield high quality and wue of arabica coffee in dry and hot regions due to the shading habit of arabica coffee growth shading cultivation can create a suitable microclimate environment reduce leaf surface temperature steiman et al 2011 boreux et al 2016 nesper et al 2017 change leaf photosynthetic characteristics araujo et

drinks aroma taste and acidity bote and struik 2011 vaast et al 2006 however the effect of shading on the yield was not consistent bosselmann et al 2009 haggar et al 2011 ricci et al 2011 van asten et al 2011 previous studies found that the contents of chlorogenic acid and total sugar fructose glucose and sucrose in dry bean are the highest at 40 shading somporn et al 2012 other studies have found that high shading level raises leaf area quality and particle size of coffee bean but declines coffee yield jaramillobotero et al 2010 somporn et al 2012 hence suitable shading for improving the yield quality and wue of arabica coffee in hot and dry regions needs further investigation drip irrigation can promote coffee growth and enhance yield and economic income under shade cultivation perdoná and soratto 2015a b 2016 however how to effectively combine deficit irrigation and shading to maintain yield and improve quality and wue of arabica coffee is unsolved and needs further investigation

transpiration rate tr and leaf apparent radiation use efficiency aruel of arabica coffee table 1 compared to full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di decreased pn and tr by 6 8 10 9 and 9 8 18 5 respectively di50 reduced aruel by 20 0 while di75 increased it by 7 6 there were pronounced effects of shading level on pn tr leaf water use efficiency wuel and aruel compared with sh0 sh60 decreased pn tr and wuel by 30 9 16 5 and 17 9 and sh45 15 2 4 5 and 12 3 respectively while sh30 enhanced pn and wuel by 26 0 and 20 4 in addition shading raised aruel by 18 3 84 7 marked interaction effects of irrigation level and shading level on aruel were observed compared to fish0 ck di50 with different shading levels di50sh60 di50sh45 and di50sh0 declined aruel by 3 4 99 9 but the other treatments increased aruel to different extents in addition fish60 had the highest aruel of 47 07 mmol mol 1 3 2 dry bean yield and water use efficiency wue dry bean yield of arabica coffee was remarkably affected by irrigation level shading level and their interaction but there was no significant interaction on it in 2016 table 2 the marginal yield showed a trend of first increase and then decrease with the raising of irrigation amount fig 4 in comparison with fi di75 and di50 reduced the average yield by 6 9 8 3 and 53 5 55 8 respectively the marginal yield was firstly positive and then negative with the enhancing of shading degree compared to sh0 sh60 declined mean yield by 26 4 29 1 sh45 did not decrease it significantly and sh30 increased it by 26 6 28 0 compared with ck fish30 fish45 and di75sh30 enhanced average yield obviously but the other treatments reduced it by 8 4 62 7 fish30 had the highest average yield 1 31 times than ck while d150sh60 had the lowest average yield and reduced it by 63 7 if compared to ck there were remarkable effects of irrigation level shading level and their interaction on wue of arabica coffee no significant interaction effect on it in 2016 was found table 2 compared to fi di50 reduced average wue by 41 5 while di75 did not increase it significantly mean wue firstly rose and then decreased with the increasing of shading degree sh30 enhanced mean wue by 26 8 while sh60 and sh45 decreased it by 26 9 and 5 2 respectively if compared with sh0 compared to ck all irrigation treatments under sh60 decreased average wue by 19 9 51 9 at different shading levels di75 increased average wue by 3 5 44 5 while di50 decreased it by 23 8 46 0 di75sh30 had the highest average wue 1 45 times than ck 3 3 nutritional quality of dry bean effects of irrigation level on total sugar content and shading level on protein content were not obvious but other nutritional quality indices were prominently influenced by irrigation level shading level and their interactions table 3 with the enhancing of water deficit degree caffeine content increased however chlorogenic acid content firstly increased and then decreased compared to fi di75 increased the contents of crude fat and chlorogenic acid by 6 0 and 10 2 respectively but it did not raise the contents of protein and caffeine significantly di50 increased caffeine content by 22 6 but it did not affect the contents of protein and crude fat markedly with the increased shading level the contents of total sugar crude fat and chlorogenic acid firstly rose and then decreased while caffeine content gradually diminished in comparison with sh0 sh60 declined the contents of crude fat caffeine and chlorogenic acid by 7 7 12 5 and 19 4 but did not decline total sugar content greatly sh45 decreased the contents of caffeine and chlorogenic acid by 14 3 and 13 9 but did not reduce the contents of crude fat and total sugar significantly sh30 raised the contents of total sugar and chlorogenic acid by 6 3 and 5 5 but did not enhance crude fat content obviously and decreased caffeine content by 12 5 compared to ck di75sh60 did not increase the content of total sugar and di50sh60 did not enhance protein content significantly other treatments raised the contents of total sugar and protein significantly di50sh30 di50sh0 and di50sh60 increased caffeine content to varying degree while other treatments decreased it di75sh30 had the highest contents of total sugar crude fat and chlorogenic acid and di75sh30 increased them by 12 2 6 6 and 10 0 respectively but decreased caffeine content by 8 3 if compared with ck 3 4 comprehensive nutritional quality evaluated by principle component analysis pca the cumulative variance contribution of the first and second principal components was more than 85 indicating that the 1st and 2nd principal components could basically reflect all the information of nutritional quality indices table 4 constructing principal component function 28 pc1 0 5453ts 0 5154pro 0 4778crf 0 4496ca 0 0812caf 29 pc2 0 0003ts 0 1288pro 0 2340crf 0 2680ca 0 9258caf 30 zf 0 72372pc1 0 27628pc2 where pc 1 and pc 2 are the 1st and 2nd principal component scores zf is comprehensive score ts pro crf ca and caf are the standardized values for total sugar protein crude fat chlorogenic acid and caffeine respectively from the principal component function the weights of total sugar protein crude fat and chlorogenic acid in pc 1 was higher than that of caffeine and the weight of caffeine in pc 2 was high so pc 1 and pc 2 represented the favorable and unfavorable variation information of nutritional qualities respectively as shown in fig 5 the quality comprehensive evaluation index of di75 at the same shading level and sh30 at the same irrigation level were higher indicating that mild deficit irrigation and suitable shading could improve the nutritional quality of dry bean di75sh30 had the highest comprehensive nutritional quality followed by fish30 3 5 comprehensive benefit evaluation based on improved topsis method table 5 shows the results of comprehensive benefit evaluation compared to fi di75 and di50 decreased comprehensive benefit evaluation index c i by 6 18 and 66 92 respectively sh30 and sh45 increased c i by 42 16 and 5 88 but sh60 decreased it by 23 95 when compared with sh0 di75sh30 had the highest c i 5 32 times than ck but di50sh0 had the minimum value of c i so di75sh30 had the optimal comprehensive benefit of coffee yield nutritional quality and wue the result of spearman rank correlation analysis indicated that the dry bean yield was positively related to ci while caffeine content was negatively related to ci the correlation between the contents of total sugar and crude fat and ci was not obvious 4 discussion this study showed that regulated deficit irrigation remarkably reduced net photosynthetic rate of arabica coffee possibly due to the decrease of stomatal conductance induced by water stress the obstruction of co2 entering leaves or the decline of photosynthetic activity of mesophyll cells chastain et al 2014 tesfaye et al 2014 di75 enhanced leaf apparent radiation use efficiency aruel which was probably related to the optimization of canopy structure and the increase of canopy extinction capacity under moderate deficit irrigation camargo et al 2016 liu et al 2016b zhou et al 2016 however di50 decreased aruel possibly due to the decrease in absorptive and transformative capacity of photosynthetically active radiation caused by severe water deficit the shading level had pronounced effect on leaf photosynthesis transpiration water use efficiency wuel and aruel of arabica coffee which was consistent with the results of the related studies araujo et al 2008 bote and struik 2011 dong et al 2016 in this study sh30 increased leaf net photosynthetic rate and wuel probably because suitable shading reduced the damage of strong sunlight to photosynthetic mechanism alleviated the phenomenon of midday depression improved the chlorophyll and ps ii light conversion efficiency reduced heat dissipation and made up the relative lack of light so the photosynthetic efficiency was enhanced charbonnier et al 2017 li et al 2014 xu et al 2010 however the effect of sh0 might have photo inhibition inactivation or damage to the light system reaction center of leaves simultaneously thickened the cell wall and restricted the gas exchange rate which finally may lead to the decrease of photosynthetic rate han et al 2017 insufficient radiation in sh60 possibly led to the decrease of photosynthetic electron transport and key enzymes thus reducing the net photosynthetic rate and wuel mishanin et al 2017 zheng and yang 2008 shading significantly raised aruel possibly because shade leaves increased the distribution ratio of electron transport quantum in the psii reaction center and reduced the quantum ratio for heat dissipation jia et al 2015 and the results also showed that coffee leaves had a certain ability of regulation and adaption for weak light stress bloor 2003 wang et al 2009 the interaction between irrigation and shading had significant effects on aruel which was probably related to the regulation of root zone soil water content by irrigation and the change of canopy microclimate environment by shading thus the effective transformation of photosynthetically active radiation was changed liu et al 2017 in this study the marginal yield of dry bean was the maximum when irrigation amount and shading degree were appropriately reduced the marginal yield was negative when shading level ranged from sh30 to sh45 or from sh45 to sh60 mainly because excessive shading decreased solar radiation intercepted by canopy which resulted in insufficient photosynthetic product synthesis and supply capacity in leaves damatta 2004 liu et al 2017 yildirim et al 2017 di75sh30 could simultaneously achieve maximum water use efficiency wue and higher dry bean yield indicating that moderate deficit irrigation could basically meet the growth requirement of coffee under suitable shading possibly because sh30 increased leaf net photosynthetic rate and wuel but decreased ineffective evaporation of soil surface water bote and struik 2011 evizal 2016 severe deficit irrigation in di50 significantly reduced the yield and wue under different shading levels probably because soil water stress reduced flower bud differentiation and fruit number of coffee and inhibited the growth and development of fruit sakai et al 2015 the results indicated that irrigation level had marked effect on most of nutritional quality indices in coffee dry bean which was probably related to the effects of soil moisture on photosynthetic characteristics photosynthate accumulation transportation and transformation of inorganic and organic compounds in plants du and kang 2011 xu et al 2004 mild deficit irrigation di75 increased the contents of crude fat and chlorogenic acid in dry bean and thus improved the nutritional quality which was in consistent with the previous results patanè et al 2011 santesteban et al 2011 tesfaye et al 2013 however severe deficit irrigation di50 might lead to the damage of beneficial nutrient components thereby decreasing the nutritional quality of coffee bean with the rising of water stress chlorogenic acid content in coffee bean firstly increased and then decreased probably because sufficient irrigation had a dilution effect on accumulation of chlorogenic acid xing et al 2015 while plant primary productivity was greatly inhibited and raw materials for the synthesis of secondary products were decreased under severe water deficit irrigation liu et al 2016a shading level had significant effects on the contents of total sugar protein crude fat caffeine and chlorogenic acid which was probably related to the change of micro climatic environment for coffee growth by shading the adjustment of the physiological processes such as absorption distribution and synthesis of nutrients and induction and regulation of synthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites in different tissues and cells of plants ozden 2014 zhang et al 2009 there were many indices affecting the nutritional quality of coffee and the indices interacted each other however the evaluation index was relatively simple huang et al 2012 läderach et al 2011 in this study two principal components extracted by principal component analysis were used to evaluate the comprehensive nutritional quality of dry bean and the results indicated that di75sh30 had the best comprehensive nutritional quality and di75sh30 had the highest comprehensive benefit based on dry bean yield nutritional quality and water use efficiency using the improved topsis method and this treatment not only had higher yield and water use efficiency but also improved the nutritional quality of dry bean therefore the combination of moderate deficit irrigation saving irrigation water by 25 and proper shading 30 shading could simultaneously achieve water saving suitable yield and better quality the results could provide practical reference for the deficit irrigation and shading management of arabica coffee in dry and hot regions 5 conclusions 1 compared to full irrigation mild deficit irrigation improved leaf apparent radiation use efficiency and nutritional quality of arabica coffee 2 compared with no shading 30 shading improved the yield and water use efficiency of arabica coffee and nutritional quality of dry bean 3 mild deficit irrigation could improve water use efficiency and nutritional quality of arabica coffee without yield reduction under proper shading the treatment of 75 full irrigation amount and 30 shading had optimal comprehensive benefit of coffee yield nutritional quality and water use efficiency thus this treatment was a suitable irrigation and shading management for arabica coffee in dry and hot

transpiration rate tr and leaf apparent radiation use efficiency aruel of arabica coffee table 1 compared to full irrigation fi deficit irrigation di decreased pn and tr by 6 8 10 9 and 9 8 18 5 respectively di50 reduced aruel by 20 0 while di75 increased it by 7 6 there were pronounced effects of shading level on pn tr leaf water use efficiency wuel and aruel compared with sh0 sh60 decreased pn tr and wuel by 30 9 16 5 and 17 9 and sh45 15 2 4 5 and 12 3 respectively while sh30 enhanced pn and wuel by 26 0 and 20 4 in addition shading raised aruel by 18 3 84 7 marked interaction effects of irrigation level and shading level on aruel were observed compared to fish0 ck di50 with different shading levels di50sh60 di50sh45 and di50sh0 declined aruel by 3 4 99 9 but the other treatments increased aruel to different extents in addition fish60 had the highest aruel of 47 07 mmol mol 1 3 2 dry bean yield and water use efficiency wue dry bean yield of arabica coffee was remarkably affected by irrigation level shading level and their interaction but there was no significant interaction on it in 2016 table 2 the marginal yield showed a trend of first increase and then decrease with the raising of irrigation amount fig 4 in comparison with fi di75 and di50 reduced the average yield by 6 9 8 3 and 53 5 55 8 respectively the marginal yield was firstly positive and then negative with the enhancing of shading degree compared to sh0 sh60 declined mean yield by 26 4 29 1 sh45 did not decrease it significantly and sh30 increased it by 26 6 28 0 compared with ck fish30 fish45 and di75sh30 enhanced average yield obviously but the other treatments reduced it by 8 4 62 7 fish30 had the highest average yield 1 31 times than ck while d150sh60 had the lowest average yield and reduced it by 63 7 if compared to ck there were remarkable effects of irrigation level shading level and their interaction on wue of arabica coffee no significant interaction effect on it in 2016 was found table 2 compared to fi di50 reduced average wue by 41 5 while di75 did not increase it significantly mean wue firstly rose and then decreased with the increasing of shading degree sh30 enhanced mean wue by 26 8 while sh60 and sh45 decreased it by 26 9 and 5 2 respectively if compared with sh0 compared to ck all irrigation treatments under sh60 decreased average wue by 19 9 51 9 at different shading levels di75 increased average wue by 3 5 44 5 while di50 decreased it by 23 8 46 0 di75sh30 had the highest average wue 1 45 times than ck 3 3 nutritional quality of dry bean effects of irrigation level on total sugar content and shading level on protein content were not obvious but other nutritional quality indices were prominently influenced by irrigation level shading level and their interactions table 3 with the enhancing of water deficit degree caffeine content increased however chlorogenic acid content firstly increased and then decreased compared to fi di75 increased the contents of crude fat and chlorogenic acid by 6 0 and 10 2 respectively but it did not raise the contents of protein and caffeine significantly di50 increased caffeine content by 22 6 but it did not affect the contents of protein and crude fat markedly with the increased shading level the contents of total sugar crude fat and chlorogenic acid firstly rose and then decreased while caffeine content gradually diminished in comparison with sh0 sh60 declined the contents of crude fat caffeine and chlorogenic acid by 7 7 12 5 and 19 4 but did not decline total sugar content greatly sh45 decreased the contents of caffeine and chlorogenic acid by 14 3 and 13 9 but did not reduce the contents of crude fat and total sugar significantly sh30 raised the contents of total sugar and chlorogenic acid by 6 3 and 5 5 but did not enhance crude fat content obviously and decreased caffeine content by 12 5 compared to ck di75sh60 did not increase the content of total sugar and di50sh60 did not enhance protein content significantly other treatments raised the contents of total sugar and protein significantly di50sh30 di50sh0 and di50sh60 increased caffeine content to varying degree while other treatments decreased it di75sh30 had the highest contents of total sugar crude fat and chlorogenic acid and di75sh30 increased them by 12 2 6 6 and 10 0 respectively but decreased caffeine content by 8 3 if compared with ck 3 4 comprehensive nutritional quality evaluated by principle component analysis pca the cumulative variance contribution of the first and second principal components was more than 85 indicating that the 1st and 2nd principal components could basically reflect all the information of nutritional quality indices table 4 constructing principal component function 28 pc1 0 5453ts 0 5154pro 0 4778crf 0 4496ca 0 0812caf 29 pc2 0 0003ts 0 1288pro 0 2340crf 0 2680ca 0 9258caf 30 zf 0 72372pc1 0 27628pc2 where pc 1 and pc 2 are the 1st and 2nd principal component scores zf is comprehensive score ts pro crf ca and caf are the standardized values for total sugar protein crude fat chlorogenic acid and caffeine respectively from the principal component function the weights of total sugar protein crude fat and chlorogenic acid in pc 1 was higher than that of caffeine and the weight of caffeine in pc 2 was high so pc 1 and pc 2 represented the favorable and unfavorable variation information of nutritional qualities respectively as shown in fig 5 the quality comprehensive evaluation index of di75 at the same shading level and sh30 at the same irrigation level were higher indicating that mild deficit irrigation and suitable shading could improve the nutritional quality of dry bean di75sh30 had the highest comprehensive nutritional quality followed by fish30 3 5 comprehensive benefit evaluation based on improved topsis method table 5 shows the results of comprehensive benefit evaluation compared to fi di75 and di50 decreased comprehensive benefit evaluation index c i by 6 18 and 66 92 respectively sh30 and sh45 increased c i by 42 16 and 5 88 but sh60 decreased it by 23 95 when compared with sh0 di75sh30 had the highest c i 5 32 times than ck but di50sh0 had the minimum value of c i so di75sh30 had the optimal comprehensive benefit of coffee yield nutritional quality and wue the result of spearman rank correlation analysis indicated that the dry bean yield was positively related to ci while caffeine content was negatively related to ci the correlation between the contents of total sugar and crude fat and ci was not obvious 4 discussion this study showed that regulated deficit irrigation remarkably reduced net photosynthetic rate of arabica coffee possibly due to the decrease of stomatal conductance induced by water stress the obstruction of co2 entering leaves or the decline of photosynthetic activity of mesophyll cells chastain et al 2014 tesfaye et al 2014 di75 enhanced leaf apparent radiation use efficiency aruel which was probably related to the optimization of canopy structure and the increase of canopy extinction capacity under moderate deficit irrigation camargo et al 2016 liu et al 2016b zhou et al 2016 however di50 decreased aruel possibly due to the decrease in absorptive and transformative capacity of photosynthetically active radiation caused by severe water deficit the shading level had pronounced effect on leaf photosynthesis transpiration water use efficiency wuel and aruel of arabica coffee which was consistent with the results of the related studies araujo et al 2008 bote and struik 2011 dong et al 2016 in this study sh30 increased leaf net photosynthetic rate and wuel probably because suitable shading reduced the damage of strong sunlight to photosynthetic mechanism alleviated the phenomenon of midday depression improved the chlorophyll and ps ii light conversion efficiency reduced heat dissipation and made up the relative lack of light so the photosynthetic efficiency was enhanced charbonnier et al 2017 li et al 2014 xu et al 2010 however the effect of sh0 might have photo inhibition inactivation or damage to the light system reaction center of leaves simultaneously thickened the cell wall and restricted the gas exchange rate which finally may lead to the decrease of photosynthetic rate han et al 2017 insufficient radiation in sh60 possibly led to the decrease of photosynthetic electron transport and key enzymes thus reducing the net photosynthetic rate and wuel mishanin et al 2017 zheng and yang 2008 shading significantly raised aruel possibly because shade leaves increased the distribution ratio of electron transport quantum in the psii reaction center and reduced the quantum ratio for heat dissipation jia et al 2015 and the results also showed that coffee leaves had a certain ability of regulation and adaption for weak light stress bloor 2003 wang et al 2009 the interaction between irrigation and shading had significant effects on aruel which was probably related to the regulation of root zone soil water content by irrigation and the change of canopy microclimate environment by shading thus the effective transformation of photosynthetically active radiation was changed liu et al 2017 in this study the marginal yield of dry bean was the maximum when irrigation amount and shading degree were appropriately reduced the marginal yield was negative when shading level ranged from sh30 to sh45 or from sh45 to sh60 mainly because excessive shading decreased solar radiation intercepted by canopy which resulted in insufficient photosynthetic product synthesis and supply capacity in leaves damatta 2004 liu et al 2017 yildirim et al 2017 di75sh30 could simultaneously achieve maximum water use efficiency wue and higher dry bean yield indicating that moderate deficit irrigation could basically meet the growth requirement of coffee under suitable shading possibly because sh30 increased leaf net photosynthetic rate and wuel but decreased ineffective evaporation of soil surface water bote and struik 2011 evizal 2016 severe deficit irrigation in di50 significantly reduced the yield and wue under different shading levels probably because soil water stress reduced flower bud differentiation and fruit number of coffee and inhibited the growth and development of fruit sakai et al 2015 the results indicated that irrigation level had marked effect on most of nutritional quality indices in coffee dry bean which was probably related to the effects of soil moisture on photosynthetic characteristics photosynthate accumulation transportation and transformation of inorganic and organic compounds in plants du and kang 2011 xu et al 2004 mild deficit irrigation di75 increased the contents of crude fat and chlorogenic acid in dry bean and thus improved the nutritional quality which was in consistent with the previous results patanè et al 2011 santesteban et al 2011 tesfaye et al 2013 however severe deficit irrigation di50 might lead to the damage of beneficial nutrient components thereby decreasing the nutritional quality of coffee bean with the rising of water stress chlorogenic acid content in coffee bean firstly increased and then decreased probably because sufficient irrigation had a dilution effect on accumulation of chlorogenic acid xing et al 2015 while plant primary productivity was greatly inhibited and raw materials for the synthesis of secondary products were decreased under severe water deficit irrigation liu et al 2016a shading level had significant effects on the contents of total sugar protein crude fat caffeine and chlorogenic acid which was probably related to the change of micro climatic environment for coffee growth by shading the adjustment of the physiological processes such as absorption distribution and synthesis of nutrients and induction and regulation of synthesis and accumulation of secondary metabolites in different tissues and cells of plants ozden 2014 zhang et al 2009 there were many indices affecting the nutritional quality of coffee and the indices interacted each other however the evaluation index was relatively simple huang et al 2012 läderach et al 2011 in this study two principal components extracted by principal component analysis were used to evaluate the comprehensive nutritional quality of dry bean and the results indicated that di75sh30 had the best comprehensive nutritional quality and di75sh30 had the highest comprehensive benefit based on dry bean yield nutritional quality and water use efficiency using the improved topsis method and this treatment not only had higher yield and water use efficiency but also improved the nutritional quality of dry bean therefore the combination of moderate deficit irrigation saving irrigation water by 25 and proper shading 30 shading could simultaneously achieve water saving suitable yield and better quality the results could provide practical reference for the deficit irrigation and shading management of arabica coffee in dry and hot regions 5 conclusions 1 compared to full irrigation mild deficit irrigation improved leaf apparent radiation use efficiency and nutritional quality of arabica coffee 2 compared with no shading 30 shading improved the yield and water use efficiency of arabica coffee and nutritional quality of dry bean 3 mild deficit irrigation could improve water use efficiency and nutritional quality of arabica coffee without yield reduction under proper shading the treatment of 75 full irrigation amount and 30 shading had optimal comprehensive benefit of coffee yield nutritional quality and water use efficiency thus this treatment was a suitable irrigation and shading management for arabica coffee in dry and hot

11461,agricultural landscapes contain many different soil types with heterogeneous nitrogen n attenuation capacity typically a zone of contribution zoc surrounding a borehole is used to interpret subsurface hydro biogeochemical functional capacity this presents a net interpretation of source and attenuation within these calculated areas herein we use the concept of zoc commonly used for borehole screen intervals but for an end of pipe location within four hydrologically isolated plots water samples from end of pipe and piezometer locations are examined for nitrogen n biogeochemical dissolved gas and isotopic viewpoints to elucidate multi layered net water provenance n source transformations and fate results showed a nitrate no3 n plume migrating in shallow groundwater between 0 39 and 8 07 mg n l with low concentrations in the shallow artificial drainage system below 3 22 mg n l water provenance data showed distinct signatures of precipitation and deep groundwater at 3 4 m below ground level bgl and water entering migrating and discharging at the end of pipe location the latter signature was caused by enrichment of δ18o h2o during migration this means there was disconnectivity on site with no interaction between water migrating through the drainage pipe at 1 m and deeper groundwater migrating at 3 4 m depth the analysis of no3 n concentration and its isotopic signature δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 identified further connections between screen interval depths and an up gradient organic point source with elevated no3 n migrating at this depth and different transformation processes occurring at different depths temporally no3 n concentrations at this depth have decreased over time fenton et al documented an average of 7 5 4 5 mg n l whereas ibrahim et al documented an average of 6 8 3 7 mg n l at this depth the point source was removed in 2006 and no3 n concentration in the present study have further reduced to an average of 3 9 2 8 mg n l end of pipe data at 1 m bgl highlighted connectivity with the overlying plot and showed different water attenuation functionality than the deeper system end of pipe locations clustered together along the denitrification line this highlighted a consistency of signals across the four plots in terms of what occurs in the soil profile above the drain installation depth of 1 m at 3 4 m bgl however samples varied spatially showing inconsistency between the end of pipe locations and plots indicating the occurrence of different processes a fuller characterisation of dairy farm n sustainability can be deemed using the net provenance n source n transformation and fate methodology presented future work should investigate how drainage design shallow and groundwater affects n transformation and the net concept developed herein should be rolled out to rank dairy farms in terms of their n attenuation capacity keywords land drainage agriculture nitrogen natural isotopic abundances dissolved gases 1 introduction agricultural landscapes contain many different soil types with varied drainage classes this spatial arrangement of soils presents a soil scape of varying soil functional capacity all soils perform a set of functions i e water purification carbon sequestration nutrient cycling food production fibre and fuel habitat for biodiversity however they differ in terms of rate schulte et al 2014 one such function is water attenuation the ability to naturally reduce water contamination which in terms of n changes across drainage classes coyle et al 2016 poorly drained soils present highest capacity while free draining soils present the lowest capacity nitrate lost from agricultural systems migrates and transforms along many different subsurface pathways once no3 n leaches to a drainage system it migrates laterally and the transformation potential becomes reduced this pathway has been well characterised in terms of no3 n concentration and flow which of course enables flux calculations skaggs et al 1994 kladivko et al 2004 tiemeyer et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 attenuation over time using flux is a tool used to infer natural attenuation fenton et al 2009 but gives no insights into water origin source of n or indeed what transformation processes are involved others have investigated different aspects such as spatial and temporal changes in n speciation ibrahim et al 2013 and indirect emissions weymann et al 2008 on pasture artificial drainage systems are installed in imperfect or poorly drained plots potentially altering the inherent natural attenuation or water purification function in the immediate area of the drain installation around the pipe mole gravel mole gravel pack thereby altering transformations within the zoc drained by this system as used within flux calculations a single sampling point i e an end of pipe eop location can be therefore used to examine the functional capacity of this larger area this concept has been already explored in groundwater systems using boreholes and associated zocs typically subsurface hydro biogeochemical functional areas gonzalez inca et al 2015 are difficult to delineate with studies such as jahangir et al 2012a 2012b or rivas et al 2017 relying on borehole networks to identify various factors that can be used to characterise the transformational potential of these subsurface environments for example fenton et al 2009 used similar techniques boreholes and associated zocs and identified a strong correlation between no3 n concentration in shallow groundwater distance from a known point source and subsoil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks this allows prediction of natural attenuation areas but gives no further insights into origin n source or attenuation an artificial drainage system if characterised correctly in terms of position depth of installation and lateral extent and connectivity with a set of multi techniques physiochemical dissolved gases and isotopic analyses could provide such insights and give more characterisation power above that of flux alone kellman 2005 investigated eop water samples under controlled conditions to investigate δ15n no3 signature differences between inorganic and organic inputs whereas the signature data was distinct to a particular known source it was demonstrated that isotopic fractionation did not alter source signatures on another isolated site the same as the present study ibrahim et al 2013 investigated n speciation in runoff artificial land drainage installed at 1 m depth and shallow groundwater at 3 4 m depth tracing n losses across rainfall events that study showed that n losses were higher in runoff and groundwater with lowest losses discharging from the subsurface drains this pointed to a multi layered system in terms of source connectivity and the present study investigates this further dissolved organic nitrogen don dominated losses but dissolved inorganic n was more abundant in subsurface drains both studies did not characterise the provenance origin of the water within the system or the transformational processes that resulted in particularly high or low n concentrations natural isotopic techniques δd h2o δ18o h2o δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can be used for the identification of water provenance processes such as nitrification and denitrification and sources this procedure can be carried out at a single moment whereas n concentrations need to be taken over time when combined with other methods these natural isotopic techniques e g dissolved gas in water samples and biogeochemical parameters could give greater insight into n source and transformational processes at a given site baily et al 2011 jahangir et al 2012a pastén zapata et al 2014 wells et al 2016 to our knowledge the use of a combination of multiple techniques e g physiochemical dissolved gases and isotopic analyses has never been attempted under hydrologically isolated field conditions such controlled conditions enable a more defined interpretation of results and therefore present an opportunity to examine a single eop water samples as net provenance source and transformation indicators for a large zoc and b single shallow groundwater samples from screen intervals as net provenance source and transformation indicators for an associated zoc knowledge pertaining to on site eop and shallow groundwater no3 n flux has already been established in various publication fenton et al 2009 ibrahim et al 2013 therefore the objectives of the present study using historic and additional fieldwork were to utilise eop and piezometer net approaches across four isolated grassland plots in the south east of ireland to 1 characterise n migration through the multi layered site using dissolved gases n species and biogeochemical parameters and 2 to characterise isotopic signatures of h2o and no3 n to elucidate the net provenance of water source of n and the transformational processes and the interaction of fate of n on this multi layered site 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the site is located on the beef farm at the teagasc johnstown castle environmental research centre co wexford se ireland 52 17 36 n 6 31 6 w fig 1 a it has a cool maritime climate with mean annual precipitation of 1002 mm and annual temperature 9 6 c ibrahim et al 2013 the isolated plots 4 2 ha in total 2 slope were installed in 2005 and contain six plots separated by 4 m deep open ditches that intersect shallow groundwater to understand the overburden soil and subsoil lateral variations and thicknesses an electromagnetic em conductivity and resistivity survey was conducted on site in september 2009 apex geoservices ltd ie fig 1b for the em survey values ranged from 15 to 38 ms m and were interpreted as 26 mainly silt clay 20 26 mainly gravelly clay and 20 represent silty clayey gravel lenses within the gravelly clay this means that in fig 1b plots 1 2 are dominated by 20 green yellow red heavier in terms of soil texture with some 20 blue lighter in texture and better drainage whereas plots 3 4 are dominated by 20 blue with some 20 green from a no3 n distribution perspective this interpretation matches that of fenton et al 2009 where higher no3 n concentration migrates in blue areas of fig 1b which have a high ks and a lower water attenuation capacity i e natural ability of the soil to bioremediate contaminants in this case no3 n depending upon hydrologic and biological factors plots 1 and 2 are grouped as poorly drained whereas plots 4 and 5 are grouped as imperfectly drained in

laterals 10 m spacing with a single end of pipe discharge point which can be sampled installed at 1 m depth in each plot intercepted infiltrating water but also drained shallow groundwater when the water table raised above the position of the drains an important aspect of the present study is to use isotopes to elucidate the origin of eop water when it is sampled and to find out if it contains a distinct rainwater signal or a groundwater signal or indeed both due to the slope on site the water table position was shallow at the bottom field position and deepened towards the top position each

up gradient field sand hill excessive irrigation hydraulic loads promoted leaching of n which was subsequently mineralised and currently migrates as no3 n in shallow groundwater underneath the isolated plots for the drainage system zoc the lateral length of the drain multiplied by the spacing involved 10 m was used in the current study this equated to a zoc larger than the plots themselves i e plots 1 2 3 and 4 have a zoc of 1 0 0 9 0 4 and 0 4 ha respectively this indicated that all infiltrating water within each plot discharged through eop locations and the isolated nature of the plots open ditches were deeper than the installation depth on all sides of each plot ensured no up gradient or lateral run on therefore the zoc for each of the plots was the actual surface area of

other variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen distribution dissolved gases and water provenance due to the high n surpluses 219 kg n ha identified with the partial n balance this site has the potential for high n leaching from fields to the drainage system and groundwater groundwater sampled within plot 1 showed increasing no3 n values from top to bottom t 0 89 m 1 90 and b 2 55 mg n l plot 2 b 0 39 mg n l contained lowest no3 n concentrations plot 3 showed higher no3 n concentrations t 5 34 m 4 71 and b 6 46 mg n l with one piezometer breaching the contamination threshold of 5 65 mg n l daly 2000 this threshold indicates the presence of a significant contamination but not pollution due to either inorganic fertiliser or an organic waste source in plot 4 each piezometer showed values above the threshold t 6 31 m 8 07 and b 6 05 mg n l no sample was above the maximum admissible concentrations mac of 11 3 mg no3 n l eu 2014 from a temporal side the average no3 n concentration within groundwater has been declining over time for example it was 7 5 4 5 mg n l from 2006 to 2007 fenton et al 2009 but a later study by ibrahim et al 2013 showed that this average concentration decreased further during the 2007 2008 sampling period to 6 8 3 7 mg no3 n l and continued to be low at eop locations with an average of only 0 45 0 63 mg n l natural attenuation and removal of the point source in 2006 has enabled average groundwater concentrations to reach 3 9 2 8 mg n l and 1 18 1 78 mg n l for eop locations in the present study the water table position for top middle bottom locations for plots 1 2 3 were 2 2 1 1 2 3 m bgl n a 0 45 0 85 m bgl and 2 8 1 5 0 8 respectively this equates with the em survey on the site where plot 2 contained heavier textured soils with higher water attenuation function and a corresponding shallow water table plot 2 showed a much greater groundwater interaction with the artificial drainage system than the other plots eop locations showed no3 n value of 3 22 mg n l plot 1 0 00 mg n l plot 2 and 0 31 mg n l plot 3 table 1 in agreement with ibrahim et al 2013 the high concentrations in the groundwater did not express themselves at eop locations which generally had lower values than the groundwater samples i e from 0 02 to 1 34 mg n l dissolved gas data aids with net transformation interpretation and indeed indirect emissions relate to the fate of n groundwater was characterised by dissolved n2o values in the range of 0 0035 and 0 0739 mg n l while excess n2 ranged from 0 1417 to 0 9954 mg n l values for ef5g 1 ranged from 0 0098 to 0 0020 ef5g 2 0 0261 0 0039 with only one shallow groundwater location showing values below 0 0025 ipcc set default value for groundwater n2o emission ipcc 2006 table 1 dissolved n2o average 0 0427 mg n l was higher than previous values recorded on another site within the same farm 0 024 mg n l jahangir et al 2013 while excess n2 was lower 0 4575 vs 2 28 mg n l plots 1 and 2 showed lower p 0 01 dissolved n2o av 0 0227 mg n l when compared with plots 3 and 4 showing sign of contamination av 0 0560 mg n l excess n2 on plots 1 and 2 averaged 0 5204 mg n l slightly higher than plots 3 and 4 av 0 4197 mg n l plots 1 2 showed similar total emissions dissolved n2o excess n2 to plots 3 4 0 4130 and 0 4097 mg n l respectively however plots 3 and 4 showed higher values of n2o n2o n2 which might indicate a higher component of incomplete denitrification end of pipe locations showed dissolved n2o values between 0 0009 and 0 0049 mg n l while for excess n2 between 0 0223 and 0 1945 mg n l end of pipe samples in plot 3 showed ef5g 1 values above the ipcc standard while these were below the standard in plots 1 and 2 in terms of net origin of water in samples groundwater piezometer samples exhibited variability across the site with h2o stable isotopes ranging from 3 2 and 8 5 for δ18o h2o and from 33 4 and 41 5 for δd h2o fig 2 samples within groundwater showed a signature consistent with the high humidity climate for the british isles δ18o h2o from 8 5 to 5 δd h2o from 30 to 55 specifically for the wexford region δ18o h2o from 6 5 to 5 5 δd h2o from 35 to 45 darling et al 2003 this means that precipitation irish long term weighted mean for precipitation 5 5 for δ18o h2o and 36 for δd h2o and groundwater at 3 4 m have a distinctive signal water entering the drainage pipe a mix of shallow groundwater surrounding the pipe within the zoc and infiltrating water from the soil profile above has a second distinctive signal that can be seen in the depleted values for δ18o h2o within plot 2 and 3 groundwater has been found to generally reflect a rainfall signature however evaporation from soil and surface detention storage can produce evaporative enrichment and local evaporation lines gibson et al 2005 kim and lee 2011 klaus et al 2015 in fig 2 two out of three eop samples show a shift towards the left i e enrichment this enrichment could be due to migration from deposition to the eop location with possible evaporation from soil and within the drainage system itself the eop samples from plot 1 however show a common signature with groundwater samples that could be signifying a reduction of evaporation or a higher interaction with groundwater within this field and or pipe the drainage design was therefore insufficient to control the water table below the drainage systems for all locations in the field ibrahim et al 2013 noticed a reduction in terms of no3 n concentration from groundwater to eop samples at this same site here both the h2o signature and no3 n concentration data are highlighting disconnectivity with subsurface transfer pathways and dissolved reactive n nr migration pathways on the site potentially are as follows 1 infiltration of rainwater directly to the drainage system 2 recharge of infiltrating water from the plot which does not go into the drainage system but recharges to shallow groundwater and 3 groundwater that interacts with the drainage system as the water table rises and could come from an offsite location and or the paddock however shallow groundwater at 3 4 m depth piezometer samples 1 m screen interval is not likely to interact with the drainage system at 1 m depth due to the heavy texture of the soil only groundwater around the drainage pipe ends up as a part of the end of pipe sample this gives a multi layered system that exhibits disconnectivity on site between a a nitrate plume associated with an up gradient source migrating at depth and b low levels of leached n or high attenuation capacity above the drainage system within the isolated paddock thereby resulting in unpolluted water discharging from the end of pipe location 3 2 n source and transformation processes no3 n isotopic signatures were determined by the combination of n sources and transformational processes affecting the original pool of no3 n xue et al 2009 shallow groundwater and eop samples from the four plots showed values between the ranges typically associated with a manure sewage source kendall 1998 the occurrence of specific processes is characterised by specific fractionation factors which leads to the creation of specific signatures within the residual pools since organisms preferentially use lighter isotopes the microbiological process cause an enrichment of heavy isotopes in the remaining source pool with a depletion in the product signature kendall 1998 ranges are known for several n sources and processes e g denitrification and nitrification and a recent review has summarised these for agricultural areas nikolenko et al 2017 specifically it was highlighted that when denitrification occurs this process follows a linear trend generally a 1 1 1 2 trend granger et al 2008 granger and wankel 2016 hernandez del amo et al 2018 both piezometers and eop locations showed a clustered pattern along a 1 1 1 2 line indicating an influence of denitrification in the transformation of no3 n fig 3 this was consistent with the study of baily et al 2011 on a neighbouring dairy site and was consistent across seasons and in terms of the source the absence of nh4 n contamination within the field seems to exclude dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process that reduces no3 n to no2 n and then to nh4 n however distinguishing between denitrification and dnra is difficult as the isotope effect of dnra has still not been investigated alkhatib et al 2012 wells et al 2016 the no3 n isotopic composition showed low spatial variability shallow groundwater average δ15n no3 was 11 1 maximum 23 2 minimum 6 0 whereas average δ18o no3 was 7 2 maximum 11 0 minimum 0 0 plots 1 2 showed larger spatial variability whereas plots 3 4 showed less variability with data clustering as in fig 3 end of pipe locations had average δ15n no3 of 9 4 1 2 and 6 6 1 8 for δ18o no3 fig 3 end of pipe locations shared the same transformation signature as for groundwater from plots 3 and 4 fig 3 this indicated a consistency of signal across all four plots in terms of which microbial process occurred within the soil profile above the drain installation depth of 1 m the inconsistency of signal within the piezometer monitoring system for plots 1 2 i e high spatial variation and no indication of clustering along the denitrification line indicates the occurrence of a different or a mix of processes e g nitrification dnra anammox fenton et al 2009 identified ks as one of the main explanatory parameters for no3 n concentration suggesting that lower ks equates with higher attenuation capacity and therefore low concentrations of no3 n therefore ks areas present lower attenuation areas and therefore give rise to higher no3 n concentrations in groundwater herein groundwater samples which clustered along the denitrification line had a higher enrichment of both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 matching lower ks areas fig 4 as ks and no3 enrichment correlate well no3 n fractionation shows potential to be used to identify denitrification hotspots within agricultural areas as can be seen from the present study in addition to n flux eop water samples can also provide information to elucidate net water origin n source and give further insights into n transformational processes when combining data from different monitoring networks at the same site data can be used to investigate the connectivity or indeed disconnectivity as found in the present study between these two monitoring depths at the present site dissolved gas in eop samples allowed for greater interpretation of shallow subsurface net denitrification processes above and around a drainage system the classification of an artificial drainage system location and design type depth and spacing and their study in terms of physiochemical gaseous and isotopic parameters are essential to understand the fate of n and guide future installation and management future work should consider the different types of land drainage design including shallow disruptive techniques and their role in the water attenuation function of soils on agricultural landscapes a multi level piezometer network could then be used to compliment such interpretations for all other areas and depths outside the influence of the drainage system indeed the open ditch network should be investigated further as part of this system broadening out this type of n characterisation across dairy farms in specific geographical locations with specific rainfall and soil conditions e g poorly drained soils could enable the ranking of farms based on their n attenuation capacity this would aid specific components of water quality sustainability on these sites 4 conclusions the concept of flux is well established using concentration and flow data from land drainage eop or borehole screen intervals however this data tells very little about the net origin of a water sample the source of n in that sample or indeed the transformational processes responsible for the n concentrations in that sample this study showed that collating isotopic dissolved gas and biophysical data from eop and groundwater locations creates a clearer conceptual model of a site water origin results indicated disconnectivity between the two sample depths studied groundwater at 3 4 m depth was connected with an up gradient dairy soiled water irrigation point source with elevated nitrate concentrations migrating at this depth end of pipe water at 1 m depth had low nitrate concentrations multi techniques highlighted connectivity with the overlying plot with a different water attenuation functionality than the deeper system denitrification was the main process of attenuation which was correlated with subsoil ks land drainage systems in connection with a multi technique analysis can be used to examine the water attenuation function of soils over larger areas future work should investigate how drainage system design e g shallow and groundwater affects n transformation and this method should be broadened to rank commercial dairy farms in terms of their n attenuation capacity acknowledgements the study was funded by the teagasc

11461,agricultural landscapes contain many different soil types with heterogeneous nitrogen n attenuation capacity typically a zone of contribution zoc surrounding a borehole is used to interpret subsurface hydro biogeochemical functional capacity this presents a net interpretation of source and attenuation within these calculated areas herein we use the concept of zoc commonly used for borehole screen intervals but for an end of pipe location within four hydrologically isolated plots water samples from end of pipe and piezometer locations are examined for nitrogen n biogeochemical dissolved gas and isotopic viewpoints to elucidate multi layered net water provenance n source transformations and fate results showed a nitrate no3 n plume migrating in shallow groundwater between 0 39 and 8 07 mg n l with low concentrations in the shallow artificial drainage system below 3 22 mg n l water provenance data showed distinct signatures of precipitation and deep groundwater at 3 4 m below ground level bgl and water entering migrating and discharging at the end of pipe location the latter signature was caused by enrichment of δ18o h2o during migration this means there was disconnectivity on site with no interaction between water migrating through the drainage pipe at 1 m and deeper groundwater migrating at 3 4 m depth the analysis of no3 n concentration and its isotopic signature δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 identified further connections between screen interval depths and an up gradient organic point source with elevated no3 n migrating at this depth and different transformation processes occurring at different depths temporally no3 n concentrations at this depth have decreased over time fenton et al documented an average of 7 5 4 5 mg n l whereas ibrahim et al documented an average of 6 8 3 7 mg n l at this depth the point source was removed in 2006 and no3 n concentration in the present study have further reduced to an average of 3 9 2 8 mg n l end of pipe data at 1 m bgl highlighted connectivity with the overlying plot and showed different water attenuation functionality than the deeper system end of pipe locations clustered together along the denitrification line this highlighted a consistency of signals across the four plots in terms of what occurs in the soil profile above the drain installation depth of 1 m at 3 4 m bgl however samples varied spatially showing inconsistency between the end of pipe locations and plots indicating the occurrence of different processes a fuller characterisation of dairy farm n sustainability can be deemed using the net provenance n source n transformation and fate methodology presented future work should investigate how drainage design shallow and groundwater affects n transformation and the net concept developed herein should be rolled out to rank dairy farms in terms of their n attenuation capacity keywords land drainage agriculture nitrogen natural isotopic abundances dissolved gases 1 introduction agricultural landscapes contain many different soil types with varied drainage classes this spatial arrangement of soils presents a soil scape of varying soil functional capacity all soils perform a set of functions i e water purification carbon sequestration nutrient cycling food production fibre and fuel habitat for biodiversity however they differ in terms of rate schulte et al 2014 one such function is water attenuation the ability to naturally reduce water contamination which in terms of n changes across drainage classes coyle et al 2016 poorly drained soils present highest capacity while free draining soils present the lowest capacity nitrate lost from agricultural systems migrates and transforms along many different subsurface pathways once no3 n leaches to a drainage system it migrates laterally and the transformation potential becomes reduced this pathway has been well characterised in terms of no3 n concentration and flow which of course enables flux calculations skaggs et al 1994 kladivko et al 2004 tiemeyer et al 2008 zhao et al 2016 attenuation over time using flux is a tool used to infer natural attenuation fenton et al 2009 but gives no insights into water origin source of n or indeed what transformation processes are involved others have investigated different aspects such as spatial and temporal changes in n speciation ibrahim et al 2013 and indirect emissions weymann et al 2008 on pasture artificial drainage systems are installed in imperfect or poorly drained plots potentially altering the inherent natural attenuation or water purification function in the immediate area of the drain installation around the pipe mole gravel mole gravel pack thereby altering transformations within the zoc drained by this system as used within flux calculations a single sampling point i e an end of pipe eop location can be therefore used to examine the functional capacity of this larger area this concept has been already explored in groundwater systems using boreholes and associated zocs typically subsurface hydro biogeochemical functional areas gonzalez inca et al 2015 are difficult to delineate with studies such as jahangir et al 2012a 2012b or rivas et al 2017 relying on borehole networks to identify various factors that can be used to characterise the transformational potential of these subsurface environments for example fenton et al 2009 used similar techniques boreholes and associated zocs and identified a strong correlation between no3 n concentration in shallow groundwater distance from a known point source and subsoil saturated hydraulic conductivity ks this allows prediction of natural attenuation areas but gives no further insights into origin n source or attenuation an artificial drainage system if characterised correctly in terms of position depth of installation and lateral extent and connectivity with a set of multi techniques physiochemical dissolved gases and isotopic analyses could provide such insights and give more characterisation power above that of flux alone kellman 2005 investigated eop water samples under controlled conditions to investigate δ15n no3 signature differences between inorganic and organic inputs whereas the signature data was distinct to a particular known source it was demonstrated that isotopic fractionation did not alter source signatures on another isolated site the same as the present study ibrahim et al 2013 investigated n speciation in runoff artificial land drainage installed at 1 m depth and shallow groundwater at 3 4 m depth tracing n losses across rainfall events that study showed that n losses were higher in runoff and groundwater with lowest losses discharging from the subsurface drains this pointed to a multi layered system in terms of source connectivity and the present study investigates this further dissolved organic nitrogen don dominated losses but dissolved inorganic n was more abundant in subsurface drains both studies did not characterise the provenance origin of the water within the system or the transformational processes that resulted in particularly high or low n concentrations natural isotopic techniques δd h2o δ18o h2o δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can be used for the identification of water provenance processes such as nitrification and denitrification and sources this procedure can be carried out at a single moment whereas n concentrations need to be taken over time when combined with other methods these natural isotopic techniques e g dissolved gas in water samples and biogeochemical parameters could give greater insight into n source and transformational processes at a given site baily et al 2011 jahangir et al 2012a pastén zapata et al 2014 wells et al 2016 to our knowledge the use of a combination of multiple techniques e g physiochemical dissolved gases and isotopic analyses has never been attempted under hydrologically isolated field conditions such controlled conditions enable a more defined interpretation of results and therefore present an opportunity to examine a single eop water samples as net provenance source and transformation indicators for a large zoc and b single shallow groundwater samples from screen intervals as net provenance source and transformation indicators for an associated zoc knowledge pertaining to on site eop and shallow groundwater no3 n flux has already been established in various publication fenton et al 2009 ibrahim et al 2013 therefore the objectives of the present study using historic and additional fieldwork were to utilise eop and piezometer net approaches across four isolated grassland plots in the south east of ireland to 1 characterise n migration through the multi layered site using dissolved gases n species and biogeochemical parameters and 2 to characterise isotopic signatures of h2o and no3 n to elucidate the net provenance of water source of n and the transformational processes and the interaction of fate of n on this multi layered site 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the site is located on the beef farm at the teagasc johnstown castle environmental research centre co wexford se ireland 52 17 36 n 6 31 6 w fig 1 a it has a cool maritime climate with mean annual precipitation of 1002 mm and annual temperature 9 6 c ibrahim et al 2013 the isolated plots 4 2 ha in total 2 slope were installed in 2005 and contain six plots separated by 4 m deep open ditches that intersect shallow groundwater to understand the overburden soil and subsoil lateral variations and thicknesses an electromagnetic em conductivity and resistivity survey was conducted on site in september 2009 apex geoservices ltd ie fig 1b for the em survey values ranged from 15 to 38 ms m and were interpreted as 26 mainly silt clay 20 26 mainly gravelly clay and 20 represent silty clayey gravel lenses within the gravelly clay this means that in fig 1b plots 1 2 are dominated by 20 green yellow red heavier in terms of soil texture with some 20 blue lighter in texture and better drainage whereas plots 3 4 are dominated by 20 blue with some 20 green from a no3 n distribution perspective this interpretation matches that of fenton et al 2009 where higher no3 n concentration migrates in blue areas of fig 1b which have a high ks and a lower water attenuation capacity i e natural ability of the soil to bioremediate contaminants in this case no3 n depending upon hydrologic and biological factors plots 1 and 2 are grouped as poorly drained whereas plots 4 and 5 are grouped as imperfectly drained in terms of geology the cullenstown formation is present on site except in the south west where rocks of the shelmaliere formation are indicated the cullenstown formation is described as grey green metagreywacke and slate and ranges from 6 5 m to 16 5 m depth the geological survey of ireland subsoils map gsi 2018 indicates till derived from metamorphic rocks a narrow strip of alluvium is indicated along the western boundary of the survey area and also along the stream valley to the south the geological survey of ireland vulnerability map for the area indicates that the groundwater vulnerability rating of the site is high the bedrock is listed as a locally important aquifer all plots had three installed piezometers at top middle and bottom locations drilled to 4 m depth with a 1

laterals 10 m spacing with a single end of pipe discharge point which can be sampled installed at 1 m depth in each plot intercepted infiltrating water but also drained shallow groundwater when the water table raised above the position of the drains an important aspect of the present study is to use isotopes to elucidate the origin of eop water when it is sampled and to find out if it contains a distinct rainwater signal or a groundwater signal or indeed both due to the slope on site the water table position was shallow at the bottom field position and deepened towards the top position each plot had 4 sampling locations a three piezometer screened sampling points and b a single eop location that gave a composite of the entire paddock at 1 m depth for the purposes of the present study

organic fertiliser and 58 kg n ha feed concentrate and n surpluses of 219 kg n ha calculated as the difference between inputs and outputs 123 kg n ha milk plus 16 kg n ha slurry data from 2014 annual farm balance fenton et al 2009 calculated a zoc from piezometer screen data on the present study site which connected these monitoring points with a point source a soiled water irrigation system in an up gradient field sand hill excessive irrigation hydraulic loads promoted leaching of n which was subsequently mineralised and currently migrates as no3 n in shallow groundwater underneath the isolated plots for the drainage system zoc the lateral length of the drain multiplied by the spacing involved 10 m was used in the current study this equated to a zoc larger than the plots themselves i e plots 1 2 3 and 4 have a zoc of 1 0 0 9 0 4 and 0 4 ha respectively this indicated that all infiltrating water within each plot discharged through eop locations and the isolated nature of the plots open ditches were deeper than the installation depth on all sides of each plot ensured no up gradient or lateral run on therefore the zoc for each of the plots was the actual surface area of each plot down to 1 m depth 2 2 data collection water samples were collected in october 2014 samples from piezometers were collected using a bladder pump flow rate of 100 ml min geotech environmental

other variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen distribution dissolved gases and water provenance due to the high n surpluses 219 kg n ha identified with the partial n balance this site has the potential for high n leaching from fields to the drainage system and groundwater groundwater sampled within plot 1 showed increasing no3 n values from top to bottom t 0 89 m 1 90 and b 2 55 mg n l plot 2 b 0 39 mg n l contained lowest no3 n concentrations plot 3 showed higher no3 n concentrations t 5 34 m 4 71 and b 6 46 mg n l with one piezometer breaching the contamination threshold of 5 65 mg n l daly 2000 this threshold indicates the presence of a significant contamination but not pollution due to either inorganic fertiliser or an organic waste source in plot 4 each piezometer showed values above the threshold t 6 31 m 8 07 and b 6 05 mg n l no sample was above the maximum admissible concentrations mac of 11 3 mg no3 n l eu 2014 from a temporal side the average no3 n concentration within groundwater has been declining over time for example it was 7 5 4 5 mg n l from 2006 to 2007 fenton et al 2009 but a later study by ibrahim et al 2013 showed that this average concentration decreased further during the 2007 2008 sampling period to 6 8 3 7 mg no3 n l and continued to be low at eop locations with an average of only 0 45 0 63 mg n l natural attenuation and removal of the point source in 2006 has enabled average groundwater concentrations to reach 3 9 2 8 mg n l and 1 18 1 78 mg n l for eop locations in the present study the water table position for top middle bottom locations for plots 1 2 3 were 2 2 1 1 2 3 m bgl n a 0 45 0 85 m bgl and 2 8 1 5 0 8 respectively this equates with the em survey on the site where plot 2 contained heavier textured soils with higher water attenuation function and a corresponding shallow water table plot 2 showed a much greater groundwater interaction with the artificial drainage system than the other plots eop locations showed no3 n value of 3 22 mg n l plot 1 0 00 mg n l plot 2 and 0 31 mg n l plot 3 table 1 in agreement with ibrahim et al 2013 the high concentrations in the groundwater did not express themselves at eop locations which generally had lower values than the groundwater samples i e from 0 02 to 1 34 mg n l dissolved gas data aids with net transformation interpretation and indeed indirect emissions relate to the fate of n groundwater was characterised by dissolved n2o values in the range of 0 0035 and 0 0739 mg n l while excess n2 ranged from 0 1417 to 0 9954 mg n l values for ef5g 1 ranged from 0 0098 to 0 0020 ef5g 2 0 0261 0 0039 with only one shallow groundwater location showing values below 0 0025 ipcc set default value for groundwater n2o emission ipcc 2006 table 1 dissolved n2o average 0 0427

dissolved n2o av 0 0227 mg n l when compared with plots 3 and 4 showing sign of contamination av 0 0560 mg n l excess n2 on plots 1 and 2 averaged 0 5204 mg n l slightly higher than plots 3 and 4 av 0 4197 mg n l plots 1 2 showed similar total emissions dissolved n2o excess n2 to plots 3 4 0 4130 and 0 4097 mg n l respectively however plots 3 and 4 showed higher values of n2o n2o n2 which might indicate a higher component of incomplete denitrification end of pipe locations showed dissolved n2o values between 0 0009 and 0 0049 mg n l while for excess n2 between 0 0223 and 0 1945 mg n l end of pipe samples in plot 3 showed ef5g 1 values above the ipcc standard while these were below the standard in plots 1 and 2 in terms of net origin of water in samples groundwater piezometer samples exhibited variability across the site with h2o stable isotopes ranging from 3 2 and 8 5 for δ18o h2o and from 33 4 and 41 5 for δd h2o fig 2 samples within groundwater showed a signature consistent with the high humidity climate for the british isles δ18o h2o from 8 5 to 5 δd h2o from 30 to 55 specifically for the wexford region δ18o h2o from 6 5 to 5 5 δd h2o from 35 to 45 darling et al 2003 this means that precipitation irish long term weighted mean for precipitation 5 5 for δ18o h2o and 36 for δd h2o and groundwater at 3 4 m have a distinctive signal water entering the drainage pipe a mix of shallow groundwater surrounding the pipe within the zoc and infiltrating water from the soil profile above has a second distinctive signal that can be seen in the depleted values for δ18o h2o within plot 2 and 3 groundwater has been found to generally reflect a rainfall signature however evaporation from soil and surface detention storage can produce evaporative enrichment and local evaporation lines gibson et al 2005 kim and lee 2011 klaus et al 2015 in fig 2 two out of three eop samples show a shift towards the left i e enrichment this enrichment could be due to migration from deposition to the eop location with possible evaporation from soil and within the drainage system itself the eop samples from plot 1 however show a common signature with groundwater samples that could be signifying a reduction of evaporation or a higher interaction with groundwater within this field and or pipe the drainage design was therefore insufficient to control the water table below the drainage systems for all locations in the field ibrahim et al 2013 noticed a reduction in terms of no3 n concentration from groundwater to eop samples at this same site here both the h2o signature and no3 n concentration data are highlighting disconnectivity with subsurface transfer pathways and dissolved reactive n nr migration pathways on the site potentially are as follows 1 infiltration of rainwater directly to the drainage system 2 recharge of infiltrating water from the plot which does not go into the drainage system but recharges to shallow groundwater and 3 groundwater that interacts with the drainage system as the water table rises and could come from an offsite location and or the paddock however shallow groundwater at 3 4 m depth piezometer samples 1 m screen interval is not likely to interact with the drainage system at 1 m depth due to the heavy texture of the soil only groundwater around the drainage pipe ends up as a part of the end of pipe sample this gives a multi layered system that exhibits disconnectivity on site between a a nitrate plume associated with an up gradient source migrating at depth and b low levels of leached n or high attenuation capacity above the drainage system within the isolated paddock thereby resulting in unpolluted water discharging from the end of pipe location 3 2 n source and transformation processes no3 n isotopic signatures were determined by the combination of n sources and transformational processes affecting the original pool of no3 n xue et al 2009 shallow groundwater and eop samples from the four plots showed values between the ranges typically associated with a manure sewage source kendall 1998 the occurrence of specific processes is characterised by specific fractionation factors which leads to the creation of specific signatures within the residual pools since organisms preferentially use lighter isotopes the microbiological process cause an enrichment of heavy isotopes in the remaining source pool with a depletion in the product signature kendall 1998 ranges are known for several n sources and processes e g denitrification and nitrification and a recent review has summarised these for agricultural areas nikolenko et al 2017 specifically it was highlighted that when denitrification occurs this process follows a linear trend generally a 1 1 1 2 trend granger et al 2008 granger and wankel 2016 hernandez del amo et al 2018 both piezometers and eop locations showed a clustered pattern along a 1 1 1 2 line indicating an influence of denitrification in the transformation of no3 n fig 3 this was consistent with the study of baily et al 2011 on a neighbouring dairy site and was consistent across seasons and in terms of the source the absence of nh4 n contamination within the field seems to exclude dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra process that reduces no3 n to no2 n and then to nh4 n however distinguishing between denitrification and dnra is difficult as the isotope effect of dnra has still not been investigated alkhatib et al 2012 wells et al 2016 the no3 n isotopic composition showed low spatial variability shallow groundwater average δ15n no3 was 11 1 maximum 23 2 minimum 6 0 whereas average δ18o no3 was 7 2 maximum 11 0 minimum 0 0 plots 1 2 showed larger spatial variability whereas plots 3 4 showed less variability with data clustering as in fig 3 end of pipe locations had average δ15n no3 of 9 4 1 2 and 6 6 1 8 for δ18o no3 fig 3 end of pipe locations shared the same transformation signature as for groundwater from plots 3 and 4 fig 3 this indicated a consistency of signal across all four plots in terms of which microbial process occurred within the soil profile above the drain installation depth of 1 m the inconsistency of signal within the piezometer monitoring system for plots 1 2 i e high spatial variation and no indication of clustering along the denitrification line indicates the occurrence of a different or a mix of processes e g nitrification dnra anammox fenton et al 2009 identified ks as one of the main explanatory parameters for no3 n concentration suggesting that lower ks equates with higher attenuation capacity and therefore low concentrations of no3 n therefore ks areas present lower attenuation areas and therefore give rise to higher no3 n concentrations in groundwater herein groundwater samples which clustered along the denitrification line had a higher enrichment of both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 matching lower ks areas fig 4 as ks and no3 enrichment correlate well no3 n fractionation shows potential to be used to identify denitrification hotspots within agricultural areas as can be seen from the present study in addition to n flux eop water samples can also provide information to elucidate net water origin n source and give further insights into n transformational processes when combining data from different monitoring networks at the same site data can be used to investigate the connectivity or indeed disconnectivity as found in the present study between these two monitoring depths at the present site dissolved gas in eop samples allowed for greater interpretation of shallow subsurface net denitrification processes above and around a drainage system the classification of an artificial drainage system location and design type depth and spacing and their study in terms of physiochemical gaseous and isotopic parameters are essential to understand the fate of n and guide future installation and management future work should consider the different types of land drainage design including shallow disruptive techniques and their role in the water attenuation function of soils on agricultural landscapes a multi level piezometer network could then be used to compliment such interpretations for all other areas and depths outside the influence of the drainage system indeed the open ditch network should be investigated further as part of this system broadening out this type of n characterisation across dairy farms in specific geographical locations with specific rainfall and soil conditions e g poorly drained soils could enable the ranking of farms based on their n attenuation capacity this would aid specific components of water quality sustainability on these sites 4 conclusions the concept of flux is well established using concentration and flow data from land drainage eop or borehole screen intervals however this data tells very little about the net origin of a water sample the source of n in that sample or indeed the transformational processes responsible for the n concentrations in that sample this study showed that collating isotopic dissolved gas and biophysical data from eop and groundwater locations creates a clearer conceptual model of a site water origin results indicated disconnectivity between the two sample depths studied groundwater at 3 4 m depth was connected with an up gradient dairy soiled water irrigation point source with elevated nitrate concentrations migrating at this depth end of pipe water at 1 m depth had low nitrate concentrations multi techniques highlighted connectivity with the overlying plot with a different water attenuation functionality than the deeper system denitrification was the main process of attenuation which was correlated with subsoil ks land drainage systems in connection with a multi technique analysis can be used to examine the water attenuation function of soils over larger areas future work should investigate how drainage system design e g shallow and groundwater affects n transformation and this method should be broadened to rank commercial dairy farms in terms of their n attenuation capacity acknowledgements the study was funded by the teagasc

11462,potato seed production from in vitro multiplication processes requires different steps starting from greenhouse cultivation of plants and production of the first generation of tubers minitubers these tubers are then used as seeds in the first field culture conditions which is followed by a second field culture using the previous tubers as seeds the insect proof greenhouse culture of potato plants requires regular watering and an adequate fertilization process in this context we focused in this report on the greenhouse culture conditions of two intraspecific somatic hybrids that previously showed improved resistance to potato virus y and to pythium aphanidermatum infection three different culture conditions were tested a seasonal culture submitted to full irrigation ir100 or to 50 irrigation ir50 and off seasonal culture the effects of the moderate water deficit during the culture period on plant growth and tuber yield were investigated during the different culture periods physiological biochemical and agronomical parameters were followed the greenhouse experiments were applied on two commercial varieties nicola and spunta used as control in addition to the two somatic hybrid lines cn1 and cn2 hybrid plants exhibited better plant growth and higher yields of tubers than the commercial varieties under moderate water supply plants from hybrid lines showed higher tuber quality than commercial lines indeed the highest levels of dry matter starch protein and lipid contents were measured in cn1 tubers in the full irrigation regime similarly in the off seasonal culture the cn1 and cn2 tubers exhibited the highest dry matter content the 50 reduction of irrigation rate slightly affected the starch protein and lipid contents of the different plant lines however the cn1 hybrid tuber content in starch and reduced sugars remained higher than the other tubers keywords somatic hybrid lines greenhouse moderate water supply culture period water management 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is a crop of high nutritive value and of considerable economic importance worldwide being the fourth in crop production following wheat maize and rice the potato s demand is increasing at a greater rate than many other food crops mguidich belhaj et al 2015 however due to its high water consumption potato is far more sensitive to water stress than many other crops porter et al 1999 wang et al 2006 iwama 2008 therefore the irrigation regime is crucial in determining the ability of the plant to produce tubers especially in arid and semi arid areas a stable high quality potato crop requires a uniform and high level of available water ierna et al 2011 levy et al 2013 water shortage reduces vegetative growth of nearly all plants and most crops can face critical growth periods during which drought may reduce the yield samarah and al issa 2006 farooq et al 2008 insufficient water supply may result in reduced plant growth yield and crop quality al yahyai 2012 indeed during the vegetative stage water deficit greatly decreases the number of leaves leaf area and stem height fernie and willmitzer 2001 in the case of the potato plant during tuber differentiation interrupted water supply leads to poor plant growth jefferies and mackerron 1993 whereas during tuber growth it has a drastic effect on the total plant and marketable yield and tuber quality like shape frequency of abnormalities dry matter content size distribution and chemical composition gregory and simmonds 1992 hassanpanah et al 2008 the frequency of irrigation and the amount of water applied to crops is a common concern of the crop producers water stress quite often leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in plant leaves munné bosch and penuelas 2003 this overproduction of ros can induce oxidative stress that impairs the normal function of cells and the photosynthesis process dietz and pfannschmidt 2011 to alleviate these damages plants have evolved multiple antioxidant mechanisms to detoxify ros including antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat moreover plants display different mechanisms to withstand drought stress their response to water deficit can be very different among cultivars hassanpanah 2010 but also as a function of the period at which stress occurs kashyap and panda 2003 therefore a great attention should be paid to the optimization of irrigation management practices in different pedo climatic conditions typical of the main growing areas fabeiro et al 2001 ierna and mauromicale 2006 ierna et al 2011 excessive irrigation on the other hand may increase nutrient leaching water logging problems incidence of pests and diseases and the associated cost of frequent operation and maintenance of the irrigation system al yahyai 2012 the efficient water use for agricultural production is still one of the main challenges worldwide indeed optimizing water application to plants may reduce production costs increase plant growth and crop yield thus to improve water use efficiency in agriculture the irrigation management must be optimized to avoid unnecessary waste of important water resources especially in those countries such as tunisia where water is a key limiting factor in the crop production saccon 2017 in these area the water resource is rare and random which is an obstacle facing the economic and social development therefore the amount of water provided for irrigation during the growing season must not exceed the effective crop water needs the water requirement of a crop must be satisfied to achieve potential yields saccon 2017 in tunisia potato plants are cultivated all the year divided into four periods the most important production occurs during the season which starts in january plantation and harvesting is performed in may and the late season which starts in august and harvesting in december plant breeding using somatic hybridization can help to select new potato lines that are able to maintain crop yield under low water availability thieme et al 2010 somatic hybridization is an alternative method to sexual hybridization that allows the transfer of multigenic characters such as those responsible for the tolerance to abiotic stress thieme et al 2008 in this context intraspecific somatic hybrids produced previously by protoplast fusion between cardinal and nicola di haploid lines cn1 and cn2 were selected and characterized nouri ellouz et al 2006 these hybrids showed improved resistance to pythium aphanidermatum and to pvy nouri ellouz et al 2006 moreover the improved quality of hybrid tubers in terms of dry matter and starch content encourage us to envisage their registration as new varieties this step needs an evaluation of plant performance under greenhouse culture conditions used locally for the production of the first generation of seeds to reach this goal we investigated here the behavior of these hybrids to greenhouse culture conditions during two periods under cultivation process used by the private seed potato production company the second objective was the evaluation of were compared to commercial spunta and nicola varieties which are the main potato cultivars used in tunisia ctpta technical center of potato and artichoke the analysis of the performance of the hybrid lines with respect to growth and tuber production under greenhouse culture conditions over two irrigation regimes and two planting dates were examined in terms of some agro physiological characters 2 material and methods the study was conducted using two commercial potato varieties spunta sp and nicola ni and two intraspecific somatic hybrid lines cn1 and cn2 resulting from protoplast fusion between cardinal and nicola nouri ellouz et al 2006 the spunta variety is the most cultivated and consumed in tunisia 80 because it is adapted to local climate and soil conditions three week old in vitro cultivated plants that had developed roots in liquid ms medium murashige and skoog 1962 were transferred to a greenhouse and cultivated individually in plastic standard jars 8 8 9 cm containing 100 sphagnum blond peat npk 14 10 18 supplemented with osmocote npk 17 9 12 at a ratio of 1000 25 w w for an adequate n fertilization cultures were carried out in a tunisian agricultural development company mabrouka according to the process used there the greenhouse cultures were conducted over two culture periods seasonal and off seasonal cultures and two irrigation regimes the full water treatment corresponds to water saturation in jar since the plants used come from in vitro culture while the second one corresponds to 50 reduction of water supply irrigation was homogenously applied on the cultivated areas using an automatically system in the seasonal culture the plantation started on january 29th and harvesting was performed on may 1st during this period 120 plants were sprinkled with 90 ml tap water per jar twice a week corresponding approximately to 280 m3 ha per week to maintain adequate moisture levels after two weeks of culture 60 plants underwent a water shortage reduction of 50 of irrigation water supply ir50 in the off seasonal culture plantation was performed on march 16th and harvested on may 30th the plants were irrigated twice a week with 100

parameters were measured lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring mda content that is frequently used as a marker of oxidation of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids after 37 days of limited water supply treatment ir 50 very low mda levels were measured in hybrid lines while no mda was detected in sp and ni leaves however after 72 days of treatment the mda content increased in the different plants the highest increase of mda level was observed in the sp variety after 72 days the cn2 line also showed a low accumulation of mda content in leaves underwater shortage fig 3 a the accumulation of h2o2 was observed in leaves of sp cn1 and cn2 plants after 72 days of culture in reduced watering condition ir 50 while no h2o2 increase was observed after 37 days of growth fig 3b 3 1 4 evaluation of the antioxidant activities 3 1 4 1 sod activity the sod activities measured in leaves after 72 days of plant culture fig 3c showed a significant increase in plants of the sp commercial variety submitted to water deficit ir 50 however no change of this activity was detected in ni and cn1 plants a significant decrease of sod was observed in cn2 plants after 72 days of culture under water deficit ir 50 3 1 4 2 cat activity an increase of cat activity was noticed in sp and cn2 plants that showed the highest increase levels of h2o2 under water shortage conditions ir 50 the low increase of h2o2 content observed in the cn1 line can be related to the slight increase of cat activity the sp variety displayed the highest cat activity while a decrease was noticed in the ni line fig 3d 3 1 5 accumulation of soluble sugars and proline two osmoprotectants were considered here proline and soluble sugars the results revealed an important increase in proline content in the cn2 line fig 3e while the highest accumulation of soluble sugars was measured in cn1 plants after 72 days of culture under reduced watering conditions fig 3f no significant variation in proline or soluble sugars was noticed for the other plants except a decrease of proline in ni and soluble sugars reductions in sp and cn2 plants 3 1 6 evaluation of potato tuber yield caliber and color after three months of culture of potato plants in the greenhouse the tubers were hand harvested counted and weighed to determine their average number and weight in the different culture conditions ir100 and ir50 the cn1 hybrid line exhibited the highest yield with regard to the number or weight of tubers per plant the partial water deficit did not have any negative effect on tuber yield on any line the cn1 and cn2 hybrids also showed the highest tuber yield during the off seasonal culture period table 1 the culture period had a slight positive effect on tuber yield of the cn2 hybrid line and its ni parent the tubers produced were classified according to their caliber in order to evaluate the effect of the reduction of water supply as reported by ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 five different classes from cal1 length 6 5 cm to cal5 length 1 5 cm were distinguished the most abundant calibers were cal2 cal3 and cal4 whatever the irrigation condition adopted caliber 3 3 l 4 5 cm predominated in tubers of the sp variety in both culture conditions variability in the color of tubers was also noticed in the cn1 and cn2 hybrids an intensity gradient of pink color was observed in these tubers fig 4 this gradient ranged from light to dark pink this variability of color was measured by colorimetry based on red a and yellow b components and clarity l fig 5 two classes of tubers were distinguished in hybrid lines according to the pink intensity of their skin light pink lp tubers and dark pink dp tubers the culture period seems to act on the color of cn1 and cn2 hybrid tubers indeed the percentage of dark pink tubers increased in both hybrid lines in fact all cn1 tubers were dark pink whereas only 60 of cn2 tubers had a dark pink color against 38 in the previous culture in the cn1 hybrid line grown in standard conditions ir100 the cal3 with light pink tubers was slightly more abundant than those of cal4 however the reduction of plant watering seemed to affect the growth of light pink tubers in which the proportion of cal5 l 1 5 cm increased table 2 in the cn2 line light pink tubers cn2lp of cal4 were predominant in both culture conditions in the off seasonal culture calibers cal3 and cal4 were the most abundant in nicola cn1 and cn2 table 2 spunta tubers were characterized by the dominance of cal2 followed by the cal3 caliber 3 1 7 chemical analysis of potato tubers dry matter ash starch reduced sugars proteins and lipid contents of potato tubers from seasonal culture were analyzed in relation to the irrigation process adopted fig 6 a some changes of tuber composition were noticed when the irrigation was reduced by 50 the dark pink cn1 tubers obtained by full irrigation showed the highest dry matter content 25 ash content 1 13 starch 25 protein 2 5 and lipid content 0 1 the cn1lp tubers displayed higher dry matter content in comparison to ni and sp however the dry matter of the cn2 tubers was similar to that of the sp reduction of irrigation rate to 50 led to a reduction in dry matter of cn1 tubers while cn2 sp and ni dry matter did not show any significant change at p 0 05 anova test in the dry matter when the irrigation was reduced to 50 the cn2 and sp tubers showed similar percentages of dry matter ash and starch their levels of reducing sugars were lower than those measured in cn1 and sp but remained higher than those of ni tubers of both commercial varieties sp and ni subjected to reduced water supply showed an increase in dry matter ash starch reducing sugars proteins and lipids contents however a decrease was observed in tubers cn1lp cn1dp and cn2lp 4 discussion management of irrigation is an important practice in crop production particularly in arid and semi arid areas it pays attention to the crop irrigation needs and identifies the critical factors for measuring crop requirements and the control of irrigation to both optimize cropping and minimize water waste evans and sadler 2008 tunisia is in a semi arid zone characterized by insufficient and erratic rainfall which causes frequent periods of drought bouchrika et al 2015 for these reasons irrigation is an essential component for potato production areas making it crucial to optimize water use due to the energy requirement and limited water resources water supply becomes a problem limiting potato culture in several areas in tunisia while the culture period covers all the year moreover phytopathogens such as viruses and fungi may cause important limiting factors for potato culture all these constraints limited the use to the spunta variety while about 51 varieties are registered in the tunisian catalog ctpta technical center of potato and artichoke this work focused on the use of potato intraspecific somatic hybrid lines which previously showed better resistance to pvy and to a number of pathogenic fungi nouri ellouz et al 2006 therefore these hybrid lines were tested in large scale greenhouse culture conditions three culture factors were tested seasonal culture period during which two irrigation levels were conducted full irrigation and 50 reduced water irrigation and an off seasonal culture the main question here is to investigate the capacity of these hybrids to adapt to tunisian culture conditions in comparison to spunta before their registration as new varieties by measuring plant growth and tuber yields in addition the effect of reduced water irrigation on potential tuber yields of the hybrids was compared to commercial varieties therefore growth parameters were followed and physiological analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of reduced water supply and culture period on hybrid potato yield and the quality of the tubers in comparison to the commercial varieties ni and sp no significant effect at p 0 05 anova test of the irrigation regimes on the development of stems and the leaf number was noticed while the reduced irrigation regime ir50 led to a decrease of the ca cb in plants of the sp variety but not in the hybrid ones and their parent ni this may reflect the reduced water supply applied here indeed cameron et al 1999 reported that the effects of deficient irrigation may vary depending on the intensity of the water deficit applied moderate water deficit has been reported to induce a decline in the photosynthetic rate in potato plants vos and oyarzum 1987 basu et al 1998 moreover kirnak et al 2001 reported that stem length of water stressed plants was lower than that of well watered plants since the reduction in the irrigation rate can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species ros pinheiro et al 2004 that may cause damages to proteins lipids carbohydrates and dna we focused here on lipid peroxidation and h2o2 accumulation in leaves of plants submitted to low irrigation rate lipid peroxidation is often used as an indicator of oxidative stress in plants resulting from abiotic stress shukla et al 2012 we measured the mda content which is one of the end products of lipid peroxidation deebaa et al 2012 hasanuzzaman et al 2014 described that lipid peroxidation as represented by mda and h2o2 contents remarkably increased under water deficit the limitation of water supply applied in this study of potato plants led to an increase in the mda content in sp leaves suggesting an oxidative stress due to water depletion however it remained stable in ni and cn1 leaves a small increase was also measured in cn2 leaves in addition it was observed that the moderate water deficit increased the h2o2 level significantly at p 0 05 anova test in the leaves of the sp and cn2 potato plants after 72 days of culture antioxidant enzymes involved in ros detoxification alvarez et al 2009 and maintaining a balance between the overproduction of ros and their scavenging szalai et al 2009 were assayed here during 72 days of culture under low water supplying an increase of sod activities was observed in sp leaves however this activity remained constant in ni and cn1 leaves and it decreased slightly in the cn2 line in comparison to well watered controls these data can be related to the high mda accumulation in sp leaves since sod constitutes the first enzyme acting against accumulation of these toxic radicals hameed et al 2011 scavenging o2 radicals and generating h2o2 the cat activity was correlated with h2o2 accumulation measured in plants leaves indeed an increase of cat activity was observed in sp and cn2 plants the small increase in the levels of h2o2 in the cn1 line resulted in a slight increase in the catalase activities accumulation of osmolytes such as proline and soluble sugars to enable osmo regulation under drought stress was commonly perceived in plants trovato et al 2008 production of proline by plant tissue under water deficient conditions is an adaptive response sarani et al 2014 since this compatible solute can adjust the osmotic potential in the cytoplasm caballero et al 2005 and its content can be used as a physiological marker in relation to osmotic stress similarly the accumulation of sugars contributes to cellular protection and partial conservation of key physiological processes in drought stressed plants both proline and soluble sugars can act as non enzymatic antioxidants the limitation of watering led to a significant increase at p 0 05 anova test of proline in cn2 leaves and accumulation of soluble sugars in cn1 however a decrease of soluble sugar content was registered in cn2 and sp leaves and ni plants showed a decrease of proline content reduced irrigation regime ir50 did not affect tuber yield in terms of weight and number among caliber classes cantore et al 2014 the hybrid lines showed the highest yield compared to commercial varieties in both irrigation regimes ir100 and ir50 in terms of number and weight similarly no significant effect p 0 05 anova test was noticed on tuber yield during seasonal culture as well as in off seasonal culture since the cn1 and cn2 hybrids resulted from protoplasts fusion between the nicola and cardinal dihaploid lines nouri ellouz et al 2006 the color of their tubers was investigated indeed the cardinal parental variety is characterized by red colored tubers a pink skin of tubers was noticed in both hybrid lines it may be due to the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments during growth and or a change in the physio chemical environment of the pigments resulting in a color change even though no quantitative change in anthocyanin burton 1989 tuber surface chroma intensity of redness varied from light to dark pink in hybrid tubers which corresponds to a variation of intensity of redness from 2 to 15 for the cn1 line and from 1 to 12 for cn2 line in both regimes of irrigation in seasonal culture two classes of tubers were identified in the seasonal culture this classification was based on the pink intensity of skin light pink lp tubers and dark pink dp tubers this change in chroma of surface area could result from anthocyanin degradation or dilution due to increases in cell size chen yi et al 1997 indeed the largest caliber of hybrid mini tubers was more than 65 mm and showed the lowest rate of dark pink tubers produced in both irrigation regimes and both periods of culture for the off seasonal culture the cn1 line produced only dark pink tubers as opposed to the cn2 line which produced 60 dark pink tubers these data suggest that water availability and culture period affect color intensity and anthocyanin concentration of tuber skin these results also suggest that the reduced water supply applied ir50 has a more negative effect on the tuber size of the ni variety than of the hybrid lines cn1 and cn2 this corroborates the vigor of these hybrid lines nouri ellouz et al 2006 the highest percentage of tuber calibers corresponds to the intermediate cal3 and cal4 in both culture seasons oversized tubers cal1 were almost absent from the different lines the chemical composition of tubers is an important criterion in determining the culinary and technological qualities that define their type of use gravoueille 1996 pedreschi et al 2005 tubers differ from one another with regard to chemical composition this diversification exists not only between tubers belonging to different cultivars but also between tubers belonging to the same cultivar beukema and van der zaag 1990 kolbe and stephan beckmann 1997 dry matter ash starch reduced sugars proteins and lipids were analyzed in potato tubers during both irrigation regimes ir100 and ir50 of seasonal culture the results indicated that cn1 tubers showed the highest levels of these components in full irrigation regime ir100 in fact dry matter and starch contents were more important in the cn1 line in the seasonal culture similarly in the off seasonal culture the cn1 line showed the highest dry matter content fig 7 dry matter increased significantly at p 0 05 anova test in cn2 and sp varieties obtained from off seasonal culture in comparison to the seasonal culture reduced sugar content above 0 6 induced browning during frying gravoueille 1996 tubers of different lines showed reduced sugar levels under 0 6 suggesting their use in producing french fries the lowest levels were observed in tubers of ni followed by the cn2 line the protein contents of light pink tubers cn1 and cn2 were lower than those of tubers of the ni parent dry weight starch reduced sugar proteins and lipid contents increased in ni and sp tubers submitted to moderate water deficit ir50 however for the hybrids cn1lp cn1dp and cn2lp a marked decrease was observed the water deficit seemed to be responsible for the increase of reduced sugar levels in sp and cn1 the study showed that the somatic hybrids exhibited similar yields and tuber quality in both irrigation regimes and seasons and even better than those obtained under full irrigation of hybrid lines as already reported our hypothesis is that reduced watering conditions can improve the efficiency of water use by allowing water saving and by maintaining a good level of both yield and quality of tubers acknowledgements the work was financed by the tunisian ministry of

11462,potato seed production from in vitro multiplication processes requires different steps starting from greenhouse cultivation of plants and production of the first generation of tubers minitubers these tubers are then used as seeds in the first field culture conditions which is followed by a second field culture using the previous tubers as seeds the insect proof greenhouse culture of potato plants requires regular watering and an adequate fertilization process in this context we focused in this report on the greenhouse culture conditions of two intraspecific somatic hybrids that previously showed improved resistance to potato virus y and to pythium aphanidermatum infection three different culture conditions were tested a seasonal culture submitted to full irrigation ir100 or to 50 irrigation ir50 and off seasonal culture the effects of the moderate water deficit during the culture period on plant growth and tuber yield were investigated during the different culture periods physiological biochemical and agronomical parameters were followed the greenhouse experiments were applied on two commercial varieties nicola and spunta used as control in addition to the two somatic hybrid lines cn1 and cn2 hybrid plants exhibited better plant growth and higher yields of tubers than the commercial varieties under moderate water supply plants from hybrid lines showed higher tuber quality than commercial lines indeed the highest levels of dry matter starch protein and lipid contents were measured in cn1 tubers in the full irrigation regime similarly in the off seasonal culture the cn1 and cn2 tubers exhibited the highest dry matter content the 50 reduction of irrigation rate slightly affected the starch protein and lipid contents of the different plant lines however the cn1 hybrid tuber content in starch and reduced sugars remained higher than the other tubers keywords somatic hybrid lines greenhouse moderate water supply culture period water management 1 introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is a crop of high nutritive value and of considerable economic importance worldwide being the fourth in crop production following wheat maize and rice the potato s demand is increasing at a greater rate than many other food crops mguidich belhaj et al 2015 however due to its high water consumption potato is far more sensitive to water stress than many other crops porter et al 1999 wang et al 2006 iwama 2008 therefore the irrigation regime is crucial in determining the ability of the plant to produce tubers especially in arid and semi arid areas a stable high quality potato crop requires a uniform and high level of available water ierna et al 2011 levy et al 2013 water shortage reduces vegetative growth of nearly all plants and most crops can face critical growth periods during which drought may reduce the yield samarah and al issa 2006 farooq et al 2008 insufficient water supply may result in reduced plant growth yield and crop quality al yahyai 2012 indeed during the vegetative stage water deficit greatly decreases the number of leaves leaf area and stem height fernie and willmitzer 2001 in the case of the potato plant during tuber differentiation interrupted water supply leads to poor plant growth jefferies and mackerron 1993 whereas during tuber growth it has a drastic effect on the total plant and marketable yield and tuber quality like shape frequency of abnormalities dry matter content size distribution and chemical composition gregory and simmonds 1992 hassanpanah et al 2008 the frequency of irrigation and the amount of water applied to crops is a common concern of the crop producers water stress quite often leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species ros in plant leaves munné bosch and penuelas 2003 this overproduction of ros can induce oxidative stress that impairs the normal function of cells and the photosynthesis process dietz and pfannschmidt 2011 to alleviate these damages plants have evolved multiple antioxidant mechanisms to detoxify ros including antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat moreover plants display different mechanisms to withstand drought stress their response to water deficit can be very different among cultivars hassanpanah 2010 but also as a function of the period at which stress occurs kashyap and panda 2003 therefore a great attention should be paid to the optimization of irrigation management practices in different pedo climatic conditions typical of the main growing areas fabeiro et al 2001 ierna and mauromicale 2006 ierna et al 2011 excessive irrigation on the other hand may increase nutrient leaching water logging problems incidence of pests and diseases and the associated cost of frequent operation and maintenance of the irrigation system al yahyai 2012 the efficient water use for agricultural production is still one of the main challenges worldwide indeed optimizing water application to plants may reduce production costs increase plant growth and crop yield thus to improve water use efficiency in agriculture the irrigation management must be optimized to avoid unnecessary waste of important water resources especially in those countries such as tunisia where water is a key limiting factor in the crop production saccon 2017 in these area the water resource is rare and random which is an obstacle facing the economic and social development therefore the amount of water provided for irrigation during the growing season must not exceed the effective crop water needs the water requirement of a crop must be satisfied to achieve potential yields saccon 2017 in tunisia potato plants are cultivated all the year divided into four periods the most important production occurs during the season which starts in january plantation and harvesting is performed in may and the late season which starts in august and harvesting in december plant breeding using somatic hybridization can help to select new potato lines that are able to maintain crop yield under low water availability thieme et al 2010 somatic hybridization is an alternative method to sexual hybridization that allows the transfer of multigenic characters such as those responsible for the tolerance to abiotic stress thieme et al 2008 in this context intraspecific somatic hybrids produced previously by protoplast fusion between cardinal and nicola di haploid lines cn1 and cn2 were selected and characterized nouri ellouz et al 2006 these hybrids showed improved resistance to pythium aphanidermatum and to pvy nouri ellouz et al 2006 moreover the improved quality of hybrid tubers in terms of dry matter and starch content encourage us to envisage their registration as new varieties this step needs an evaluation of plant performance under greenhouse culture conditions used locally for the production of the first generation of seeds to reach this goal we investigated here the behavior of these hybrids to greenhouse culture conditions during two periods under cultivation process used by the private seed potato production company the second objective was the evaluation of were compared to commercial spunta and nicola varieties which are the main potato cultivars used in tunisia ctpta technical center of potato and artichoke the analysis of the performance of the hybrid lines with respect to growth and tuber production under greenhouse culture conditions over two irrigation regimes and two planting dates were examined in terms of some agro physiological characters 2 material and methods the study was conducted using two commercial potato varieties spunta sp and nicola ni and two intraspecific somatic hybrid lines cn1 and cn2 resulting from protoplast fusion between cardinal and nicola nouri ellouz et al 2006 the spunta variety is the most cultivated and consumed in tunisia 80 because it is adapted to local climate and soil conditions three week old in vitro cultivated plants that had developed roots in liquid ms medium murashige and skoog 1962 were transferred to a greenhouse and cultivated individually in plastic standard jars 8 8 9 cm containing 100 sphagnum blond peat npk 14 10 18 supplemented with osmocote npk 17 9 12 at a ratio of 1000 25 w w for an adequate n fertilization cultures were carried out in a tunisian agricultural development company mabrouka according to the process used there the greenhouse cultures were conducted over two culture periods seasonal and off seasonal cultures and two irrigation regimes the full water treatment corresponds to water saturation in jar since the plants used come from in vitro culture while the second one corresponds to 50 reduction of water supply irrigation was homogenously applied on the cultivated areas using an automatically system in the seasonal culture the plantation started on january 29th and harvesting was performed on may 1st during this period 120 plants were sprinkled with 90 ml tap water per jar twice a week corresponding approximately to 280 m3 ha per week to maintain adequate moisture levels after two weeks of culture 60 plants underwent a water shortage reduction of 50 of irrigation water supply ir50 in the off seasonal culture plantation was performed on march 16th and harvested on may 30th the plants were irrigated twice a week with 100 water ir100 phytosanitary treatments were applied every ten days by spraying diluted fungicides and insecticides the temperature in the greenhouse ranged from 14 to 25 c in the first culture period and from 14 to 30 c for the second period the reference crop evapotranspiration eto in these conditions were 2 3 mm day and 5 7 mm day respectively 2 1 growth monitoring the growth of plants of different varieties was evaluated every week by measuring stem elongation and determining leaf number three plants of each variety cultivated in the different conditions ir100 and ir50 were used to monitor the physiological parameters after 37 and 72 days of seasonal culture all measurements were made in triplicate 2 2 determination of chlorophyll content total chlorophyll was extracted from

for lightness a and b for the color opponents green red and blue yellow were measured with a chroma meter cr 400 410 konica minolta colorimeter tuber samples were scanned at five different locations to determine the l a b values as the average of five measurements 2 13 statistical analysis the data related to the physiological parameters and the yield components of plants as well as the chemical parameters of tubers produced during the seasonal culture were subjected to anova method analysis of variance values were compared between the two irrigation regimes ir100 and ir 50 within each potato variety by the newman keuls test to detect significant differences between treatment values at p 0 05 all measurements were performed in triplicate using three independent plants taken randomly 3 results during the seasonal culture period the behavior of plants from the different potato lines cultivated in the greenhouse and submitted to reduced or full irrigation was evaluated in addition a comparison of the development of potato plants from different lines cultivated in both seasons seasonal and off seasonal periods was assessed 3 1 effect of water deficit and season variation on plants 3 1 1 evaluation of growth parameters the leaf number and stem length of plants were measured during the culture period fig 1 a and b no significant effect of water supply reduction at p 0 05 anova test was noticed on plant elongation and leaf number in commercial as well as in hybrid lines cultivated during the seasonal period during the off seasonal period higher stem length of cn1 and cn2 hybrid plants was also measured in comparison to those of the ni and sp varieties fig 1a in contrast the leaf number in ni plants was lower than those in the sp cn1 and cn2 lines fig 1b 3 1 2 determination of chlorophyll content the leaf chlorophyll level was determined in plants cultivated under full or 50 irrigation conditions during 72 days fig 2 the c h l o r o p h y l l a c h l o r o p h y l l b ratio was determined after 37 and 72 days of culture to provide preliminary information about the photosynthetic activity of plants rao and rao 1981 pinheiro et al 2004 kögler and söffker 2017 the c h l o r o p h y l l a c h l o r o p h y l l b ratio of hybrid lines seemed not to be affected by water shortage however this ratio increased in sp and ni after 37 days of culture under 50 water deficit ir 50 3 1 3 evaluation of oxidative stress parameters in order to determine if the reduction of water supply can have a negative effect on potato plant culture some oxidative stress parameters were measured lipid peroxidation was estimated by measuring mda content that is frequently used as a marker of oxidation of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids after 37 days of limited water supply treatment ir 50 very low mda levels were measured in hybrid lines while no mda was detected in sp and ni leaves however after 72 days of treatment the mda content increased in the different plants the highest increase of mda level was observed in the sp variety after 72 days the cn2 line also showed a low accumulation of mda content in leaves underwater shortage fig 3 a the accumulation of h2o2 was observed in leaves of sp cn1 and cn2 plants after 72 days of culture in reduced watering condition ir 50 while no h2o2 increase was observed after 37 days of growth fig 3b 3 1 4 evaluation of the antioxidant activities 3 1 4 1 sod activity the sod activities measured in leaves after 72 days of plant culture fig 3c showed a significant increase in plants of the sp commercial variety submitted to water deficit ir 50 however no change of this activity was detected in ni and cn1 plants a significant decrease of sod was observed in cn2 plants after 72 days of culture under water deficit ir 50 3 1 4 2 cat activity an increase of cat activity was noticed in sp and cn2 plants that showed the highest increase levels of h2o2 under water shortage conditions ir 50 the low increase of h2o2 content observed in the cn1 line can be related to the slight increase of cat activity the sp variety displayed the highest cat activity while a decrease was noticed in the ni line fig 3d 3 1 5 accumulation of soluble sugars and proline two osmoprotectants were considered here proline and soluble sugars the results revealed an important increase in proline content in the cn2 line fig 3e while the highest accumulation of soluble sugars was measured in cn1 plants after 72 days of culture under reduced watering conditions fig 3f no significant variation in proline or soluble sugars was noticed for the other plants except a decrease of proline in ni and soluble sugars reductions in sp and cn2 plants 3 1 6 evaluation of potato tuber yield caliber and color after three months of culture of potato plants in the greenhouse the tubers were hand harvested counted and weighed to determine their average number and weight in the different culture conditions ir100 and ir50 the cn1 hybrid line exhibited the highest yield with regard to the number or weight of tubers per plant the partial water deficit did not have any negative effect on tuber yield on any line the cn1 and cn2 hybrids also showed the highest tuber yield during the off seasonal culture period table 1 the culture period had a slight positive effect on tuber yield of the cn2 hybrid line and its ni parent the tubers produced were classified according to their caliber in order to evaluate the effect of the reduction of water supply as reported by ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 five different classes from cal1 length 6 5 cm to cal5 length 1 5 cm were distinguished the most abundant calibers were cal2 cal3 and cal4 whatever the irrigation condition adopted caliber 3 3 l 4 5 cm predominated in tubers of the sp variety in both culture conditions variability in the color of tubers was also noticed in the cn1 and cn2 hybrids an intensity gradient of pink color was observed in these tubers fig 4 this gradient ranged from light to dark pink this variability of color was measured by colorimetry based on red a and yellow b components and clarity l fig 5 two classes of tubers were distinguished in hybrid lines according to the pink intensity of their skin light pink lp tubers and dark pink dp tubers the culture period seems to act on the color of cn1 and cn2 hybrid tubers indeed the percentage of dark pink tubers increased in both hybrid lines in fact all cn1 tubers were dark pink whereas only 60 of cn2 tubers had a dark pink color against 38 in the previous culture in the cn1 hybrid line grown in standard conditions ir100 the cal3 with light pink tubers was slightly more abundant than those of cal4 however the reduction of plant watering seemed to affect the growth of light pink tubers in which the proportion of cal5 l 1 5 cm increased table 2 in the cn2 line light pink tubers cn2lp of cal4 were predominant in both culture conditions in the off seasonal culture calibers cal3 and cal4 were the most abundant in nicola cn1 and cn2 table 2 spunta tubers were characterized by the dominance of cal2 followed by the cal3 caliber 3 1 7 chemical analysis of potato tubers dry matter ash starch reduced sugars proteins and lipid contents of potato tubers from seasonal culture were analyzed in relation to the irrigation process adopted fig 6 a some changes of tuber composition were noticed when the irrigation was reduced by 50 the dark pink cn1 tubers obtained by full irrigation showed the highest dry matter content 25 ash content 1 13 starch 25 protein 2 5 and lipid content 0 1 the cn1lp tubers displayed higher dry matter content in comparison to ni and sp however the dry matter of the cn2 tubers was similar to that of the sp reduction of irrigation rate to 50 led to a reduction in dry matter of cn1 tubers while cn2 sp and ni dry matter did not show any significant change at p 0 05 anova test in the dry matter when the irrigation was reduced to 50 the cn2 and sp tubers showed similar percentages of dry matter ash and starch their levels of reducing sugars were lower than those measured in cn1 and sp but remained higher than those of ni tubers of both commercial varieties sp and ni subjected to reduced water supply showed an increase in dry matter ash starch reducing sugars proteins and lipids contents however a decrease was observed in tubers cn1lp cn1dp and cn2lp 4 discussion management of irrigation is an important practice in crop production particularly in arid and semi arid areas it pays attention to the crop irrigation needs and identifies the critical factors for measuring crop requirements and the control of irrigation to both optimize cropping and minimize water waste evans and sadler 2008 tunisia is in a semi arid zone characterized by insufficient and erratic rainfall which causes frequent periods of drought bouchrika et al 2015 for these reasons irrigation is an essential component for potato production areas making it crucial to optimize water use due to the energy requirement and limited water resources water supply becomes a problem limiting potato culture in several areas in tunisia while the culture period covers all the year moreover phytopathogens such as viruses and fungi may cause important limiting factors for potato culture all these constraints limited the use to the spunta variety while about 51 varieties are registered in the tunisian catalog ctpta technical center of potato and artichoke this work focused on the use of potato intraspecific somatic hybrid lines which previously showed better resistance to pvy and to a number of pathogenic fungi nouri ellouz et al 2006 therefore these hybrid lines were tested in large scale greenhouse culture conditions three culture factors were tested seasonal culture period during which two irrigation levels were conducted full irrigation and 50 reduced water irrigation and an off seasonal culture the main question here is to investigate the capacity of these hybrids to adapt to tunisian culture conditions in comparison to spunta before their registration as new varieties by measuring plant growth and tuber yields in addition the effect of reduced water irrigation on potential tuber yields of the hybrids was compared to commercial varieties therefore growth parameters were followed and physiological analyses were conducted to investigate the effect of reduced water supply and culture period on hybrid potato yield and the quality of the tubers in comparison to the commercial varieties ni and sp no significant effect at p 0 05 anova test of the irrigation regimes on the development of stems and the leaf number was noticed while the reduced irrigation regime ir50 led to a decrease of the ca cb in plants of the sp variety but not in the hybrid ones and their parent ni this may reflect the reduced water supply applied here indeed cameron et al 1999 reported that the effects of deficient irrigation may vary depending on the intensity of the water deficit applied moderate water deficit has been reported to induce a decline in the photosynthetic rate in potato plants vos and oyarzum 1987 basu et al 1998 moreover kirnak et al 2001 reported that stem length of water stressed plants was lower than that of well watered plants since the reduction in the irrigation rate can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species ros pinheiro et al 2004 that may cause damages to proteins lipids carbohydrates and dna we focused here on lipid peroxidation and h2o2 accumulation in leaves of plants submitted to low irrigation rate lipid peroxidation is often used as an indicator of oxidative stress in plants resulting from abiotic stress shukla et al 2012 we measured the mda content which is one of the end products of lipid peroxidation deebaa et al 2012 hasanuzzaman et al 2014 described that lipid peroxidation as represented by mda and h2o2 contents remarkably increased under water deficit the limitation of water supply applied in this study of potato plants led to an increase in the mda content in sp leaves suggesting an oxidative stress due to water depletion however it remained stable in ni and cn1 leaves a small increase was also measured in cn2 leaves in addition it was observed that the moderate water deficit increased the h2o2 level significantly at p 0 05 anova test in the leaves of the sp and cn2 potato plants after 72 days of culture antioxidant enzymes involved in ros detoxification alvarez et al 2009 and maintaining a balance between the overproduction of ros and their scavenging szalai et al 2009 were assayed here during 72 days of culture under low water supplying an increase of sod activities was observed in sp leaves however this activity remained constant in ni and cn1 leaves and it decreased slightly in the cn2 line in comparison to well watered controls these data can be related to the high mda accumulation in sp leaves since sod constitutes the first enzyme acting against accumulation of these toxic radicals hameed et al 2011 scavenging o2 radicals and generating h2o2 the cat activity was correlated with h2o2 accumulation measured in plants leaves indeed an increase of cat activity was observed in sp and cn2 plants the small increase in the levels of h2o2 in the cn1 line resulted in a slight increase in the catalase activities accumulation of osmolytes such as proline and soluble sugars to enable osmo regulation under drought stress was commonly perceived in plants trovato et al 2008 production of proline by plant tissue under water deficient conditions is an adaptive response sarani et al 2014 since this compatible solute can adjust the osmotic potential in the cytoplasm caballero et al 2005 and its content can be used as a physiological marker in relation to osmotic stress similarly the accumulation of sugars contributes to cellular protection and partial conservation of key physiological processes in drought stressed plants both proline and soluble sugars can act as non enzymatic antioxidants the limitation of watering led to a significant increase at p 0 05 anova test of proline in cn2 leaves and accumulation of soluble sugars in cn1 however a decrease of soluble sugar content was registered in cn2 and sp leaves and ni plants showed a decrease of proline content reduced irrigation regime ir50 did not affect tuber yield in terms of weight and number among caliber classes cantore et al 2014 the hybrid lines showed the highest yield compared to commercial varieties in both irrigation regimes ir100 and ir50 in terms of number and weight similarly no significant effect p 0 05 anova test was noticed on tuber yield during seasonal culture as well as in off seasonal culture since the cn1 and cn2 hybrids resulted from protoplasts fusion between the nicola and cardinal dihaploid lines nouri ellouz et al 2006 the color of their tubers was investigated indeed the cardinal parental variety is characterized by red colored tubers a pink skin of tubers was noticed in both hybrid lines it may be due to the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments during growth and or a change in the physio chemical environment of the pigments resulting in a color change even though no quantitative change in anthocyanin burton 1989 tuber surface chroma intensity of redness varied from light to dark pink in hybrid tubers which corresponds to a variation of intensity of redness from 2 to 15 for the cn1 line and from 1 to 12 for cn2 line in both regimes of irrigation in seasonal culture two classes of tubers were identified in the seasonal culture this classification was based on the pink intensity of skin light pink lp tubers and dark pink dp tubers this change in chroma of surface area could result from anthocyanin degradation or dilution due to increases in cell size chen yi et al 1997 indeed the largest caliber of hybrid mini tubers was more than 65 mm and showed the lowest rate of dark pink tubers produced in both irrigation regimes and both periods of culture for the off seasonal culture the cn1 line produced only dark pink tubers as opposed to the cn2 line which produced 60 dark pink tubers these data suggest that water availability and culture period affect color intensity and anthocyanin concentration of tuber skin these results also suggest that the reduced water supply applied ir50 has a more negative effect on the tuber size of the ni variety than of the hybrid lines cn1 and cn2 this corroborates the vigor of these hybrid lines nouri ellouz et al 2006 the highest percentage of tuber calibers corresponds to the intermediate cal3 and cal4 in both culture seasons oversized tubers cal1 were almost absent from the different lines the chemical composition of tubers is an important criterion in determining the culinary and technological qualities that define their type of use gravoueille 1996 pedreschi et al 2005 tubers differ from one another with regard to chemical composition this diversification exists not only between tubers belonging to different cultivars but also between tubers belonging to the same cultivar beukema and van der zaag 1990 kolbe and stephan beckmann 1997 dry matter ash starch reduced sugars proteins and lipids were analyzed in potato tubers during both irrigation regimes ir100 and ir50 of seasonal culture the results indicated that cn1 tubers showed the highest levels of these components in full irrigation regime ir100 in fact dry matter and starch contents were more important in the cn1 line in the seasonal culture similarly in the off seasonal culture the cn1 line showed the highest dry matter content fig 7 dry matter increased significantly at p 0 05 anova test in cn2 and sp varieties obtained from off seasonal culture in comparison to the seasonal culture reduced sugar content above 0 6 induced browning during frying gravoueille 1996 tubers of different lines showed reduced sugar levels under 0 6 suggesting their use in producing french fries the lowest levels were observed in tubers of ni followed by the cn2 line the protein contents of light pink tubers cn1 and cn2 were lower than those of tubers of the ni parent dry weight starch reduced sugar proteins and lipid contents increased in ni and sp tubers submitted to moderate water deficit ir50 however for the hybrids cn1lp cn1dp and cn2lp a marked decrease was observed the water deficit seemed to be responsible for the increase of reduced sugar levels in sp and cn1 the study showed that the somatic hybrids exhibited similar yields and tuber quality in both irrigation regimes and seasons and even better than those obtained under full irrigation of hybrid lines as already reported our hypothesis is that reduced watering conditions can improve the efficiency of water use by allowing water saving and by maintaining a good level of both yield and quality of tubers acknowledgements the work was financed by the tunisian ministry of

11463,dielectric moisture sensors are particularly suitable for irrigation management in greenhouse soilless production identifying the practical effects of substrate water content set points on crop performance is crucial for successful sensor based irrigation we designed and constructed a prototype cloud connected system for wireless sensor based irrigation management and tested it on basil grown in a perlite coco 1 1 v v soilless substrate under greenhouse conditions dielectric moisture salinity sensors gs3 decagon devices pullman wa usa were used the study with two subsequent experiments assessed i the effects of a progressive decline in substrate water availability corresponding to moisture levels from water holding capacity to 0 10 m3 m 3 on the gas exchange parameters and leaf water status of basil plants ii the short term recovery response of plants when re watered after substrate water content has decreased to different levels iii the effects of different irrigation set points 0 40 0 30 and 0 20 m3 m 3 and leaching rates 8 or 18 on the basil crop performance over a complete growing cycle no physiological stress responses were observed on basil plants when moisture level was higher than approximately 0 20 m3 m 3 while plants showed drought symptoms at approximately 0 17 m3 m 3 corresponding to a substrate matric potential and hydraulic conductivity of 300 hpa and 0 0005 cm day 1 respectively photosynthesis and leaf water potential recovered to values similar to non stress conditions following a short drought with moisture level as low as 0 10 m3 m 3 basil growth was similar when plants were grown with irrigation set points of 0 40 0 30 or 0 20 m3 m 3 for the complete growing cycle fresh weight tended to increase when a higher leaching rate was used probably because leaching lowered substrate ec water use efficiency basil fresh weight unit water used was similar at different irrigation set points and leaching rates our results indicate that the use of a wireless sensor network for real time sensing of substrate water status combined with precise information on the effects of water availability levels on plants is an effective tool for precision irrigation management of greenhouse soilless basil keywords ocimum basilicum l wireless gs3 sensors drought stress available water greenhouse 1 introduction irrigation is of paramount importance in horticulture because of its implications on the economic and technical aspects of this agricultural sector fereres et al 2003 irrigation management affects crop performance in the case of vegetable production optimal irrigation may lead to qualitative and quantitative improvements dukes et al 2010 while both under and over irrigation may compromise the success of the crop pardossi et al 2009 beside the direct effects on crop performance irrigation practices also impact the environment and society in both developed and developing countries decreased water availability for irrigation is expected in the near future due to urbanization and industrialization playán and mateos 2006 levidow et al 2014 irrigated agriculture is the greatest water user and a potential source of pollution in many countries due to the release of agrochemicals into the environment through the leaching and runoff associated with excessive irrigation it is therefore necessary to adopt agricultural practices such as efficient irrigation management which minimize pollution to meet societal goals satisfy government regulations and promote sustainable use of resources in agriculture blackstock et al 2010 greenhouse production of vegetables has increased in importance in recent decades especially in areas with suitable climatic conditions such as the mediterranean region baudoin et al 2013 greenhouse vegetable production may decrease the environmental impact compared to open field cultivation stanghellini 2014 however to achieve this goal rational and efficient practices need to be adopted in this framework making tools available for efficient irrigation management is a key factor montesano et al 2015 one of the most disruptive innovations ever introduced in the greenhouse sector is soilless cultivation it includes any method of growing plants without the use of soil as rooting medium in which the nutrients are supplied via the irrigation water referred to as nutrient solution ns savvas et al 2013 a significant amount of greenhouse vegetables particularly in europe u s and canada are produced using soilless substrates the main advantages of this system are a better control of fertilization and irrigation and prevention of soil borne diseases generally resulting in increased yield high quality and more efficient use of resources especially water and fertilizers raviv and leith 2007 valenzano et al 2008 beside vegetables for which soilless cultivation is already well established such as tomato producers are exploring soilless greenhouse herb i e basil production systems as a means to grow high quality crops in an efficient manner treadwell et al 2011 irrigation in soilless cultivation is a highly repetitive task and can be automated to reduce labor costs however automatic irrigation does not necessarily mean efficient irrigation for instance automation based on timers in which ns is automatically supplied based on fixed schedules may not be efficient because irrigation is not based on crop water requirements a promising approach for improved irrigation management and automation in greenhouse consists of making objective decisions regarding irrigation scheduling based on real time measurements of the growing substrate water status through sensors van iersel et al 2013 soil moisture sensors are a dynamic and constantly developing area of technology for both technical and commercial reasons montesano et al 2015 and interest in using sensors for practical irrigation management has grown in the last decade pardossi et al 2009 lichtenberg et al 2013 a number of reliable and affordable sensors principally based on frequency domain reflectometry fdr to measure volumetric water content vwc and electrical conductivity ec in growing substrates have become available in the last decade readers are referred to van iersel et al 2013 for a more in depth review on this topic the use of those sensors proved to be particularly suitable for soilless conditions nemali et al 2007 irrigation based on those sensors may considerably reduce water consumption and increase the overall water use efficiency wue compared to timer based irrigation based on a recent analysis it has been estimated that the average water use by us ornamental crop producers who adopt wireless sensor irrigation networks would decline by approximately 50 majsztrik et al 2013 a significant amelioration of wue was observed with sensor based compared to timer based irrigation in soilless lettuce with wue increasing from 25 to 70 depending on the irrigation set point montesano et al 2016a the automation of irrigation based on root zone moisture sensing relies on a simple principle the moisture level in the growing substrate decreases because of evapotranspiration sensors detect this change and automatically activate irrigation when the level reaches a predetermined set value resulting in on demand irrigation van iersel 2015 this is in accordance with the assumption that an optimally designed irrigation system will provide water and fertilizers to the plants just when the plants require it this way all provided water is used by the plants and none is wasted with the possible exception of a certain leaching fraction used to prevent salt accumulation in the substrate thus maximizing wue lieth and oki 2008 by using substrate specific water retention curves it is possible to correlate the substrate vwc sensed by fdr sensors with matric potential a parameter used to estimate whether water in the substrate is available to plants this information can then be used to determine vwc set points for precise irrigation montesano et al 2016a in soilless growing substrates water is considered readily available for plants at substrate matric potentials from 10 to 100 hpa pf of 1 2 while water is considered progressively less available at matric potential values lower than 100 hpa pf 2 de boodt and verdonck 1972 raviv and blom 2001 however little work has been done to correlate the commonly defined concept of water availability with plant growth altland et al 2010 and to identify the practical effects of irrigation set points on crop performance taking into account that the response could be highly dependent on species recently a number of studies focused on the implementation of prototype systems for automatic irrigation of greenhouse crops based on soil moisture sensors possibly integrated with other types of sensors goumopoulos et al 2014 described an adaptable decision support system integrated with a wireless sensor actuator network to implement autonomous zone specific irrigation an automated system for irrigation control based on low cost open source microcontrollers and soil moisture sensors was proposed by ferrarezi et al 2015 navarro hellín et al 2015 tested a system based on an innovative wireless sensor architecture to help growers manage irrigation in different agricultural systems including greenhouse soilless culture significant advances have been made in the development of wireless technology in the last few years so new tools for irrigation control in commercial greenhouses based on wireless sensor networks are now available to growers kohanbash et al 2013 lea cox et al 2013 bayer et al 2016 based on the above mentioned considerations we designed and constructed a new prototype cloud connected system for wireless sensor based irrigation management we aimed to use data from a wireless network of soil moisture sensors placed in a greenhouse for automatic control of irrigation the system was used in two consecutive experiments with soilless basil ocimum basilicum l an important high value greenhouse crop mininni et al 2015 basil was used because of the popularity of this herb common in the mediterranean diet to enhance the flavour of food and because of its recognized antioxidant effects puccinelli et al 2017 the objective of experiment 1 was to study the effects of progressive substrate drying and the consequent decline in vwc and water availability on the gas exchange parameters and leaf water status of basil plants the study also looked at the short term recovery of plants when re watered after vwc had decreased to different levels the objective of experiment 2 was to study the effects of different irrigation set points and of different leaching rates on the performance of greenhouse grown soilless basil we also tested the ability of the sensor based irrigation system to fully automate irrigation over a complete growing cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation system description the greenhouse irrigation control kit gick used in this research is made up of hardware firmware and software components able to acquire store plot and process data generated by soil moisture sensors and consequently activate solenoid valves based on a reconfigurable set of conditions in this section a general description of the system is provided for technical details see the extended version of the system description provided as supplemental material the gick is composed of a main networking and control unit mncu and multiple wireless sdi 12 serial digital interface at 1200 baud host nodes wshns figs 1 and 2 the gick can accommodate 62 wshns the maximum number of unique addresses allowed by the sdi 12 protocol in this implementation the number of wshns is 2 serving twelve sdi 12 sensors the mncu and the wshns are both based on low cost general purpose hardware and open source software and on some custom made printed circuit boards pcbs scripts and firmware by taking advantage of the cloud computing model and of modern web technologies the prototype was designed with a strong focus on its ease of use so that even untrained users can interact with the system through a web based graphical user interface gui in this implementation every operation that can be performed by the user is present in a graphical user interface hosted in the cloud and can be accessed by any web browser on desktop smartphone and tablet devices this means that a centralized set of software services processes user requests such as a change in a configuration and relays them to the mncus the same way a centralized set of software services handles the information acquired or produced by the mncus such as a solenoid valve status and shows them to the users on the other hand critical operations such as actual irrigation decisions are performed locally on the mncu to avoid malfunctions due to a network failure the system can operate irrigation based on a manual sensor or timer based approach with specific reference to the sensor based approach the operator is required to interact with the system through the web based dashboard interface in order to select an irrigation zone to be configured select the specific sensors in the network and the related measured parameter whose readings will be used to verify the conditions for the irrigation occurrence in the zone select the data mean maximum minimum value and the condition options define the set point value define the duration of the irrigation event the duration can be divided into pulses by enabling the pulsed irrigation function and defining the duration of pulses and pauses enable if considered appropriate an emergency configuration in case of network failures typically due to faulty sensors the system sends an e mail alert and starts to supply irrigation according to a preset schedule until the sensor based mode is activated again 2 2 greenhouse experiments two experiments were carried out from april to july 2016 in a plastic polymethacrylate greenhouse at the experimental farm la noria of the institute of sciences of food production national research council ispa cnr in mola di bari ba southern italy 41 03 n 17 04 e 2 2 1 experiment 1 basil seedlings cv gigante italiano classico tesoro della terra

emitters 2 l h 1 netafim fresno ca per grow bag placed at approximately 20 cm spacing along the bag at equal distance from the lateral edges of the bag in this experiment the automatic irrigation system was set to supply irrigation according to pre set schedules while the sensor network was used for vwc monitoring as described in more detail below plants were kept well watered using a pre set irrigation schedule one minute of irrigation per hour from 8 00 am to 7 00 pm to prevent drought stress and to allow abundant leaching to avoid salt accumulation in the substrate all plants were grown under those conditions up to the start of treatments treatments were imposed on june 6 2016 38 days after transplant dat and consisted of i well watered treatment used as a control in which plants were irrigated up to the end of the experiment with a schedule set to maintain the substrate vwc close to the maximum water holding capacity ii permanent irrigation suspension in which watering was permanently stopped with the aim to expose plants to a progressively drying substrate iii recovery after 3 days without irrigation in which watering was suspended and restarted three days later when plants started to show symptoms of drought stress according to the measurements performed on that day iv recovery after four days without irrigation in which watering was suspended and restarted 4 days later in the last two treatments the maximum water holding capacity of the growing substrate was restored when irrigation was resumed the experiment was terminated 5 days after the start of the drought conditions when plants in the permanent irrigation suspension treatment showed severe water stress symptoms environmental conditions inside the greenhouse were measured using a cs215 l

measure the matric potential gradient within the substrate the soil sample ring is placed on a balance to measure evaporation from the substrate surface weight measurements are also used to determine the changes in vwc of the substrate throughout the measurement period the 250 ml soil sampling ring was filled with substrate which was subsequently saturated with water data collection started after the tensiometers were inserted into the perlite coco mixture and the soil sample ring was placed on the balance data collection was performed using software specifically designed for this purpose tensioview ums matric potential data are expressed both in hpa and as the pf log10 of the absolute value of the matric potential in hpa data collection took 12 d after which data were analyzed using curve fitting software hyprop fit ums this software determines a moisture release curve for the substrate and can also determine hydraulic conductivity of the substrate but only when the substrate is relatively dry and a measurable matric potential gradient is present in the substrate vwc less than 0 25 m3 m 3 for more details on this technique see peters and durner 2008a 2008b gas exchange and leaf water potential ψ measurements were taken every day of drought conditions around midday on plants in the well watered and permanent irrigation suspension treatments to follow the plant responses

visual appearance of plants i e presence or absence of visual symptoms of stress on the 4th day after the start of the drought conditions chlorophyll a b and total and total carotenoid content were determined spectrophotometrically using the extraction procedure reported by bonasia et al 2013 with some modifications briefly leaf discs 0 3 g were punched from young expanded leaves of two plants

same equipment and methods described for experiment 1 the same day relative chlorophyll content of the leaves was measured non destructively with a spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta ramsey n j which measures chlorophyll content in arbitrary units here referred to as spad units the measurements were performed on three plants per experimental unit 10 measurements per plant on the upper part of the canopy on 23 dat plants were harvested total fresh weight of shoots yield was measured on all 30 plants of the experimental unit while leaf area and number of leaves were measured for 6 selected representative plants wue was calculated as a function of the yield and the applied irrigation water wue total fresh weight of shoots irrigation volume applied color analysis of leaves was conducted with a colorimeter cr 400 konica minolta osaka japan equipped with illuminant d65 in reflectance mode and in the cie l lightness a redness b yellowness color scale for each replication color parameters were measured on two plants using five expanded leaves from both plants and two measurements per leaf before the measurements the colorimeter was calibrated with a standard reference 2 2 3 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova treatment means were separated by tukey test when there was a significant effect at the p 0 05 level the statistical software statistica 10 0 statsoft tulsa ok usa was used for the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 the vwc in the substrate of the well watered treatment remained close to the maximum water holding capacity with a small decrease in vwc overnight when the plants were not watered fig 3 in contrast vwc decreased progressively in the other treatments in the permanent irrigation suspension treatment vwc was approximately 0 40 0 26 0 18 0 10 and 0 07 m3 m 3 around midday on days 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively fig 3 on day 3 and 4 after taking measurements for that day irrigation was reactivated in the two vwc recovery treatments until irrigation was reactivated vwc values in these treatments were similar to the permanent irrigation suspension treatment after reactivating irrigation vwc was restored to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate as was evident from the appearance of leaching however vwc values at the maximum water holding capacity in the substrates subjected to drying and then re watered did not reach the same vwc as the substrate of the well watered treatment fig 3 this may be due partly to the typical hysteresis that most growing substrates exhibit during drying wetting cycles affecting their hydraulic properties and inducing rewetting difficulties valat et al 1991 naasz et al 2009 according to the substrate hydraulic properties analysis the pf increased from 0 69 to 2 59 as the substrate vwc decreased from 0 59 to 0 16 m3 m 3 at substrate vwcs of 0 40 0 30 and 0 20 m3 m 3 the pf was 1 49 1 98 and 2 34 respectively corresponding to matric potentials of 31 95 and 221 hpa fig 4 a hydraulic conductivity measurements depend on a gradient in matric potential between the two tensiometers of the hyprop and could only be determined for substrate water contents from 0 30 to 0 16 m3 m 3 figs 4b and c show the hydraulic conductivity over a range of vwc and matric potential expressed as pf in the perlite coco substrate used in the experiment within this relatively narrow range of substrate water content the hydraulic conductivity decreased 690 fold at a substrate vwc of 0 30 m3 m 3 the hydraulic conductivity was 0 076 cm day 1 while at a vwc of 0 20 m3 m 3 it was reduced to 0 0025 cm day 1 approximately 30 x lower this rapid decrease in substrate hydraulic conductivity can slow the mass flow of water towards the root system and may limit water availability in highly porous dry substrates o meara et al 2014 for the first two days following irrigation suspension the plants showed no visible or physiological stress symptoms fig 5 on day 3 plants subjected to drought conditions had much lower gs pn and tr than well watered plants 0 03 vs 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 2 27 vs 7 88 μmol m 2 s 1 and 1 51 vs 3 63 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 5a c in addition to physiological effects symptoms of water stress became visible in drought stressed plants on day 4 and became more severe on day 5 on day 4 gas exchange of plants that were re watered after 3 days without irrigation recovered to values similar to the control plants higher than drought stressed plants fig 5a c similarly on day 5 non irrigated plants had lower gs pn and tr than control plants irrigated after 4 days of drought recovered to values similar to control plants on day 5 fig 5a c closing stomata to reduce transpiration and prevent tissue dehydration and potential damage to the leaf is a typical response of plants to decreasing water availability sperry et al 2002 the ψ was similar for all plants up to day 3 while on days 4 and 5 plants subjected to permanent water stress had lower ψ than control plants 1 4 vs 0 8 and 1 4 vs 0 77 mpa respectively on day 4 and 5 fig 5d in general plants subjected to drought and subsequent irrigation had ψ values similar to the control fig 5d the contents of chla chlb chltot and total carotenoids were similar in all treatments on average 1037 325 1362 and 216 μg g 1 fresh weight respectively data not shown kordi et al 2013 reported reduced photosynthetic pigment concentrations in drought stressed basil grown in a mixture of fine sand leaf mould and garden soil subjected to drought ranging from 60 to 30 of field capacity for the entire growing cycle on the other hand khakdan et al 2016 found that under severe water deficit stress conditions 25 of field capacity in a sandy loam soil for 29 days basil chl content increased while carotenoid content decreased in our study the absence of responses in terms of chl and carotenoids content is probably due to the short term focus of the study the drought conditions had clear effects on gas exchanges and water status of plants but stress was not severe enough to affect pigment concentrations based on substrate vwc during the experiment and observations on plants no physiological stress responses were observed when vwc value was higher than approximately 0 20 m3 m 3 day 1 and 2 figs 3 and 5 but when vwc dropped below this value as observed on day 3 at a vwc of approximately 0 17 m3 m 3 fig 3 photosynthesis started to decrease fig 5 however all basil plants exposed to a vwc well below 0 20 m3 m 3 although for a short period survived while clearly showing symptoms of water stress consistent with previous studies with plants in soilless substrate exposed to drought for a short o meara et al 2014 or long term period burnett and van iersel 2008 van iersel et al 2010 in our experiment water availability in the drought stressed treatment could be considered a limiting factor to normal plant gas exchange and water status from day 3 on as confirmed by the drastic reduction in photosynthetic parameters and starting from day 4 by ψ based on the substrate moisture release curve fig 4a the matric potential corresponding to the vwc observed on day 3 at the time of measurements approximately 0 17 m3 m 3 was 315 hpa water in soilless growing substrates is generally considered readily available for plants with substrate matric potentials of 10 to 100 hpa pf of 1 2 while water is considered progressively less available at matric potential values lower than 100 hpa pf 2 de boodt and verdonck 1972 plant available water in soilless substrates traditionally has been defined based on substrate matric potential but it recently has been suggested that substrate hydraulic conductivity may be the real factor controlling water availability to plants in soilless growing substrates and should be considered in the assessment of plant response to substrate water status variations raviv and blom 2001 wallach 2008 o meara et al 2014 low hydraulic conductivity in fact may slow water movement in drying substrates and thus limit plant water uptake van iersel et al 2013 in the present study drought symptoms in plant basil appeared approximately at a hydraulic conductivity of 0 0005 cm day 1 fig 4c the results of this experiment show the short term physiological effects of low vwc on soilless basil plants but also indicate that photosynthesis and leaf water potential can recover following a short drought with vwc as low as 0 10 m3 m 3 it is also interesting to note that leaf gas exchange was reduced before visual stress symptoms or a reduction in ψ were detected this confirms that irrigation management based on visual assessment of plants may not be able to prevent drought stress while real time sensing of substrate water status is an effective tool if combined with precise information on the effects of substrate water availability on plants nemali et al 2007 however it is necessary to also test the growth response of plants exposed to different vwc levels for the entire growing cycle to determine how well short and long term response correlate 3 2 experiment 2 the sensor based irrigation system automated irrigation successfully over the 14 days of this study in all treatments vwc fluctuated between the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate as evident from the presence of leaching table 1 and the specific irrigation set point for the treatment fig 6 the first sensor based irrigation event occurred in vwc 0 4 on the first day after treatments were started 9 dat fig 6a and in vwc 0 3 and vwc 0 3 hl treatments on the following day 10 dat fig 6b while it took 4 days 12 dat for the substrate of the vwc 0 2 treatment to dry out to the irrigation set point 0 20 m3 m 3 fig 6c the vwc fluctuations were greatest in the vwc 0 2 treatment in which the irrigation frequency was the lowest fig 6c as in experiment 1 substrates subjected to the lowest vwc set point 0 20 m3 m 3 showed rewetting difficulties following severe drying as evident from the lower vwc values after irrigation events compared to the initial vwc measured at the start of treatments fig 6c valat et al 1991 naasz et al 2009 total applied ns was similar in vwc 0 4 vwc 0 3 and vwc 0 2 treatments while the highest total applied ns was recorded in vwc 0 3hl table 1 leaching was similar 8 3 on average table 1 for treatments where a low leaching rate was targeted regardless of irrigation set point while it was higher 18 4 in the high leaching treatment table 1 adjusting the irrigation event duration combined with the sensor based control of substrate moisture was an effective strategy for precise control of leaching the use of gick allowed for a reduction in leaching to values considered a goal for efficient irrigation management in free drain open soilless culture i e 10 15 pardossi et al 2009 the ecp generally increased over time in all treatments from 2 5 to 4 5 ds m 1 fig 6 thus confirming an accumulation of salts in the growing substrate from fertilizers added and salts present in the irrigation water such increase in ecp commonly occurs in commercial soilless growing conditions lieth and oki 2008 however the behavior of the ecp differed among treatments when the set point was 0 30 or 0 40 m3 m 3 the ecp generally fell after irrigation events as an effect of salt leaching and dilution in the growing medium and increased on average during the interval before the next irrigation reaching the maximum value just before the next irrigation fig 6a and b similar patterns were reported by valdés et al 2015 on the other hand when the set point was 0 20 m3 m 3 the ecp tended to decrease during the time between two consecutive irrigation events and sharply increased after an irrigation fig 6c it is possible that the longer period between consecutive irrigation events in this treatment allowed plants to take up salts from the substrate solution lowering the ecp before the next application of ns increased ecp again such fluctuations in ecp were less pronounced in other treatments where ns was applied more frequently however we cannot rule out that this decrease in ecp between irrigation events was an artefact of the way ecp was calculated since ecp calculations tend to be less accurate at low vwc scoggins and van iersel 2006 the higher leaching rate imposed in the vwc 0 3hl treatment led to less salinity build up compared to vwc 0 3 the ecp in these two treatments was similar in the first half of the growing cycle but in the second half approximately from 16 dat the ecp was higher with minimum leaching vwc 0 3 than with high leaching vwc 0 3hl 4 5 vs 3 7 ds m 1 respectively on average fig 6 b the desired leaching rate typically is a function of how quickly salt build up is likely to occur as well as crop sensitivity to salinity leaching may be desirable when the irrigation water has high salinity as leaching will help move salts out of the root zone if the water is of good quality and fertigation results in little salt build up in the root zone then the leaching rate can be minimized lieth and oki 2008 growers may adjust the duration of irrigation events with the optimal duration dependent on the volume of water that needs to be supplied to restore the substrate water holding capacity starting from a specific water content plus the amount of leaching that is needed measuring salinity and water status of substrates is essential to determine appropriate leaching amounts in conventional irrigation approaches the leaching fraction should range from 0 to 20 under well controlled conditions in rare instances higher leaching fractions are targeted i e when saline irrigation water is used lieth and oki 2008 however it is common in substrate systems to apply 30 50 more water than that used by the crop kläring 2001 and often growers do not have a clear and precise record of the leachate amounts the availability of new sensors that combine the measurements of substrate water content and ec offers new possibilities for management of irrigation and leaching especially when saline water is used for soilless cultivation incrocci et al 2010 those sensors have been successfully integrated in the automatic irrigation system designed for the present study resulting in precise control of leaching using gick growers could monitor ecp and increase the leaching rate when ecp exceeds crop specific thresholds photosynthetic parameters and spad did not differ among treatments table 1 this is consistent with our findings in experiment 1 which showed that photosynthesis of basil plants can recover fully after exposure to vwc as low as 0 20 m3 m 3 with similar leaching rates plants irrigated at 0 20 0 30 or 0 40 m3 m 3 set points had similar fresh weight table 1 based on the hydraulic properties of the substrate fig 4a water is readily available to plants at vwc 0 30 m3 m 3 pf 2 the absence of an effect on yield between plants irrigated at 0 30 and 0 40 m3 m 3 seems to confirm this on the other hand exposing plants repeatedly although briefly to a vwc of 0 20 m3 m 3 did not significantly reduce growth fresh weight tended to be highest when a higher leaching rate was used vwc 0 3hl table 1 probably because leaching lowered ecp during the final part of the growing cycle and may thus have reduced salinity stress fig 6b similar to fresh weight water use was similar in the three treatments with low leaching fraction as expected water use was higher with more leaching vwc 0 3hl but because fresh weight was greatest in this treatment wue was similar in all treatments 21 g fresh weight per liter table 1 at the crop level wue indicates how efficiently applied water is used to produce yield and optimal irrigation scheduling has been recognized as a major factor affecting wue however due to the high economic value and productivity per unit of applied water compared to other crops commercial vegetable growers tend to over irrigate with a consequent reduction in wue de pascale et al 2011 sensor based on demand scheduling proved to be effective in reducing irrigation water use and as a result in improving wue in ornamental crops without risking adverse consequences from under or overwatering lea cox et al 2013 hagen et al 2014 when tested in vegetable production the use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation management resulted in improved wue de pascale et al 2011 montesano et al 2016a the color of food is one of the main quality parameters evaluated by consumers influences their choices and is critical to product acceptance since food appearance is the first impression consumers get before either accepting or rejecting food leon et al 2006 montesano et al 2016b in the present study the irrigation set points did not influence the visual quality of basil in terms of color table 1 similarly bekhradi et al 2015 found that irrigation treatments corresponding to 100 75 and 50 of the field capacity did not influence color parameters of basil genovese green and purple genotypes grown in peat substrate under greenhouse conditions 4 conclusions the sensor based irrigation system designed and constructed for the present study automated irrigation successfully and was suitable for assessing the physiological responses of plants to different water availability levels in the growing substrate thus our results indicate that the use of a wireless sensor network for real time sensing of substrate water status is an effective tool for precision irrigation management of basil in greenhouse soilless conditions the findings of the present study revealed that drought symptoms appeared in basil at a moisture level well below the commonly accepted matric potential based limit for the easy available water in soilless substrates confirming that more work is needed to identify the practical effects of irrigation set points on crop performance this approach to irrigation may be adapted to other species if combined with precise information on the effects of water availability levels on those species founding source this work

11463,dielectric moisture sensors are particularly suitable for irrigation management in greenhouse soilless production identifying the practical effects of substrate water content set points on crop

grown in a perlite coco 1 1 v v soilless substrate under greenhouse conditions dielectric moisture salinity sensors gs3 decagon devices pullman wa usa were used the study with two subsequent experiments assessed i the effects of a progressive decline in substrate water availability corresponding to moisture levels from water holding capacity to 0 10 m3 m 3 on the gas exchange parameters and leaf water status of basil plants ii the short term recovery response of plants when re watered after substrate water content has decreased to different levels iii the effects of different irrigation set points 0 40 0 30 and 0 20 m3 m 3 and leaching rates 8 or 18 on the basil crop performance over a complete growing cycle no physiological stress responses were observed on basil plants when moisture level was higher than approximately 0 20 m3 m 3 while plants showed drought symptoms at approximately 0 17 m3 m 3 corresponding to a substrate matric potential and hydraulic conductivity of 300 hpa and 0 0005 cm day 1 respectively photosynthesis and leaf water potential recovered to values similar to non stress conditions following a short drought with moisture level as low as 0 10 m3 m 3 basil growth was similar when plants were grown with irrigation set points of 0 40 0 30 or 0 20 m3 m 3 for the complete growing cycle fresh weight tended to increase when a higher leaching rate was used probably because leaching lowered substrate ec water use efficiency basil fresh weight unit water used was similar at different irrigation set points and leaching rates our results indicate that the use of a wireless sensor network for real time sensing of substrate water status combined with precise information on the effects of water availability levels on plants is an effective tool for precision irrigation management of greenhouse soilless basil keywords ocimum basilicum l wireless gs3 sensors drought stress available water greenhouse 1 introduction irrigation is of paramount importance in horticulture because of its implications on the economic and technical aspects of this agricultural sector fereres et al 2003 irrigation management affects crop performance in the case of vegetable production optimal irrigation may lead to qualitative and quantitative improvements dukes et al 2010 while both under and over irrigation may compromise the success of the crop pardossi et al 2009 beside the direct effects on crop performance irrigation practices also impact the environment and society in both developed and developing countries decreased water availability for irrigation is expected in the near future due to urbanization and industrialization playán and mateos 2006 levidow et al 2014 irrigated agriculture is the greatest water user and a potential source of pollution in many countries due to the release of agrochemicals into the environment through the leaching and runoff associated with excessive irrigation it is therefore necessary to adopt agricultural practices such as efficient irrigation management which minimize pollution to meet societal goals satisfy government regulations and promote sustainable use of resources in agriculture blackstock et al 2010 greenhouse production of vegetables has increased in importance in recent decades especially in areas with suitable climatic conditions such as the mediterranean region baudoin et al 2013 greenhouse vegetable production may decrease the environmental impact compared to open field cultivation stanghellini 2014 however to achieve this goal rational and efficient practices need to be adopted in this framework making tools available for efficient irrigation management is a key factor montesano et al 2015 one of the most disruptive innovations ever introduced in the greenhouse sector is soilless cultivation it includes any method of growing plants without the use of soil as rooting medium in which the nutrients are supplied via the irrigation water referred to as nutrient solution ns savvas et al 2013 a significant amount of greenhouse vegetables particularly in europe u s and canada are produced using soilless substrates the main advantages of this system are a better control of fertilization and irrigation and prevention of soil borne diseases generally resulting in increased yield high quality and more efficient use of resources especially water and fertilizers raviv and leith 2007 valenzano et al 2008 beside vegetables for which soilless cultivation is already well established such as tomato producers are exploring soilless greenhouse herb i e basil production systems as a means to grow high quality crops in an efficient manner treadwell et al 2011 irrigation in soilless cultivation is a highly repetitive task and can be automated to reduce labor costs however automatic irrigation does not necessarily mean efficient irrigation for instance automation based on timers in which ns is automatically supplied based on fixed schedules may not be efficient because irrigation is not based on crop water requirements a promising approach for improved irrigation management and automation in greenhouse consists of making objective decisions regarding irrigation scheduling based on real time measurements of the growing substrate water status through sensors van iersel et al 2013 soil moisture sensors are a dynamic and constantly developing area of technology for both technical and commercial reasons montesano et al 2015 and interest in using sensors for practical irrigation management has grown in the last decade pardossi et al 2009 lichtenberg et al 2013 a number of reliable and affordable sensors principally based on frequency domain reflectometry fdr to measure volumetric water content vwc and electrical conductivity ec in growing substrates have become available in the last decade readers are referred to van iersel et al 2013 for a more in depth review on this topic the use of those sensors proved to be particularly suitable for soilless conditions nemali et al 2007 irrigation based on those sensors may considerably reduce water consumption and increase the overall water use efficiency wue compared to timer based irrigation based on a recent analysis it has been estimated that the average water use by us ornamental crop producers who adopt wireless sensor irrigation networks would decline by approximately 50 majsztrik et al 2013 a significant amelioration of wue was observed with sensor based compared to timer based irrigation in soilless lettuce with wue increasing from 25 to 70 depending on the irrigation set point montesano et al 2016a the automation of irrigation based on root zone moisture sensing relies on a simple principle the moisture level in the growing substrate decreases because of evapotranspiration sensors detect this change and automatically activate irrigation when the level reaches a predetermined set value resulting in on demand irrigation van iersel 2015 this is in accordance with the assumption that an optimally designed irrigation system will provide water and fertilizers to the plants just when the plants require it this way all provided water is used by the plants and none is wasted with the possible exception of a certain leaching fraction used to prevent salt accumulation in the substrate thus maximizing wue lieth and oki 2008 by using substrate specific water retention curves it is possible to correlate the substrate vwc sensed by fdr sensors with matric potential a parameter used to estimate whether water in the substrate is available to plants this information can then be used to determine vwc set points for precise irrigation montesano et al 2016a in soilless growing substrates water is considered readily available for plants at substrate matric potentials from 10 to 100 hpa pf of 1 2 while water is considered progressively less available at matric potential values lower than 100 hpa pf 2 de boodt and verdonck 1972 raviv and blom 2001 however little work has been done to correlate the commonly defined concept of water availability with plant growth altland et al 2010 and to identify the practical effects of irrigation set points on crop performance taking into account that the response could be highly dependent on species recently a number of studies focused on the implementation of prototype systems for automatic irrigation of greenhouse crops based on soil moisture sensors possibly integrated with other types of sensors goumopoulos et al 2014 described an adaptable decision support system integrated with a wireless sensor actuator network to implement autonomous zone specific irrigation an automated system for irrigation control based on low cost open source microcontrollers and soil moisture sensors was proposed by ferrarezi et al 2015 navarro hellín et al 2015 tested a system based on an innovative wireless sensor architecture to help growers manage irrigation in different agricultural systems including greenhouse soilless culture significant advances have been made in the development of wireless technology in the last few years so new tools for irrigation control in commercial greenhouses based on wireless sensor networks are now available to growers kohanbash et al 2013 lea cox et al 2013 bayer et al 2016 based on the above mentioned considerations we designed and constructed a new prototype cloud connected system for wireless sensor based irrigation management we aimed to use data from a wireless network of soil moisture sensors placed in a greenhouse for automatic control of irrigation the system was used in two consecutive experiments with soilless basil ocimum basilicum l an important high value greenhouse crop mininni et al 2015 basil was used because of the popularity of this herb common in the mediterranean diet to enhance the flavour of food and because of its recognized antioxidant effects puccinelli et al 2017 the objective of experiment 1 was to study the effects of progressive substrate drying and the consequent decline in vwc and water availability on the gas exchange parameters and leaf water status of basil plants the study also looked at the short term recovery of plants when re watered after vwc had decreased to different levels the objective of experiment 2 was to study the effects of different irrigation set points and of different leaching rates on the performance of greenhouse grown soilless basil we also tested the ability of the sensor based irrigation system to fully automate irrigation over a complete growing cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation system description the greenhouse irrigation control kit gick used in this research is made up of hardware firmware and software components able to acquire store plot and process data generated by soil moisture sensors and consequently activate solenoid valves based on a reconfigurable set of conditions in this section a general description of the system is provided for technical details see the extended version of the system description provided as supplemental material the gick is composed of a main networking and control unit mncu and multiple wireless sdi 12 serial digital interface at 1200 baud host nodes wshns figs 1 and 2 the gick can accommodate 62 wshns the maximum number of unique addresses allowed by the sdi 12 protocol in this implementation the number of wshns is 2 serving twelve sdi 12 sensors the mncu and the wshns are both based on low cost general purpose hardware and open source software and on some custom made printed circuit boards pcbs scripts and firmware by taking advantage of the cloud computing model and of modern web technologies the prototype was designed with a strong focus on its ease of use so that even untrained users can interact with the system through a web based graphical user interface gui in this implementation every operation that can be performed by the user is present in a graphical user interface hosted in the cloud and can be accessed by any web browser on desktop smartphone and tablet devices this means that a centralized set of software services processes user requests such as a change in a configuration and relays them to the mncus the same way a centralized set of software services handles the information acquired or produced by the mncus such as a solenoid valve status and shows them to the users on the other hand critical operations such as actual irrigation decisions are performed locally on the mncu to avoid malfunctions due to a network failure the system can operate irrigation based on a manual sensor or timer based approach with specific reference to the sensor based approach the operator is required to interact with the system through the web based dashboard interface in order to select an irrigation zone to be configured select the specific sensors in the network and the related measured parameter whose readings will be used to verify the conditions for the irrigation occurrence in the zone select the data mean maximum minimum value and the condition options define the set point value define the duration of the irrigation event the duration can be divided into pulses by enabling the pulsed irrigation function and defining the duration of pulses and pauses enable if considered appropriate an emergency configuration in case of network failures typically due to faulty sensors the system sends an e mail alert and starts to supply irrigation according to a preset schedule until the sensor based mode is activated again 2 2 greenhouse experiments two experiments were carried out from april to july 2016 in a plastic polymethacrylate greenhouse at the experimental farm la noria of the institute of

system was set to supply irrigation according to pre set schedules while the sensor network was used for vwc monitoring as described in more detail below plants were kept well watered using a pre set irrigation schedule one minute of irrigation per hour from 8 00 am to 7 00 pm to prevent drought stress and to allow abundant leaching to avoid salt accumulation in the substrate all plants were grown under those conditions up to the start of treatments treatments were imposed on june 6 2016 38 days after transplant dat and consisted of i well watered treatment used as a control in which plants were irrigated up to the end of the experiment with a schedule set to maintain the substrate vwc close to the maximum water holding capacity ii permanent irrigation suspension in which watering was permanently stopped with the aim to expose plants to a progressively drying substrate iii recovery after 3 days without irrigation in which watering was suspended and restarted three days later when plants started to show symptoms of drought stress according to the measurements performed on that day iv recovery after four days without irrigation in which watering was suspended and restarted 4 days later in the last two treatments the maximum water holding capacity of the growing substrate was restored when irrigation was resumed the experiment was terminated 5 days after the start of the drought conditions when plants in the permanent irrigation suspension treatment showed severe water stress symptoms environmental conditions inside the greenhouse were measured using a cs215 l

measure the matric potential gradient within the substrate the soil sample ring is placed on a balance to measure evaporation from the substrate surface weight measurements are also used to determine the changes in vwc of the substrate throughout the measurement period the 250 ml soil sampling ring was filled with substrate which was subsequently saturated with water data collection started after the tensiometers were inserted into the perlite coco mixture and the soil sample ring was placed on the balance data collection was performed using software specifically designed for this purpose tensioview ums matric potential data are expressed both in hpa and as the pf log10 of the absolute value of the matric potential in hpa data collection took 12 d after which data were analyzed using curve fitting software hyprop fit ums this software determines a moisture release curve for the substrate and can also determine hydraulic conductivity of the substrate but only when the substrate is relatively dry and a measurable matric potential gradient is present in the substrate vwc less than 0 25 m3 m 3 for more details on this technique see peters and durner 2008a 2008b gas exchange and leaf water potential ψ measurements were taken every day of drought conditions around midday on plants in the well watered and permanent irrigation suspension treatments to follow the plant responses to different substrate water conditions those measurements were also taken on day 4 and 5 the day following the restarting of irrigation on plants of recovery after 3 days without irrigation and recovery after 4 days without irrigation respectively net leaf photosynthesis pn stomatal conductance gs and transpiration rate tr were measured using a li 6400xt portable photosynthesis system licor inc lincoln ne usa which provided a photosynthetic photon flux ppf of 800 μmol m 2 s 1 and a co2 concentration of 400 μmol mol 1 the measures were performed on two plants per replications on two fully developed young green leaves per plant exposed to sunlight for a total of twelve replicated measurements per treatment the ψ was measured using a scholander hammel type pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 for each replication two leaves were collected from two different plants for a total of twelve replicated measurements per treatment at the time of measurements a note was also taken on the visual appearance of plants i e presence or absence of visual symptoms of stress on the 4th day after the start of the drought conditions chlorophyll a b and total and total carotenoid content were determined spectrophotometrically using the extraction procedure reported by bonasia et al 2013 with some modifications briefly leaf discs 0 3 g were punched from young expanded leaves of two plants per replication the leaf discs were placed in 80 acetone for the extraction and the absorbance of the extract was measured at 470 645 and 662 nm using a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu kyoto japan the amount of chlorophyll a and b total chlorophyll and total carotenoids expressed on a fresh weight basis μg g 1 were calculated using the following eqs 1 4 dere et al 1998 1 chlorophyll a chla 11

in a randomized complete block design with three replications each experimental unit containing 3 grow bags with a total of 30 plants per experimental unit three gs3 sensors per treatment were used to measure substrate vwc and ec each sensor was installed in the middle part of the central grow bag in each experimental unit at equal distance between emitters and was fully inserted into the substrate

and stop of every irrigation event flow meters gsd5 b meters gonars ud italy were used to record the amount of supplied ns ns leachate from the grow bags was collected in buckets placed at the lower end of each experimental unit and was measured approximately every two days no pesticide applications were needed during the growing cycle which ended on july 13 2016 23 dat average daily mean minimum and maximum air temperatures inside the greenhouse during the crop cycle were 30 5 22 0 and 40 3 c respectively average daily mean minimum and maximum air relative humidity were 53 30 and 77 respectively the daily light integral dli during the experiment ranged from about 12 to 21 mol m 2 d 1 with a mean value of 19 mol m 2 d 1 on 22 dat gas exchange parameters were measured using the same equipment and methods described for experiment 1 the same day relative chlorophyll content of the leaves was measured non destructively with a spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta ramsey n j which measures chlorophyll content in arbitrary units here referred to as spad units the measurements were performed on three plants per experimental unit 10 measurements per plant on the upper part of the canopy on 23 dat plants were harvested total fresh weight of shoots yield was measured on all 30 plants of the experimental unit while leaf area and number of leaves were measured for 6 selected representative plants wue was calculated as a function of the yield and the applied irrigation water wue total fresh weight of shoots irrigation volume applied color analysis of leaves was conducted with a colorimeter cr 400 konica minolta osaka japan equipped with illuminant d65 in reflectance mode and in the cie l lightness a redness b yellowness color scale for each replication color parameters were measured on two plants using five expanded leaves from both plants and two measurements per leaf before the measurements the colorimeter was calibrated with a standard reference 2 2 3 statistical analysis data were subjected to analysis of variance anova treatment means were separated by tukey test when there was a significant effect at the p 0 05 level the statistical software statistica 10 0 statsoft tulsa ok usa was used for the analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 experiment 1 the vwc in the substrate of the well watered treatment remained close to the maximum water holding capacity with a small decrease in vwc overnight when the plants were not watered fig 3 in contrast vwc decreased progressively in the other treatments in the permanent irrigation suspension treatment vwc was approximately 0 40 0 26 0 18 0 10 and 0 07 m3 m 3 around midday on days 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively fig 3 on day 3 and 4 after taking measurements for that day irrigation was reactivated in the two vwc recovery treatments until irrigation was reactivated vwc values in these treatments were similar to the permanent irrigation suspension treatment after reactivating irrigation vwc was restored to the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate as was evident from the appearance of leaching however vwc values at the maximum water holding capacity in the substrates subjected to drying and then re watered did not reach the same vwc as the substrate of the well watered treatment fig 3 this may be due partly to the typical hysteresis that most growing substrates exhibit during drying wetting cycles affecting their hydraulic properties and inducing rewetting difficulties valat et al 1991 naasz et al 2009 according to the substrate hydraulic properties analysis the pf increased from 0 69 to 2 59 as the substrate vwc decreased from 0 59 to 0 16 m3 m 3 at substrate vwcs of 0 40 0 30 and 0 20 m3 m 3 the pf was 1 49 1 98 and 2 34 respectively corresponding to matric potentials of 31 95 and 221 hpa fig 4 a hydraulic conductivity measurements depend on a gradient in matric potential between the two tensiometers of the hyprop and could only be determined for substrate water contents from 0 30 to 0 16 m3 m 3 figs 4b and c show the hydraulic conductivity over a range of vwc and matric potential expressed as pf in the perlite coco substrate used in the experiment within this relatively narrow range of substrate water content the hydraulic conductivity decreased 690 fold at a substrate vwc of 0 30 m3 m 3 the hydraulic conductivity was 0 076 cm day 1 while at a vwc of 0 20 m3 m 3 it was reduced to 0 0025 cm day 1 approximately 30 x lower this rapid decrease in substrate hydraulic conductivity can slow the mass flow of water towards the root system and may limit water availability in highly porous dry substrates o meara et al 2014 for the first two days following irrigation suspension the plants showed no visible or physiological stress symptoms fig 5 on day 3 plants subjected to drought conditions had much lower gs pn and tr than well watered plants 0 03 vs 0 12 mol m 2 s 1 2 27 vs 7 88 μmol m 2 s 1 and 1 51 vs 3 63 mmol m 2 s 1 respectively fig 5a c in addition to physiological effects symptoms of water stress became visible in drought stressed plants on day 4 and became more severe on day 5 on day 4 gas exchange of plants that were re watered after 3 days without irrigation recovered to values similar to the control plants higher than drought stressed plants fig 5a c similarly on day 5 non irrigated plants had lower gs pn and tr than control plants irrigated after 4 days of drought recovered to values similar to control plants on day 5 fig 5a c closing stomata to reduce transpiration and prevent tissue dehydration and potential damage to the leaf is a typical response of plants to decreasing water availability sperry et al 2002 the ψ was similar for all plants up to day 3 while on days 4 and 5 plants subjected to permanent water stress had lower ψ than control plants 1 4 vs 0 8 and 1 4 vs 0 77 mpa respectively on day 4 and 5 fig 5d in general plants subjected to drought and subsequent irrigation had ψ values similar to the control fig 5d the contents of chla chlb chltot and total carotenoids were similar in all treatments on average 1037 325 1362 and 216 μg g 1 fresh weight respectively data not shown kordi et al 2013 reported reduced photosynthetic pigment concentrations in drought stressed basil grown in a mixture of fine sand leaf mould and garden soil subjected to drought ranging from 60 to 30 of field capacity for the entire growing cycle on the other hand khakdan et al 2016 found that under severe water deficit stress conditions 25 of field capacity in a sandy loam soil for 29 days basil chl content increased while carotenoid content decreased in our study the absence of responses in terms of chl and carotenoids content is probably due to the short term focus of the study the drought conditions had clear effects on gas exchanges and water status of plants but stress was not severe enough to affect pigment concentrations based on substrate vwc during the experiment and observations on plants no physiological stress responses were observed when vwc value was higher than approximately 0 20 m3 m 3 day 1 and 2 figs 3 and 5 but when vwc dropped below this value as observed on day 3 at a vwc of approximately 0 17 m3 m 3 fig 3 photosynthesis started to decrease fig 5 however all basil plants exposed to a vwc well below 0 20 m3 m 3 although for a short period survived while clearly showing symptoms of water stress consistent with previous studies with plants in soilless substrate exposed to drought for a short o meara et al 2014 or long term period burnett and van iersel 2008 van iersel et al 2010 in our experiment water availability in the drought stressed treatment could be considered a limiting factor to normal plant gas exchange and water status from day 3 on as confirmed by the drastic reduction in photosynthetic parameters and starting from day 4 by ψ based on the substrate moisture release curve fig 4a the matric potential corresponding to the vwc observed on day 3 at the time of measurements approximately 0 17 m3 m 3 was 315 hpa water in soilless growing substrates is generally considered readily available for plants with substrate matric potentials of 10 to 100 hpa pf of 1 2 while water is considered progressively less available at matric potential values lower than 100 hpa pf 2 de boodt and verdonck 1972 plant available water in soilless substrates traditionally has been defined based on substrate matric potential but it recently has been suggested that substrate hydraulic conductivity may be the real factor controlling water availability to plants in soilless growing substrates and should be considered in the assessment of plant response to substrate water status variations raviv and blom 2001 wallach 2008 o meara et al 2014 low hydraulic conductivity in fact may slow water movement in drying substrates and thus limit plant water uptake van iersel et al 2013 in the present study drought symptoms in plant basil appeared approximately at a hydraulic conductivity of 0 0005 cm day 1 fig 4c the results of this experiment show the short term physiological effects of low vwc on soilless basil plants but also indicate that photosynthesis and leaf water potential can recover following a short drought with vwc as low as 0 10 m3 m 3 it is also interesting to note that leaf gas exchange was reduced before visual stress symptoms or a reduction in ψ were detected this confirms that irrigation management based on visual assessment of plants may not be able to prevent drought stress while real time sensing of substrate water status is an effective tool if combined with precise information on the effects of substrate water availability on plants nemali et al 2007 however it is necessary to also test the growth response of plants exposed to different vwc levels for the entire growing cycle to determine how well short and long term response correlate 3 2 experiment 2 the sensor based irrigation system automated irrigation successfully over the 14 days of this study in all treatments vwc fluctuated between the maximum water holding capacity of the substrate as evident from the presence of leaching table 1 and the specific irrigation set point for the treatment fig 6 the first sensor based irrigation event occurred in vwc 0 4 on the first day after treatments were started 9 dat fig 6a and in vwc 0 3 and vwc 0 3 hl treatments on the following day 10 dat fig 6b while it took 4 days 12 dat for the substrate of the vwc 0 2 treatment to dry out to the irrigation set point 0 20 m3 m 3 fig 6c the vwc fluctuations were greatest in the vwc 0 2 treatment in which the irrigation frequency was the lowest fig 6c as in experiment 1 substrates subjected to the lowest vwc set point 0 20 m3 m 3 showed rewetting difficulties following severe drying as evident from the lower vwc values after irrigation events compared to the initial vwc measured at the start of treatments fig 6c valat et al 1991 naasz et al 2009 total applied ns was similar in vwc 0 4 vwc 0 3 and vwc 0 2 treatments while the highest total applied ns was recorded in vwc 0 3hl table 1 leaching was similar 8 3 on average table 1 for treatments where a low leaching rate was targeted regardless of irrigation set point while it was higher 18 4 in the high leaching treatment table 1 adjusting the irrigation event duration combined with the sensor based control of substrate moisture was an effective strategy for precise control of leaching the use of gick allowed for a reduction in leaching to values considered a goal for efficient irrigation management in free drain open soilless culture i e 10 15 pardossi et al 2009 the ecp generally increased over time in all treatments from 2 5 to 4 5 ds m 1 fig 6 thus confirming an accumulation of salts in the growing substrate from fertilizers added and salts present in the irrigation water such increase in ecp commonly occurs in commercial soilless growing conditions lieth and oki 2008 however the behavior of the ecp differed among treatments when the set point was 0 30 or 0 40 m3 m 3 the ecp generally fell after irrigation events as an effect of salt leaching and dilution in the growing medium and increased on average during the interval before the next irrigation reaching the maximum value just before the next irrigation fig 6a and b similar patterns were reported by valdés et al 2015 on the other hand when the set point was 0 20 m3 m 3 the ecp tended to decrease during the time between two consecutive irrigation events and sharply increased after an irrigation fig 6c it is possible that the longer period between consecutive irrigation events in this treatment allowed plants to take up salts from the substrate solution lowering the ecp before the next application of ns increased ecp again such fluctuations in ecp were less pronounced in other treatments where ns was applied more frequently however we cannot rule out that this decrease in ecp between irrigation events was an artefact of the way ecp was calculated since ecp calculations tend to be less accurate at low vwc scoggins and van iersel 2006 the higher leaching rate imposed in the vwc 0 3hl treatment led to less salinity build up compared to vwc 0 3 the ecp in these two treatments was similar in the first half of the growing cycle but in the second half approximately from 16 dat the ecp was higher with minimum leaching vwc 0 3 than with high leaching vwc 0 3hl 4 5 vs 3 7 ds m 1 respectively on average fig 6 b the desired leaching rate typically is a function of how quickly salt build up is likely to occur as well as crop sensitivity to salinity leaching may be desirable when the irrigation water has high salinity as leaching will help move salts out of the root zone if the water is of good quality and fertigation results in little salt build up in the root zone then the leaching rate can be minimized lieth and oki 2008 growers may adjust the duration of irrigation events with the optimal duration dependent on the volume of water that needs to be supplied to restore the substrate water holding capacity starting from a specific water content plus the amount of leaching that is needed measuring salinity and water status of substrates is essential to determine appropriate leaching amounts in conventional irrigation approaches the leaching fraction should range from 0 to 20 under well controlled conditions in rare instances higher leaching fractions are targeted i e when saline irrigation water is used lieth and oki 2008 however it is common in substrate systems to apply 30 50 more water than that used by the crop kläring 2001 and often growers do not have a clear and precise record of the leachate amounts the availability of new sensors that combine the measurements of substrate water content and ec offers new possibilities for management of irrigation and leaching especially when saline water is used for soilless cultivation incrocci et al 2010 those sensors have been successfully integrated in the automatic irrigation system designed for the present study resulting in precise control of leaching using gick growers could monitor ecp and increase the leaching rate when ecp exceeds crop specific thresholds photosynthetic parameters and spad did not differ among treatments table 1 this is consistent with our findings in experiment 1 which showed that photosynthesis of basil plants can recover fully after exposure to vwc as low as 0 20 m3 m 3 with similar leaching rates plants irrigated at 0 20 0 30 or 0 40 m3 m 3 set points had similar fresh weight table 1 based on the hydraulic properties of the substrate fig 4a water is readily available to plants at vwc 0 30 m3 m 3 pf 2 the absence of an effect on yield between plants irrigated at 0 30 and 0 40 m3 m 3 seems to confirm this on the other hand exposing plants repeatedly although briefly to a vwc of 0 20 m3 m 3 did not significantly reduce growth fresh weight tended to be highest when a higher leaching rate was used vwc 0 3hl table 1 probably because leaching lowered ecp during the final part of the growing cycle and may thus have reduced salinity stress fig 6b similar to fresh weight water use was similar in the three treatments with low leaching fraction as expected water use was higher with more leaching vwc 0 3hl but because fresh weight was greatest in this treatment wue was similar in all treatments 21 g fresh weight per liter table 1 at the crop level wue indicates how efficiently applied water is used to produce yield and optimal irrigation scheduling has been recognized as a major factor affecting wue however due to the high economic value and productivity per unit of applied water compared to other crops commercial vegetable growers tend to over irrigate with a consequent reduction in wue de pascale et al 2011 sensor based on demand scheduling proved to be effective in reducing irrigation water use and as a result in improving wue in ornamental crops without risking adverse consequences from under or overwatering lea cox et al 2013 hagen et al 2014 when tested in vegetable production the use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation management resulted in improved wue de pascale et al 2011 montesano et al 2016a the color of food is one of the main quality parameters evaluated by consumers influences their choices and is critical to product acceptance since food appearance is the first impression consumers get before either accepting or rejecting food leon et al 2006 montesano et al 2016b in the present study the irrigation set points did not influence the visual quality of basil in terms of color table 1 similarly bekhradi et al 2015 found that irrigation treatments corresponding to 100 75 and 50 of the field capacity did not influence color parameters of basil genovese green and purple genotypes grown in peat substrate under greenhouse conditions 4 conclusions the sensor based irrigation system designed and constructed for the present study automated irrigation successfully and was suitable for assessing the physiological responses of plants to different water availability levels in the growing substrate thus our results indicate that the use of a wireless sensor network for real time sensing of substrate water status is an effective tool for precision irrigation management of basil in greenhouse soilless conditions the findings of the present study revealed that drought symptoms appeared in basil at a moisture level well below the commonly accepted matric potential based limit for the easy available water in soilless substrates confirming that more work is needed to identify the practical effects of irrigation set points on crop performance this approach to irrigation may be adapted to other species if combined with precise information on the effects of water availability levels on those species founding source this work

11464,chestnut orchards are facing new limitations due to scarce of soil water during summer times mainly attributed to the low precipitation amount typically occurred on such period the present study aims to define a methodology to improve in a smart way the utilization of water on chestnut irrigation based on leaf gas exchanges parameters there is done a transposition for the soil water content and matric potential to allow an optimization of the irrigation scheduling in chestnut trees trial was installed in a loamy soil at the northeast of portugal between 2013 and 2016 with micro sprinkler and drip irrigation system stem water potential photosynthetic rate soil water content and soil water potential were monitored during the vegetative cycle june october the stem water potential was dependent on air s temperature and soil moisture the higher photosynthetic rate 9 11 μmolco2 m 2 s 1 was reached when midday stem water potential ranged between 1 2 to 0 5 mpa and the regression between stem water potential and soil water content on the top 10 40 cm of soil was of r2 0 38 according to these it was admissible to trigger irrigation when the probe registers 16 and watering must keep soil s moisture near 23 the regression between stem and soil water potential was of r2 0 43 and irrigation scheduling may be triggered when watermark sensor at 30 60 cm soil depth is above 100 cbar to promote good tree water status although this last is air temperature dependent keywords castanea sativa m water management soil moisture physiology 1 introduction portugal had 35 595 ha of chestnut trees with a total production of 27 628 tons in 2015 ine 2015 the chestnut tree is mainly found in rainfed conditions but the irrigated area is growing from the new 835 ha planted within 2007 2013 about 23 are in irrigation conditions proder 2014 irrigation increases chestnut productivity and fruit size breisch 1995 but so far only martins et al 2010 2011 studied the effect of irrigation in chestnut trees under different soil s management and soil plant relationship was approached additionally only a field study made in france and developed by jayne 2005 can be consulted although it did not approach the soil plant relationship the soil water plant relationship is deeply dependent on plant s physiology and morphology as well as on soil s features clothier and green 1994 meinzer et al 2004 it is difficult to establish a clear and straight relationship between soil and plant water status since climatic conditions also intervenes kenneth et al 1997 naor 2006 sanjit et al 2012 but preferably all the factors must be consider for a correct water management in the absence of models that integrate all the factors in practice irrigation can be programmed based in one factor alone or in two the midday stem water potential ψwmd has been indicated as the most sensitive and reasonable in the detection of water status of perennial crops such as the prune tree mccutchan and shackel 1992 shackel et al 2000a shackel et al 2000b lampinen et al 2004 pecan tree sanjit et al 2012 and walnut tree fulton et al 2002 similar conclusions were found in vineyards williams and araújo 2002 olive trees gómez del campo 2013 or peach trees mirás avaloz et al 2016 however ψwmd is relatively new in terms of on farm adoption and has the disadvantage of not being an automatic method leading that fruit growers are more accustomed to guide their irrigation decisions by adopting a water budget method using climate based estimates of crop evapotranspiration or methods of soil moisture monitoring girona et al 2002 the understanding of a correlation between ψwmd and soil water content overcomes this disadvantage because soil moisture can be monitored by probes in an automatic and continuous way munoz carpena 2015 additionally the ψwmd indicates when irrigation should start but it does not indicate how long the irrigation should last something that can be overcome by placing soil water sensors to record when the effective root depth is wet gómez del campo 2013 in which concern the soil moisture based optimized irrigation it consists of keeping the soil within a target moisture range by replenishing the plant water uptake with irrigation this practice reduces the potential for soil water excess and leaching of agrochemicals present in the soil however it requires selection of a suitable method for soil moisture estimation munoz carpena 2015 the soil moisture can be approached by indirect methods such as volumetric or by tensiometric methods and the decision for one or another depends on the cost accuracy response time installation management and durability munoz carpena 2015 the first method measures the amount of water in the soil either by weight or volume and the second measures the potential energy status of a small parcel of water in the soil we define smart irrigation as the one that is based on controllers that reduce outdoor water use by monitoring and using information about site conditions soil and climatic features ideally this controller should also access plant s physiological parameters to better meet the plant water needs but so far technology is not there yet however and in a tentative to get close to this smart irrigation in a crop that usually is rainfed this study aims to define reference soil water values both by using volumetric or tensiometric methods departing from plants water status and photosynthetic productivity for proper irrigation on chestnut trees 2 material and methods several steps were followed to achieve the purpose of the study first the photosynthetic rate was used to infer which plant s water potential reflects the most adequate water status later a regression between ψwmd and soil water content soil water potential was established to define the soil values from where it can be decide the irrigation the data used in this regression was gathered during three years 2013 2015 and 2016 from watered and non watered trees located in two different experimental plot described forwards more details can be consulted in mota et al 2014 and mota et al 2018 2 1 orchard characterization the experiment was conducted during 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 in the northeast of portugal 862 m altitude on a commercial orchard planted in 1993 with compass 5 by 10 m the rootstocks were seedlings from castanea sativa m grafted with judia variety the soil is kept with seeded pasture since plantation the soils are cambisols with 100 cm of thickness and c horizon shows many coarse gravel and cobbles soils are loam and on the toppest 10 60 cm the organic matter is about 3 and has 26 and 115 mg kg 1 of extractable p2o5 and k2o egnér rihem method respectively and ph h2o of 4 7 the moisture contents at field capacity fc and wilting point wp were determined with a pressure plate apparatus at 10 kpa pf value 2 and 1500 kpa pf value 4 2 respectively table 1 in this method undisturbed soil sample is placed on a porous ceramic plate in a chamber and saturated with water a pressure of 10 or 1500 kpa is applied until equilibrium in water content between the plate and the soil sample is reached at which time soil water content is determined klute 1986 2 2 experimental plots in the following plots border trees were kept around the study area and between each tree sample in 2013 14 a micro sprinkler irrigation system was installed in twenty four trees and irrigation started at august 28th in 2013 when stem water potential measured at 09 00 h gmt fell below 0 6 mpa full irrigated treatment fi or 0 8 mpa deficit irrigated treatment di in each irrigation event the water furnished was about 30 mm as far as our knowledge there are no studies about the stem water potential of the chestnut trees so the definition of this threshold took into consideration martins et al 2010 and brown et al 2014 that refer an hydric comfort level when the predawn water potential is within 0 4 and 0 6 mpa and thus we admitted a slight decreased of these values at 9am twelve non irrigated trees ni were kept for control five sample trees per treatment were selected fig 1 left each sprinkler had a debit of 40 l h placed 1 5 m away from the trunk and wetting an area of 13 m2 the mean total amount of water w furnished during the vegetative cycle in 2013 was of 1040 m3 ha 1490 m3 ha and 590 m3 ha for fi and di respectively 2014 was a very humid year and no irrigation was done since the tree water potential did not always reach the values to initiate the irrigation and when it did irrigation was not initiated since the weather forecast indicated rain for the following days as it happened in 2015 16 two types of irrigation systems were installed under the purpose of other study which aimed an economical comparison mota et al 2018 each one in forty trees as follow ti drip irrigation two pipes per tree row emitters spaced 1 m with debit of 3 6 l h si sprinkler irrigation one suspended

7 9 and 10 6 mm respectively moreover the tmed during the summer july august and september of 2014 was lower 19 c and the hr was higher 63 than the other years and thus the stem water potential rarely reached the threshold for watering and when it did reach the irrigation was not initiated due to climatic forecast of rain on the following days so no irrigation was done in 2014 and the data was not included the total annual precipitation in 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 was of 823 747 593 and 971 mm respectively and are near the ones mentioned by breisch 1995 for good growth of c sativa 800 900 mm year but the water deficit was very low from march to september especially in july and august this fact reflects the importance of the soil for storing water during the winter to further ahead meet the water requirements of the tree during the vegetative period actually it is well known the behavior of the higher plants to absorb water from deeper layers and distribute it all over the plant to overcome the water constraints during the summer garnier et al 1986 david et al 2013 nadezhdina et al 2008 martins et al 2010 still irrigation helped the plants to overcome the water constraints during the summer as it can be seen by the higher stem water potential in the irrigated trees comparing with the none irrigated trees along the months fig 3 during the irrigated period july august and september the mean ψwmd was 1 13 0 07 mpa and 1 32 0 12 mpa for irrigated and non irrigated treatment respectively for the same period the mean soil water content θavg on the top 10 40 cm was 14 7 and on the soil layers at 50 80 cm depth it was 16 3 and both were within the readily available water on this soil which is the fraction of total available water that a crop can extract from the root zone without suffering water stress being the total available water calculated as the difference between fc and wp for a certain root depth oliveira 2003 on the other hand in none irrigated trees the θavg on the top 10 40 cm was 12 0 and in the soil layers between 50 and 80 cm depth the θavg was 14 4 both values very close or even below to the wilting point for these soil layers determined in the laboratory table 1 therefore it is admissible that irrigated plants were in minimal soil water comfort due to the irrigation events the high values of net photosynthesis found in our study strengthen this affirmation however it is noteworthy that air s temperature also plays an important role in the stem water potential especially evident in august and september for instance comparing 2013 with 2016 in the irrigated treatments fig 3 up the θavg at 10 40 cm soil depth was lower in the first year and the θavg at 50 80 cm was similar between the years however the ψwmd was clearly lower in 2016 where tmax was 34 and 31 c august and september respectively while in 2013 where tmax was 29 and 26 c showed higher ψwmd same findings are reported in mota et al 2017 for chestnut trees that refers some influence of the vapor deficit pressure on the stem water potential in other fruit trees like in prune tree a strong relationship between vapor deficit pressure and stem water potential is reported by mccutchan and shackel 1992 according to gomes laranjo et al 2007 the optimal growth temperature for the european chestnut tree is 24 c when the maximal photosynthetic rate a 100 is achieved which for the portuguese varieties the mean value is about 10 μmolco2 m 2 s 1 from our results the a md tendentiously decreases with the ψwmd according to the regression found y 3 9708 2 5 922x 8 3508 r2 0 35 being the a 100 11 μmolco2 m 2 s 1 reached when ψwmd ranged between 0 5 to 0 8 mpa fig 4 admitting breaks of 10 in the maximal photosynthetic rate a 90 the ψwmd would be around 1 2 mpa this is coherent with gomes laranjo et al 2007 and gomes laranjo and coutinho 2008 which found that the a 90 is reached when leaf water potential is of 1 6 mpa which somehow equates a stem water potential close to 1 2 mpa the leaf water potential is lower than the stem water potential because it is measured on a transpiring leaf and a strong correlation between the stem and leaf water potential was found by other authors in vineyards and pecan trees williams and araújo 2002 sanjit et al 2012 according to lampinen et al 2015 by keeping the ψwmd about 0 1 0 2 mpa below the fully watered baseline which is 1 mpa for almonds and prunes it can be assured that trees do not get into deficit conditions and that there is no over irrigation therefore for the chestnut tree it is admissible to infer that ψwmd 1 2 mpa is a balanced value to get a good photosynthetic productivity and assures a comfortable water status at midday still more studies are needed to support this affirmation especially because it can differ depending on the soil type and it hydraulic conductivity and texture plant age chestnut variety and phenological stage for instance some studies in olive trees moriana et al 2012 or in vineyards girona et al 2006 indicate the possibility to change the stem or leaf water potential thresholds for irrigation along the vegetative cycle however and for the purpose of the present study a relation between ψwmd and θavg on the 10 40 cm and on the 50 80 cm soil depth was plotted to further define which soil water content mostly guarantees the ψwmd close to 1 2 mpa the correlation found in this study was higher between ψwmd and θavg at 10 40 cm r2 0 38 than with θavg at 50 80 cm r2 0 31 fig 5 these values are close although lower to some values found in the literature gómez del campo 2013 found a logarithmic function between relative extractable water and ψwmd with r2 0 77 for an olive orchard by its turn williams and araújo 2002 found a linear regression between θ and ψwmd with a correlation of r2 0 63 in vineyards also sanjit et al 2012 in pecan trees found a linear regression between θavg and ψwmd with r2 0 73 and r2 0 80 in sandy and clay soils respectively in high trees a straight relationship between soil water content and water potential is not easy to obtain due to the great and irregular root volume and the difficulty to cover it with soil sensors gómez del campo 2013 besides the influence of external factors such as the climatic conditions this is especially true in adult trees that were in rainfed conditions during almost twenty years as the ones in our study which may explained the lower correlation between stem water potential and soil water content and most probably deeper roots than the 80 cm also influence the whole tree water status but sensors at that soil depth are not practical to install still from our results we may now to infer that the irrigation scheduling based on soil capacitance probes in loam soils as the one in the experiment can take as reference the moisture on the top soil layers and it should be such that irrigation starts when θavg 10 40 cm is close to 16 and must be kept near 23 to guarantee good levels of water potential and photosynthesis in the chestnut trees if the producer chooses to irrigate based on ψwmsoil it is essential to know the soil type because depending on it and its water s retention capacity for the same ψwsoil the soil water content differs and it is important to know the soil curves brady 1990 oliveira 2003 munoz carpena 2015 in our study a polynomial regression ψwmd 1e 05 ψw soil 2 0 006 ψwmsoil 0 753 was found between the ψwmd of irrigated trees and ψwmsoil on the average 30 cm to 60 cm soil depth with a correlation of r2 0 43 fig 6 therefore we consider that the best commitment for irrigation schedule in loam soils as the one in the experiment with adult trees is to keep values near 100 cbar on the firsts 30 60 cm of soil depth to assure an adequate ψwmd depending on air s temperature these values are coherent with soil curves for different soil types lopes et al 2003 but is important to retain that the watermark sensors measures the degree of water retention in the soil lopes et al 2003 and its interpretation must be well understood by the irrigation manager additionally in very clay soils and in crops tolerant to dry these sensors may not be the ideal ones since they are limited to reading up to 250 cbar additionally the general stabilization of the ψwmd even with the lowest values of ψwm soil could indicate that deeper roots than the ones analyzed contributed for the stabilizing of the ψwmd surprisingly the correlation found between the watermark sensor at 80 cm and the ψwmd was very weak data not shown as well as it was lower between ψwmd and θavg at 50 80 cm soil depth fig 5 for one hand it can be admissible that roots deeper than the 80 cm layer may have influenced the stabilization of the tree water potential since trees have twenty years and surely a very deep volume for another hand this behavior on the stabilization of the ψwmd can also reflect an anisohydric response of the chestnut tree when facing soil drying and subsequent water stress plants that display anisohydric characteristics do maintain control over leaf water potential but at a diminished rate when compared to isohydric plants that are constantly regulating their leaf water potential due to hydraulic and chemical signals limpus 2009 as soil water potential declines so too will the leaf water potential until it reaches threshold at which point stomata will begin to regulate water loss jones 2007 however it is not easy to categorize a plant as completely isohydric or anisohydric since the same species can actually integrate both responses as referred by moriana et al 2012 for olive trees further work is needed to give more robustness to the physiological and soil values found in this study especially in different soil types and water regimes nevertheless the findings of our work are valuable to encourage the smart irrigation on the chestnut tree which has currently facing a more intensive vision on its cropping 4 conclusions the adult chestnut tree benefits with irrigation since the stem water potential at midday are higher comparing with the non irrigated trees as well as the photosynthetic rate the irrigation can be programmed based on different soil moisture sensors as soon as the irrigation manager is aware of their limitations especially to what concern to the non straight relationship between soil water status and plant water status the procedure to obtain the soil water values of reference starting from their relationship with plant parameters such as photosynthetic rate or plant water potential is not simple to achieved due to the intervention of other factors such as the climatic features deep soil roots and internal physiological regulation that are not easy to approach and that surely play an important role in the plants behavior deeper studies that consider all the biotic and abiotic factors that interfere in the chestnut tree should be developed to be the basis of a proper smart irrigation acknowledgements we thank to helena ferreira and cesaltina carvalho for helping on field work this work was supported by fct fundação para a ciência e tecnologia

11464,chestnut orchards are facing new limitations due to scarce of soil water during summer times mainly attributed to the low precipitation amount typically occurred on such period the present study aims to define a methodology to improve in a smart way the utilization of water on chestnut irrigation based on leaf gas exchanges parameters there is done a transposition for the soil water content and matric potential to allow an optimization of the irrigation scheduling in chestnut trees trial was installed in a loamy soil at the northeast of portugal between 2013 and 2016 with micro sprinkler and drip irrigation system stem water potential photosynthetic rate soil water content and soil water potential were monitored during the vegetative cycle june october the stem water potential was dependent on air s temperature and soil moisture the higher photosynthetic rate 9 11 μmolco2 m 2 s 1 was reached when midday stem water potential ranged between 1 2 to 0 5 mpa and the regression between stem water potential and soil water content on the top 10 40 cm of soil was of r2 0 38 according to these it was admissible to trigger irrigation when the probe registers 16 and watering must keep soil s moisture near 23 the regression between stem and soil water potential was of r2 0 43 and irrigation scheduling may be triggered when watermark sensor at 30 60 cm soil depth is above 100 cbar to promote good tree water status although this last is air temperature dependent keywords castanea sativa m water management soil moisture physiology 1 introduction portugal had 35 595 ha of chestnut trees with a total production of 27 628 tons in 2015 ine 2015 the chestnut tree is mainly found in rainfed conditions but the irrigated area is growing from the new 835 ha planted within 2007 2013 about 23 are in irrigation conditions proder 2014 irrigation increases chestnut productivity and fruit size breisch 1995 but so far only martins et al 2010 2011 studied the effect of irrigation in chestnut trees under different soil s management and soil plant relationship was approached additionally only a field study made in france and developed by jayne 2005 can be consulted although it did not approach the soil plant relationship the soil water plant relationship is deeply dependent on plant s physiology and morphology as well as on soil s features clothier and green 1994 meinzer et al 2004 it is difficult to establish a clear and straight relationship between soil and plant water status since climatic conditions also intervenes kenneth et al 1997 naor 2006 sanjit et al 2012 but preferably all the factors must be consider for a correct water management in the absence of models that integrate all the factors in practice irrigation can be programmed based in one factor alone or in two the midday stem water potential ψwmd has been indicated as the most sensitive and reasonable in the detection of water status of perennial crops such as the prune tree mccutchan and shackel 1992 shackel et al 2000a shackel et al 2000b lampinen et al 2004 pecan tree sanjit et al 2012 and walnut tree fulton et al 2002 similar conclusions were found in vineyards williams and araújo 2002 olive trees gómez del campo 2013 or peach trees mirás avaloz et al 2016 however ψwmd is relatively new in terms of on farm adoption and has the disadvantage of not being an automatic method leading that fruit growers are more accustomed to guide their irrigation decisions by adopting a water budget method using climate based estimates of crop evapotranspiration or methods of soil moisture monitoring girona et al 2002 the understanding of a correlation between ψwmd and soil water content overcomes this disadvantage because soil moisture can be monitored by probes in an automatic and continuous way munoz carpena 2015 additionally the ψwmd indicates when irrigation should start but it does not indicate how long the irrigation should last something that can be overcome by placing soil water sensors to record when the effective root depth is wet gómez del campo 2013 in which concern the soil moisture based optimized irrigation it consists of keeping the soil within a target moisture range by replenishing the plant water uptake with irrigation this practice reduces the potential for soil water excess and leaching of agrochemicals present in the soil however it requires selection of a suitable method for soil moisture estimation munoz carpena 2015 the soil moisture can be approached by indirect methods such as volumetric or by tensiometric methods and the decision for one or another depends on the cost accuracy response time installation management and durability munoz carpena 2015 the first method measures the amount of water in the soil either by weight or volume and the second measures the potential energy status of a small parcel of water in the soil we define smart irrigation as the one that is based on controllers that reduce outdoor water use by monitoring and using information about site conditions soil and climatic features ideally this controller should also access plant s physiological parameters to better meet the plant water needs but so far technology is not there yet however and in a tentative to get close to this smart irrigation in a crop that usually is rainfed this study aims to define reference soil water values both by using volumetric or tensiometric methods departing from plants water status and photosynthetic productivity for proper irrigation on chestnut trees 2 material and methods several steps were followed to achieve the purpose of the study first the photosynthetic rate was used to infer which plant s water potential reflects the most adequate water status later a regression between ψwmd and soil water content soil water potential was established to define the soil values from where it can be decide the irrigation the data used in this regression was gathered during three years 2013 2015 and 2016 from watered and non watered trees located in two different experimental plot described forwards more details can be consulted in mota et al 2014 and mota et al 2018 2 1 orchard characterization the experiment was conducted during 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 in the northeast of portugal 862 m altitude on a commercial orchard planted in 1993 with compass 5 by 10 m the rootstocks were seedlings from castanea sativa m grafted with judia variety the soil is kept with seeded pasture since plantation the soils are cambisols with 100 cm of thickness and c horizon shows many coarse gravel and cobbles soils are loam and on the toppest 10 60 cm the organic matter is about 3 and has 26 and 115 mg kg 1 of extractable p2o5 and k2o egnér rihem method respectively and ph h2o of 4 7 the moisture contents at field capacity fc and wilting point wp were determined with a pressure plate apparatus at 10 kpa pf value 2 and 1500 kpa pf value 4 2 respectively table 1 in this method undisturbed soil sample is placed on a porous ceramic plate in a chamber and saturated with water a pressure of 10 or 1500 kpa is applied until equilibrium in water content between the plate and the soil sample is reached at which time soil water content is determined klute 1986 2 2 experimental plots in the following plots border trees were kept around the study area and between each tree sample in 2013 14 a micro sprinkler irrigation system was installed in twenty four trees and irrigation started at august 28th in 2013 when stem water potential measured at 09 00 h gmt fell below 0 6 mpa full irrigated treatment fi or 0 8 mpa deficit irrigated treatment di in each irrigation event the water furnished was about 30 mm as far as our knowledge there are no studies about the stem water potential of the chestnut trees so the definition of this threshold took into consideration martins et al 2010 and brown et al 2014 that refer an hydric comfort level when the predawn water potential is within 0 4 and 0 6 mpa and thus we admitted a slight decreased of these values at 9am twelve non irrigated trees ni were kept for control five sample trees per treatment were selected fig 1 left each sprinkler had a debit of 40 l h placed 1 5 m away from the trunk and wetting an area of 13 m2 the mean total amount of water w furnished during the vegetative cycle in 2013 was of 1040 m3 ha 1490 m3 ha and 590 m3 ha for fi and di respectively 2014 was a very humid year and no irrigation was done since the tree water potential did not always reach the values to initiate the irrigation and when it did irrigation was not initiated since the weather forecast indicated rain for the following days as it happened in 2015 16 two types of irrigation systems were installed under the purpose of other study which aimed an economical comparison mota et al 2018 each one in forty trees as follow ti drip irrigation two pipes per tree row emitters spaced 1 m with debit of 3 6 l h si sprinkler irrigation one suspended

watered baseline which is 1 mpa for almonds and prunes it can be assured that trees do not get into deficit conditions and that there is no over irrigation therefore for the chestnut tree it is admissible to infer that ψwmd 1 2 mpa is a balanced value to get a good photosynthetic productivity and assures a comfortable water status at midday still more studies are needed to support this affirmation especially because it can differ depending on the soil type and it hydraulic conductivity and texture plant age chestnut variety and phenological stage for instance some studies in olive trees moriana et al 2012 or in vineyards girona et al 2006 indicate the possibility to change the stem or leaf water potential thresholds for irrigation along the vegetative cycle however and for the purpose of the present study a relation between ψwmd and θavg on the 10 40 cm and on the 50 80 cm soil depth was plotted to further define which soil water content mostly guarantees the ψwmd close to 1 2 mpa the correlation found in this study was higher between ψwmd and θavg at 10 40 cm r2 0 38 than with θavg at 50 80 cm r2 0 31 fig 5 these values are close although lower to some values found in the literature gómez del campo 2013 found a logarithmic function between relative extractable water and ψwmd with r2 0 77 for an olive orchard by its turn williams and araújo 2002 found a linear regression between θ and ψwmd with a correlation of r2 0 63 in vineyards also sanjit et al 2012 in pecan trees found a linear regression between θavg and ψwmd with r2 0 73 and r2 0 80 in sandy and clay soils respectively in high trees a straight relationship between soil water content and water potential is not easy to obtain due to the great and irregular root volume and the difficulty to cover it with soil sensors gómez del campo 2013 besides the influence of external factors such as the climatic conditions this is especially true in adult trees that were in rainfed conditions during almost twenty years as the ones in our study which may explained the lower correlation between stem water potential and soil water content and most probably deeper roots than the 80 cm also influence the whole tree water status but sensors at that soil depth are not practical to install still from our results we may now to infer that the irrigation scheduling based on soil capacitance probes in loam soils as the one in the experiment can take as reference the moisture on the top soil layers and it should be such that irrigation starts when θavg 10 40 cm is close to 16 and must be kept near 23 to guarantee good levels of water potential and photosynthesis in the chestnut trees if the producer chooses to irrigate based on ψwmsoil it is essential to know the soil type because depending on it and its water s retention capacity for the same ψwsoil the soil water content differs and it is important to know the soil curves brady 1990 oliveira 2003 munoz carpena 2015 in our study a polynomial regression ψwmd 1e 05 ψw soil 2 0 006 ψwmsoil 0 753 was found between the ψwmd of irrigated trees and ψwmsoil on the average 30 cm to 60 cm soil depth with a correlation of r2 0 43 fig 6 therefore we consider that the best commitment for irrigation schedule in loam soils as the one in the experiment with adult trees is to keep values near 100 cbar on the firsts 30 60 cm of soil depth to assure an adequate ψwmd depending on air s temperature these values are coherent with soil curves for different soil types lopes et al 2003 but is important to retain that the watermark sensors measures the degree of water retention in the soil lopes et al 2003 and its interpretation must be well understood by the irrigation manager additionally in very clay soils and in crops tolerant to dry these sensors may not be the ideal ones since they are limited to reading up to 250 cbar additionally the general stabilization of the ψwmd even with the lowest values of ψwm soil could indicate that deeper roots than the ones analyzed contributed for the stabilizing of the ψwmd surprisingly the correlation found between the watermark sensor at 80 cm and the ψwmd was very weak data not shown as well as it was lower between ψwmd and θavg at 50 80 cm soil depth fig 5 for one hand it can be admissible that roots deeper than the 80 cm layer may have influenced the stabilization of the tree water potential since trees have twenty years and surely a very deep volume for another hand this behavior on the stabilization of the ψwmd can also reflect an anisohydric response of the chestnut tree when facing soil drying and subsequent water stress plants that display anisohydric characteristics do maintain control over leaf water potential but at a diminished rate when compared to isohydric plants that are constantly regulating their leaf water potential due to hydraulic and chemical signals limpus 2009 as soil water potential declines so too will the leaf water potential until it reaches threshold at which point stomata will begin to regulate water loss jones 2007 however it is not easy to categorize a plant as completely isohydric or anisohydric since the same species can actually integrate both responses as referred by moriana et al 2012 for olive trees further work is needed to give more robustness to the physiological and soil values found in this study especially in different soil types and water regimes nevertheless the findings of our work are valuable to encourage the smart irrigation on the chestnut tree which has currently facing a more intensive vision on its cropping 4 conclusions the adult chestnut tree benefits with irrigation since the stem water potential at midday are higher comparing with the non irrigated trees as well as the photosynthetic rate the irrigation can be programmed based on different soil moisture sensors as soon as the irrigation manager is aware of their limitations especially to what concern to the non straight relationship between soil water status and plant water status the procedure to obtain the soil water values of reference starting from their relationship with plant parameters such as photosynthetic rate or plant water potential is not simple to achieved due to the intervention of other factors such as the climatic features deep soil roots and internal physiological regulation that are not easy to approach and that surely play an important role in the plants behavior deeper studies that consider all the biotic and abiotic factors that interfere in the chestnut tree should be developed to be the basis of a proper smart irrigation acknowledgements we thank to helena ferreira and cesaltina carvalho for helping on field work this work was supported by fct fundação para a ciência e tecnologia
