14645,as an important freshwater resource in the qinghai tibet plateau glacial lakes are being immensely affected by global warming due to the lack of long term monitoring data the processes and driving mechanisms of the water ecology of these glacial lakes in a rapidly changing climate are poorly understood this study for the first time reconstructed changes in water temperature and photosynthetic microbial communities over the past 200 years in lake basomtso a glacial lake on the southeastern tibetan plateau temperatures were reconstructed using a paleotemperature proxy based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers brgdgts the cell membrane lipids of some bacteria and photosynthetic microbial communities were determined by high throughput dna sequencing the reconstructed mean annual air temperature maat at lake basomtso varied between 6 9 and 8 3 c over the past 200 years with a rapid warming rate of 0 25 c 10 yrs after 1950s carbon isotope of sediment and n alkane analyses indicate that 95 of the organic matter in lake basomtso is derived from a mixture of terrestrial c3 plants and endogenous organic matter inputs and the proportion of endogenous organic matter in the sediments has gradually increased since the 1960s the sedimentary dna analyses of the sediment core reveal that chloracea is the most dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microbial group 84 5 over the past 200 years however the relative abundance of cyanobacteria has increased from 6 8 before the 1960s to 15 5 nowadays suggesting that warmer temperatures favor the growth of cyanobacteria in glacial lakes among eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms the chlorophyceae have been gradually replaced by dinoflagellata and diatomacae since the 1980s although the chlorophyceae still had the highest average relative abundance overall 30 40 the pb isotopic composition together with the total phosphorous concentration implies that human activity exerted a minimal impact on lake basomtso over the past 200 yrs however the synchronous fluctuations of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and metal elements in sediments suggest that temperature appears to have a strong influence on nutrient input to lake basomtso by controlling glacial erosion global warming and the concurrent increase in glacial meltwater are two main factors driving changes in nutrient inputs from terrestrial sources which in turn increases the lake productivity and changes microbial community composition our findings demonstrate the sensitive response of glacial lake ecology to global warming it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and research of glacial lake ecology on the tibetan plateau so as to more scientifically and accurately understand the response process and mechanism of the glacial lake ecosystem under global warming graphical abstrcat image graphical abstract keywords glacial lakes global warming gdgts seddna tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau is famously entitled the third pole of the world and the water tower of asia immerzeel et al 2010 with a mean altitude of over 4000 m above the sea level and an overall area of about 2 5 106 km2 many important rivers fed by the glacier meltwater such as the yangtze river yellow river lancang river and nu river all originate from the tibetan plateau huo et al 2022a the glaciers on the tibetan plateau are estimated to cover an area of about 1 105 km2 and the tibetan plateau has more than 1065 lakes with an area 1 km2 among which more than 1 3 are glacial lakes yao et al 2012 tao et al 2020 glacial lakes are an important part of the freshwater resources of the tibetan plateau that play a crucial role in fueling the water system of the tibetan plateau over the last few decades the global surface has experienced significant warming with the warming rate of the tibetan plateau at 0 44 c 10 yr between 1980 and 2012 which is 2 75 folds with respect to the global average 0 16 c 10 yr xu et al 2009 lin et al 2017 huo et al 2022a climate warming can cause changes in various hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycles of the water system on the tibetan plateau which will likely adversely impact its ecological structure function and resilience mclauchlan et al 2013 o beirne et al 2017 multiple lines of evidence suggest that rapid warming is causing significant glacier recession on the tibetan plateau with the loss of glacier stocks in the asian highlands accounting for 19 of the total annual global loss of glacier stocks 267 16 giga ton gt from 2000 to 2019 this has caused a significant decline in terrestrial water resource reserves in the asian highlands hugonnet et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2023b and lake area increased from 38 596 km2 to 46 831 km2 tao et al 2020 tang et al 2023 the glacial recharge to lakes on the tibetan plateau increased by 127 14 3 gt between 1976 and 2019 which is much higher than that 42 6 4 9 gt of non glacial lake water zhang et al 2021b the water quality of the tibetan plateau lake systems is currently acceptable and ecological changes due to climate warming do not appear to have crossed the ecological threshold thus far wischnewski et al 2011 liu et al 2021 however field surveys of several lakes on the tibetan plateau have shown that climate change has caused significant impacts on lake biomes and ecosystems on the tibetan plateau through changing water salinity and temperature resulting in variations of primary productivity and algal communities lin et al 2017 jia et al 2022 the water environment of glacial lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is vital for the livelihoods of local people and to the security of water resources in asia while previous studies on the physical characteristics and water quality changes of lakes on the qtp have provided useful information a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of the water environment and ecology in glacial lakes is a prerequisite for developing strategies for water resource protection however there is a paucity of studies on the long term evolution of water quality and ecology in glacial lakes on the qtp over the past century glacial lakes are one of the most sensitive while fragile areas to climate change with less resilience williamson et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 for these unique attributes glacial lake sediments are a good archive for documenting changes in water ecology and environment which can be further used to reconstruct the long term evolution of the lake water environment on the qtp the lipid biomarker and sedimentary dna seddna analyses in lake sediment cores have made it possible to reconstruct the long term microbial community changes in lakes keck et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2023a for example the evolution of the cyanobacterial community in taihu lake reconstructed by seddna revealed that increasing temperature and decreasing wind speed accounted for a gradual dominance of cyanobacteria in lake taihu zhang et al 2023b multiple lipid biomarkers have been used to reconstruct changes in aquatic ecosystems hydrology and methane cycling in lake wudalianchi from changbai mountain china before and after a regional volcanic eruption yao et al 2022 these new methods combined with the analyses of geochemical indicators such as nutrient elements and their isotopic compositions can provide novel insights into the environmental changes and community evolution of aquatic ecosystems herein we employed lipid biomarkers and high throughput dna sequencing techniques to examine the evolution of the photosynthetic microbial community in a sediment core from lake basomtso a glacial lake on the southeastern tibetan plateau temperature changes over the last 200 years were reconstructed using bacterial membrane lipids branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers brgdgts correspondingly the input of exogenous organic matter and elements to lake sediments during this period were assessed using organic geochemical proxies and pb isotopic compositions our findings provide strong data support to build a theoretical foundation for the development of strategies for water protection in glacial lakes on the qtp 2 material and method 2 1 sampling the lake basomtso 30 0 1 30 2 53 n 93 53 37 94 1 48 e 3500 m above the sea level is a glacial dammed freshwater lake located in the southeast of the tibetan plateau at the confluence of the nyingchi tanggula and the himalayas the lake has an area of about 26 km2 and a maximum depth of about 120 m with a salinity of 0 12 g l and water ph of 7 2 li et al 2017 its main source of recharge is via rainfall and glacier meltwater li et al 2016 lake basomtso exhibits stratification characteristics during winter and summer the low temperature together with the hypoxic condition caused by water stratification are favorable to the long term preservation of organic matter and dna within the sediments two parallel sediment cores of 44 cm and 52 cm in length respectively with a clear sediment water interface were collected by a gravity corer from the center of the lake at a depth of 100 m fig 1 30 0 59 n 93 55

was corrected for the self absorption effect of low energy γ rays within the samples the absolute ages of the sediment core were calculated using a constant flow and constant sedimentation rate cfcs model appleby and oldfield 1978 given that the porosity of the sediment core decreases with depth the cumulative mass depth m g cm 2 was used instead of depth cm when calculating the sediment accumulation rates the cumulative mass depth m a at depth a can be calculated using the formula 1 1 m a 0 a ρ z d z where ρ z is the dry bulk density of the sediment at depth z chen et al 2019 2 3

paleotemperature reconstruction in lakes tierney et al 2010 brgdgts are named with roman numerals i ii and iii which correspond to 4 5 and 6 methyl groups on the alkyl chains of brgdgts respectively the lowercase a b and c denote 0 1 and 2 cyclopentyl rings on the alkyl chains of brgdgts respectively in addition the prime symbol is used to indicate the isomers with the methyl moiety at the c6 position instead of the c5 position de jonge et al 2013 the distribution of 15 brgdgt compounds in global lake sediments was found to be closely related to mean annual air temperature maat martínez sosa et al 2021 and has been widely used to infer past temperature variation feng et al 2019 martin et al 2020 to reconstruct the paleotemperature in the sediment core of lake basomtso we first collected the instrumental mean annual air temperature maat data from 1961 to 2018 at the meteorological station in bayi town which is 2992 m above sea level and 60 1 km from lake basomtso based on the dating results of the core the distribution of brgdgts in the top sediments of the core over the period of 1961 2018 was used to develop a lake specific calibration for temperature reconstructions in lake basomtso stepwise forward selection sfs a statistical method to select the brgdgt compounds that have the most significant correlation with temperature over the period of 1961 2018 was employed and a brgdgt calibration for temperature reconstruction was obtained 2 maat 2 5 f iia 4 81 r 2 0 79 p 0 05 where f iia is the relative abundance of iia in all brgdgts temperature before the year 1961 in the sediment core was reconstructed using this calibration 2 7 vegetation type reconstruction the average carbon chain length acl and aquatic vegetation index p aq of long chain n alkanes carbon chain 21 were calculated respectively using the n alkane abundance in the sediments ficken et al 2000 poynter et al 1989 according to the formula as follows 3 acl i c i c i 4 p aq c 23 c 25 c 23 c 25 c 29 c 31 where i denotes the carbon chain length over the range from 23 to 33 and c i denotes the relative abundance of n alkanes with carbon chain length i higher acl and lower p aq values indicate more contribution of terrestrial higher plants and emergent macrophytes than submerged floating plants to the organic matter pool in the lake sediment core ficken et al 2000 2 8 assessment of heavy metal pollution degree the enrichment factor ef was used to evaluate the extent of heavy metal contamination and the ef is calculated as follows 5 ef t s r s t b r b where ts and tb represent targeted metal element concentrations in sediment samples and background respectively rs and rb represent reference element concentrations in sediment samples and background respectively the concentration data at the bottom of the sediment column core 34 cm was selected as the background and the rock forming element aluminum al was selected as the reference element 3 results and discussion 3 1 chrolonogy the 210pbex decreases logarithmically with increasing mass depth and gradually converges to background values at the bottom of the sediment core fig 2 due to the large uncertainty of 210pbex in the lower part of the sediment core only data collected from 22 cm depth were used to calculate lake sediment ages through the cfcs model appleby and oldfield 1978 zhan et al 2019 while this may lead to greater dating uncertainty in the lower part of the sediment core it does not affect the main conclusions because the variation of 210pbex and 137cs in the sediment core was primarily found in the middle and upper parts of the sediment core the cfcs model for 210pbex shows an average deposition rate of approximately 0 15 g cm2 yr in lake basomtso and the calculated age based on the cfcs model shows the age of 1966 occurs at 13 cm the maximum peak of 137cs occurs at 13 cm depth corresponding to 1963 the age discrepancy between the 137cs and cfcs model is minor 3 yrs and indicates that the dating results are reliable 3 2 temperature variation over the last 200 yrs the maat change over the last 200 years reconstructed from brgdgts in the sediment core of lake basomtso is shown in fig 3 instrumental temperature data from the weather station in bayi a town near lake basomtso shows that maat in the region increased between 1961 and 2018 and ranged from 6 5 to 9 c with an average of 7 7 c the maat reconstructed from brgdgts also shows an increasing trend during the period with temperature variations ranging from 7 2 to 8 2 c with an average of 7 7 c overall the reconstructed maat matched significantly well with the instrumental data r2 0 79 p 0 05 fig s3 indicating that the reconstructed temperature record was reliable over the past 200 years the variation of maat in lake basomtso ranged from 6 9 to 8 3 c fig 3 with an average of 7 5 c before 1930 maat at lake basomtso showed no clear trend with temperatures fluctuating between 7 2 and 8 1 c averaged at 7 4 c between 1930 and 1960 temperatures fell from 7 8 c to 6 9 c but then increased rapidly to 7 9 c subsequently the maat showed a continuously increasing trend and remaining above 8 c for almost 20 years compared to global temperature trends temperature trends at lake basomtso are more significant fig 3 especially during the post 1950 period global temperatures have increased by about 0 9 c since 1950 in contrast the temperature at lake basomtso increased by around 1 2 c which is significantly higher than the global average mainly due to the higher altitude of lake basomtso the rate of surface temperature rise is usually higher on plateaus than that at lower altitudes due to a combination of surface reflection cloud radiation surface water vapor and radiative flux changes pepin et al 2015 tang et al 2023 3 3 temporal changes in historical primary productivity toc tn and tp contents in lake basomtso sediments ranged from 0 26 to 0 83 0 026 to 0 065 and 0 063 to 0 073 respectively fig 4 before 1930 toc tn and tp contents showed no obvious change fluctuating around 0 59 0 039 and 0 069 respectively from 1930 to 1950 toc tn and tp contents dropped rapidly to 0 26 0 03 and 0 063 respectively however toc tn and tp contents quickly rebounded to 0 64 0 05 and 0 073 respectively from 1950 to 1960 after 1960 toc and tn contents continued to rise while tp content showed a downward trend in general toc and tn contents exhibit similar trends to our reconstructed temperature suggesting that temperature has a significant influence on organic matter accumulation in lake basomtso sediments figs 3 and 4 however tp content displays an opposite trend to temperature since 1960 this decline in tp content is likely attributed to the reduction in the phosphorus content of catchment soils in recent years excessive grazing and climate change have contributed to the degradation of pastures on the tibet plateau dong et al 2016 ren et al 2013 resulting in a reduction in the phosphorus content of the top soils consequently there has been a decrease in the phosphorus input into the lake through surface runoff which has resulted in a gradual decline in sediment tp contents the organic carbon isotope δ13corg acl and p aq were used to identify the source of organic matter in general photosynthetic microorganisms in the lake water and higher plants in the lake catchment are the two main sources of organic matter in the lake sediments pinckney et al 2001 c3 plants are reported to have a lower δ13corg typically ranging from 24 to 30 whereas c4 plants have a relatively higher δ13corg 10 to 16 the δ13corg value of organic matter from photosynthetic living microorganisms in the lake is close to that of the c3 plants meyers 2003 lu et al 2020 higher acl values indicate a higher organic matter input from terrestrial higher plants while lower acl values indicate an increased input of endogenous organic matter li et al 2022 p aq is an indicator of the proportion of submerged plants phytoplankton relative to terrestrial vegetation inputs lower p aq indicates inputs of terrestrial organic matter while higher p aq indicates inputs of organic matter from internal phytoplankton or submerged plants ficken et al 2000 the δ13corg acl and p aq of the lake basomtso sediments vary from 23 5 to 20 1 28 0 to 29 3 and 0 29 to 0 42 respectively together these proxies indicate that organic matter in lake basomtso is mainly derived from terrestrial c3 plants with mixed inputs like endogenous organic matter from the lake before 1930 these proxies were relatively stable but after 1930 the δ13corg of lake basomtso sediments gradually decreased while acl slightly decreased and p aq showed an increasing trend fig 4 these findings indicate that the proportion of endogenous organic matter in lake basomtso sediments gradually increased and the primary productivity within the lake continuously enhanced the rise in the primary productivity of lakes in the modern period is mainly due to the increased anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate change monchamp et al 2018 however with the rapid development of tourism in lake basomtso since the 1980s human activity is in a constant state of enhancement but overall the impact of human activity on the environment of lake basomtso is still very weak to better assess the impact of human activities on lake basomtso we analyzed the sedimentary heavy element concentrations the results showed consistency between the concentrations of heavy elements fig s1a and the historical changes in toc and tn contents both of which responded well to temperature changes the increase in temperature led to an increase in glacial meltwater and more nutrients entered the lake along with the meltwater that fuels more nutrients to the microbial community at the same time the biological communities within the lakes are more active yielding higher primary productivity of the lakes while tp content followed the same trend as temperature before 1960 it showed a decreasing trend after 1960 this indicates that the flourishing of photosynthetic microorganisms was not related to the increase in tp and human activities had no significant effect on the photosynthetic microbial community of the lake by analyzing the heavy metals in lake basomtso we found that the ef of these metals all fluctuated around 1 fig s1b suggesting that they are more likely associated with natural origin kang et al 2017 the pb isotope data further suggest the weak influence of human activities on lake basomtso as shown in fig s2 the 208pb 206pb and 206pb 207pb values range from 2 081 to 2 087 and from 1 197 to 1 204 respectively for lake basomtso sediments these isotopic values differ significantly from typical anthropogenic pb from vehicle exhaust coal combustion and metal smelting zheng et al 2004 and are also inconsistent with the atmospheric pb isotopic composition of major cities in south and east asia mukai et al 2001 in contrast the pb isotopes of the lake basomtso sediments are closer to the natural end members such as desert dust and loess ferrat et al 2012 which fall within the riverine sediment range of the tibetan plateau tan et al 2014 therefore climate warming rather than human activity is the main driver for the rise in primary productivity in basomtso lake 3 4 temporal succession of photosynthetic microbial communities high throughput sequencing of sedadna provides an effective strategy to assess long term trends in photosynthetic microbial communities a total of 1463 060 and 1548 670 prokaryotic and eukaryotic rrna gene sequences were obtained from 22 lake basomtso sediment samples containing 5698 prokaryotic and 2276 eukaryotic otus the final results include 2229 prokaryotic and 152 784 eukaryotic photosynthetic microbial reads clustered in 69 prokaryotic and 182 eukaryotic photosynthetic otus respectively the absolute abundance of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms responded better to temperature to reduce the effect of dna degradation relative abundance was used to further explore the sequence of temporal changes in the photosynthetic microbial community fig 6 the relative abundance was calculated as the proportion of a particular prokaryotic eukaryotic photosynthetic microbe to the total prokaryotic eukaryotic photosynthetic microbes to better represent the variation in different photosynthetic microbial communities as shown in fig 5 the chao index of α diversity exhibits a generally increasing trend for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms from 1800 onward especially there is a significant rising trend since the 1960s which is slightly higher than the average global warming rate these observations indicate that temperature is an important control on biodiversity in lake basomtso and that temperature change has a dramatic effect on the biological communities in the lake in terms of the microbial communities a total of two prokaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms cyanobacteria and chloracea were detected in the lake basomtso sediments as shown in fig 6 in all sediment samples chloracea was the most dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microorganism with average relative abundance of 90 6 while cyanobacteria had an average relative abundance of only 9 4 the eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms detected included chlorophyceae 25 6 dinoflagellata 22 9 diatomacae 19 3 trebouxiophyceae 14 9 chrysophyceae 11 6 and eustigmatophyceae 5 8 fig 6 with respect to the historical trends the relative abundance of cyanobacteria has increased significantly since 1960 although chloracea remains the dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microbial community in the latest 40 years the average relative abundance of cyanobacteria has reached 15 5 much higher than the average relative abundance before 1980 7 1 similarly changes in photosynthetic microbial communities have been observed for eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms although chlorophyceae had the highest mean relative abundance 29 5 dinoflagellata and diatomacae began to rise rapidly after 1960 and after 1980 chlorophyceae began to gradually increase more importantly dinoflagellata and diatomacae became the dominant eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms in the present day sediments of lake basomtso often cyanobacteria flourish best in water bodies at 25 35 c while dinoflagellata and diatomacae also tend to dominate towards warmer environments with a stronger competitive advantage in warmer climates watson et al 1997 although maat in lake basomtso region is below 10 c temperatures have risen rapidly since 1960 and the relative abundance of these three photosynthetic microorganisms shows a rising trend as temperatures rise cyanobacteria dinoflagellata and diatomacae gain a competitive advantage and tend to flourish and biodiversity increases significantly the evolution of the photosynthetic microbial community in lake basomtso is mainly due to climate change on one hand the increase in temperature increases the rate of enzymatic reaction of photosynthetic microorganisms which is conducive to the reproduction of photosynthetic microorganisms and the increase in biomass huo et al 2022a for cyanobacteria in particular the increase in temperature will further enhance the competitive advantage of cyanobacteria compared to other microorganisms carey et al 2012 on other hand rising temperatures are expected to cause the meltdown of glaciers which increases surface runoff and lead to increased nutrient input to lakes anslan et al 2020 this has led to a shift in the microbial community of the lake similar climate driven changes in microbial communities have also been identified in the tibetan plateau at yamdrok yumtso huo et al 2022a it is worth noting that although lake basomtso is a glacial lake with less impact from human activities fig s2 and low microbial diversity the biodiversity of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes increased significantly with the relative abundance of cyanobacteria increasing from 6 to 15 5 and diatoms from 15 7 to 31 7 respectively the flourishing of these microorganisms and the increase in total number and diversity may be potentially harmful to the original lake ecosystem which is less resilient the fragile ecosystems of glacial lakes are difficult to restore once contaminated and therefore ecological monitoring and protection of these glacial lakes should be strengthened in the future 4 conclusions this study reconstructed the temporal dynamics of temperature and photosynthetic microbial communities in lake basomtso on the tibetan plateau over the past two centuries the maat at lake basomtso varied from 6 9 to 8 3 c and rose rapidly after the 1950s with maat remaining above 8 c for the last two decades carbon isotope and n alkane analyses indicate that the sediments were mainly derived from a mixed input of endogenous organic matter from terrestrial c3 plants and photosynthetic microorganisms after the 1960s the contribution from endogenous organic matter in the sediments of lake basomtso gradually increased as the primary productivity within the lake continued to increase mainly due to rising temperatures rather than increased anthropogenic nutrient input chloracea is by far the most dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microbial community in lake basomtso but the relative abundance of cyanobacteria has increased significantly in recent years among the eukaryotic photosynthetic microbes chlorophyceae has now been replaced by dinoflagellata and diatomacae despite having the highest average relative abundance overall climate warming and its consequent glacial melting are the two main causes of the succession of photosynthetic microbial communities our findings suggest that global warming has significant implications for glacial lake ecosystems on the tibetan plateau in the context of continued future warming glaciers are expected to melt and retreat rapidly bringing more additional nutrients to glacial lakes the biomass and community composition of photosynthetic microbes are likely to increase dramatically given the fragility and importance of glacial lake ecosystems more expeditions are urgently needed to understand the current state of water quantity and quality in highland glacial lakes globally and how they will respond to rapid climate change more extensive field station monitoring systems need to be built to obtain long term continuous monitoring data which will enable us to better understand the resilience of highland glacial lakes and the extent to which our human activities impact these fragile yet important freshwater ecosystems

14645,as an important freshwater resource in the qinghai tibet plateau glacial lakes are being immensely affected by global warming due to the lack of long term monitoring data the processes and driving mechanisms of the water ecology of these glacial lakes in a rapidly changing climate are poorly understood this study for the first time reconstructed changes in water temperature and photosynthetic microbial communities over the past 200 years in lake basomtso a glacial lake on the southeastern tibetan plateau temperatures were reconstructed using a paleotemperature proxy based on branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers brgdgts the cell membrane lipids of some bacteria and photosynthetic microbial communities were determined by high throughput dna sequencing the reconstructed mean annual air temperature maat at lake basomtso varied between 6 9 and 8 3 c over the past 200 years with a rapid warming rate of 0 25 c 10 yrs after 1950s carbon isotope of sediment and n alkane analyses indicate that 95 of the organic matter in lake basomtso is derived from a mixture of terrestrial c3 plants and endogenous organic matter inputs and the proportion of endogenous organic matter in the sediments has gradually increased since the 1960s the sedimentary dna analyses of the sediment core reveal that chloracea is the most dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microbial group 84 5 over the past 200 years however the relative abundance of cyanobacteria has increased from 6 8 before the 1960s to 15 5 nowadays suggesting that warmer temperatures favor the growth of cyanobacteria in glacial lakes among eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms the chlorophyceae have been gradually replaced by dinoflagellata and diatomacae since the 1980s although the chlorophyceae still had the highest average relative abundance overall 30 40 the pb isotopic composition together with the total phosphorous concentration implies that human activity exerted a minimal impact on lake basomtso over the past 200 yrs however the synchronous fluctuations of total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and metal elements in sediments suggest that temperature appears to have a strong influence on nutrient input to lake basomtso by controlling glacial erosion global warming and the concurrent increase in glacial meltwater are two main factors driving changes in nutrient inputs from terrestrial sources which in turn increases the lake productivity and changes microbial community composition our findings demonstrate the sensitive response of glacial lake ecology to global warming it is necessary to strengthen the monitoring and research of glacial lake ecology on the tibetan plateau so as to more scientifically and accurately understand the response process and mechanism of the glacial lake ecosystem under global warming graphical abstrcat image graphical abstract keywords glacial lakes global warming gdgts seddna tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau is famously entitled the third pole of the world and the water tower of asia immerzeel et al 2010 with a mean altitude of over 4000 m above the sea level and an overall area of about 2 5 106 km2 many important rivers fed by the glacier meltwater such as the yangtze river yellow river lancang river and nu river all originate from the tibetan plateau huo et al 2022a the glaciers on the tibetan plateau are estimated to cover an area of about 1 105 km2 and the tibetan plateau has more than 1065 lakes with an area 1 km2 among which more than 1 3 are glacial lakes yao et al 2012 tao et al 2020 glacial lakes are an important part of the freshwater resources of the tibetan plateau that play a crucial role in fueling the water system of the tibetan plateau over the last few decades the global surface has experienced significant warming with the warming rate of the tibetan plateau at 0 44 c 10 yr between 1980 and 2012 which is 2 75 folds with respect to the global average 0 16 c 10 yr xu et al 2009 lin et al 2017 huo et al 2022a climate warming can cause changes in various hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycles of the water system on the tibetan plateau which will likely adversely impact its ecological structure function and resilience mclauchlan et al 2013 o beirne et al 2017 multiple lines of evidence suggest that rapid warming is causing significant glacier recession on the tibetan plateau with the loss of glacier stocks in the asian highlands accounting for 19 of the total annual global loss of glacier stocks 267 16 giga ton gt from 2000 to 2019 this has caused a significant decline in terrestrial water resource reserves in the asian highlands hugonnet et al 2021 zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2023b and lake area increased from 38 596 km2 to 46 831 km2 tao et al 2020 tang et al 2023 the glacial recharge to lakes on the tibetan plateau increased by 127 14 3 gt between 1976 and 2019 which is much higher than that 42 6 4 9 gt of non glacial lake water zhang et al 2021b the water quality of the tibetan plateau lake systems is currently acceptable and ecological changes due to climate warming do not appear to have crossed the ecological threshold thus far wischnewski et al 2011 liu et al 2021 however field surveys of several lakes on the tibetan plateau have shown that climate change has caused significant impacts on lake biomes and ecosystems on the tibetan plateau through changing water salinity and temperature resulting in variations of primary productivity and algal communities lin et al 2017 jia et al 2022 the water environment of glacial lakes on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is vital for the livelihoods of local people and to the security of water resources in asia while previous studies on the physical characteristics and water quality changes of lakes on the qtp have provided useful information a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of the water environment and ecology in glacial lakes is a prerequisite for developing strategies for water resource protection however there is a paucity of studies on the long term evolution of water quality and ecology in glacial lakes on the qtp over the past century glacial lakes are one of the most sensitive while fragile areas to climate change with less resilience williamson et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 for these unique attributes glacial lake sediments are a good archive for documenting changes in water ecology and environment which can be further used to reconstruct the long term evolution of the lake water environment on the qtp the lipid biomarker and sedimentary dna seddna analyses in lake sediment cores have made it possible to reconstruct the long term microbial community changes in lakes keck et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b zhang et al 2023a for example the evolution of the cyanobacterial community in taihu lake reconstructed by seddna revealed that increasing temperature and decreasing wind speed accounted for a gradual dominance of cyanobacteria in lake taihu zhang et al 2023b multiple lipid biomarkers have been used to reconstruct changes in aquatic ecosystems hydrology and methane cycling in lake wudalianchi from changbai mountain china before and after a regional volcanic eruption yao et al 2022 these new methods combined with the analyses of geochemical indicators such as nutrient elements and their isotopic compositions can provide novel insights into the environmental changes and community evolution of aquatic ecosystems herein we employed lipid biomarkers and high throughput dna sequencing techniques to examine the evolution of the photosynthetic microbial community in a sediment core from lake basomtso a glacial lake on the southeastern tibetan plateau temperature changes over the last 200 years were reconstructed using bacterial membrane lipids branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers brgdgts correspondingly the input of exogenous organic matter and elements to lake sediments during this period were assessed using organic geochemical proxies and pb isotopic compositions our findings provide strong data support to build a theoretical foundation for the development of strategies for water protection in glacial lakes on the qtp 2 material and method 2 1 sampling the lake basomtso 30 0 1 30 2 53 n 93 53 37 94 1 48 e 3500 m above the sea level is a glacial dammed freshwater lake located in the southeast of the tibetan plateau at the confluence of the nyingchi tanggula and the himalayas the lake has an area of about 26 km2 and a maximum depth of about 120 m with a salinity of 0 12 g l and water ph of 7 2 li et al 2017 its main source of recharge is via rainfall and glacier meltwater li et al 2016 lake basomtso exhibits stratification characteristics during winter and summer the low temperature together with the hypoxic condition caused by water stratification are favorable to the long term preservation of organic matter and dna within the sediments two parallel sediment cores of 44 cm and 52 cm in length respectively with a clear sediment water interface were collected by a gravity corer from the center of the lake at a depth of 100 m fig 1 30 0 59 n 93 55

was corrected for the self absorption effect of low energy γ rays within the samples the absolute ages of the sediment core were calculated using a constant flow and constant sedimentation rate cfcs model appleby and oldfield 1978 given that the porosity of the sediment core decreases with depth the cumulative mass depth m g cm 2 was used instead of depth cm when calculating the sediment accumulation rates the cumulative mass depth m a at depth a can be calculated using the formula 1 1 m a 0 a ρ z d z where ρ z is the dry bulk density of the sediment at depth z chen et al 2019 2 3

paleotemperature reconstruction in lakes tierney et al 2010 brgdgts are named with roman numerals i ii and iii which correspond to 4 5 and 6 methyl groups on the alkyl chains of brgdgts respectively the lowercase a b and c denote 0 1 and 2 cyclopentyl rings on the alkyl chains of brgdgts respectively in addition the prime symbol is used to indicate the isomers with the methyl moiety at the c6 position instead of the c5 position de jonge et al 2013 the distribution of 15 brgdgt compounds in global lake sediments was found to be closely related to mean annual air temperature maat martínez sosa et al 2021 and has been widely used to infer past temperature variation feng et al 2019 martin et al 2020 to reconstruct the paleotemperature in the sediment core of lake basomtso we first collected the instrumental mean annual air temperature maat data from 1961 to 2018 at the meteorological station in bayi town which is 2992 m above sea level and 60 1 km from lake basomtso based on the dating results of the core the distribution of brgdgts in the top sediments of the core over the period of 1961 2018 was used to develop a lake specific calibration for temperature reconstructions in lake basomtso stepwise forward selection sfs a statistical method to select the brgdgt compounds that have the most significant correlation with temperature over the period of 1961 2018 was employed and a brgdgt calibration for temperature reconstruction was obtained 2 maat 2 5 f iia 4 81 r 2 0 79 p 0 05 where f iia is the relative abundance of iia in all brgdgts temperature before the year 1961 in the sediment core was reconstructed using this calibration 2 7 vegetation type reconstruction the average carbon chain length acl and aquatic vegetation index p aq of long chain n alkanes carbon chain 21 were calculated respectively using the n alkane abundance in the sediments ficken et al 2000 poynter et al 1989 according to the formula as follows 3 acl i c i c i 4 p aq c 23 c 25 c 23 c 25 c 29 c 31 where i denotes the carbon chain length over the range from 23 to 33 and c i denotes the relative abundance of n alkanes with carbon chain length i higher acl and lower p aq values indicate more contribution of terrestrial higher plants and emergent macrophytes than submerged floating plants to the organic matter pool in the lake sediment core ficken et al 2000 2 8 assessment of heavy metal pollution degree the enrichment factor ef was used to evaluate the extent of heavy metal contamination and the ef is calculated as follows 5 ef t s r s t b r b where ts and tb represent targeted metal element concentrations in sediment samples and background respectively rs and rb represent reference element concentrations in sediment samples and background respectively the concentration data at the bottom of the sediment column core 34 cm was selected as the background and the rock forming element aluminum al was selected as the reference element 3 results and discussion 3 1 chrolonogy the 210pbex decreases logarithmically with increasing mass depth and gradually converges to background values at the bottom of the sediment core fig 2 due to the large uncertainty of 210pbex in the lower part of the sediment core only data collected from 22 cm depth were used to calculate lake sediment ages through the cfcs model appleby and oldfield 1978 zhan et al 2019 while this may lead to greater dating uncertainty in the lower part of the sediment core it does not affect the main conclusions because the variation of 210pbex and 137cs in the sediment core was primarily found in the middle and upper parts of the sediment core the cfcs model for 210pbex shows an average deposition rate of approximately 0 15 g cm2 yr in lake basomtso and the calculated age based on the cfcs model shows the age of 1966 occurs at 13 cm the maximum peak of 137cs occurs at 13 cm depth corresponding to 1963 the age discrepancy between the 137cs and cfcs model is minor 3 yrs and indicates that the dating results are reliable 3 2 temperature variation over the last 200 yrs the maat change over the last 200 years reconstructed from brgdgts in the sediment core of lake basomtso is shown in fig 3 instrumental temperature data from the weather station in bayi a town near lake basomtso shows that maat in the region increased between 1961 and 2018 and ranged from 6 5 to 9 c with an average of 7 7 c the maat reconstructed from brgdgts also shows an increasing trend during the period with temperature variations ranging from 7 2 to 8 2 c with an average of 7 7 c overall the reconstructed maat matched significantly well with the instrumental data r2 0 79 p 0 05 fig s3 indicating that the reconstructed temperature record was reliable over the past 200 years the variation of maat in lake basomtso ranged from 6 9 to 8 3 c fig 3 with an average of 7 5 c before 1930 maat at lake basomtso showed no clear trend with temperatures fluctuating between 7 2 and 8 1 c averaged at 7 4 c between 1930 and 1960 temperatures fell from 7 8 c to 6 9 c but then increased rapidly to 7 9 c subsequently the maat showed a continuously increasing trend and remaining above 8 c for almost 20 years compared to global temperature trends temperature trends at lake basomtso are more significant fig 3 especially during the post 1950 period global temperatures have increased by about 0 9 c since 1950 in contrast the temperature at lake basomtso increased by around 1 2 c which is significantly higher than the global average mainly due to the higher altitude of lake basomtso the rate of surface temperature rise is usually higher on plateaus than that at lower altitudes due to a combination of surface reflection cloud radiation surface water vapor and radiative flux changes pepin et al 2015 tang et al 2023 3 3 temporal changes in historical primary productivity toc tn and tp contents in lake basomtso sediments ranged from 0 26 to 0 83 0 026 to 0 065 and 0 063 to 0 073 respectively fig 4 before 1930 toc tn and tp contents showed no obvious change fluctuating around 0 59 0 039 and 0 069 respectively from 1930 to 1950 toc tn and tp contents dropped rapidly to 0 26 0 03 and 0 063 respectively however toc tn and tp contents quickly rebounded to 0 64 0 05 and 0 073 respectively from 1950 to 1960 after 1960 toc and tn contents continued to rise while tp content showed a downward trend in general toc and tn contents exhibit similar trends to our reconstructed temperature suggesting that temperature has a significant influence on organic matter accumulation in lake basomtso sediments figs 3 and 4 however tp content displays an opposite trend to temperature since 1960 this decline in tp content is likely attributed to the reduction in the phosphorus content of catchment soils in recent years excessive grazing and climate change have contributed to the degradation of pastures on the tibet plateau dong et al 2016 ren et al 2013 resulting in a reduction in the phosphorus content of the top soils consequently there has been a decrease in the phosphorus input into the lake through surface runoff which has resulted in a gradual decline in sediment tp contents the organic carbon isotope δ13corg acl and p aq were used to identify the source of organic matter in general photosynthetic microorganisms in the lake water and higher plants in the lake catchment are the two main sources of organic matter in the lake sediments pinckney et al 2001 c3 plants are reported to have a lower δ13corg typically ranging from 24 to 30 whereas c4 plants have a relatively higher δ13corg 10 to 16 the δ13corg value of organic matter from photosynthetic living microorganisms in the lake is close to that of the c3 plants meyers 2003 lu et al 2020 higher acl values indicate a higher organic matter input from terrestrial higher plants while lower acl values indicate an increased input of endogenous organic matter li et al 2022 p aq is an indicator of the proportion of submerged plants phytoplankton relative to terrestrial vegetation inputs lower p aq indicates inputs of terrestrial organic matter while higher p aq indicates inputs of organic matter from internal phytoplankton or submerged plants ficken et al 2000 the δ13corg acl and p aq of the lake basomtso sediments vary from 23 5 to 20 1 28 0 to 29 3 and 0 29 to 0 42 respectively together these proxies indicate that organic matter in lake basomtso is mainly derived from terrestrial c3 plants with mixed inputs like endogenous organic matter from the lake before 1930 these proxies were relatively stable but after 1930 the δ13corg of lake basomtso sediments gradually decreased while acl slightly decreased and p aq showed an increasing trend fig 4 these findings indicate that the proportion of endogenous organic matter in lake basomtso sediments gradually increased and the primary productivity within the lake continuously enhanced the rise in the primary productivity of lakes in the modern period is mainly due to the increased anthropogenic nutrient inputs and climate change monchamp et al 2018 however with the rapid development of tourism in lake basomtso since the 1980s human activity is in a constant state of enhancement but overall the impact of human activity on the environment of lake basomtso is still very weak to better assess the impact of human activities on lake basomtso we analyzed the sedimentary heavy element concentrations the results showed consistency between the concentrations of heavy elements fig s1a and the historical changes in toc and tn contents both of which responded well to temperature changes the increase in temperature led to an increase in glacial meltwater and more nutrients entered the lake along with the meltwater that fuels more nutrients to the microbial community at the same time the biological communities within the lakes are more active yielding higher primary productivity of the lakes while tp content followed the same trend as temperature before 1960 it showed a decreasing trend after 1960 this indicates that the flourishing of photosynthetic microorganisms was not related to the increase in tp and human activities had no significant effect on the photosynthetic microbial community of the lake by analyzing the heavy metals in lake basomtso we found that the ef of these metals all fluctuated around 1 fig s1b suggesting that they are more likely associated with natural origin kang et al 2017 the pb isotope data further suggest the weak influence of human activities on lake basomtso as shown in fig s2 the 208pb 206pb and 206pb 207pb values range from 2 081 to 2 087 and from 1 197 to 1 204 respectively for lake basomtso sediments these isotopic values differ significantly from typical anthropogenic pb from vehicle exhaust coal combustion and metal smelting zheng et al 2004 and are also inconsistent with the atmospheric pb isotopic composition of major cities in south and east asia mukai et al 2001 in contrast the pb isotopes of the lake basomtso sediments are closer to the natural end members such as desert dust and loess ferrat et al 2012 which fall within the riverine sediment range of the tibetan plateau tan et al 2014 therefore climate warming rather than human activity is the main driver for the rise in primary productivity in basomtso lake 3 4 temporal succession of photosynthetic microbial communities high throughput sequencing of sedadna provides an effective strategy to assess long term trends in photosynthetic microbial communities a total of 1463 060 and 1548 670 prokaryotic and eukaryotic rrna gene sequences were obtained from 22 lake basomtso sediment samples containing 5698 prokaryotic and 2276 eukaryotic otus the final results include 2229 prokaryotic and 152 784 eukaryotic photosynthetic microbial reads clustered in 69 prokaryotic and 182 eukaryotic photosynthetic otus respectively the absolute abundance of eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms responded better to temperature to reduce the effect of dna degradation relative abundance was used to further explore the sequence of temporal changes in the photosynthetic microbial community fig 6 the relative abundance was calculated as the proportion of a particular prokaryotic eukaryotic photosynthetic microbe to the total prokaryotic eukaryotic photosynthetic microbes to better represent the variation in different photosynthetic microbial communities as shown in fig 5 the chao index of α diversity exhibits a generally increasing trend for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms from 1800 onward especially there is a significant rising trend since the 1960s which is slightly higher than the average global warming rate these observations indicate that temperature is an important control on biodiversity in lake basomtso and that temperature change has a dramatic effect on the biological communities in the lake in terms of the microbial communities a total of two prokaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms cyanobacteria and chloracea were detected in the lake basomtso sediments as shown in fig 6 in all sediment samples chloracea was the most dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microorganism with average relative abundance of 90 6 while cyanobacteria had an average relative abundance of only 9 4 the eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms detected included chlorophyceae 25 6 dinoflagellata 22 9 diatomacae 19 3 trebouxiophyceae 14 9 chrysophyceae 11 6 and eustigmatophyceae 5 8 fig 6 with respect to the historical trends the relative abundance of cyanobacteria has increased significantly since 1960 although chloracea remains the dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microbial community in the latest 40 years the average relative abundance of cyanobacteria has reached 15 5 much higher than the average relative abundance before 1980 7 1 similarly changes in photosynthetic microbial communities have been observed for eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms although chlorophyceae had the highest mean relative abundance 29 5 dinoflagellata and diatomacae began to rise rapidly after 1960 and after 1980 chlorophyceae began to gradually increase more importantly dinoflagellata and diatomacae became the dominant eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms in the present day sediments of lake basomtso often cyanobacteria flourish best in water bodies at 25 35 c while dinoflagellata and diatomacae also tend to dominate towards warmer environments with a stronger competitive advantage in warmer climates watson et al 1997 although maat in lake basomtso region is below 10 c temperatures have risen rapidly since 1960 and the relative abundance of these three photosynthetic microorganisms shows a rising trend as temperatures rise cyanobacteria dinoflagellata and diatomacae gain a competitive advantage and tend to flourish and biodiversity increases significantly the evolution of the photosynthetic microbial community in lake basomtso is mainly due to climate change on one hand the increase in temperature increases the rate of enzymatic reaction of photosynthetic microorganisms which is conducive to the reproduction of photosynthetic microorganisms and the increase in biomass huo et al 2022a for cyanobacteria in particular the increase in temperature will further enhance the competitive advantage of cyanobacteria compared to other microorganisms carey et al 2012 on other hand rising temperatures are expected to cause the meltdown of glaciers which increases surface runoff and lead to increased nutrient input to lakes anslan et al 2020 this has led to a shift in the microbial community of the lake similar climate driven changes in microbial communities have also been identified in the tibetan plateau at yamdrok yumtso huo et al 2022a it is worth noting that although lake basomtso is a glacial lake with less impact from human activities fig s2 and low microbial diversity the biodiversity of both eukaryotes and prokaryotes increased significantly with the relative abundance of cyanobacteria increasing from 6 to 15 5 and diatoms from 15 7 to 31 7 respectively the flourishing of these microorganisms and the increase in total number and diversity may be potentially harmful to the original lake ecosystem which is less resilient the fragile ecosystems of glacial lakes are difficult to restore once contaminated and therefore ecological monitoring and protection of these glacial lakes should be strengthened in the future 4 conclusions this study reconstructed the temporal dynamics of temperature and photosynthetic microbial communities in lake basomtso on the tibetan plateau over the past two centuries the maat at lake basomtso varied from 6 9 to 8 3 c and rose rapidly after the 1950s with maat remaining above 8 c for the last two decades carbon isotope and n alkane analyses indicate that the sediments were mainly derived from a mixed input of endogenous organic matter from terrestrial c3 plants and photosynthetic microorganisms after the 1960s the contribution from endogenous organic matter in the sediments of lake basomtso gradually increased as the primary productivity within the lake continued to increase mainly due to rising temperatures rather than increased anthropogenic nutrient input chloracea is by far the most dominant prokaryotic photosynthetic microbial community in lake basomtso but the relative abundance of cyanobacteria has increased significantly in recent years among the eukaryotic photosynthetic microbes chlorophyceae has now been replaced by dinoflagellata and diatomacae despite having the highest average relative abundance overall climate warming and its consequent glacial melting are the two main causes of the succession of photosynthetic microbial communities our findings suggest that global warming has significant implications for glacial lake ecosystems on the tibetan plateau in the context of continued future warming glaciers are expected to melt and retreat rapidly bringing more additional nutrients to glacial lakes the biomass and community composition of photosynthetic microbes are likely to increase dramatically given the fragility and importance of glacial lake ecosystems more expeditions are urgently needed to understand the current state of water quantity and quality in highland glacial lakes globally and how they will respond to rapid climate change more extensive field station monitoring systems need to be built to obtain long term continuous monitoring data which will enable us to better understand the resilience of highland glacial lakes and the extent to which our human activities impact these fragile yet important freshwater ecosystems

14646,the activated sludge process is widely used for biological wastewater treatment due to its low cost and high efficiency although numerous lab scale bioreactor experiments have been conducted to investigate the microorganism performance and mechanisms in activated sludge understanding the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale bioreactors has remained elusive in this study we investigated the bacterial communities in 966 activated sludge samples obtained from various bioreactors including both full and lab scale ones from 95 previous studies our findings reveal significant differences in the bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors with thousands of bacterial genera exclusive to each scale we also identified 12 genera that are frequently abundant in full scale bioreactors but rarely observed in lab scale reactors by using a machine learning method organic matter and temperature were determined as the primary factors affecting microbial communities in full and lab scale bioreactors additionally transient bacterial species from other environments may also contribute to the observed bacterial community differences furthermore the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale bioreactors were verified by comparing the results of lab scale bioreactor experiments to full scale bioreactor sampling overall this study sheds light on the bacteria overlooked in lab scale studies and deepens our understanding of the differences in bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated sludge bacterial community wastewater treatment machine learning 1 introduction as the most popular biological wastewater treatment method activated sludge has been used for more than a century van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 microorganisms with various functions in activated sludge work together to transform and degrade a range of pollutants found in municipal and industrial wastewater studies have been conducted to understand the microbial community structure in full scale wastewater treatment plants wang et al 2012 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 which have revealed a core bacterial community in activated sludge from different plants treating municipal wastewater despite the community structure of activated sludge being well characterized the detailed functions of many microorganisms are still unknown hatzenpichler et al 2020 and many bacterial species remain uncultured zhang and zhang 2022 our understanding of the functions of wastewater treatment microorganisms is merely the tip of the iceberg to improve the performance of activated sludge processes numerous lab scale bioreactor experiments have been conducted to enhance the removal efficiency of organic matter zhang et al 2018 nitrogen wang et al 2019 phosphorus xu et al 2021 and micropollutants khan et al 2019 qian et al 2021 in addition such studies have been conducted to investigate sludge bulking and foaming processes nittami and batinovic 2022 and to develop new technologies to improve the settleability of activated sludge sam et al 2022 in general the bacterial communities in the bioreactors are analyzed and the results are used to explain the pollutant removal processes and the sludge characteristics as reported in many of these studies it is well known that the bacterial communities in lab scale bioreactors are often significantly different from those in the seeding sludge which is usually taken from full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors studies have indicated that the pollutant biodegradation rate in lab scale bioreactors under controlled conditions is often less effective than that in full scale bioreactors kuppusamy et al 2016 megharaj et al 2011 which can be attributed to the differences in bacterial communities despite a considerable number of lab scale bioreactor studies have been conducted there is a lack of comprehensive analysis comparing the bacterial communities in lab scale bioreactors with those in full scale bioreactors as a result little is known about the bacteria that are easy or difficult to enrich and cultivate in lab scale bioreactors in this study we applied both bioinformatic and experimental methods to investigate the differences in bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors we systematically analyzed the 16s rrna gene sequences of 966 activated sludge samples from 297 full and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors this allowed us to identify the frequently observed bacterial genera in different scale bioreactors and to explore the relationships among different genera in addition a machine learning approach was used to investigate the environmental parameters affecting the bacterial communities in different scale bioreactors furthermore we performed lab scale experiments and collected a number of activated sludge samples from full scale wwtps to verify the analysis results overall the results improved our understanding of the differences in bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors and highlighted the bacteria that are difficult to cultivate in lab scale bioreactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of public data to collect 16s rrna gene sequencing data generated from activated sludge in biological wastewater treatment systems we searched published studies and retrieved the sequencing data of 966 samples from the ncbi sequence read archive https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra these activated sludge samples were collected from both full scale 570 samples and lab scale bioreactors 396 samples operated under aerobic conditions the detailed wastewater treatment bioreactors information and the accession numbers of the sequencing data were shown in table s1 and table s2 respectively 2 2 experimental setup and sludge sample collection in order to verify the analysis results based on the previously published studies a lab scale continuous flow bioreactor consisting of an aeration tank and a sedimentation tank was operated in this study the seed sludge was taken

time srt of approximately 20 days the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss were kept at approximately 3000 mg l the temperature was controlled within 24 1 c and the dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained at 2 4 mg l this bioreactor was fed by synthetic wastewater glucose 200 mg l nh4 n 25 mg l po4 3 p 5 mg l nahco3 300 mg l caco3 10 mg l mgso4 20 mg l and necessary trace elements over the 80 day operation of lab scale bioreactor a total of 18 activated sludge samples were collected in addition 24 samples were taken from the aeration tanks of two full scale bioreactors treating municipal wastewater in nanjing china all activated sludge samples were fixed with ethanol and stored in 20 c refrigerator for further treatment 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing dna were extracted from the 42 activated sludge samples using the dneasy powersoil pro kit qiagen usa the quality and concentration of dna were determined by nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and 1 0 agarose gel electrophoresis then the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the pcr primers 338f 5 act cct acg gga ggc agc ag 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 targeting the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene by using an abi geneamp 9700 pcr thermocycler abi ca usa the following pcr amplification cycling conditions were applied

samples were amplified in triplicate and the pcr products were extracted from 2 agarose gel and purified using the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences usa the purified amplicons were used to construct a library and sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa with paired end settings 2 4 bioinformatics analysis all 16s rrna gene sequences were processed and analyzed by usearch v 10 0 240 edgar 2010 we used fastx truncate stripleft 25 stripright 20 to remove primer binding and filtered low quality reads with fastq maxee 1 0 after quality control all samples were then rarefied to 20 000 reads and operation taxonomic unit otu clustering was performed at a 97 identity level wu et al 2019 the representative sequence of each otu was assigned taxonomy using the sintax classifier and analyzed against midas database dueholm et al 2022 nierychlo et al 2020 specially used for sewage treatment with a confidence threshold of 0 8 each sample was processed and analyzed individually and the taxonomic assignment results at genus level were then merged for statistical analysis and visualization a few terms were defined to describe the occurrence and abundance of different bacterial genera frequently observed genera was defined as genera observed in more than 50 of all samples frequently abundant genera was defined as genera with relative abundance 0 1 in over 50 of all samples frequently observed but less abundant genera was defined as genera with relative abundance 0 02 in over 50 of all samples 2 5 machine learning with xgboost model the machine learning approach based on xgboost model was applied to differentiate activated sludge from different scale bioreactors and to investigate the impacts of different environmental factors on the bacterial communities in bioreactors cai et al 2019 the xgboost classifier was applied because of its high accuracy and applicability to datasets with many features training and evaluation of the model were performed by using the xgboost package for python besides we also trained the model with selected features and compared the model performance with different parameters n estimators and max depth both the holdout method random training set testing set 8 2 and ten fold cross validation were applied to verify that the model was not overfitted ye et al 2020 furthermore the performance of the model was evaluated by the accuracy of the classifier using the accuracy score function in scikit learn 2 6 statistical analysis and data visualization alpha diversity in different scale bioreactors was analyzed and visualized by the ggpubr package in r and the differences in species richness and simpson s diversity were compared by student s t test bray curtis distance based principal coordinates analysis pcoa and adonis analysis were performed in r with the vegan package to reveal the differences between microbial communities in different scale bioreactors the distribution of abundant genera in full and lab scale was shown in violin plots and student s t test was performed to check the significant difference between the two groups in order to explore the correlations of genera in full and lab scale bioreactors r and gephi were used for co occurrence network analysis spearman s correlation coefficient ρ 0 6 and significance p 0 01 were considered as the strong correlation and statistical significance in addition the differentially abundant genera in different scale bioreactors were identified based on welch s t test at 95 confidence intervals in stamp parks et al 2014 the feature importance of environmental factors for distinguishing bioreactor scale was analyzed by xgboost classifier based on the linear discriminant analysis lda linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 was used to determine the genera most likely to explain differences between groups separated by different chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations 3 results 3 1 bacterial community profiles in full and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors to comprehensively investigate the bacterial communities in activated sludge in both full scale and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors we conducted an analysis of 966 16s rrna gene sequencing datasets obtained from 95 studies table s1 these datasets were derived from samples collected from activated sludge in 297 bioreactors including 115 lab scale bioreactors and 182 full scale bioreactors across 29 countries and four continents table s1 fig 1 a the studies encompassed a range of treatment processes e g conventional activated sludge anoxic oxic anaerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch reactor and oxidation ditch fig 1b and carbon sources e g municipal wastewater industrial wastewater leachate glucose and acetate given the large sample size diverse geographical sources and variety of reactor types the findings are representative of a broad range of systems based on the midas database all of the 16s rrna gene sequences were assigned to 78 phyla and 6937 genera and over 88 of the sequences were successfully classified at the genus level fig s1 suggesting our analysis covered the bacterial population information in these samples in depth alpha diversity analysis fig 1c d showed that the species richness t test p 0 001 and simpson s diversity indices t test p 0 001 of the bacterial communities in full scale bioreactors were significantly higher than those in the lab scale bioreactors indicating that full scale bioreactors were able to maintain more diverse and complex microbial communities although the main bacterial phyla observed in the full and lab scale reactors were generally similar fig s2 clustering analysis further revealed a clear distinction adonis analysis r2 0 p 0 001 between different scale bioreactor groups at both phylum and genus levels fig 1e f in addition it was found that samples from full scale bioreactors were closely related to each other while the samples from lab scale bioreactors were distributed in a more dispersed pattern suggesting that the microbial communities among different full scale bioreactors were more similar than those among the lab scale bioreactors 3 2 differences of bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors in total 5689 and 6301 genera were obtained from the lab scale and full scale activated sludge samples fig 2 a of these genera 5053 were present in both types of reactors 636 were only found in the lab scale bioreactors and 1248 were only found in the full scale bioreactors of the 1248 genera specific to full scale bioreactors 47 3 77 were observed in over 3 of the full scale samples table s3 while for the 636 genera specific to the lab scale genera only 6 genera 0 94 were present in over 3 of the lab scale samples table s4 in some full scale bioreactors and lab scale bioreactors the total abundance of these specific genera can reach up to 10 and 40 respectively fig 2b and most of the genera 42 of 47 specific to full scale bioreactors are putative ones and have not been well characterized table s3 by comparing the 10 most abundant genera in lab scale and full scale bioreactors fig s2 it was found that only five genera i e dechloromonas flavobacterium haliangium thauera and zoogloea were common in addition we also investigated the frequently observed genera according to their occurrence frequency in different samples it is obvious that some genera frequently observed in bioreactors but have a low abundance besides 26 genera such as terrimonas ferruginibacter and hyphomicrobium were determined as frequently abundant relative abundance 0 1 in more than 50 of the samples in full scale bioreactors fig 2c table s5 notably nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and phosphate accumulating organisms ca accumulibacter were frequently abundant in the full scale bioreactors while only six genera were found to be frequently abundant in lab scale bioreactors fig 2c table s6 these frequently abundant genera made up 20 54 and 10 13 of the total sequences in full and lab scale bioreactors respectively fig 2d interestingly 12 of the 26 frequently abundant genera in full scale bioreactors were rarely present in lab scale bioreactors fig 2e these genera have low relative abundances 0 02 in more than half of lab scale samples table s5 and their total relative abundance in full scale bioreactors are obviously higher than that in the lab scale ones fig s3 furthermore as revealed by welch s t test analysis fig s4 many other bacteria also displayed significant differences p 0 05 in abundance between the two groups of bioreactors fig s4 also shows that the relative abundance of some genera such as zoogloea pseudomonas flavobacterium in lab scale bioreactors could be largely higher than those in the full scale bioreactors suggesting these bacteria tend to proliferate under the conditions of lab scale cultivation 3 3 co occurrence network of bacterial genera in different scale bioreactors to investigate the potential relationships among the bacteria in different types of reactors co occurrence network analysis was performed fig 3 for lab scale bioreactors strong and significant positive correlations spearman s ρ 0 6 p 0 01 among frequently observed genera are obviously less than those in full scale bioreactors the larger number of correlations among bacterial genera in full scale bioreactors indicate that complex interactions may exist in the full scale bioreactors however these interactions may not be preserved when these bacteria are cultivated in the lab scale bioreactors the co occurrence networks also show that the correlation relationships among bacterial genera are irrelevant to the relative abundance and occurrence frequency in full scale bioreactors fig 3a genera with different relative abundance and occurrence may collaborate with each other to achieve the pollutant degradation in full scale bioreactors interestingly dechloromonas and sulfuritalea were not only frequently abundant in full scale bioreactors but also correlated with many other genera including many putative genera indicating that they may play important roles in the wastewater treatment process moreover it was also noticed that members of sulfuritalea are rarely present in lab scale bioreactors in addition the frequently abundant genera terrimonas and ferruginibacter have strong correlation relationship in lab scale bioreactors fig 3c while this relationship was not observed in full scale bioreactors according to the taxonomic information the co occurrence networks revealed that the bacterial genera affiliated with proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidota accounted for the majority of the nodes fig 3b d likely due to the dominance of these three phyla in the activated sludge samples most genera in networks of full and lab scale bioreactors fig 3b d were correlated with genera in the same phyla and the phylum level patterns were obvious the full scale bioreactor networks had higher modularity indices of 0 604 suggesting that the nodes tended to cluster together and form obvious modular structures the two largest modules have 23 and 15 genera and the majority of their nodes belong to bacteroidota and firmicutes respectively 3 4 factors affecting the bacterial community differences in order to reveal the factors leading to the different bacterial communities between full and lab scale activated sludge samples a machine learning approach xgboost was used to analyze the relationships between environmental operational factors and the bacterial communities fig 4 to ensure the model s application the missing values of the environmental factors fig s5 were filled with the median sheng et al 2012 despite the missing values we successfully distinguished the scale of the bioreactors with environmental and operational factors by using xgboost classifier accuracy 94 33 feature importance analysis showed that cod and temperature were the two most important factors in distinguishing the bioreactors scale fig 4a additionally we observed significant differences p 0 001 in cod concentration and temperature values between lab scale bioreactors and full scale bioreactors fig s6a b to address the potential influence of these differences we selected activated sludge samples associated with typical cod 100 500 mg l and temperature 20 30 c and compared their bacterial communities however despite selecting samples with similar cod and temperature values differences in microbial community composition still persisted fig s6c this indicated that other environmental and operational factors may also significantly impact the bacterial communities to further explore the influence of organic matter concentration on bacterial community structure we divided the bioreactors into three types according to the organic matter concentrations of the influent i e high middle and low then lefse was applied to determine the bacteria with significantly different relative abundances among the three groups of bioreactors fig 4b c eventually 33 differentially abundant taxonomic clades lda score 3 5 were identified and the lda scores of distinct taxa were presented in table s7 according to the lefse results the high level organic matter group had 8 distinctive taxa and except members in corynebacteriales all other taxa are affiliated with proteobacteria for the middle level group 12 taxa affiliated with chloroflexi acidobacteriota verrucomicrobiota bacteroidota and myxococcia were identified it was noticed that most of the distinctive taxa were also frequently abundant genera in the full scale bioreactors as shown in fig 4c and table s5 the relative abundances of terrimonas in bioreactors fed with middle level organic matter were higher than those in the other two groups the relative abundance of dechloromonas haliangium sulfuritalea and midas g 17 in bioreactors fed with low level organic matter were higher than those in the other two groups while zoogloea in the high level group was observed to have higher relative abundances than those in the bioreactors fed with lower concentrations of organic matter 3 5 experimental verification in order to valid the data analysis results based on the public data we collected activated sludge samples from two full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors and operated a lab scale aerobic bioreactor to investigate the bacterial community by comparing the microbial community structures of 18 lab scale and 24 full scale activated sludge samples it was found that the bacterial community in the full scale bioreactors significantly differed from that in the lab scale bioreactors fig 5 a adions r2 0 5 p 0 001 which was consistent with the results obtained from public data analysis of the 156 genera frequently observed in full scale bioreactors 152 still were frequently observed in our full scale bioreactor samples fig 5b as for the 51 frequently observed genera in lab scale bioreactors identified in public data 40 were frequently observed in our lab scale bioreactor samples fig 5b the relative abundance of these genera in accounted for 52 25 and 19 51 in full and lab scale activated sludge samples respectively fig 5c in addition based on the public data analysis we identified 26 frequently abundant genera in full scale bioreactors fig 2d among them 23 genera were still frequently abundant in our full scale samples fig 5d the relative abundance of these made up 22 04 of total sequences fig 5d through analyzing the genera frequently abundant in full scale bioreactors but rarely present in lab scale bioreactors in our experimental lab scale bioreactor samples we confirmed that the genera with relatively high abundance in full scale bioreactors were less abundant in laboratory fig 5e moreover along with the reactor operation the relative abundance of these genera decreased from 2 30 to around 1 in a few days and then decreased gradually and after 73 days of lab scale bioreactor operation their abundance approached zero given the long srt about 20 days of the lab scale bioreactor the washout effect on bacterial species would be minimal and the increase and decline in their total relative abundance is mainly caused by the operational conditions of the bioreactor 4 discussion in this study we conducted a large scale data analysis and demonstrated that the bacterial community structures in full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors are significantly different from those in lab scale reactors with the latter having a relatively lower complexity this is mainly because full scale wastewater treatment plants typically have more complicated wastewater composition and special operating conditions as demonstrated by this study and some previous works che et al 2021 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 organic matters level is one of the major factors influencing bacterial community structures in addition full scale bioreactors are also affected by various conditions such as rainfall temperature fluctuation bacteria immigration via influent these factors may also lead to the bacterial community differences moreover our results showed that the full scale bioreactors have more uniform and consistent bacterial communities with more frequently abundant genera than lab scale bioreactors which may be due to the similar wastewater composition and wastewater treatment processes across different wastewater treatment plants cao et al 2020 while for different lab scale bioreactors the wastewater composition and operation conditions usually significantly differed the bacterial compositions at the phylum level in the full and lab scale reactors were found to be relatively similar with proteobacteria and bacteroidetes being the dominant phyla which was consistent with previous studies wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 however at the genus level 1248 genera were found only present in the full scale bioreactors this implies that many bacterial species are difficult to cultivate in the lab scale bioreactors moreover 46 of the frequently abundant genera in full scale bioreactors were rarely present in lab scale bioreactors suggesting that the selection pressure of the lab scale bioreactors could significantly alter the bacterial community structures and the dominant bacteria in the full scale bioreactors may not be enriched in the lab scale bioreactors it was noticed that most of the bacteria specific to the full scale bioreactors are annotated as putative genera and have not been isolated as pure culture this is consistent with the previous report that a large number of bacterial species in full scale activated sludge resist cultivation zhang and zhang 2022 the mechanisms behind the cultivation resistance could be due to the hidden traits of these bacteria and require further investigation especially using genetic and transcriptional information zhang et al 2019 some known bacteria specific to the full scale bioreactors are extremophile for example frigoribacterium species optimally grow in dust and soil at low temperatures 2 to 10 c kämpfer et al 2000 and gallionella species are abundantly present in sediment at ph 4 4 fabisch et al 2013 these bacteria might be transient species and they enter the full scale wastewater system accidentally from soil sediments or other environments surprisingly it was also found that a considerable number of bacterial genera were only present in lab scale reactors to the best of our knowledge this was not reported in previous studies these bacteria may be from either synthetic wastewater or laboratory environments and the functions and metabolic mechanisms of these bacteria need to be further investigated as this will determine the practical significance of lab scale experiments co occurrence analysis revealed that some genera not only frequently abundant in different full scale bioreactors but also were strongly correlated with many other genera indicating that they could be keystone genera in these bioreactors wu et al 2022 and may play important roles in maintaining the functions of the bacterial community sulfuritalea and dechloromonas were identified as such keystone genera in full scale bioreactors they are involved in denitrification carosia et al 2014 mcilroy et al 2016 organic matter degradation processes begmatov et al 2022 and can tolerate salt or alkaline stress conditions fudou et al 2002 han et al 2019 which can be beneficial for resisting shock loading in full scale bioreactors moreover their participation in c and n metabolism such as generating nitrous oxide may also affect the global cycle of carbon and nitrogen chen et al 2020 however the abundance of sulfuritalea in lab scale bioreactors was usually relatively low table s5 likely due to significant community changes in the lab scale bioreactors operated under high selection pressure the keystone genera linked to many genera rarely present in the lab scale reactors such as ca accumulibacter midas g 17 midas g 558 ca obscuribacter midas g 4871 and midas g 283 most of which are putative genera and have not been well characterized these genera may also play significant roles in the wastewater treatment systems and their low abundance in lab scale bioreactors could impact the applicability of experimental results to full scale bioreactors therefore it would be valuable to further investigate these genera in future studies machine learning methods have been used to analyze the relationships between environmental parameters and microbial community structures in many previous studies wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 in this study based on feature importance analysis of the machine learning it was found that organic matter and temperature are the two most important factors affecting the bacterial community structure which is consistent with several previous studies sun et al 2022 wu et al 2019 the influence of organic matter on bacterial community structure is well known wen et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 and the impact of temperature on bacterial community is also significant lapara et al 2001 nadarajah et al 2007 lab scale bioreactors often maintain a relatively constant temperature in indoor environment which may differ from the natural temperature in full scale bioreactors additionally it should be noted that other parameters such as ph and salinity may also significantly affect the bacterial community he et al 2017 maspolim et al 2015 however since both full scale and lab scale reactors were usually not operated under extreme levels of these parameters they were not identified as the most important ones during the application of machine learning method lefse analysis further revealed that the relative abundance of some bacterial genera in bioreactors fed with wastewater containing different levels of organic matter were significantly different the results table s7 were generally consistent with previous studies for example dokdonella species were often found in soil with low concentrations of organic matter yoo et al 2009 yoon et al 2006 while most zoogloea species were observed in activated sludge bioreactors under high organic loadings an et al 2016 shao et al 2009 in general we demonstrated that some bacteria rarely cultivated in lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors can be identified by analyzing a large number of previously published data and performing experimental verification furthermore the variety of bacterial communities in different scale bioreactors was confirmed by the clustering analysis it is possible that the rarely cultivated bacteria abundant in some specific lab scale bioreactors were not included in the samples of this study this indicates that these bacteria may be hard to cultivate and require special conditions and configurations to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to comprehensively compare the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors however there are still limitations in this study including the lack of investigation on bacterial community fluctuations over time in bioreactors and the incomplete understanding of the functions of bacteria that are abundant in full and lab scale bioreactors therefore further studies are needed to address these knowledge gaps we hope that our findings will inspire further research on the bacteria with different abundances in these two types of reactors especially those rarely cultivated in lab scale ones and enhance our knowledge of the microbial ecology in wastewater treatment systems 5 conclusions in this study based on large scale data analysis we showed that bacterial community structures in full and lab scale bioreactors are largely different thousands of bacterial genera specific to full and lab scale bioreactors were identified a number of genera frequently abundant in full scale reactors but rarely present in lab scale reactors were also identified moreover it was found that the co occurrence networks among bacterial genera in full scale bioreactors are significantly more complex than those in the lab scale bioreactors many bacterial correlations in full scale reactors are not found in lab scale bioreactors furthermore by using machine learning method organic matter was determined as the most importance factor in influencing microbial communities in different scale bioreactors overall our results improved our understanding of the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale wastewater bioreactors highlighted the bacteria that are difficult to cultivate in lab scale bioreactors and provided important insights into the wastewater treatment bioreactor operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14646,the activated sludge process is widely used for biological wastewater treatment due to its low cost and high efficiency although numerous lab scale bioreactor experiments have been conducted to investigate the microorganism performance and mechanisms in activated sludge understanding the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale bioreactors has remained elusive in this study we investigated the bacterial communities in 966 activated sludge samples obtained from various bioreactors including both full and lab scale ones from 95 previous studies our findings reveal significant differences in the bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors with thousands of bacterial genera exclusive to each scale we also identified 12 genera that are frequently abundant in full scale bioreactors but rarely observed in lab scale reactors by using a machine learning method organic matter and temperature were determined as the primary factors affecting microbial communities in full and lab scale bioreactors additionally transient bacterial species from other environments may also contribute to the observed bacterial community differences furthermore the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale bioreactors were verified by comparing the results of lab scale bioreactor experiments to full scale bioreactor sampling overall this study sheds light on the bacteria overlooked in lab scale studies and deepens our understanding of the differences in bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords activated sludge bacterial community wastewater treatment machine learning 1 introduction as the most popular biological wastewater treatment method activated sludge has been used for more than a century van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 microorganisms with various functions in activated sludge work together to transform and degrade a range of pollutants found in municipal and industrial wastewater studies have been conducted to understand the microbial community structure in full scale wastewater treatment plants wang et al 2012 wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2012 which have revealed a core bacterial community in activated sludge from different plants treating municipal wastewater despite the community structure of activated sludge being well characterized the detailed functions of many microorganisms are still unknown hatzenpichler et al 2020 and many bacterial species remain uncultured zhang and zhang 2022 our understanding of the functions of wastewater treatment microorganisms is merely the tip of the iceberg to improve the performance of activated sludge processes numerous lab scale bioreactor experiments have been conducted to enhance the removal efficiency of organic matter zhang et al 2018 nitrogen wang et al 2019 phosphorus xu et al 2021 and micropollutants khan et al 2019 qian et al 2021 in addition such studies have been conducted to investigate sludge bulking and foaming processes nittami and batinovic 2022 and to develop new technologies to improve the settleability of activated sludge sam et al 2022 in general the bacterial communities in the bioreactors are analyzed and the results are used to explain the pollutant removal processes and the sludge characteristics as reported in many of these studies it is well known that the bacterial communities in lab scale bioreactors are often significantly different from those in the seeding sludge which is usually taken from full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors studies have indicated that the pollutant biodegradation rate in lab scale bioreactors under controlled conditions is often less effective than that in full scale bioreactors kuppusamy et al 2016 megharaj et al 2011 which can be attributed to the differences in bacterial communities despite a considerable number of lab scale bioreactor studies have been conducted there is a lack of comprehensive analysis comparing the bacterial communities in lab scale bioreactors with those in full scale bioreactors as a result little is known about the bacteria that are easy or difficult to enrich and cultivate in lab scale bioreactors in this study we applied both bioinformatic and experimental methods to investigate the differences in bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors we systematically analyzed the 16s rrna gene sequences of 966 activated sludge samples from 297 full and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors this allowed us to identify the frequently observed bacterial genera in different scale bioreactors and to explore the relationships among different genera in addition a machine learning approach was used to investigate the environmental parameters affecting the bacterial communities in different scale bioreactors furthermore we performed lab scale experiments and collected a number of activated sludge samples from full scale wwtps to verify the analysis results overall the results improved our understanding of the differences in bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors and highlighted the bacteria that are difficult to cultivate in lab scale bioreactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection of public data to collect 16s rrna gene sequencing data generated from activated sludge in biological wastewater treatment systems we searched published studies and retrieved the sequencing data of 966 samples from the ncbi sequence read archive https www ncbi nlm nih gov sra these activated sludge samples were collected from both full scale 570 samples and lab scale bioreactors 396 samples operated under aerobic conditions the detailed wastewater treatment bioreactors information and the accession numbers of the sequencing data were shown in table s1 and table s2 respectively 2 2 experimental setup and sludge sample collection in order to verify the analysis results based on the previously published studies a lab scale continuous flow bioreactor consisting of an aeration tank and a sedimentation tank was operated in this study the seed sludge was taken from the aeration tank of a full scale wastewater treatment plant in nanjing china the bioreactor has an effective working volumes of 2 2 l a hydraulic retention time of 10 h and a sludge retention time srt of approximately 20 days the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss were kept at approximately 3000 mg l the temperature was controlled within 24 1 c and the dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained at 2 4 mg l this bioreactor was fed by synthetic wastewater glucose 200 mg l nh4 n 25 mg l po4 3 p 5 mg l nahco3 300 mg l caco3 10 mg l mgso4 20 mg l and necessary trace elements over the 80 day operation of lab scale bioreactor a total of 18 activated sludge samples were collected in addition 24 samples were taken from the aeration tanks of two full scale bioreactors treating municipal wastewater in nanjing china all activated sludge samples were fixed with ethanol and stored in 20 c refrigerator for further treatment 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing dna were extracted from the 42 activated sludge samples using the dneasy powersoil pro kit qiagen usa the quality and concentration of dna were determined by nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific usa and 1 0 agarose gel electrophoresis then the bacterial 16s rrna gene was amplified with the pcr primers 338f 5 act cct acg gga ggc agc ag 3 and 806r 5 gga cta chv ggg twt cta at 3 targeting the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene by using an abi geneamp 9700 pcr thermocycler abi ca usa the following pcr amplification cycling conditions were applied initial denaturation at 95 c for 3 min followed by 27 cycles of denaturing at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 55 c for 30 s and extension at 72 c for 45 s and a final extension step at 72 c for 10 min all samples were amplified in triplicate and the pcr products were extracted from 2 agarose gel and purified using the axyprep dna gel extraction kit axygen biosciences usa the purified amplicons were used to construct a library and sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina san diego usa with paired end settings 2 4 bioinformatics analysis all 16s rrna gene sequences were processed and analyzed by usearch v 10 0 240 edgar 2010 we used fastx truncate stripleft 25 stripright 20 to remove primer binding and filtered low quality reads with fastq maxee 1 0 after quality control all samples were then rarefied to 20 000 reads and operation taxonomic unit otu clustering was performed at a 97 identity level wu et al 2019 the representative sequence of each otu was assigned taxonomy using the sintax classifier and analyzed against midas database dueholm et al 2022 nierychlo et al 2020 specially used for sewage treatment with a confidence threshold of 0 8 each sample was processed and analyzed individually and the taxonomic assignment results at genus level were then merged for statistical analysis and visualization a few terms were defined to describe the occurrence and abundance of different bacterial genera frequently observed genera was defined as genera observed in more than 50 of all samples frequently abundant genera was defined as genera with relative abundance 0 1 in over 50 of all samples frequently observed but less abundant genera was defined as genera with relative abundance 0 02 in over 50 of all samples 2 5 machine learning with xgboost model the machine learning approach based on xgboost model was applied to differentiate activated sludge from different scale bioreactors and to investigate the impacts of different environmental factors on the bacterial communities in bioreactors cai et al 2019 the xgboost classifier was applied because of its high accuracy and applicability to datasets with many features training and evaluation of the model were performed by using the xgboost package for python besides we also trained the model with selected features and compared the model performance with different parameters n estimators and max depth both the holdout method random training set testing set 8 2 and ten fold cross validation were applied to verify that the model was not overfitted ye et al 2020 furthermore the performance of the model was evaluated by the accuracy of the classifier using the accuracy score function in scikit learn 2 6 statistical analysis and data visualization alpha diversity in different scale bioreactors was analyzed and visualized by the ggpubr package in r and the differences in species richness and simpson s diversity were compared by student s t test bray curtis distance based principal coordinates analysis pcoa and adonis analysis were performed in r with the vegan package to reveal the differences between microbial communities in different scale bioreactors the distribution of abundant genera in full and lab scale was shown in violin plots and student s t test was performed to check the significant difference between the two groups in order to explore the correlations of genera in full and lab scale bioreactors r and gephi were used for co occurrence network analysis spearman s correlation coefficient ρ 0 6 and significance p 0 01 were considered as the strong correlation and statistical significance in addition the differentially abundant genera in different scale bioreactors were identified based on welch s t test at 95 confidence intervals in stamp parks et al 2014 the feature importance of environmental factors for distinguishing bioreactor scale was analyzed by xgboost classifier based on the linear discriminant analysis lda linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 was used to determine the genera most likely to explain differences between groups separated by different chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations 3 results 3 1 bacterial community profiles in full and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors to comprehensively investigate the bacterial communities in activated sludge in both full scale and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors we conducted an analysis of 966 16s rrna gene sequencing datasets obtained from 95 studies table s1 these datasets were derived from samples collected from activated sludge in 297 bioreactors including 115 lab scale bioreactors and 182 full scale bioreactors across 29 countries and four continents table s1 fig 1 a the studies encompassed a range of treatment processes e g conventional activated sludge anoxic oxic anaerobic anoxic oxic sequencing batch reactor and oxidation ditch fig 1b and carbon sources e g municipal wastewater industrial wastewater leachate glucose and acetate given the large sample size diverse geographical sources and variety of reactor types the findings are representative of a broad range of systems based on the midas database all of the 16s rrna gene sequences were assigned to 78 phyla and 6937 genera and over 88 of the sequences were successfully classified at the genus level fig s1 suggesting our analysis covered the bacterial population information in these samples in depth alpha diversity analysis fig 1c d showed that the species richness t test p 0 001 and simpson s diversity indices t test p 0 001 of the bacterial communities in full scale bioreactors were significantly higher than those in the lab scale bioreactors indicating that full scale bioreactors were able to maintain more diverse and complex microbial communities although the main bacterial phyla observed in the full and lab scale reactors were generally similar fig s2 clustering analysis further revealed a clear distinction adonis analysis r2 0 p 0 001 between different scale bioreactor groups at both phylum and genus levels fig 1e f in addition it was found that samples from full scale bioreactors were closely related to each other while the samples from lab scale bioreactors were distributed in a more dispersed pattern suggesting that the microbial communities among different full scale bioreactors were more similar than those among the lab scale bioreactors 3 2 differences of bacterial communities between full and lab scale bioreactors in total 5689 and 6301 genera were obtained from the lab scale and full scale activated sludge samples fig 2 a of these genera 5053 were present in both types of reactors 636 were only found in the lab scale bioreactors and 1248 were only found in the full scale bioreactors of the 1248 genera specific to full scale bioreactors 47 3 77 were observed in over 3 of the full scale samples table s3 while for the 636 genera specific to the lab scale genera only 6 genera 0 94 were present in over 3 of the lab scale samples table s4 in some full scale bioreactors and lab scale bioreactors the total abundance of these specific genera can reach up to 10 and 40 respectively fig 2b and most of the genera 42 of 47 specific to full scale bioreactors are putative ones and have not been well characterized table s3 by comparing the 10 most abundant genera in lab scale and full scale bioreactors fig s2 it was found that only five genera i e dechloromonas flavobacterium haliangium thauera and zoogloea were common in addition we also investigated the frequently observed genera according to their occurrence frequency in different samples it is obvious that some genera frequently observed in bioreactors but have a low abundance besides 26 genera such as terrimonas ferruginibacter and hyphomicrobium were determined as frequently abundant relative abundance 0 1 in more than 50 of the samples in full scale bioreactors fig 2c table s5 notably nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and phosphate accumulating organisms ca accumulibacter were frequently abundant in the full scale bioreactors while only six genera were found to be frequently abundant in lab scale bioreactors fig 2c table s6 these frequently abundant genera made up 20 54 and 10 13 of the total sequences in full and lab scale bioreactors respectively fig 2d interestingly 12 of the 26 frequently abundant genera in full scale bioreactors were rarely present in lab scale bioreactors fig 2e these genera have low relative abundances 0 02 in more than half of lab scale samples table s5 and their total relative abundance in full scale bioreactors are obviously higher than that in the lab scale ones fig s3 furthermore as revealed by welch s t test analysis fig s4 many other bacteria also displayed significant differences p 0 05 in abundance between the two groups of bioreactors fig s4 also shows that the relative abundance of some genera such as zoogloea pseudomonas flavobacterium in lab scale bioreactors could be largely higher than those in the full scale bioreactors suggesting these bacteria tend to proliferate under the conditions of lab scale cultivation 3 3 co occurrence network of bacterial genera in different scale bioreactors to investigate the potential relationships among the bacteria in different types of reactors co occurrence network analysis was performed fig 3 for lab scale bioreactors strong and significant positive correlations spearman s ρ 0 6 p 0 01 among frequently observed genera are obviously less than those in full scale bioreactors the larger number of correlations among bacterial genera in full scale bioreactors indicate that complex interactions may exist in the full scale bioreactors however these interactions may not be preserved when these bacteria are cultivated in the lab scale bioreactors the co occurrence networks also show that the correlation relationships among bacterial genera are irrelevant to the relative abundance and occurrence frequency in full scale bioreactors fig 3a genera with different relative abundance and occurrence may collaborate with each other to achieve the pollutant degradation in full scale bioreactors interestingly dechloromonas and sulfuritalea were not only frequently abundant in full scale bioreactors but also correlated with many other genera including many putative genera indicating that they may play important roles in the wastewater treatment process moreover it was also noticed that members of sulfuritalea are rarely present in lab scale bioreactors in addition the frequently abundant genera terrimonas and ferruginibacter have strong correlation relationship in lab scale bioreactors fig 3c while this relationship was not observed in full scale bioreactors according to the taxonomic information the co occurrence networks revealed that the bacterial genera affiliated with proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidota accounted for the majority of the nodes fig 3b d likely due to the dominance of these three phyla in the activated sludge samples most genera in networks of full and lab scale bioreactors fig 3b d were correlated with genera in the same phyla and the phylum level patterns were obvious the full scale bioreactor networks had higher modularity indices of 0 604 suggesting that the nodes tended to cluster together and form obvious modular structures the two largest modules have 23 and 15 genera and the majority of their nodes belong to bacteroidota and firmicutes respectively 3 4 factors affecting the bacterial community differences in order to reveal the factors leading to the different bacterial communities between full and lab scale activated sludge samples a machine learning approach xgboost was used to analyze the relationships between environmental operational factors and the bacterial communities fig 4 to ensure the model s application the missing values of the environmental factors fig s5 were filled with the median sheng et al 2012 despite the missing values we successfully distinguished the scale of the bioreactors with environmental and operational factors by using xgboost classifier accuracy 94 33 feature importance analysis showed that cod and temperature were the two most important factors in distinguishing the bioreactors scale fig 4a additionally we observed significant differences p 0 001 in cod concentration and temperature values between lab scale bioreactors and full scale bioreactors fig s6a b to address the potential influence of these differences we selected activated sludge samples associated with typical cod 100 500 mg l and temperature 20 30 c and compared their bacterial communities however despite selecting samples with similar cod and temperature values differences in microbial community composition still persisted fig s6c this indicated that other environmental and operational factors may also significantly impact the bacterial communities to further explore the influence of organic matter concentration on bacterial community structure we divided the bioreactors into three types according to the organic matter concentrations of the influent i e high middle and low then lefse was applied to determine the bacteria with significantly different relative abundances among the three groups of bioreactors fig 4b c eventually 33 differentially abundant taxonomic clades lda score 3 5 were identified and the lda scores of distinct taxa were presented in table s7 according to the lefse results the high level organic matter group had 8 distinctive taxa and except members in corynebacteriales all other taxa are affiliated with proteobacteria for the middle level group 12 taxa affiliated with chloroflexi acidobacteriota verrucomicrobiota bacteroidota and myxococcia were identified it was noticed that most of the distinctive taxa were also frequently abundant genera in the full scale bioreactors as shown in fig 4c and table s5 the relative abundances of terrimonas in bioreactors fed with middle level organic matter were higher than those in the other two groups the relative abundance of dechloromonas haliangium sulfuritalea and midas g 17 in bioreactors fed with low level organic matter were higher than those in the other two groups while zoogloea in the high level group was observed to have higher relative abundances than those in the bioreactors fed with lower concentrations of organic matter 3 5 experimental verification in order to valid the data analysis results based on the public data we collected activated sludge samples from two full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors and operated a lab scale aerobic bioreactor to investigate the bacterial community by comparing the microbial community structures of 18 lab scale and 24 full scale activated sludge samples it was found that the bacterial community in the full scale bioreactors significantly differed from that in the lab scale bioreactors fig 5 a adions r2 0 5 p 0 001 which was consistent with the results obtained from public data analysis of the 156 genera frequently observed in full scale bioreactors 152 still were frequently observed in our full scale bioreactor samples fig 5b as for the 51 frequently observed genera in lab scale bioreactors identified in public data 40 were frequently observed in our lab scale bioreactor samples fig 5b the relative abundance of these genera in accounted for 52 25 and 19 51 in full and lab scale activated sludge samples respectively fig 5c in addition based on the public data analysis we identified 26 frequently abundant genera in full scale bioreactors fig 2d among them 23 genera were still frequently abundant in our full scale samples fig 5d the relative abundance of these made up 22 04 of total sequences fig 5d through analyzing the genera frequently abundant in full scale bioreactors but rarely present in lab scale bioreactors in our experimental lab scale bioreactor samples we confirmed that the genera with relatively high abundance in full scale bioreactors were less abundant in laboratory fig 5e moreover along with the reactor operation the relative abundance of these genera decreased from 2 30 to around 1 in a few days and then decreased gradually and after 73 days of lab scale bioreactor operation their abundance approached zero given the long srt about 20 days of the lab scale bioreactor the washout effect on bacterial species would be minimal and the increase and decline in their total relative abundance is mainly caused by the operational conditions of the bioreactor 4 discussion in this study we conducted a large scale data analysis and demonstrated that the bacterial community structures in full scale wastewater treatment bioreactors are significantly different from those in lab scale reactors with the latter having a relatively lower complexity this is mainly because full scale wastewater treatment plants typically have more complicated wastewater composition and special operating conditions as demonstrated by this study and some previous works che et al 2021 guo et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 organic matters level is one of the major factors influencing bacterial community structures in addition full scale bioreactors are also affected by various conditions such as rainfall temperature fluctuation bacteria immigration via influent these factors may also lead to the bacterial community differences moreover our results showed that the full scale bioreactors have more uniform and consistent bacterial communities with more frequently abundant genera than lab scale bioreactors which may be due to the similar wastewater composition and wastewater treatment processes across different wastewater treatment plants cao et al 2020 while for different lab scale bioreactors the wastewater composition and operation conditions usually significantly differed the bacterial compositions at the phylum level in the full and lab scale reactors were found to be relatively similar with proteobacteria and bacteroidetes being the dominant phyla which was consistent with previous studies wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 however at the genus level 1248 genera were found only present in the full scale bioreactors this implies that many bacterial species are difficult to cultivate in the lab scale bioreactors moreover 46 of the frequently abundant genera in full scale bioreactors were rarely present in lab scale bioreactors suggesting that the selection pressure of the lab scale bioreactors could significantly alter the bacterial community structures and the dominant bacteria in the full scale bioreactors may not be enriched in the lab scale bioreactors it was noticed that most of the bacteria specific to the full scale bioreactors are annotated as putative genera and have not been isolated as pure culture this is consistent with the previous report that a large number of bacterial species in full scale activated sludge resist cultivation zhang and zhang 2022 the mechanisms behind the cultivation resistance could be due to the hidden traits of these bacteria and require further investigation especially using genetic and transcriptional information zhang et al 2019 some known bacteria specific to the full scale bioreactors are extremophile for example frigoribacterium species optimally grow in dust and soil at low temperatures 2 to 10 c kämpfer et al 2000 and gallionella species are abundantly present in sediment at ph 4 4 fabisch et al 2013 these bacteria might be transient species and they enter the full scale wastewater system accidentally from soil sediments or other environments surprisingly it was also found that a considerable number of bacterial genera were only present in lab scale reactors to the best of our knowledge this was not reported in previous studies these bacteria may be from either synthetic wastewater or laboratory environments and the functions and metabolic mechanisms of these bacteria need to be further investigated as this will determine the practical significance of lab scale experiments co occurrence analysis revealed that some genera not only frequently abundant in different full scale bioreactors but also were strongly correlated with many other genera indicating that they could be keystone genera in these bioreactors wu et al 2022 and may play important roles in maintaining the functions of the bacterial community sulfuritalea and dechloromonas were identified as such keystone genera in full scale bioreactors they are involved in denitrification carosia et al 2014 mcilroy et al 2016 organic matter degradation processes begmatov et al 2022 and can tolerate salt or alkaline stress conditions fudou et al 2002 han et al 2019 which can be beneficial for resisting shock loading in full scale bioreactors moreover their participation in c and n metabolism such as generating nitrous oxide may also affect the global cycle of carbon and nitrogen chen et al 2020 however the abundance of sulfuritalea in lab scale bioreactors was usually relatively low table s5 likely due to significant community changes in the lab scale bioreactors operated under high selection pressure the keystone genera linked to many genera rarely present in the lab scale reactors such as ca accumulibacter midas g 17 midas g 558 ca obscuribacter midas g 4871 and midas g 283 most of which are putative genera and have not been well characterized these genera may also play significant roles in the wastewater treatment systems and their low abundance in lab scale bioreactors could impact the applicability of experimental results to full scale bioreactors therefore it would be valuable to further investigate these genera in future studies machine learning methods have been used to analyze the relationships between environmental parameters and microbial community structures in many previous studies wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 in this study based on feature importance analysis of the machine learning it was found that organic matter and temperature are the two most important factors affecting the bacterial community structure which is consistent with several previous studies sun et al 2022 wu et al 2019 the influence of organic matter on bacterial community structure is well known wen et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 and the impact of temperature on bacterial community is also significant lapara et al 2001 nadarajah et al 2007 lab scale bioreactors often maintain a relatively constant temperature in indoor environment which may differ from the natural temperature in full scale bioreactors additionally it should be noted that other parameters such as ph and salinity may also significantly affect the bacterial community he et al 2017 maspolim et al 2015 however since both full scale and lab scale reactors were usually not operated under extreme levels of these parameters they were not identified as the most important ones during the application of machine learning method lefse analysis further revealed that the relative abundance of some bacterial genera in bioreactors fed with wastewater containing different levels of organic matter were significantly different the results table s7 were generally consistent with previous studies for example dokdonella species were often found in soil with low concentrations of organic matter yoo et al 2009 yoon et al 2006 while most zoogloea species were observed in activated sludge bioreactors under high organic loadings an et al 2016 shao et al 2009 in general we demonstrated that some bacteria rarely cultivated in lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors can be identified by analyzing a large number of previously published data and performing experimental verification furthermore the variety of bacterial communities in different scale bioreactors was confirmed by the clustering analysis it is possible that the rarely cultivated bacteria abundant in some specific lab scale bioreactors were not included in the samples of this study this indicates that these bacteria may be hard to cultivate and require special conditions and configurations to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to comprehensively compare the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale wastewater treatment bioreactors however there are still limitations in this study including the lack of investigation on bacterial community fluctuations over time in bioreactors and the incomplete understanding of the functions of bacteria that are abundant in full and lab scale bioreactors therefore further studies are needed to address these knowledge gaps we hope that our findings will inspire further research on the bacteria with different abundances in these two types of reactors especially those rarely cultivated in lab scale ones and enhance our knowledge of the microbial ecology in wastewater treatment systems 5 conclusions in this study based on large scale data analysis we showed that bacterial community structures in full and lab scale bioreactors are largely different thousands of bacterial genera specific to full and lab scale bioreactors were identified a number of genera frequently abundant in full scale reactors but rarely present in lab scale reactors were also identified moreover it was found that the co occurrence networks among bacterial genera in full scale bioreactors are significantly more complex than those in the lab scale bioreactors many bacterial correlations in full scale reactors are not found in lab scale bioreactors furthermore by using machine learning method organic matter was determined as the most importance factor in influencing microbial communities in different scale bioreactors overall our results improved our understanding of the bacterial community differences between full and lab scale wastewater bioreactors highlighted the bacteria that are difficult to cultivate in lab scale bioreactors and provided important insights into the wastewater treatment bioreactor operation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14647,primary treatment of municipal wastewater by rotating belt filtration followed by hydrolysis and acidogenic fermentation of the filter primary sludge fps at ambient temperature was studied at pilot scale during one year the seasonal variations of volatile fatty acids vfas nutrient release and soluble cod production as well as microbial community assembly were assessed leading to novel findings for fermentation at ambient temperature the reproducibility of vfa production performance was first established by operating the two fermentation reactors under the same conditions showing similar results regarding vfa production and microbial community structure one year of operation at 5 d retention time rt and 16 29 c resulted in an average vfa yield of 180 35 mg cod g vsin and soluble cod yield of 242 40 mg cod g vsin the vfa formation was temperature dependent with θ 1 033 0 005 r r 20 θ t 20 c the seasonal variations of the acetic and propionic acid productions were pronounced whereas the productions of vfas with longer chains were more stable regardless of temperature the community structure of the reactor microbiomes was also clearly affected by season and temperature and linked with the production spectrum of vfas the ammonium and phosphate releases were stable during the year leading to a decrease in ratios of soluble cod to nh4 n and po4 3 p during winter the soluble cod yield was 11 and 27 higher at 5 d rt compared to 3 and 2 d rt respectively but the corresponding volumetric productivities were lower the dissimilarities between microbiomes in influent fps and fermenters were significant even at a short rt of 2 d and increased with longer rt of 3 and 5 d primarily caused by selection of bacteria within bacteroidota in the fermentation reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rotating belt filter primary sludge fermentation hydrolysis carbon source volatile fatty acids 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment requires a sufficient amount of readily biodegradable carbon for denitrification and excess phosphate uptake in biological nutrient removal bnr to meet the effluent demands for nitrogen and phosphorus volke et al 2020 numerous studies have focused on production and use of volatile fatty acids vfas also known as short chain fatty acids as carbon sources for bnr atasoy et al 2018 lee et al 2014 biologically produced vfas are suitable carbon sources for both denitrification and biological phosphorus removal elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 settler primary sludge sps and waste activated sludge are often available at wastewater treatment plants wwtps as potential substrates for hydrolysis and fermentation to vfas and have been used for this purpose andreasen et al 1997 bouzas et al 2002 pitman et al 1992 wang et al 2020 one possibility to increase the amount of biodegradable carbon for bnr is in line acidogenic fermentation of sps in the primary settlers banister and pretorius 1998 ekholm et al 2022 hey et al 2012 tykesson et al 2005 which is relatively easy to implement but sensitive to variations of wastewater flow side stream fermentation of sps where the sludge is fermented in a separate reactor and recycled to a primary settler is more flexible compared to an in line process as it allows for controlled dosing of carbon source to the main stream but it may cause deteriorated settling properties and odor banister and pretorius 1998 filtration as primary treatment of wastewater results in smaller footprint and potentially higher removal of total suspended solids tss compared to primary settlers väänänen et al 2016 the sludge that is separated in primary filtration has been denoted primary sludge christensen et al 2022 rotating belt filter rbf biosolids bahreini et al 2021 fine sieved fraction ghasimi et al 2016 or cellulosic primary sludge conca et al 2020 but we propose the generic term filter primary sludge fps fps from an rbf has a total solids ts concentration of 4 10 without integrated dewatering rusten et al 2017 which is considerably higher compared to the ts in both sps 1 0 3 4 and waste activated sludge 0 6 1 2 ucisik and henze 2008 hence it is reasonable to expect a high volumetric vfa production with use of fps for fermentation fermentation of fps and sps originating from the same wastewater has resulted in similar vfa yields brison et al 2022 suggesting comparable biodegradability of the two substrates polymer addition to the wastewater prior to filtration chemically enhanced filtration has been observed to increase the tss removal and the fps methane potential rusten et al 2017 but has not been applied in previously published studies of fps fermentation bahreini et al 2021 2020a da ros et al 2020 leaving a knowledge gap concerning the potentials of this substrate fermentation of sps has occasionally been studied at lower temperatures below 25 c dauknys et al 2019 ferreiro and soto 2003 skalsky and daigger 1995 full scale fermentation of sps as an inline process at wwtps has also been applied at ambient temperature in the nordic countries andreasen et al 1997 ekholm et al 2022 tykesson et al 2005 however the link between temperature and fermentation yield has not been thoroughly addressed the production rate has been shown to be lower for fps fermentation below 35 c bahreini et al 2020b but fermentation at ambient temperature has the advantage of lower energy requirement therefore the seasonal variations in fermentation of sludge are of practical as well as academic interest acidogenic bacteria can be found in raw sps even without an intentional fermentation process lin and li 2018 maspolim et al 2015 consequently batch tests with fermentation have been conducted successfully without inoculum both with sps miron et al 2000 and with fps from rbf crutchik et al 2018 da ros et al 2020 the vfa production could however be increased by using fermented sludge as inoculum in batch tests with sps banister and pretorius 1998 which implies that hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria were enriched in fermentation reactors both the product spectrum and microbial community structure were found to be comparable in fermentation of sps and fps indicating that the composition of sps and fps consisting mainly of polysaccharides selected for similar communities brison et al 2022 bacteria within firmicutes and bacteroidota that are capable of fermenting were found in the sludge from iron enhanced primary sedimentation and multiplied during mesophilic semi continuous fermentation lin and li 2018 temperature ranging from 25 to 55 c has been shown to have a profound impact on microbial community composition and can be linked to production of specific vfas huang et al 2021 furthermore the microbial community of fps anaerobic digestion for methane production has been investigated at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions ghasimi et al 2015 but the community assembly in fps fermentation at ambient temperature is yet to be mapped out in this study we propose a pre treatment method for municipal wastewater comprising chemically enhanced prefiltration with rbf and acidogenic fermentation of fps at ambient temperature a pilot plant with an rbf and two fermentation reactors was operated for one year with the aim to evaluate the seasonal variations in the fermentation of fps at ambient temperature as well as the effects of different retention times rts the corresponding microbial communities were characterised in the influent sludge and in the acidogenic fermentation 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater pre treatment the pilot plant fig s1 was situated at källby municipal wwtp in lund sweden which has a load of 90 000 population equivalents and a low industrial load wastewater screened through 6 mm was pumped into the pilot plant flow proportionally to the wwtp flow but with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 18 m3 h during the year of operation in this study july 2020 to july 2021 the average flow was 11 3 m3 h with tss 242 64 mg l cod 528 111 mg l total nitrogen 55 7 9 6 and total phosphorus 6 7 1 3 the inlet tank contained online measurement of tss visolid wtw to enable online control for polymer addition a cationic polymer solution of 0 1 0 2 superfloc 6260 kemira kemi ab was added in the pipe to the first of two mixed flocculation tanks 0 8 m3 each the polymer was dosed at 1 1 2 0 g m3 with additional 5 7 g g tss resulting in a total average polymer dose of 3 2 g m3 the particular polymer was chosen since it produced high strength flocs the total flocculation hydraulic rt hrt was 9 3 min the rbf sf1000 salsnes filter was operated with a fixed setpoint for water level at 210 mm july april and 240 mm april july with a filter cloth pore size of 350 µm the integrated dewatering device was excluded since the ts of the fps was otherwise too high to be pumped removal of tss and cod in the rbf was 64 10 and 44 9 respectively 2 2 sludge treatment and sampling the influent sludge tank had a variable working volume of 0 15 0 38 m3 and rt of 0 3 0 1 d the two fermentation reactors were placed outdoors both insulated and mixed at 70 rpm with a working volume of 1 5 m3 each the steel pipes for sludge were equipped with heat tracing and insulation to avoid freezing during winter influent and effluent pumping was automatically controlled at 4 6 times d for each reactor and the pumping volume was set to achieve the desired rt during the first operational setting the verification period both reactors had a set rt of 5 d table 1 which resulted in rts of 4 9 0 4 and 5 0 0 5 d in r1 and r2 respectively the rt in the first reactor r1 was kept at 5 0 0 6 d during a whole year to assess the seasonal variations whereas the second reactor r2 was set to first 3 d 3 2 0 7 d and then 2 d 2 2 0 1 d during the assessment of different rts the effluent sludge was pumped to the pilot plant outlet during the time of this study and therefore not recycled to the wastewater grab samples of sludge were taken twice week on alternating weekdays from the lower part of the reactors and from the influent sludge tank temperatures were measured instantaneously on site during a period in december 2020 the fermentation reactors were heated unintentionally and the temperatures were thus not ambient in february 2021 the pipes were frozen during two weeks despite heat tracing and insulation both these periods are excluded in the results data was also excluded if there was a deviation of rt due to error in pumping or flow measurement 2 3 chemical analyses ts and volatile solids vs were analysed after 24 h at 105 c and after 2 h at 550 c cod and ammonium nitrogen were measured with spectrophotometric cuvettes hach lck114 and lck304 samples for analysis of soluble cod and specific vfas were first centrifuged 5000 rpm 5 min and subsequently filtered through glass fiber filters with pore size 20 µm munktell mga no 110 116 and 0 45 µm syringe filters sartorious minisart rc 25 for ph measurements a ph electrode was used metrohm xylem samples for analysis of ammonium nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus were first filtered through 1 6 µm glass fiber filters whatman no 1820 055 phosphate phosphorus and total phosphorus were analysed in 20 ml samples with spectrophotometry perkinelmer lambda 35 after acidification with 4 m h2so4 kjeldahl nitrogen in sludge samples was measured according to ss en 16 169 2012 with analyser unit kjeltec 8420 and compass software 2 2 foss analytics vfas were measured both as acetic acid equivalents hac eq with 5 point titration according to ibrahim et al 2014 and as separate acids with either gas chromatography gc or high performance liquid chromatography hplc the 5 point titration also provided values of total alkalinity for the measurement of specific vfas with gc or hplc the same standard solution volatile free acid mix merck was used for calibration samples for vfa analysis 900 µl were conserved with 100 µl 10 w w phosphoric acid the gc agilent 6850 was equipped with a 30 m 0 53 mm 1 µm column 19095f 123e agilent nitrogen gas was used as carrier while hydrogen gas was added for flame ionization the temperature was raised from 80 c to 120 c at a rate of 20 c min thereafter from 120 c to 130 c at a rate of 6 13 c min whereafter the temperature was kept constant at 130 c for 5 min injection temperature was 180 c and detector temperature 260 c injection volume was 1 µl the hplc 1269 infinity ii quaternary system agilent was operated at 60 c during 60 min with a flow of 0 7 ml h through the column infinitylab poroshell 120 ec c18 for each sample 20 µl was injected and the variable wavelength detector signal at 210 nm was used for quantification with openlab agilent phosphoric acid 0 1 w w was used as carrier solution batch tests for measurement of denitrification rate was conducted with influent and filtered wastewater as well as filtered wastewater with added fermentate according to the procedure described in the supplementary material 2 4 microbial community analysis biweekly samples of the influent sludge to the reactors r1 and r2 over the entire operational period starting from june 2020 in total 98 samples were subjected to amplicon sequencing experimental procedures are described in detail in the supplementary material in brief dna was extracted and the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr after purification quality control and measurement of dna concentrations the pooled pcr products were sequenced on a miseq illumina processing of the obtained raw sequence reads and generation of count tables with amplicon sequence variants asvs were carried out using dada2 v1 16 callahan et al 2016 and vsearch rognes et al 2016 in parallel a consensus count table from the two pipelines were generated using qdiv modin et al 2020 taxonomy was assigned with sintax edgar 2016 using the midas 4 8 1 database dueholm et al 2022 the bioinformatics and diversity calculations were carried out in qdiv modin et al 2020 the dataset was rarefied by subsampling each sample to 35 957 reads alpha and beta diversity was calculated using the hill number framework see the supplementary material for details dissimilarities between samples were visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa to determine the dissimilarity caused by compositional turnover between samples and assess the roles of deterministic and stochastic factors for microbial community assembly the raup crick null model chase et al 2011 raup and crick 1979 was used adapted for hill based dissimilarities in qdiv modin et al 2020 redundancy analysis rda of the top 25 genera in r1 having constant rt and selected environmental data was carried out in the r package vegan v2 6 4 oksanen et al 2022 using the rda function after doing a hellinger transformation of the community abundances using the decostand function for more details on bioinformatics see the supplementary material raw sequence reads are deposited at the sequence read archive ncbi bioproject prjna945084 2 5 calculations given its 0 3 d average rt the influent sludge tank was considered as part of the total process volume the soluble cod and vfa yields y were thus calculated based on the difference between reactor concentrations and influent wastewater concentrations as the influent wastewater concentrations were negligible compared to the reactor concentrations the yields were calculated according to eq 1 where vsin is the mean value of influent vs during a period of two weeks 1 y r e a c t o r v s i n in models for bnr all conversion rates can be multiplied by a temperature dependency factor often in the form of eq 2 where r is the reaction rate and t is the temperature in c rieger et al 2013 since the rt was kept constant eq 2 could be simplified to eq 3 where the y is the observed yield during the experimental period and y20 is the observed yield at 20 c the fitting of the temperature dependency constant θ was carried out in origin originlab using levenberg marquardt iteration 2 r r 20 θ t 20 c 3 y y 20 θ t 20 c two sided student t test conducted for paired data as well as the calculations of standard deviations were made in excel 2019 microsoft 3 results 3 1 acidogenic fermentation was highly reproducible filtration of municipal wastewater with rbf resulted in a sludge with 4 5 0 6 ts and 87 5 4 4 vs of ts with an average concentration of 57 200 13 400 mg cod l table 2 the two reactors r1 and r2 for acidogenic fermentation of fps were first operated as duplicates with the same rt of 5 d with similar results the vfa concentrations were 8 070 1 360 and 8 060 1 420 mg cod l in r1 and r2 respectively fig 1 likewise the mean vfa distributions were very similar in both reactors 27 1 acetic acid hac 42 2 propionic acid hpr 3 0 isovaleric acid iso hbu 14 1 butyric acid hbu 5 1 iso valeric acid iso hval 9 1 valeric acid hval expressed as of vfa cod n 14 for each reactor the difference in mean values for 13 process parameters were 0 4 4 5 between the reactors for 10 parameters no differences were observed p 0 05 while significant deviations were found for three parameters with minor differences sm table s1 3 2 considerable seasonal variations in fermentation at ambient temperature the temperature ranged from 16 to 29 c during one year of operation of r1 at the rt of 5 d the observed soluble cod yield was 242 40 mg cod g vsin of which vfas constituted 180 35 mg cod g vsin corresponding to 108 16 mg hac eq g vsin eq 1 table 2 a clear seasonal dependency can be seen for soluble cod and vfa concentrations fig s2a and observed vfa yield fig 2 a with a peak in september and minimum in march the vfa yield deviated however from the temperature curve during january and may june fig 2a curve fitting of the observed vfa cod yield versus the temperature eq 3 fig 2b rendered a yield at 20 c y20 of 172 4 mg cod g vsin and θ of 1 033 0 005 r2 0 55 measurements of vfa with titration which were carried out in parallel and at higher frequency gave a y20 of 103 mg hac eq g vsin and a slightly lower value for θ of 1 029 0 004 at r2 0 56 fig s2b the temperature dependencies of ammonium and phosphate were weak due to the strong temperature dependence for the vfa formation the ratios of soluble cod to nutrients were higher during summer than during winter fig 3 the soluble cod to nh4 n ratio was ranging from 17 to 20 g cod g nh4 n during winter to 20 30 g cod g nh4 n during summer a similar temperature effect was observed for the soluble cod to po4 3 ratio which was 20 25 g cod g po4 3 p during winter and rose to 30 45 g cod g po4 3 p during summer the maximum denitrification rate for filtered wastewater was increased from 6 3 to 9 0 mg no3 n eq g vss h with addition of fermentate fig s4 hpr was the dominating vfa on cod basis followed by hac and they both displayed a clear seasonal variation fig 4 a b the yields of hbu iso hbu hval and iso hval were more stable throughout the year fig 4a b the temperature correlations for the observed yields of hac and hpr were y20 42 1 θ 1 042 0 007 r2 0 48 and y20 63 2 θ 1 054 0 007 r2 0 59 respectively fig 4b consequently the fraction of hpr increased with higher temperature fig s3 furthermore the fraction of hbu was unusually high in march after the period of operational problems fig s3 3 3 both carbon source production and quality were affected by retention time rt during march june when the two reactors r1 and r2 were operated at different rts temperatures in both reactors were rising from 16 to 28 c there was a statistically significant difference of 11 in the observed soluble cod yield already during period 1 from march to mid may when r1 was operated at 5 d rt and r2 at 3 d rt with 258 43 and 230 27 mg cod g vsin in r1 and r2 respectively table 3 the volumetric scod production was on the other hand 50 lower at the longer rt 2 000 200 compared to 3 000 200 g scod m3 d in r1 and r2 respectively when the rt was lowered to 2 d in r2 during period 2 from mid may to mid june the difference in scod yield increased to 27 with 263 36 and 191 33 mg cod g vsin in r1 and r2 respectively the volumetric scod production was 78 lower in r1 than r2 1 800 200 compared to 3 300 400 g cod m3 d table 3 meanwhile the observed hac eq yield was less affected by rt than the volumetric scod production 34 lower at 3 d rt and 48 lower at 2 d rt compared to 5 d rt the ratios of scod to nh4 n table 3 were similar during the first period which suggests that the fraction of soluble cod derived from hydrolysis of proteins were comparable at rt of 5 and 3 d 25 g scod g nh4 n during period 2 the difference was minor resulting in ratios of 26 2 and 23 3 g cod g nh4 n in r1 and r2 respectively the ratios of soluble cod to po4 3 p table 3 displayed a small but statistically significant difference during the first period with 70 13 and 64 14 g cod g po4 3 p in r1 and r2 the difference grew during period 2 with 77 4 and 65 6 g cod g po4 3 p 3 4 the microbiomes in the fermentation reactors were distinctly different from the influent filter primary sludge the diversity within samples alpha diversity was lower in the reactor microbiomes than in the reactor influent fps p 0 001 considering both species richness number of asvs 0d and when taking the relative abundance of asvs into account 1d fig s5 when comparing the microbial community structure between the reactor and the influent fps microbiomes beta diversity as pairwise dissimilarities over 13 months of operation fig 5 a it was clear that the reactors harboured microorganisms with a community structure distinctly different from the influent fps it was also evident that the two reactors when operated at the same rt had similar microbiomes fig 5b which is in line with the similar vfa production from the two reactors during this period fig 1 the patterns of a clear separation of the microbiomes in reactors and influent as well as the minor differences between the replicate reactors was confirmed by pcoa ordination fig s6 when decreasing the rt to 3 and 2 d of r2 while keeping it at 5 d in r1 differences between microbiomes in the two reactors increased fig 5b as did the yield of vfa table 3 the null model analysis showed that the microbial community composition in the reactors were more dissimilar to the influent sludge than could be explained by chance fig 5c the analysis also showed that the composition in the parallel reactors were more similar to each other than could be expected by chance especially when operated at the same rt of five days during the verification period but even at shorter rt the microbiomes in r2 were distinctly different from the influent fig 5c 3 5 bacteria within bacteroidota were highly enriched in the reactors seven phyla had an average relative abundance exceeding 1 in either the reactors or the influent fps in the influent firmicutes and proteobacteria were the largest phyla accounting for 36 and 34 of the microbiomes with smaller contributions of bacteroidota 13 actinobacteriota 5 3 and camplylobacteriota 5 0 fig s7 in the reactors bacteria within bacteroidota were clearly enriched with relative abundances of 47 and 44 in r1 and r2 respectively at the expense of bacteria within the other phyla especially bacteria within proteobacteria had profoundly lower relative abundances of 14 in r1 and 15 in r2 within bacteroidota a number of genera were enriched in the reactors for instance prevotella prevotella 9 and the midas genera 47 113 and 51 577 within prevotellaceae dueholm et al 2022 as well as u29 b03 within rikenellaceae fig 6 the reactor conditions explained 68 of the variation of the abundant genera in the r1 microbiome as revealed by rda fig s8 among the genera within prevotellaceae and rikenellaceae various associations with reactor conditions were observed with prevotella 9 correlating with the concentrations of hbu u29 b03 with iso hbu and midas genus 47 113 and prevotellaceae sv5557 with hac 3 6 changes over time in community structure over time the microbiomes changed at similar rates of about 0 01 d 1 suggesting a rather stable succession in the reactors as well as the influent fps fig s9 however a few peaks in rate of change were observed for instance around february 2021 when the temperature fluctuated considerably and feeding of sludge to the reactors was temporarily halted community dissimilarity at various time gaps fig 7 indicated seasonal patterns with a maximum dissimilarity at 5 r1 and 6 months fps time gap and a secondary minimum at 10 r1 and 12 months fps 4 discussion 4 1 carbon source production the results in this study support the reproducibility of fps fermentation with similar microbial community structure in the two pilot scale reactors producing vfa and other chemical components in an equal manner figs 1 5 table s1 a few operational disturbances such as failure of pumps and unintentional heating did not have any long term effects on the microbial community structure and process performance suggesting process robustness reproducibility of duplicate lab scale reactors with influent from the same batch of primary sludge was observed already by eastman and fergusson 1981 reproducibility at pilot scale with its larger variation in environmental conditions as shown in this study is promising for application in full scale the soluble cod yield of 242 40 mg cod g vsin during one year at 5 3 d rt at 16 29 c including the sludge tank is comparable to the yield of 267 mg cod g vs during fermentation at 25 c and 4 d rt bahreini et al 2020b furthermore the vfa yield of 180 35 mg cod g vs is comparable to 154 mg cod g vs from fps at 6 d rt and 37 c da ros et al 2020 and 162 13 mg cod g vs for fermentation at 4 d rt and 37 c crutchik et al 2018 although the temperature was varying and lower in this study in conclusion the fps substrate and fermentation conditions at ambient temperature in this study resulted in similar yields compared with previous findings the rt had clear effect on the soluble cod and vfa with considerably higher yields at 5 days than 2 or 3 days table 3 this supports previous findings of soluble cod production from fps that increased from 173 to 267 mg cod g vs when increasing rt from 2 to 4 d at 25 c bahreini et al 2020b since an rt of 5 d produced a fermentate with higher vfa po4 3 p compared to at shorter rt longer rt would be more favourable for application of the fermentate as carbon source for enhanced biological phosphorus removal 4 2 seasonal variations the seasonal variation in temperature 16 29 c had profound effect on the production of vfa fig 4 accordingly the community dissimilarity as a function of time gap fig 7 indicated that the microbial community in the fermenters also varied seasonally the temperature dependency constant for vfa production was θ 1 033 the only previous fps study found at this point for comparable temperatures of 25 and 35 c bahreini et al 2020b report vfa yields that can be used to calculate temperature dependency of θ 1 04 at an rt of 4 d although the studies are not directly comparable the similar θ values between the studies suggest a general response of acidogenic fermentation of fps sludge to temperature variation among the vfa components the production of hac and hpr was higher during the warmer months while the production of the other vfas was rather stable over the year hac and hpr have been shown to be the major products from fermentation of both sps and fps brison et al 2022 huang et al 2021 but the results of temperature impact on the vfa distribution in previous studies have not been consistent increasing temperature during fermentation of sps has shown profound impact on the fractions of produced hac and hpr but in various directions while the fraction of larger vfas have been either rather unaffected or increased at increasing temperatures cokgor et al 2009 ferreiro and soto 2003 huang et al 2021 the vfa composition is worth considering since hac and hbu have been found to be preferred substrates to hpr for denitrifying bacteria elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 meaning that the fermentate in this case might be a more appealing substrate for denitrification when it is produced at lower fermentation temperature although the soluble cod to ammonium ratio was lower during winter 17 20 g cod g nh4 n it was still high compared to the theoretical requirement of 3 74 g cod g n for denitrification with hac chiu and chung 2003 hpr is on the other hand an attractive substrate for ebpr moser engeler et al 1998 the stable concentrations of ammonium and phosphate implies that the degradation of proteins was rather unchanged and that degradation of carbohydrates was responsible for the seasonal variation of vfa production degradation of fat is inhibited during acidic conditions since methanogenic bacteria are needed for uptake of hydrogen in order to create a thermodynamically favourable environment for lipid conversion van lier et al 2020 vfas with longer chains can be produced from proteins via the stickland reaction ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 the stable concentrations of both ammonium and phosphate over time is consequently in line with the lack of seasonal variation for hbu iso hbu hval and iso hval fermentation of sucrose with both hac and hpr as products is more favourable energetically compared to fermentation to only hbu or hac van lier et al 2020 which is presumably the reason for the production of these two vfas as the dominant pathway exhibiting the same temporal trend at a full scale plant the practical and economic advantages of operating a process at ambient temperature can be weighty despite the lower reaction rate this study brings new and useful insights to the seasonal variations of fermentation at ambient and transient temperature which are likely similar to the existing fermentation of sps running at numerous wwtps since the cellulose content is higher in fps compared to sps ahmed et al 2019 the seasonal variation in the production of hac and hpr is likely to be less pronounced but may occur also in full scale fermentation of sps 4 3 microbial community structure the observed separation in microbial community structure between the influent fps and the reactor biomass fig 5a fig s6 was caused by both differences in species richness fig s1 and compositional differences species turnover as revealed by the null models chase et al 2011 modin et al 2020 the null model results fig 5c furthermore suggests that deterministic forces such as reactor conditions and species interactions were vital for shaping the reactor microbiomes and that stochastic immigration birth and death were of limited importance chase and myers 2011 zhou 2017 in various wastewater treatment reactors and anaerobic digestors deterministic forces have been assigned important roles for shaping the microbiomes ali et al 2019 de celis et al 2022 liébana et al 2019 vanwonterghem et al 2014 however the investigated reactors have been operated at considerably longer retention times which promotes deterministic species selection ali et al 2019 our results indicate that even a few days of rt would suffice for deterministic selection of reactor microbiomes at least for fermentation reactors the results also put the many findings in fermentation reactors of different microbial communities at various environmental conditions e g brison et al 2022 maspolim et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 in context in the reactor microbiomes bacteria within bacteroidota were enriched while proteobacteria were strongly reduced in abundance fig 7 s7 it has been suggested that proteobacteria generally harbours bacteria with low activity at anaerobic conditions why their presence in fermentation reactors is mainly a factor of immigration rather than growth brison et al 2022 mei et al 2016 which fits well with the observations here the enrichment of bacteria within bacteroidota also confirms previous findings of high abundances of bacteria within this phylum in fermentation reactors brison et al 2022 esquivel elizondo et al 2017 huang et al 2021 maspolim et al 2015 little is known about the physiology of the enriched genera within bacteroidota mainly belonging to prevotellaceae and rikenellaceae dueholm et al 2022 except that they are likely anaerobic and fermentative capable of hydrolysing polysaccharides and proteins abe et al 2013 könönen et al 2010 krieg 2010 members in rikenellaceae and prevotellaceae are often associated with the gut microbiome but have also been assigned important roles for vfa production in fermentation reactors brison et al 2022 esquivel elizondo et al 2017 in the gut microbiome bacteria within prevotellaceae are associated with the fermentation of fiber precup and vodnar 2019 which may explain its high abundance in fermentation reactors treating fps containing a particularly high cellulose content ahmed et al 2019 the observation that various genera within prevotellaceae were correlated with different vfa components in the reactor as indicated by rda fig s8 furthermore suggests functional variation among the genera which seems likely as bacteria within prevotellaceae have genes for production of a number of vfa species esquivel elizondo et al 2017 the reactor microbiome showed clear seasonal patterns most likely driven by the variation in temperature fig 7 for instance one of the main genera prevotella 9 was mostly abundant at cold conditions and seemingly linked with hbu production fig s8 temperature has previously been identified as the key seasonal factor for community succession in activated sludge de celis et al 2022 griffin and wells 2017 here the reactor microbiome exhibited more pronounced and somewhat different seasonal patterns than the influent fps fig 7 probably caused by the sharp temperature gradients in the reactor fig 3 altogether the findings highlight that the fermentation microbiome was largely influenced by the reactor conditions of which temperature was a main factor which thereby caused seasonal variation in the spectrum of produced vfas 5 conclusions fermentation of fps at pilot scale was reproducible and stable with insignificant differences in vfa production and microbial community structure between parallel reactors operated at 5 d rt seasonal variations had considerable influence on the vfa production rate and thus the observed yield and the microbial community structure hac and hpr formation displayed strong temperature dependencies while the formation of longer chained vfas was more stable the seasonal pattern of vfa production during fermentation at ambient temperature has not been shown before although it is of importance for subsequent bnr the nutrient solubilisation was less temperature dependent than the vfa production and cod solubilisation observed as lower ratios for scod po4 3 p and scod nh4 n in the fermentate during winter consequently the carbon source quality for nutrient removal would decrease at lower temperature lower rt of 2 and 3 d resulted in a higher volumetric productivity and may hence be suitable if there is an existing but restricted volume to be used for fermentation in a greenfield installation a longer rt of 5 d or longer is preferable to increase the yields of soluble cod and vfa as well as soluble cod to nutrient ratios the microbial community structure in the fermentation process was to a large extent shaped by process conditions and biotic interaction

14647,primary treatment of municipal wastewater by rotating belt filtration followed by hydrolysis and acidogenic fermentation of the filter primary sludge fps at ambient temperature was studied at pilot scale during one year the seasonal variations of volatile fatty acids vfas nutrient release and soluble cod production as well as microbial community assembly were assessed leading to novel findings for fermentation at ambient temperature the reproducibility of vfa production performance was first established by operating the two fermentation reactors under the same conditions showing similar results regarding vfa production and microbial community structure one year of operation at 5 d retention time rt and 16 29 c resulted in an average vfa yield of 180 35 mg cod g vsin and soluble cod yield of 242 40 mg cod g vsin the vfa formation was temperature dependent with θ 1 033 0 005 r r 20 θ t 20 c the seasonal variations of the acetic and propionic acid productions were pronounced whereas the productions of vfas with longer chains were more stable regardless of temperature the community structure of the reactor microbiomes was also clearly affected by season and temperature and linked with the production spectrum of vfas the ammonium and phosphate releases were stable during the year leading to a decrease in ratios of soluble cod to nh4 n and po4 3 p during winter the soluble cod yield was 11 and 27 higher at 5 d rt compared to 3 and 2 d rt respectively but the corresponding volumetric productivities were lower the dissimilarities between microbiomes in influent fps and fermenters were significant even at a short rt of 2 d and increased with longer rt of 3 and 5 d primarily caused by selection of bacteria within bacteroidota in the fermentation reactors graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rotating belt filter primary sludge fermentation hydrolysis carbon source volatile fatty acids 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment requires a sufficient amount of readily biodegradable carbon for denitrification and excess phosphate uptake in biological nutrient removal bnr to meet the effluent demands for nitrogen and phosphorus volke et al 2020 numerous studies have focused on production and use of volatile fatty acids vfas also known as short chain fatty acids as carbon sources for bnr atasoy et al 2018 lee et al 2014 biologically produced vfas are suitable carbon sources for both denitrification and biological phosphorus removal elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 settler primary sludge sps and waste activated sludge are often available at wastewater treatment plants wwtps as potential substrates for hydrolysis and fermentation to vfas and have been used for this purpose andreasen et al 1997 bouzas et al 2002 pitman et al 1992 wang et al 2020 one possibility to increase the amount of biodegradable carbon for bnr is in line acidogenic fermentation of sps in the primary settlers banister and pretorius 1998 ekholm et al 2022 hey et al 2012 tykesson et al 2005 which is relatively easy to implement but sensitive to variations of wastewater flow side stream fermentation of sps where the sludge is fermented in a separate reactor and recycled to a primary settler is more flexible compared to an in line process as it allows for controlled dosing of carbon source to the main stream but it may cause deteriorated settling properties and odor banister and pretorius 1998 filtration as primary treatment of wastewater results in smaller footprint and potentially higher removal of total suspended solids tss compared to primary settlers väänänen et al 2016 the sludge that is separated in primary filtration has been denoted primary sludge christensen et al 2022 rotating belt filter rbf biosolids bahreini et al 2021 fine sieved fraction ghasimi et al 2016 or cellulosic primary sludge conca et al 2020 but we propose the generic term filter primary sludge fps fps from an rbf has a total solids ts concentration of 4 10 without integrated dewatering rusten et al 2017 which is considerably higher compared to the ts in both sps 1 0 3 4 and waste activated sludge 0 6 1 2 ucisik and henze 2008 hence it is reasonable to expect a high volumetric vfa production with use of fps for fermentation fermentation of fps and sps originating from the same wastewater has resulted in similar vfa yields brison et al 2022 suggesting comparable biodegradability of the two substrates polymer addition to the wastewater prior to filtration chemically enhanced filtration has been observed to increase the tss removal and the fps methane potential rusten et al 2017 but has not been applied in previously published studies of fps fermentation bahreini et al 2021 2020a da ros et al 2020 leaving a knowledge gap concerning the potentials of this substrate fermentation of sps has occasionally been studied at lower temperatures below 25 c dauknys et al 2019 ferreiro and soto 2003 skalsky and daigger 1995 full scale fermentation of sps as an inline process at wwtps has also been applied at ambient temperature in the nordic countries andreasen et al 1997 ekholm et al 2022 tykesson et al 2005 however the link between temperature and fermentation yield has not been thoroughly addressed the production rate has been shown to be lower for fps fermentation below 35 c bahreini et al 2020b but fermentation at ambient temperature has the advantage of lower energy requirement therefore the seasonal variations in fermentation of sludge are of practical as well as academic interest acidogenic bacteria can be found in raw sps even without an intentional fermentation process lin and li 2018 maspolim et al 2015 consequently batch tests with fermentation have been conducted successfully without inoculum both with sps miron et al 2000 and with fps from rbf crutchik et al 2018 da ros et al 2020 the vfa production could however be increased by using fermented sludge as inoculum in batch tests with sps banister and pretorius 1998 which implies that hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria were enriched in fermentation reactors both the product spectrum and microbial community structure were found to be comparable in fermentation of sps and fps indicating that the composition of sps and fps consisting mainly of polysaccharides selected for similar communities brison et al 2022 bacteria within firmicutes and bacteroidota that are capable of fermenting were found in the sludge from iron enhanced primary sedimentation and multiplied during mesophilic semi continuous fermentation lin and li 2018 temperature ranging from 25 to 55 c has been shown to have a profound impact on microbial community composition and can be linked to production of specific vfas huang et al 2021 furthermore the microbial community of fps anaerobic digestion for methane production has been investigated at mesophilic and thermophilic conditions ghasimi et al 2015 but the community assembly in fps fermentation at ambient temperature is yet to be mapped out in this study we propose a pre treatment method for municipal wastewater comprising chemically enhanced prefiltration with rbf and acidogenic fermentation of fps at ambient temperature a pilot plant with an rbf and two fermentation reactors was operated for one year with the aim to evaluate the seasonal variations in the fermentation of fps at ambient temperature as well as the effects of different retention times rts the corresponding microbial communities were characterised in the influent sludge and in the acidogenic fermentation 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewater pre treatment the pilot plant fig s1 was situated at källby municipal wwtp in lund sweden which has a load of 90 000 population equivalents and a low industrial load wastewater screened through 6 mm was pumped into the pilot plant flow proportionally to the wwtp flow but with a minimum of 6 and maximum of 18 m3 h during the year of operation in this study july 2020 to july 2021 the average flow was 11 3 m3 h with tss 242 64 mg l cod 528 111 mg l total nitrogen 55 7 9 6 and total phosphorus 6 7 1 3 the inlet tank contained online measurement of tss visolid wtw to enable online control for polymer addition a cationic polymer solution of 0 1 0 2 superfloc 6260 kemira kemi ab was added in the pipe to the first of two mixed flocculation tanks 0 8 m3 each the polymer was dosed at 1 1 2 0 g m3 with additional 5 7 g g tss resulting in a total average polymer dose of 3 2 g m3 the particular polymer was chosen since it produced high strength flocs the total flocculation hydraulic rt hrt was 9 3 min the rbf sf1000 salsnes filter was operated with a fixed setpoint for water level at 210 mm july april and 240 mm april july with a filter cloth pore size of 350 µm the integrated dewatering device was excluded since the ts of the fps was otherwise too high to be pumped removal of tss and cod in the rbf was 64 10 and 44 9 respectively 2 2 sludge treatment and sampling the influent sludge tank had a variable working volume of 0 15 0 38 m3 and rt of 0 3 0 1 d the two fermentation reactors were placed outdoors both insulated and mixed at 70 rpm with a working volume of 1 5 m3 each the steel pipes for sludge were equipped with heat tracing and insulation to avoid freezing during winter influent and effluent pumping was automatically controlled at 4 6 times d for each reactor and the pumping volume was set to achieve the desired rt during the first operational setting the verification period both reactors had a set rt of 5 d table 1 which resulted in rts of 4 9 0 4 and 5 0 0 5 d in r1 and r2 respectively the rt in the first reactor r1 was kept at 5 0 0 6 d during a whole year to assess the seasonal variations whereas the second reactor r2 was set to first 3 d 3 2 0 7 d and then 2 d 2 2 0 1 d during the assessment of different rts the effluent sludge was pumped to the pilot plant outlet during the time of this study and therefore not recycled to the wastewater grab samples of sludge were taken twice week on alternating weekdays from the lower part of the reactors and from the influent sludge tank temperatures were measured instantaneously on site during a period in december 2020 the fermentation reactors were heated unintentionally and the temperatures were thus not ambient in february 2021 the pipes were frozen during two weeks despite heat tracing and insulation both these periods are excluded in the results data was also excluded if there was a deviation of rt due to error in pumping or flow measurement 2 3 chemical analyses ts and volatile solids vs were analysed after 24 h at 105 c and after 2 h at 550 c cod and ammonium nitrogen were measured with spectrophotometric cuvettes hach lck114 and lck304 samples for analysis of soluble cod and specific vfas were first centrifuged 5000 rpm 5 min and subsequently filtered through glass fiber filters with pore size 20 µm munktell mga no 110 116 and 0 45 µm syringe filters sartorious minisart rc 25 for ph measurements a ph electrode was used metrohm xylem samples for analysis of ammonium nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus were first filtered through 1 6 µm glass fiber filters whatman no 1820 055 phosphate phosphorus and total phosphorus were analysed in 20 ml samples with spectrophotometry perkinelmer lambda 35 after acidification with 4 m h2so4 kjeldahl nitrogen in sludge samples was measured according to ss en 16 169 2012 with analyser unit kjeltec 8420 and compass software 2 2 foss analytics vfas were measured both as acetic acid equivalents hac eq with 5 point titration according to ibrahim et al 2014 and as separate acids with either gas chromatography gc or high performance liquid chromatography hplc the 5 point titration also provided values of total alkalinity for the measurement of specific vfas with gc or hplc the same standard solution volatile free acid mix merck was used for calibration samples for vfa analysis 900 µl were conserved with 100 µl 10 w w phosphoric acid the gc agilent 6850 was equipped with a 30 m 0 53 mm 1 µm column 19095f 123e agilent nitrogen gas was used as carrier while hydrogen gas was added for flame ionization the temperature was raised from 80 c to 120 c at a rate of 20 c min thereafter from 120 c to 130 c at a rate of 6 13 c min whereafter the temperature was kept constant at 130 c for 5 min injection temperature was 180 c and detector temperature 260 c injection volume was 1 µl the hplc 1269 infinity ii quaternary system agilent was operated at 60 c during 60 min with a flow of 0 7 ml h through the column infinitylab poroshell 120 ec c18 for each sample 20 µl was injected and the variable wavelength detector signal at 210 nm was used for quantification with openlab agilent phosphoric acid 0 1 w w was used as carrier solution batch tests for measurement of denitrification rate was conducted with influent and filtered wastewater as well as filtered wastewater with added fermentate according to the procedure described in the supplementary material 2 4 microbial community analysis biweekly samples of the influent sludge to the reactors r1 and r2 over the entire operational period starting from june 2020 in total 98 samples were subjected to amplicon sequencing experimental procedures are described in detail in the supplementary material in brief dna was extracted and the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr after purification quality control and measurement of dna concentrations the pooled pcr products were sequenced on a miseq illumina processing of the obtained raw sequence reads and generation of count tables with amplicon sequence variants asvs were carried out using dada2 v1 16 callahan et al 2016 and vsearch rognes et al 2016 in parallel a consensus count table from the two pipelines were generated using qdiv modin et al 2020 taxonomy was assigned with sintax edgar 2016 using the midas 4 8 1 database dueholm et al 2022 the bioinformatics and diversity calculations were carried out in qdiv modin et al 2020 the dataset was rarefied by subsampling each sample to 35 957 reads alpha and beta diversity was calculated using the hill number framework see the supplementary material for details dissimilarities between samples were visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa to determine the dissimilarity caused by compositional turnover between samples and assess the roles of deterministic and stochastic factors for microbial community assembly the raup crick null model chase et al 2011 raup and crick 1979 was used adapted for hill based dissimilarities in qdiv modin et al 2020 redundancy analysis rda of the top 25 genera in r1 having constant rt and selected environmental data was carried out in the r package vegan v2 6 4 oksanen et al 2022 using the rda function after doing a hellinger transformation of the community abundances using the decostand function for more details on bioinformatics see the supplementary material raw sequence reads are deposited at the sequence read archive ncbi bioproject prjna945084 2 5 calculations given its 0 3 d average rt the influent sludge tank was considered as part of the total process volume the soluble cod and vfa yields y were thus calculated based on the difference between reactor concentrations and influent wastewater concentrations as the influent wastewater concentrations were negligible compared to the reactor concentrations the yields were calculated according to eq 1 where vsin is the mean value of influent vs during a period of two weeks 1 y r e a c t o r v s i n in models for bnr all conversion rates can be multiplied by a temperature dependency factor often in the form of eq 2 where r is the reaction rate and t is the temperature in c rieger et al 2013 since the rt was kept constant eq 2 could be simplified to eq 3 where the y is the observed yield during the experimental period and y20 is the observed yield at 20 c the fitting of the temperature dependency constant θ was carried out in origin originlab using levenberg marquardt iteration 2 r r 20 θ t 20 c 3 y y 20 θ t 20 c two sided student t test conducted for paired data as well as the calculations of standard deviations were made in excel 2019 microsoft 3 results 3 1 acidogenic fermentation was highly reproducible filtration of municipal wastewater with rbf resulted in a sludge with 4 5 0 6 ts and 87 5 4 4 vs of ts with an average concentration of 57 200 13 400 mg cod l table 2 the two reactors r1 and r2 for acidogenic fermentation of fps were first operated as duplicates with the same rt of 5 d with similar results the vfa concentrations were 8 070 1 360 and 8 060 1 420 mg cod l in r1 and r2 respectively fig 1 likewise the mean vfa distributions were very similar in both reactors 27 1 acetic acid hac 42 2 propionic acid hpr 3 0 isovaleric acid iso hbu 14 1 butyric acid hbu 5 1 iso valeric acid iso hval 9 1 valeric acid hval expressed as of vfa cod n 14 for each reactor the difference in mean values for 13 process parameters were 0 4 4 5 between the reactors for 10 parameters no differences were observed p 0 05 while significant deviations were found for three parameters with minor differences sm table s1 3 2 considerable seasonal variations in fermentation at ambient temperature the temperature ranged from 16 to 29 c during one year of operation of r1 at the rt of 5 d the observed soluble cod yield was 242 40 mg cod g vsin of which vfas constituted 180 35 mg cod g vsin corresponding to 108 16 mg hac eq g vsin eq 1 table 2 a clear seasonal dependency can be seen for soluble cod and vfa concentrations fig s2a and observed vfa yield fig 2 a with a peak in september and minimum in march the vfa yield deviated however from the temperature curve during january and may june fig 2a curve fitting of the observed vfa cod yield versus the temperature eq 3 fig 2b rendered a yield at 20 c y20 of 172 4 mg cod g vsin and θ of 1 033 0 005 r2 0 55 measurements of vfa with titration which were carried out in parallel and at higher frequency gave a y20 of 103 mg hac eq g vsin and a slightly lower value for θ of 1 029 0 004 at r2 0 56 fig s2b the temperature dependencies of ammonium and phosphate were weak due to the strong temperature dependence for the vfa formation the ratios of soluble cod to nutrients were higher during summer than during winter fig 3 the soluble cod to nh4 n ratio was ranging from 17 to 20 g cod g nh4 n during winter to 20 30 g cod g nh4 n during summer a similar temperature effect was observed for the soluble cod to po4 3 ratio which was 20 25 g cod g po4 3 p during winter and rose to 30 45 g cod g po4 3 p during summer the maximum denitrification rate for filtered wastewater was increased from 6 3 to 9 0 mg no3 n eq g vss h with addition of fermentate fig s4 hpr was the dominating vfa on cod basis followed by hac and they both displayed a clear seasonal variation fig 4 a b the yields of hbu iso hbu hval and iso hval were more stable throughout the year fig 4a b the temperature correlations for the observed yields of hac and hpr were y20 42 1 θ 1 042 0 007 r2 0 48 and y20 63 2 θ 1 054 0 007 r2 0 59 respectively fig 4b consequently the fraction of hpr increased with higher temperature fig s3 furthermore the fraction of hbu was unusually high in march after the period of operational problems fig s3 3 3 both carbon source production and quality were affected by retention time rt during march june when the two reactors r1 and r2 were operated at different rts temperatures in both reactors were rising from 16 to 28 c there was a statistically significant difference of 11 in the observed soluble cod yield already during period 1 from march to mid may when r1 was operated at 5 d rt and r2 at 3 d rt with 258 43 and 230 27 mg cod g vsin in r1 and r2 respectively table 3 the volumetric scod production was on the other hand 50 lower at the longer rt 2 000 200 compared to 3 000 200 g scod m3 d in r1 and r2 respectively when the rt was lowered to 2 d in r2 during period 2 from mid may to mid june the difference in scod yield increased to 27 with 263 36 and 191 33 mg cod g vsin in r1 and r2 respectively the volumetric scod production was 78 lower in r1 than r2 1 800 200 compared to 3 300 400 g cod m3 d table 3 meanwhile the observed hac eq yield was less affected by rt than the volumetric scod production 34 lower at 3 d rt and 48 lower at 2 d rt compared to 5 d rt the ratios of scod to nh4 n table 3 were similar during the first period which suggests that the fraction of soluble cod derived from hydrolysis of proteins were comparable at rt of 5 and 3 d 25 g scod g nh4 n during period 2 the difference was minor resulting in ratios of 26 2 and 23 3 g cod g nh4 n in r1 and r2 respectively the ratios of soluble cod to po4 3 p table 3 displayed a small but statistically significant difference during the first period with 70 13 and 64 14 g cod g po4 3 p in r1 and r2 the difference grew during period 2 with 77 4 and 65 6 g cod g po4 3 p 3 4 the microbiomes in the fermentation reactors were distinctly different from the influent filter primary sludge the diversity within samples alpha diversity was lower in the reactor microbiomes than in the reactor influent fps p 0 001 considering both species richness number of asvs 0d and when taking the relative abundance of asvs into account 1d fig s5 when comparing the microbial community structure between the reactor and the influent fps microbiomes beta diversity as pairwise dissimilarities over 13 months of operation fig 5 a it was clear that the reactors harboured microorganisms with a community structure distinctly different from the influent fps it was also evident that the two reactors when operated at the same rt had similar microbiomes fig 5b which is in line with the similar vfa production from the two reactors during this period fig 1 the patterns of a clear separation of the microbiomes in reactors and influent as well as the minor differences between the replicate reactors was confirmed by pcoa ordination fig s6 when decreasing the rt to 3 and 2 d of r2 while keeping it at 5 d in r1 differences between microbiomes in the two reactors increased fig 5b as did the yield of vfa table 3 the null model analysis showed that the microbial community composition in the reactors were more dissimilar to the influent sludge than could be explained by chance fig 5c the analysis also showed that the composition in the parallel reactors were more similar to each other than could be expected by chance especially when operated at the same rt of five days during the verification period but even at shorter rt the microbiomes in r2 were distinctly different from the influent fig 5c 3 5 bacteria within bacteroidota were highly enriched in the reactors seven phyla had an average relative abundance exceeding 1 in either the reactors or the influent fps in the influent firmicutes and proteobacteria were the largest phyla accounting for 36 and 34 of the microbiomes with smaller contributions of bacteroidota 13 actinobacteriota 5 3 and camplylobacteriota 5 0 fig s7 in the reactors bacteria within bacteroidota were clearly enriched with relative abundances of 47 and 44 in r1 and r2 respectively at the expense of bacteria within the other phyla especially bacteria within proteobacteria had profoundly lower relative abundances of 14 in r1 and 15 in r2 within bacteroidota a number of genera were enriched in the reactors for instance prevotella prevotella 9 and the midas genera 47 113 and 51 577 within prevotellaceae dueholm et al 2022 as well as u29 b03 within rikenellaceae fig 6 the reactor conditions explained 68 of the variation of the abundant genera in the r1 microbiome as revealed by rda fig s8 among the genera within prevotellaceae and rikenellaceae various associations with reactor conditions were observed with prevotella 9 correlating with the concentrations of hbu u29 b03 with iso hbu and midas genus 47 113 and prevotellaceae sv5557 with hac 3 6 changes over time in community structure over time the microbiomes changed at similar rates of about 0 01 d 1 suggesting a rather stable succession in the reactors as well as the influent fps fig s9 however a few peaks in rate of change were observed for instance around february 2021 when the temperature fluctuated considerably and feeding of sludge to the reactors was temporarily halted community dissimilarity at various time gaps fig 7 indicated seasonal patterns with a maximum dissimilarity at 5 r1 and 6 months fps time gap and a secondary minimum at 10 r1 and 12 months fps 4 discussion 4 1 carbon source production the results in this study support the reproducibility of fps fermentation with similar microbial community structure in the two pilot scale reactors producing vfa and other chemical components in an equal manner figs 1 5 table s1 a few operational disturbances such as failure of pumps and unintentional heating did not have any long term effects on the microbial community structure and process performance suggesting process robustness reproducibility of duplicate lab scale reactors with influent from the same batch of primary sludge was observed already by eastman and fergusson 1981 reproducibility at pilot scale with its larger variation in environmental conditions as shown in this study is promising for application in full scale the soluble cod yield of 242 40 mg cod g vsin during one year at 5 3 d rt at 16 29 c including the sludge tank is comparable to the yield of 267 mg cod g vs during fermentation at 25 c and 4 d rt bahreini et al 2020b furthermore the vfa yield of 180 35 mg cod g vs is comparable to 154 mg cod g vs from fps at 6 d rt and 37 c da ros et al 2020 and 162 13 mg cod g vs for fermentation at 4 d rt and 37 c crutchik et al 2018 although the temperature was varying and lower in this study in conclusion the fps substrate and fermentation conditions at ambient temperature in this study resulted in similar yields compared with previous findings the rt had clear effect on the soluble cod and vfa with considerably higher yields at 5 days than 2 or 3 days table 3 this supports previous findings of soluble cod production from fps that increased from 173 to 267 mg cod g vs when increasing rt from 2 to 4 d at 25 c bahreini et al 2020b since an rt of 5 d produced a fermentate with higher vfa po4 3 p compared to at shorter rt longer rt would be more favourable for application of the fermentate as carbon source for enhanced biological phosphorus removal 4 2 seasonal variations the seasonal variation in temperature 16 29 c had profound effect on the production of vfa fig 4 accordingly the community dissimilarity as a function of time gap fig 7 indicated that the microbial community in the fermenters also varied seasonally the temperature dependency constant for vfa production was θ 1 033 the only previous fps study found at this point for comparable temperatures of 25 and 35 c bahreini et al 2020b report vfa yields that can be used to calculate temperature dependency of θ 1 04 at an rt of 4 d although the studies are not directly comparable the similar θ values between the studies suggest a general response of acidogenic fermentation of fps sludge to temperature variation among the vfa components the production of hac and hpr was higher during the warmer months while the production of the other vfas was rather stable over the year hac and hpr have been shown to be the major products from fermentation of both sps and fps brison et al 2022 huang et al 2021 but the results of temperature impact on the vfa distribution in previous studies have not been consistent increasing temperature during fermentation of sps has shown profound impact on the fractions of produced hac and hpr but in various directions while the fraction of larger vfas have been either rather unaffected or increased at increasing temperatures cokgor et al 2009 ferreiro and soto 2003 huang et al 2021 the vfa composition is worth considering since hac and hbu have been found to be preferred substrates to hpr for denitrifying bacteria elefsiniotis and wareham 2007 meaning that the fermentate in this case might be a more appealing substrate for denitrification when it is produced at lower fermentation temperature although the soluble cod to ammonium ratio was lower during winter 17 20 g cod g nh4 n it was still high compared to the theoretical requirement of 3 74 g cod g n for denitrification with hac chiu and chung 2003 hpr is on the other hand an attractive substrate for ebpr moser engeler et al 1998 the stable concentrations of ammonium and phosphate implies that the degradation of proteins was rather unchanged and that degradation of carbohydrates was responsible for the seasonal variation of vfa production degradation of fat is inhibited during acidic conditions since methanogenic bacteria are needed for uptake of hydrogen in order to create a thermodynamically favourable environment for lipid conversion van lier et al 2020 vfas with longer chains can be produced from proteins via the stickland reaction ramsay and pullammanappallil 2001 the stable concentrations of both ammonium and phosphate over time is consequently in line with the lack of seasonal variation for hbu iso hbu hval and iso hval fermentation of sucrose with both hac and hpr as products is more favourable energetically compared to fermentation to only hbu or hac van lier et al 2020 which is presumably the reason for the production of these two vfas as the dominant pathway exhibiting the same temporal trend at a full scale plant the practical and economic advantages of operating a process at ambient temperature can be weighty despite the lower reaction rate this study brings new and useful insights to the seasonal variations of fermentation at ambient and transient temperature which are likely similar to the existing fermentation of sps running at numerous wwtps since the cellulose content is higher in fps compared to sps ahmed et al 2019 the seasonal variation in the production of hac and hpr is likely to be less pronounced but may occur also in full scale fermentation of sps 4 3 microbial community structure the observed separation in microbial community structure between the influent fps and the reactor biomass fig 5a fig s6 was caused by both differences in species richness fig s1 and compositional differences species turnover as revealed by the null models chase et al 2011 modin et al 2020 the null model results fig 5c furthermore suggests that deterministic forces such as reactor conditions and species interactions were vital for shaping the reactor microbiomes and that stochastic immigration birth and death were of limited importance chase and myers 2011 zhou 2017 in various wastewater treatment reactors and anaerobic digestors deterministic forces have been assigned important roles for shaping the microbiomes ali et al 2019 de celis et al 2022 liébana et al 2019 vanwonterghem et al 2014 however the investigated reactors have been operated at considerably longer retention times which promotes deterministic species selection ali et al 2019 our results indicate that even a few days of rt would suffice for deterministic selection of reactor microbiomes at least for fermentation reactors the results also put the many findings in fermentation reactors of different microbial communities at various environmental conditions e g brison et al 2022 maspolim et al 2015 yuan et al 2016 in context in the reactor microbiomes bacteria within bacteroidota were enriched while proteobacteria were strongly reduced in abundance fig 7 s7 it has been suggested that proteobacteria generally harbours bacteria with low activity at anaerobic conditions why their presence in fermentation reactors is mainly a factor of immigration rather than growth brison et al 2022 mei et al 2016 which fits well with the observations here the enrichment of bacteria within bacteroidota also confirms previous findings of high abundances of bacteria within this phylum in fermentation reactors brison et al 2022 esquivel elizondo et al 2017 huang et al 2021 maspolim et al 2015 little is known about the physiology of the enriched genera within bacteroidota mainly belonging to prevotellaceae and rikenellaceae dueholm et al 2022 except that they are likely anaerobic and fermentative capable of hydrolysing polysaccharides and proteins abe et al 2013 könönen et al 2010 krieg 2010 members in rikenellaceae and prevotellaceae are often associated with the gut microbiome but have also been assigned important roles for vfa production in fermentation reactors brison et al 2022 esquivel elizondo et al 2017 in the gut microbiome bacteria within prevotellaceae are associated with the fermentation of fiber precup and vodnar 2019 which may explain its high abundance in fermentation reactors treating fps containing a particularly high cellulose content ahmed et al 2019 the observation that various genera within prevotellaceae were correlated with different vfa components in the reactor as indicated by rda fig s8 furthermore suggests functional variation among the genera which seems likely as bacteria within prevotellaceae have genes for production of a number of vfa species esquivel elizondo et al 2017 the reactor microbiome showed clear seasonal patterns most likely driven by the variation in temperature fig 7 for instance one of the main genera prevotella 9 was mostly abundant at cold conditions and seemingly linked with hbu production fig s8 temperature has previously been identified as the key seasonal factor for community succession in activated sludge de celis et al 2022 griffin and wells 2017 here the reactor microbiome exhibited more pronounced and somewhat different seasonal patterns than the influent fps fig 7 probably caused by the sharp temperature gradients in the reactor fig 3 altogether the findings highlight that the fermentation microbiome was largely influenced by the reactor conditions of which temperature was a main factor which thereby caused seasonal variation in the spectrum of produced vfas 5 conclusions fermentation of fps at pilot scale was reproducible and stable with insignificant differences in vfa production and microbial community structure between parallel reactors operated at 5 d rt seasonal variations had considerable influence on the vfa production rate and thus the observed yield and the microbial community structure hac and hpr formation displayed strong temperature dependencies while the formation of longer chained vfas was more stable the seasonal pattern of vfa production during fermentation at ambient temperature has not been shown before although it is of importance for subsequent bnr the nutrient solubilisation was less temperature dependent than the vfa production and cod solubilisation observed as lower ratios for scod po4 3 p and scod nh4 n in the fermentate during winter consequently the carbon source quality for nutrient removal would decrease at lower temperature lower rt of 2 and 3 d resulted in a higher volumetric productivity and may hence be suitable if there is an existing but restricted volume to be used for fermentation in a greenfield installation a longer rt of 5 d or longer is preferable to increase the yields of soluble cod and vfa as well as soluble cod to nutrient ratios the microbial community structure in the fermentation process was to a large extent shaped by process conditions and biotic interaction

14648,for decades red tide control has been recognized as necessary for mitigating financial damage to fish farms chemical disinfectants frequently used for water disinfection can reduce the risk of red tides on inland fish farms this study systematically evaluated four different chemical disinfectants ozone o3 permanganate mno4 sodium hypochlorite naocl and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 for their potential use in inland fish farms to control red tides by investigating their i inactivation efficacy regarding c polykrikoides ii total residual oxidant and byproduct formation and iii toxicity to fish the inactivation efficacy of c polykrikoides cells by chemical disinfectants from highest to lowest followed the order of o3 mno4 naocl h2o2 for different cell density conditions and disinfectant doses the o3 and naocl treatments generated bromate as an oxidation byproduct by reacting with bromide ions in seawater the acute toxicity tests of the disinfectants for juvenile red sea bream pagrus major showed that 72 h lc50 values were 1 35 estimated 0 39 1 32 and 102 61 mg l for o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 respectively considering the inactivation efficacy exposure time of residual oxidants

cochlodinium polykrikoides red tide control chemical disinfectant total residual oxidant fish acute toxicity data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction in recent decades harmful algal blooms have emerged as a serious threat to marine ecosystems and aquaculture they frequently cause mass mortality events in the wild and among aquaculture fish shellfish cochlodinium polykrikoides c polykrikoides is a notorious red tide dinoflagellate species that cause harmful algal blooms in korea japan canada and other countries anderson 2007 kim et al 2000 2004 lee 2008 studies have reported that the lethality of c polykrikoides originates from several factors including the production of reactive oxygen species suffocation by the clogging of fish gills and the depletion of dissolved oxygen in inland fish farms lim et al 2017 park et al 2019 yeganeh et al 2020 only a few methods are applicable for controlling red tide algae in open ocean fish farms spraying yellow clay has been widely adopted in korea japan and australia to prevent outbreaks and mitigate c polykrikoides beaulieu et al 2005 although this technique can achieve high removal efficacy up to 95 for c polykrikoides cells the cells that endure the spraying with yellow clay rapidly reached exponential growth within a few weeks eventually leading to the resurgence of the red tide cui et al 2020 for land based aquaculture more options are available to block the intake of the red tide species into aquatic tanks different methods including chemical treatment ultraviolet uv irradiation and filtration have been suggested for controlling c polykrikoides cells ono et al 1998 rounsefell and evans 1958 chemical disinfectants such as ozone o3 chlorine permanganate mno4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 have been studied as potential methods for controlling red tide algae o3 is a strong oxidant e o o3 o2 2 075 vnhe bard et al 1985 that is known to rapidly inactivate different algal species including c polykrikoides leading to the destruction of cells kang et al 2001 schneider et al 2003 shin et al 2017 yang et al 2015 however ozonation has several limitations such as high equipment and operational costs difficulties in handling and the formation of bromate bro3 a carcinogenic oxidation byproduct von gunten 2003 chlorine mno4 and h2o2 are also known to inactivate algal species including c polykrikoides and inhibit their cellular growth deeds et al 2002 ebenezer et al 2014 ryu et al 1998 although these oxidants are weaker than o3 they are more stable providing higher exposures oxidant dt and more cost effective despite the literature mentioned above information on determining the optimal disinfectants and their application conditions for controlling c polykrikoides in seawater still needs to be provided first the efficacies of different chemical disinfectants for controlling c polykrikoides have yet to be compared under the same conditions most previous studies have investigated only one chemical at a time secondly little is known about the effects of secondary oxidants on c polykrikoides inactivation o3 and chlorine are readily converted into hypobromous acid and hypobromite ions hobr obr by reacting with bromide ion br present in seawater bousher et al 1986 von gunten and hoigné 1994 as secondary oxidants these bromine species can potentially contribute to the inactivation of c polykrikoides cells but become precursors of harmful oxidation byproducts furthermore the acute toxicity of disinfectants in fish needs to be evaluated within the dose ranges tested to control c polykrikoides this study aims to assess the potential of different chemical disinfectants regarding the control of c polykrikoides and to suggest the best choice with appropriate dose levels that are harmless to fish for this purpose we systemically investigated i the inactivation efficacy of c polykrikoides using four different chemical disinfectants o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 at different cell densities and disinfectant doses ii the generation of total residual oxidant tro and hobr during the reaction and iii the acute toxicity of the disinfectants to juvenile fish 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received without further purification all stock solutions using naocl solution 10 15 wt active

of c polykrikoides the isolated c polykrikoides were originally obtained from the national fisheries research and development institute in korea and the stock of c polykrikoides cells 5 103 cells ml were prepared in the laboratory by subculturing as described in our previous work shin et al 2017 briefly approximately 50 cells of c polykrikoides were initially inoculated into polycarbonate bottles with guillard s f 2 medium with an extra addition of vitamin b12 at 24 c under 12 h 12 h light dark cycles illuminance of white fluorescent lights 3000 lx guillard and ryther 1962 guillard 1975 c polykrikoides cells were counted using a microscope axio scope zeiss co equipped with a sedgwick rafter chamber 50 20 1 mm the inactivation of c polykrikoides was determined by cell motility i e mobile and immobile cells were counted separately to distinguish between viable and dead inactivated cells respectively with ruptured cells excluded from the counting oemcke and van leeuwen 2005 viitaslo et al 2005 yang et al 2015 the numbers of viable and total i e viable plus dead cells are presented 2 3 inactivation experiments c polykrikoides suspensions containing viable cells with concentrations of 0 5 103 1 0 103 2 0 103 and 3 0 103 cells ml were prepared by diluting the stock of c polykrikoides ca 5 103 cells ml with seawater for inactivation experiments all inactivation experiments were performed in batch reactors 25 ml pyrex flasks using 10 ml suspensions open to the atmosphere at room temperature 22 2 c the reaction was initiated by injecting an aliquot of the disinfectant stock solution similar dose ranges of disinfectants 0 5 mg l were used except for h2o2 a relatively weaker disinfectant for which a higher dose up to 10 mg l was examined to obtain comparable data of cell inactivation samples were withdrawn at predetermined times for analysis samples were collected three times at each sampling point and immediately mixed with sodium sulfite to quench residual oxidants in the samples for cell counting sampled suspensions were placed in a sedgwick rafter chamber under a microscope and the number of viable and dead cells was counted using two hand clickers samples for chemical analysis were filtered with a 0 45 μm hydrophilic polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter the experiments were conducted at least in triplicate and the average values with standard deviations error bars are presented 2 4 chemical analysis the o3 concentration in the stock solution was spectrophotometrically determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm ε 3000 m 1 cm 1 hoigné and bader 1994 the concentration of chlorine in stock solution naocl 10 15 active chlorine was standardized spectrophotometrically ε 350 m 1 cm 1 at 292 nm for ocl johnson and margerum

phenylenediamine dpd and titanium sulfate methods eisenberg 1943 tro was also determined by the dpd method for the experiments with o3 mno4 and h2o2 hobr was analyzed by quantifying the bromophenols i

derivatization using o dianisidine almendral et al 2009 an as9 sc column was used for ic separation using a carbonate solution 9 mm as the eluent at a 1 0 ml min flow rate absorbance at 450 nm was used to detect the derivatized products 2 5 fish acute toxicity test 300 juvenile red sea bream pagrus major with a body weight of ca 5 8 g and length of ca 8 3 cm were obtained from a fish farm and acclimatized for a few days in 500 l fiberglass reinforced plastic frp tanks with a continuous seawater supply 8 10 c under a natural photoperiod then 30 fish were transferred into each 150 l frp tank containing 100 l of seawater for the adaptation period 2 3 days with aeration the experiments were initiated by injecting chemical disinfectants naocl mno4 and h2o2 into the tanks the number of surviving fish in the tanks was counted every 12 h for 72 h by monitoring seawater quality parameters do ph and temperature throughout the experiments at 72 and 24 h before the experiments the diet of the fish was controlled by depriving them of food to minimize the metabolic effects control experiments were conducted under identical conditions without chemical disinfectants to ensure a sound environment for the tested fish based on obtained concentration fish mortality response data probit analysis was undertaken to determine the 72 h median lethal concentration lc50 of the disinfectants using the originpro 9 0 software originlab co using the same procedures acute toxicity tests using h2o2 were also conducted on juvenile starry flounder platichthys stellatus and juvenile flatfish paralichthys olivaceus 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of c polykrikoides by chemical disinfectants the inactivation of c polykrikoides by chemical disinfectants i e o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 was examined as a function of time by varying the concentration of the disinfectants 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l for o3 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l for mno4 and naocl and 0 1 1 5 and 10 mg l for h2o2 at an initial cell concentration of 1 103 cells ml fig 1 similarly the inactivation profiles of c polykrikoides at different initial cell concentrations 0 5 103 2 103 and 3 103 cells ml were obtained for each chemical disinfectant fig s1 in the sd overall the removal efficacy of both viable and total cells increased with increasing concentrations of chemical disinfectants fig 1 in addition the removal of total cells was slower than that of viable cells for all the tested chemical disinfectants o3 showed significantly faster removal of c polykrikoides for both viable and total cells than the other disinfectants i e mno4 naocl and h2o2 leading to the complete removal of viable cells in 10 min when the o3 dose was higher than 1 mg l in the o3 treatments a certain degree of viable cell inactivation occurred rapidly within 30 s which has been also observed in ozone inactivation of other red tide organisms such as karenia brevis schneider et al 2003 this instantaneous inactivation trend was consistently observed at different initial cell concentrations fig s1 1 in the sd in contrast the other disinfectants resulted in relatively gradual cell inactivation over 3 h figs s1 2 s1 3 and s1 4 in sd at different initial cell concentrations the greatest inactivation of c polykrikoides by o3 results from higher oxidation power of o3 compared to the other disinfectants e0 o3 o2 2 08 vnhe e0 hocl or ocl cl 1 48 or 0 81 vnhe e0 mno4 mno2 1 68 vnhe e0 h2o2 h2o 1 78 vnhe bard et al 1985 lide 2002 it is also noteworthy that total cell removal by o3 treatment was lower than that of other disinfectants when the complete inactivation of viable cells was equally achieved this tendency was more pronounced due to the greater difference between viable and total cell removal rates in the o3 treatment as compared to those of other chemical disinfectants fig 2 these observations may result from a shorter reaction time for the o3 treatment it may take time for damaged cells to rupture and distort cell membranes owing to the leakage of intracellular components removing viable and total cells by chemical disinfectants followed pseudo first order kinetics figs 1 and s1 in the sd we determined the observed rate constants k min 1 to gain more insight into inactivation behaviors by different chemical disinfectants removal rate constants by 1 mg l of o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 treatments were plotted as a function of initial cell concentrations 0 5 103 cells ml 1 103 cells ml 2 103 cells ml and 3 103 cells ml for viable and total cells fig 2 the observed rate constants are shown as functions of the applied oxidant concentration at different initial cell concentrations fig s2 in the sd as expected from the inactivation profiles during the reaction fig 1 the removal rates of total cells were slower than those of viable cells for all initial cell concentrations and chemical disinfectants from the highest to lowest the observed removal rates for both viable and total cells followed the order o3 mno4 naocl h2o2 inactivation rates of o3 for viable cells exhibited ca 7 times higher than those of mno4 at all different initial cell concentrations fig 2 overall the removal rates for both viable and total cells decreased with increasing initial cell concentrations for all chemical disinfectants increasing the cell concentration accelerated the disinfectant consumption resulting in decreased exposure notably the cell removal rates of h2o2 were less dependent on the initial cell concentration than those of the other disinfectants which was consistent with the observation that the decomposition of h2o2 was less affected by the initial cell concentration refer to section 3 2 fig s3 in the sd however the cell inactivation rates by h2o2 observed in this study was still higher than those reported in a previous study where the higher cell density 6 103 cells ml was used ryu et al 1998 e g 10 mg l h2o2 completely inactivated 3 103 cells ml c polykrikoides in 3 h fig s1 4 whereas in ryu et al s study 14 mg l h2o2 achieved 80 inactivation of 6 103 cells ml in 3 h considering the price of chemicals naocl is the most economical option to remove c polykrikoides ozone also appears to be economically feasible but the facilities to generate and inject ozone gas and to treat off gas will require substantial cost for practical field application other factors such as harmful oxidation byproducts and fish toxicity need to be collectively considered refer to the details in following sections 3 2 production of tro and hobr the concentration of chemical disinfectants during the inactivation of c polykrikoides was monitored at different initial disinfectant concentrations 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l for o3 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l for mno4 and naocl 0 1 1 5 and 10 mg l for h2o2 during the reaction time at an initial cell concentration of 1 0 103 cells ml fig 3 similarly the decomposition profile of chemical disinfectants was obtained at different initial cell concentrations 0 5 103 2 103 and 3 103 cells ml for each chemical disinfectant fig s3 in the sd the concentration of o3 was rapidly decreased at all input concentrations exhibiting the same trend as that of viable cell inactivation fig 1a these results indicate that the rapid inactivation of viable cells during o3 treatment resulted from the direct reaction of cells with molecular o3 naocl and mno4 also rapidly decomposed in the initial reaction stage 5 10 min except for 5 mg l mno4 which showed a gradual decay the concentration of h2o2 slowly decreased throughout the reaction the decay of disinfectants was significantly accelerated by increasing the initial cell concentrations of all chemical disinfectants fig s3 in the sd the accelerated disinfectant decay lowers the disinfectant exposure leading to a decrease in inactivation efficacy fig 2 the chemistry of o3 and chlorine in seawater was strongly influenced by br present in seawater 65 mg l 0 81 mm br rapidly reacts with o3 reaction 1 ko3 160 m 1s 1 and chlorine reaction 2 khocl 2 95 103 m 1s 1 kocl 6 23 103 m 1s 1 to produce hobr obr bousher et al 1986 von gunten and hoigné 1994 hobr obr can further react with ammonia nh3 to form monobromamine reaction 3 khobr 8 107 m 1s 1 buffle et al 2004 in addition chlorine reacts directly with nh3 to form chloramines reaction 4 khocl 3 106 m 1s 1 buffle et al 2004 1 o3 br obr o2 2 hocl or ocl br hobr or obr cl 3 hobr nh3 nh2br h2o 4 hocl nh3 nh2cl h2o the formation of tro and hobr during o3 and naocl treatments was examined to gain further insight into the role of secondary residual oxidants in cell inactivation tro and hobr concentrations were monitored at different disinfectant concentrations 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l for o3 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l for naocl for 3 h at an initial cell concentration of 1 0 103 cells ml fig 4 tro can include residual disinfectants as well as secondary oxidants such as active bromine and haloamine species in contrast the hobr concentration is separately determined to estimate the fraction of hobr in tro hobr accounted for approximately 10 35 of tro depending on the conditions nh2br and nh2cl can explain the remaining fraction of tro the o3 treatment produced a smaller fraction of hobr than the naocl treatment the profile of the measured tro during the chemical treatments i e o3 and naocl exhibited a relatively gradual decrease over 3 h fig 4a and b unlike the rapid decrease in the concentrations of o3 and naocl under identical conditions fig 3a and c in the o3 and naocl treatments hobr was immediately generated as part of the tro and gradually decreased during the reaction fig 4c and d the concentration of generated hobr increased with increasing input concentrations of o3 and naocl based on the results of cell removal and oxidant decay or formation it can be concluded that i o3 treatment rapid inactivation of viable cells results from the direct reaction with o3 and tro including hobr contributes to the subsequent slow decay ii naocl treatment tro leads to the inactivation of both viable and total cells iii mno4 and h2o2 treatments mno4 and h2o2 do not produce many secondary residual oxidants a meaningful amount of tro and hobr was not detected data not shown and the primary disinfectants themselves mainly contributed to the removal of viable and total cells additionally the formation of bro3 was examined after treatment fig 5 bro3 is defined as a probable human carcinogen by the international agency for the research on cancer iarc international agency for research on cancer 1987 the formation of bro3 was observed in the o3 and naocl treatments whereas the kmno4 and h2o2 treatments did not produce a detectable amount of bro3 these observations are consistent with the trends in hobr formation fig 4c and d indicating that hobr is a key precursor to produce bro3 as the dose of o3 and naocl increased from 0 5 to 5 mg l the concentration of bro3 increased accordingly the formation of bro3 was more pronounced in o3 treatments 0 75 and 278 μg l for 0 5 and 5 mg l of o3 respectively than naocl treatments 0 12 and 1 81 μg l for 0 5 and 5 mg l of naocl respectively the risk of bro3 in fish farming waters depends on the degree of the bioaccumulation of bro3 however the fact that bro3 is a probable human carcinogen may create an esthetic objection to using o3 for reference a provisional world health organization guideline value for bro3 is 10 μg l in drinking water world health organization 2011 3 3 fish acute toxicity a 72 h fish acute toxicity test for juvenile red sea bream pagrus major was carried out to determine the lc50 median lethal concentration of chemical disinfectants fig 6 the survival rates of juvenile red sea bream pagrus major were examined for 72 h by exposing to different concentrations of chemical disinfectants 0 1 0 2 0 5 mg l for mno4 0 5 1 0 1 5 mg l as cl2 for naocl fig s4 in the sd the toxicity test of o3 was excluded due to technical difficulties in the experiment it was difficult to build facilities to inject gaseous o3 into a 500 l fish tank quantitatively and to destroy o3 off gas properly instead since o3 is rapidly converted into tro the acute fish toxicity of o3 was estimated from the value of naocl based on the tro exposures during o3 and naocl treatments the mortality rates of juvenile red sea bream pagrus major at different naocl doses fig 6c were correlated with the tro exposures under the same conditions fig 4b and using this relationship and tro exposure during o3 treatment fig 4a the fish mortality rates at different o3 doses were estimated fig 6a the estimated 72 h mortality rates of juvenile red sea bream pagrus major at 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l o3 doses were 0 0 72 98 and 100 respectively fig 6a when exposed to 0 1 0 2 0 5 mg l mno4 the fish mortality rates were 0 5 75 respectively and at higher mno4 doses 100 mortality was achieved fig 6b in contrast there was only minimal mortality observed by exposing 0 5 mg l 5 of mortality rate after 72 h and 1 mg l 10 mortality after 72 h of naocl fig 6c indicating toxicity of mno4 toward juvenile red sea bream pagrus major is higher than that of naocl when the input concentration of naocl was increased to 1 5 mg l the mortality rate significantly increased to 92 juvenile red sea bream pagrus major was highly resistant to h2o2 exposure showing no mortality after 72 h at 50 mg l h2o2 fig 6d notably the mortality rates rapidly increased within 12 h after exposure to mno4 and naocl and then remained constant throughout another 60 h whereas h2o2 exposure led to a gradual increase in mortality rates over 72 h fig s4 indicating that mno4 and naocl caused more immediate damage to fish than h2o2 the lc50 values were determined by probit analysis o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 were 1 35 estimated 0 39 1 32 and 102 61 mg l respectively juvenile red sea bream pagrus major showed significantly higher tolerance to h2o2 than other disinfectants this tendency is consistent with previous studies with reported lc50 values of naocl ca 3 5 5 6 mg l versus h2o2 ca 139 270 mg l for other marine cultured fishes including olive flounder paralichthys olivaceus rockfish sebastes pachycephalus and black sea bream acanthopagrus schlegelii kim et al 2008 subpiramaniyam 2021 the relatively low fish toxicity of h2o2 was additionally verified for juvenile starry flounder platichthys stellatus and juvenile flatfish paralichthys olivaceus which are common species raised in inland fish farms lc50 values for juvenile starry flounder platichthys stellatus and juvenile flatfish paralichthys olivaceus were 226 7 and 407 6 mg l of h2o2 respectively fig s5 in the sd based on the cell removal efficacy and fish toxicity of chemical disinfectants it can be concluded that h2o2 is a practical choice of disinfectant to control red tides in inland fish farms with minimal toxic impacts on fish viable c polykrikoides cells were inactivated entirely in 2 h with 10 mg l h2o2 fig 1d which was far lower than the lc50 values ca 100 400 mg l for the juvenile fishes tested in this study for the field application 10 50 mg l h2o2 is suggested to be applied to control c polykrikoides depending on the inflow cell density and available retention time for reaction although residual h2o2 may not cause significant fish toxicity it quenching can be considered if prolonged use of h2o2 e g more than 3 days is needed meanwhile for other disinfectants o3 mno4 and naocl active doses to effectively inactivate c polykrikoides cells ca 0 1 5 mg l overlap those to induce significant acute fish toxicity for the field application of o3 mno4 and naocl and a proper quenching of residual oxidants e g using sulfite or thiosulfate is required before the treated water is introduced into the fish farm 4 conclusions significant findings from this study are summarized as follows 1 chemical disinfectants o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 effectively inactivated and lysed c polykrikoides cells the efficacy of the chemical disinfectants in removing viable and total cells followed the order o3 mno4 naocl h2o2 2 during o3 treatment the fast inactivation of viable cells resulted from the direct reaction with o3 whereas the continuous removal of total cells resulted from the reaction with tro during the naocl treatment tro mainly removed both viable and total cells mno4 and h2o2 treatments do not produce tro with the primary disinfectants responsible for cell removal 3 the o3 and naocl treatments led to the formation of bro3 a probable human carcinogen via reactions with the intermediate hobr 4 h2o2 exhibited much lower acute toxicity in fish than other disinfectants determined lc50 values of o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 for juvenile red sea bream pagrus major were 1 35 estimated 0 39 1 32 and 102 61 mg l respectively 5 considering the cell removal efficacy formation of bro3 and fish toxicity h2o2 appears to be the most practical and safe option for controlling red tides in the field however the other disinfectants o3 mno4 and naocl may be feasible alternatives with proper oxidant quenching

algal species including c polykrikoides leading to the destruction of cells kang et al 2001 schneider et al 2003 shin et al 2017 yang et al 2015 however ozonation has several limitations such as high equipment and operational costs difficulties in handling and the formation of bromate bro3 a carcinogenic oxidation byproduct von gunten 2003 chlorine mno4 and h2o2 are also known to inactivate algal species including c polykrikoides and inhibit their cellular growth deeds et al 2002 ebenezer et al 2014 ryu et al 1998 although these oxidants are weaker than o3 they are more stable providing higher exposures oxidant dt and more cost effective despite the literature mentioned above information on determining the optimal disinfectants and their application conditions for controlling c polykrikoides in seawater still needs to be provided first the efficacies of different chemical disinfectants for controlling c polykrikoides have yet to be compared under the same conditions most previous studies have investigated only one chemical at a time secondly little is known about the effects of secondary oxidants on c polykrikoides inactivation o3 and chlorine are readily converted into hypobromous acid and hypobromite ions hobr obr by reacting with bromide ion br present in seawater bousher et al 1986 von gunten and hoigné 1994 as secondary oxidants these bromine species can potentially contribute to the inactivation of c polykrikoides cells but become precursors of harmful oxidation byproducts furthermore the acute toxicity of disinfectants in fish needs to be evaluated within the dose ranges tested to control c polykrikoides this study aims to assess the potential of different chemical disinfectants regarding the control of c polykrikoides and to suggest the best choice with appropriate dose levels that are harmless to fish for this purpose we systemically investigated i the inactivation efficacy of c polykrikoides using four different chemical disinfectants o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 at different cell densities and disinfectant doses ii the generation of total residual oxidant tro and hobr during the reaction and iii the acute toxicity of the disinfectants to juvenile fish 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received without further purification all stock solutions using naocl solution 10 15 wt active

experiments were performed in batch reactors 25 ml pyrex flasks using 10 ml suspensions open to the atmosphere at room temperature 22 2 c the reaction was initiated by injecting an aliquot of the disinfectant stock solution similar dose ranges of disinfectants 0 5 mg l were used except for h2o2 a relatively weaker disinfectant for which a higher dose up to 10 mg l was examined to obtain comparable data of cell inactivation samples were withdrawn at predetermined times for analysis samples were collected three times at each sampling point and immediately mixed with sodium sulfite to quench residual oxidants in the samples for cell counting sampled suspensions were placed in a sedgwick rafter chamber under a microscope and the number of viable and dead cells was counted using two

used to detect the derivatized products 2 5 fish acute toxicity test 300 juvenile red sea bream pagrus major with a body weight of ca 5 8 g and length of ca 8 3 cm were obtained from a fish farm and acclimatized for a few days in 500 l fiberglass reinforced plastic frp tanks with a continuous seawater supply 8 10 c under a natural photoperiod then 30 fish were transferred into each 150 l frp tank containing 100 l of seawater for the adaptation period 2 3 days with aeration the experiments were initiated by injecting chemical disinfectants naocl mno4 and h2o2 into the tanks the number of surviving fish in the tanks was counted every 12 h for 72 h by monitoring seawater quality parameters do ph and temperature throughout the experiments at 72 and 24 h before the experiments the diet of the fish was controlled by depriving them of food to minimize the metabolic effects control experiments were conducted under identical conditions without chemical disinfectants to ensure a sound environment for the tested fish based on obtained concentration fish mortality response data probit analysis was undertaken to determine the 72 h median lethal concentration lc50 of the disinfectants using the originpro 9 0 software originlab co using the same procedures acute toxicity tests using h2o2 were also conducted on juvenile starry flounder platichthys stellatus and juvenile flatfish paralichthys olivaceus 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of c polykrikoides by chemical disinfectants the inactivation of c polykrikoides by chemical disinfectants i e o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 was examined as a function of time by varying the concentration of the disinfectants 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l for o3 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l for mno4 and naocl and 0 1 1 5 and 10 mg l for h2o2 at an initial cell concentration of 1 103 cells ml fig 1 similarly the inactivation profiles of c polykrikoides at different initial cell concentrations 0 5 103 2 103 and 3 103 cells ml were obtained for each chemical disinfectant fig s1 in the sd overall the removal efficacy of both viable and total cells increased with increasing concentrations of chemical disinfectants fig 1 in addition the removal of total cells was slower than that of viable cells for all the tested chemical disinfectants o3 showed significantly faster removal of c polykrikoides for both viable and total cells than the other disinfectants i e mno4 naocl and h2o2 leading to the complete removal of viable cells in 10 min when the o3 dose was higher than 1 mg l in the o3 treatments a certain degree of viable cell inactivation occurred rapidly within 30 s which has been also observed in ozone inactivation of other red tide organisms such as karenia brevis schneider et al 2003 this instantaneous inactivation trend was consistently observed at different initial cell concentrations fig s1 1 in the sd in contrast the other disinfectants resulted in relatively gradual cell inactivation over 3 h figs s1 2 s1 3 and s1 4 in sd at different initial cell concentrations the greatest inactivation of c polykrikoides by o3 results from higher oxidation power of o3 compared to the other disinfectants e0 o3 o2 2 08 vnhe e0 hocl or ocl cl 1 48 or 0 81 vnhe e0 mno4 mno2 1 68 vnhe e0 h2o2 h2o 1 78 vnhe bard et al 1985 lide 2002 it is also noteworthy that total cell removal by o3 treatment was lower than that of other disinfectants when the complete inactivation of viable cells was equally achieved this tendency was more pronounced due to the greater difference between viable and total cell removal rates in the o3 treatment as compared to those of other chemical disinfectants fig 2 these observations may result from a shorter reaction time for the o3 treatment it may take time for damaged cells to rupture and distort cell membranes owing to the leakage of intracellular components removing viable and total cells by chemical disinfectants followed pseudo first order kinetics figs 1 and s1 in the sd we determined the observed rate constants k min 1 to gain more insight into inactivation behaviors by different chemical disinfectants removal rate constants by 1 mg l of o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 treatments were plotted as a function of initial cell concentrations 0 5 103 cells ml 1 103 cells ml 2 103 cells ml and 3 103 cells ml for viable and total cells fig 2 the observed rate constants are shown as functions of the applied oxidant concentration at different initial cell concentrations fig s2 in the sd as expected from the inactivation profiles during the reaction fig 1 the removal rates of total cells were slower than those of viable cells for all initial cell concentrations and chemical disinfectants from the highest to lowest the observed removal rates for both viable and total cells followed the order o3 mno4 naocl h2o2 inactivation rates of o3 for viable cells exhibited ca 7 times higher than those of mno4 at all different initial cell concentrations fig 2 overall the removal rates for both viable and total cells decreased with increasing initial cell concentrations for all chemical disinfectants increasing the cell concentration accelerated the disinfectant consumption resulting in decreased exposure notably the cell removal rates of h2o2 were less dependent on the initial cell concentration than those of the other disinfectants which was consistent with the observation that the decomposition of h2o2 was less affected by the initial cell concentration refer to section 3 2 fig s3 in the sd however the cell inactivation rates by h2o2 observed in this study was still higher than those reported in a previous study where the higher cell density 6 103 cells ml was used ryu et al 1998 e g 10 mg l h2o2 completely inactivated 3 103 cells ml c polykrikoides in 3 h fig s1 4 whereas in ryu et al s study 14 mg l h2o2 achieved 80 inactivation of 6 103 cells ml in 3 h considering the price of chemicals naocl is the most economical option to remove c polykrikoides ozone also appears to be economically feasible but the facilities to generate and inject ozone gas and to treat off gas will require substantial cost for practical field application other factors such as harmful oxidation byproducts and fish toxicity need to be collectively considered refer to the details in following sections 3 2 production of tro and hobr the concentration of chemical disinfectants during the inactivation of c polykrikoides was monitored at different initial disinfectant concentrations 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l for o3 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l for mno4 and naocl 0 1 1 5 and 10 mg l for h2o2 during the reaction time at an initial cell concentration of 1 0 103 cells ml fig 3 similarly the decomposition profile of chemical disinfectants was obtained at different initial cell concentrations 0 5 103 2 103 and 3 103 cells ml for each chemical disinfectant fig s3 in the sd the concentration of o3 was rapidly decreased at all input concentrations exhibiting the same trend as that of viable cell inactivation fig 1a these results indicate that the rapid inactivation of viable cells during o3 treatment resulted from the direct reaction of cells with molecular o3 naocl and mno4 also rapidly decomposed in the initial reaction stage 5 10 min except for 5 mg l mno4 which showed a gradual decay the concentration of h2o2 slowly decreased throughout the reaction the decay of disinfectants was significantly accelerated by increasing the initial cell concentrations of all chemical disinfectants fig s3 in the sd the accelerated disinfectant decay lowers the disinfectant exposure leading to a decrease in inactivation efficacy fig 2 the chemistry of o3 and chlorine in seawater was strongly influenced by br present in seawater 65 mg l 0 81 mm br rapidly reacts with o3 reaction 1 ko3 160 m 1s 1 and chlorine reaction 2 khocl 2 95 103 m 1s 1 kocl 6 23 103 m 1s 1 to produce hobr obr bousher et al 1986 von gunten and hoigné 1994 hobr obr can further react with ammonia nh3 to form monobromamine reaction 3 khobr 8 107 m 1s 1 buffle et al 2004 in addition chlorine reacts directly with nh3 to form chloramines reaction 4 khocl 3 106 m 1s 1 buffle et al 2004 1 o3 br obr o2 2 hocl or ocl br hobr or obr cl 3 hobr nh3 nh2br h2o 4 hocl nh3 nh2cl h2o the formation of tro and hobr during o3 and naocl treatments was examined to gain further insight into the role of secondary residual oxidants in cell inactivation tro and hobr concentrations were monitored at different disinfectant concentrations 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l for o3 0 1 0 5 1 and 5 mg l for naocl for 3 h at an initial cell concentration of 1 0 103 cells ml fig 4 tro can include residual disinfectants as well as secondary oxidants such as active bromine and haloamine species in contrast the hobr concentration is separately determined to estimate the fraction of hobr in tro hobr accounted for approximately 10 35 of tro depending on the conditions nh2br and nh2cl can explain the remaining fraction of tro the o3 treatment produced a smaller fraction of hobr than the naocl treatment the profile of the measured tro during the chemical treatments i e o3 and naocl exhibited a relatively gradual decrease over 3 h fig 4a and b unlike the rapid decrease in the concentrations of o3 and naocl under identical conditions fig 3a and c in the o3 and naocl treatments hobr was immediately generated as part of the tro and gradually decreased during the reaction fig 4c and d the concentration of generated hobr increased with increasing input concentrations of o3 and naocl based on the results of cell removal and oxidant decay or formation it can be concluded that i o3 treatment rapid inactivation of viable cells results from the direct reaction with o3 and tro including hobr contributes to the subsequent slow decay ii naocl treatment tro leads to the inactivation of both viable and total cells iii mno4 and h2o2 treatments mno4 and h2o2 do not produce many secondary residual oxidants a meaningful amount of tro and hobr was not detected data not shown and the primary disinfectants themselves mainly contributed to the removal of viable and total cells additionally the formation of bro3 was examined after treatment fig 5 bro3 is defined as a probable human carcinogen by the international agency for the research on cancer iarc international agency for research on cancer 1987 the formation of bro3 was observed in the o3 and naocl treatments whereas the kmno4 and h2o2 treatments did not produce a detectable amount of bro3 these observations are consistent with the trends in hobr formation fig 4c and d indicating that hobr is a key precursor to produce bro3 as the dose of o3 and naocl increased from 0 5 to 5 mg l the concentration of bro3 increased accordingly the formation of bro3 was more pronounced in o3 treatments 0 75 and 278 μg l for 0 5 and 5 mg l of o3 respectively than naocl treatments 0 12 and 1 81 μg l for 0 5 and 5 mg l of naocl respectively the risk of bro3 in fish farming waters depends on the degree of the bioaccumulation of bro3 however the fact that bro3 is a probable human carcinogen may create an esthetic objection to using o3 for reference a provisional world health organization guideline value for bro3 is 10 μg l in drinking water world health organization 2011 3 3 fish acute toxicity a 72 h fish acute toxicity test for juvenile red sea bream pagrus major was carried out to determine the lc50 median lethal concentration of chemical disinfectants fig 6 the survival rates of juvenile red sea bream pagrus major were examined for 72 h by exposing to different concentrations of chemical disinfectants 0 1 0 2 0 5 mg l for mno4 0 5 1 0 1 5 mg l as cl2 for naocl fig s4 in the sd the toxicity test of o3 was excluded due to technical difficulties in the experiment it was difficult to build facilities to inject gaseous o3 into a 500 l fish tank quantitatively and to destroy o3 off gas properly instead since o3 is rapidly converted into tro the acute fish toxicity of o3 was estimated from the value of naocl based on the tro exposures during o3 and naocl treatments the mortality rates of juvenile red sea bream pagrus major at different naocl doses fig 6c were correlated with the tro exposures under the same conditions fig 4b and using this relationship and tro exposure during o3 treatment fig 4a the fish mortality rates at different o3 doses were estimated fig 6a the estimated 72 h mortality rates of juvenile red sea bream pagrus major at 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 5 mg l o3 doses were 0 0 72 98 and 100 respectively fig 6a when exposed to 0 1 0 2 0 5 mg l mno4 the fish mortality rates were 0 5 75 respectively and at higher mno4 doses 100 mortality was achieved fig 6b in contrast there was only minimal mortality observed by exposing 0 5 mg l 5 of mortality rate after 72 h and 1 mg l 10 mortality after 72 h of naocl fig 6c indicating toxicity of mno4 toward juvenile red sea bream pagrus major is higher than that of naocl when the input concentration of naocl was increased to 1 5 mg l the mortality rate significantly increased to 92 juvenile red sea bream pagrus major was highly resistant to h2o2 exposure showing no mortality after 72 h at 50 mg l h2o2 fig 6d notably the mortality rates rapidly increased within 12 h after exposure to mno4 and naocl and then remained constant throughout another 60 h whereas h2o2 exposure led to a gradual increase in mortality rates over 72 h fig s4 indicating that mno4 and naocl caused more immediate damage to fish than h2o2 the lc50 values were determined by probit analysis o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 were 1 35 estimated 0 39 1 32 and 102 61 mg l respectively juvenile red sea bream pagrus major showed significantly higher tolerance to h2o2 than other disinfectants this tendency is consistent with previous studies with reported lc50 values of naocl ca 3 5 5 6 mg l versus h2o2 ca 139 270 mg l for other marine cultured fishes including olive flounder paralichthys olivaceus rockfish sebastes pachycephalus and black sea bream acanthopagrus schlegelii kim et al 2008 subpiramaniyam 2021 the relatively low fish toxicity of h2o2 was additionally verified for juvenile starry flounder platichthys stellatus and juvenile flatfish paralichthys olivaceus which are common species raised in inland fish farms lc50 values for juvenile starry flounder platichthys stellatus and juvenile flatfish paralichthys olivaceus were 226 7 and 407 6 mg l of h2o2 respectively fig s5 in the sd based on the cell removal efficacy and fish toxicity of chemical disinfectants it can be concluded that h2o2 is a practical choice of disinfectant to control red tides in inland fish farms with minimal toxic impacts on fish viable c polykrikoides cells were inactivated entirely in 2 h with 10 mg l h2o2 fig 1d which was far lower than the lc50 values ca 100 400 mg l for the juvenile fishes tested in this study for the field application 10 50 mg l h2o2 is suggested to be applied to control c polykrikoides depending on the inflow cell density and available retention time for reaction although residual h2o2 may not cause significant fish toxicity it quenching can be considered if prolonged use of h2o2 e g more than 3 days is needed meanwhile for other disinfectants o3 mno4 and naocl active doses to effectively inactivate c polykrikoides cells ca 0 1 5 mg l overlap those to induce significant acute fish toxicity for the field application of o3 mno4 and naocl and a proper quenching of residual oxidants e g using sulfite or thiosulfate is required before the treated water is introduced into the fish farm 4 conclusions significant findings from this study are summarized as follows 1 chemical disinfectants o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 effectively inactivated and lysed c polykrikoides cells the efficacy of the chemical disinfectants in removing viable and total cells followed the order o3 mno4 naocl h2o2 2 during o3 treatment the fast inactivation of viable cells resulted from the direct reaction with o3 whereas the continuous removal of total cells resulted from the reaction with tro during the naocl treatment tro mainly removed both viable and total cells mno4 and h2o2 treatments do not produce tro with the primary disinfectants responsible for cell removal 3 the o3 and naocl treatments led to the formation of bro3 a probable human carcinogen via reactions with the intermediate hobr 4 h2o2 exhibited much lower acute toxicity in fish than other disinfectants determined lc50 values of o3 mno4 naocl and h2o2 for juvenile red sea bream pagrus major were 1 35 estimated 0 39 1 32 and 102 61 mg l respectively 5 considering the cell removal efficacy formation of bro3 and fish toxicity h2o2 appears to be the most practical and safe option for controlling red tides in the field however the other disinfectants o3 mno4 and naocl may be feasible alternatives with proper oxidant quenching

14649,due to the recalcitrant nature of halogenated phenol conventional anaerobic bioprocess is often limited by low removal efficiency and poor process stability at the presence of electron acceptors such as nitrate 4 bromophenol 4 bp removal efficiency is significantly higher than that in the anaerobic control system but the mechanism involved is still unclear therefore an up flow nitrate reducing bioreactor nrbr was designed and consecutively performed for 215 days to explore the synergistic mechanism for bps biodegradation and nitrate reduction complete 4 bp biodegradation could be obtained in nrbr at hrt and 4 bp loading rate of 24 h and 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 while the toc removal and nitrate reduction efficiencies were as high as 91 33 2 11 and 98 31 1 33 respectively population evolution analyses revealed that the microorganisms involved in 4 bp debromination and biodegradation candidatus peregrinibacteria denitratisoma anaerolineaceae and ignavibacterium as well as nitrate reduction denitratisoma anaerolineaceae limnobacter and ignavibacterium were significantly enriched in nrbr major intermediates during 4 bp biodegradation including 4 bromocatechol 4 bromo 6 oxo hexanoic acid and succinic acid were identified while a distinct 4 bp biodegradation pathway via hydration aromatic ring cleavage hydrolysis debromination and oxidation was expounded metagenomic analysis indicated that oxidation had pht4 boh buta hydrolysis debromination s 2 haloacid dehalogenase and bio mineralization gabd sdha of 4 bp were largely enhanced in nrbr moreover carbon nitrogen energy and amino acid metabolisms were significantly facilitated with the injection of nitrate in order to provide energy and electron thus enhanced microbial activities and enzymatic reactions in nrbr the proposed mechanism provides new insights into our mechanistic understanding of halogenated phenol biodegradation and the development of sustainable bioremediation strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 4 bromophenol nitrate reduction hydrolysis debromination mineralization synergistic mechanism 1 introduction halophenols hps compounds are considered as the potential endocrine disruptors and caused great environmental concern because their persistence bioaccumulation and high toxicity han et al 2022 among them bromophenols bps have received less attention as compared to others hps such as chlorophenols although their production has been much higher in recent years smulek et al 2017 bps as the important monomer have been widely employed in the production of propellants flame retardants herbicides preservatives and antifungal agent industries smulek et al 2017 min et al 2022 bps are rather persistent in natural environment and recalcitrant to biodegradation because their chemical stability lin et al 2021 with the extensive usage of the related products and effluent discharge bps will be ultimately released into the aquatic ecosystem thus posing significant hazards to environment and human health zhang et al 2023a 2023b accordingly it is critical to eliminate bps from contaminated wastewater and understand their environmental fate the existence of bromine atom with electron withdrawing property on aromatic ring makes bps electron deficient resulting in difficulty for benzene ring cleavage aerobically min et al 2022 li et al 2018 thus major bioremediation strategy for bps is anaerobic biodegradation while the reductive debromination process could be accomplished due to the lower oxidation reduction potential under anaerobic condition debromination process can make bps more biodegradable where debromination reaction was mainly mediated by reductive dehalogenase and then achieving toxic reduction products such as phenol yang et al 2021 however due to the lack of available electron acceptors the conventional anaerobic phenol biodegradation is usually limited by low removal efficiency and poor process stability recently the substantial promotion of recalcitrant pollutants biodegradation via the introduction of exogenous electron acceptors such as nitrate has been confirmed wang et al 2020 the injection of electron acceptors such as nitrate could serve as the electron reception tank which might be conducive to the enhanced organic contaminants catabolism xu et al 2015 nitrate as an essential nitrogenous composition and more favorable thermodynamic electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration plays the key role in the biological treatment of wastewater contaminated by aromatic compounds wang et al 2020 hou et al 2022 it was reported that aromatic compounds could be efficiently removed from contaminated wastewater under nitrate reduction condition wang et al 2020 derakhshan et al 2018 reported that the efficient removal of toxicity contamination atrazine was achieved with the introduction of nitrate and its removal rate was 6 fold of that in the control attribute to the occurrence of nitrate respiration pathway long et al 2020 2021 indicated that completely bio mineralization of 4 cp could be achieved at the presence of microbial denitrification our previous studies also have found that microbial denitrification could act as electronic receiving pools thus enhanced recalcitrant contaminants biodegradation via improving the activities of electron transport system and the key enzymes wang et al 2019 2022a however little is known regarding the changes in bps biodegradation performance microbial composition and metabolic mechanism under nitrate reducing condition moreover it was reported that aromatic compounds metabolism would be altered by the available electron acceptors for microbial respiration because of the limited reactive activity of aromatic compounds xu et al 2015 generally hydroxylation and ring cleavage reaction are the main steps for aromatic compounds biodegradation with oxygen as electron acceptor lu et al 2021 the involvement of fumaric acid plays the key activation role dominating organic contaminants biodegradation under sulfate reducing condition zhang et al 2021 under activated nitrate reducing condition carboxylation and methylation usually reported as the initial steps dominating organic contaminants metabolism zhang et al 2020 increasing evidences indicated that denitrifying bacteria could utilize various electron acceptors for microbial respiration when coupled with organic matters biodegradation aromatic ring cleavage and mineralization could be performed by denitrifying bacteria even under oxygen free condition li et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 found that microbial carboxylation could be activated and thus enhanced petroleum hydrocarbons biodegradation via the activated nitrate respiration yang et al 2020 indicated that the expression of functional genes responsible for aromatic compounds biodegradation would be up regulated under activated nitrate reducing condition our previous studies also demonstrated that the catalytic activities of functional enzymes mainly responsible for contaminant biodegradation were significantly enhanced in a nitrate reducing system wang et al 2019 these results well suggested that microbial metabolism would be accelerated via the injection of nitrate and the functional genes from nitrate respiration with bps catabolism capability might play the key roles however to our best knowledge microbial metabolic mechanism involved in bps biodegradation and the corresponding genomic characteristic under nitrate reducing condition have not been studied systematically therefore in this study two up flow bioreactors nitrate reducing bioreactor nrbr and anaerobic control bioreactor were designed to 1 reveal the effect of nitrate injection on bps biodegradation and microbial community evolution meanwhile 4 bromphenol 4 bp was selected as the typical bps compounds 2 explore the microbial metabolic mechanism involved in 4 bp biodegradation and nitrate reduction at the genetic level and further guidance the application of nitrate mediated bioremediation for bps contaminated wastewater these finding would enable the development of better strategies for facilitating the application of nitrate mediated bioremediation in the context of hps contaminated wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and synthetic wastewater in order to explore the impact of nitrate injection on 4 bp biodegradation two identical up flow bioreactors with available volume of 2 l were designed fig s1 one of the bioreactors fed with the synthetic wastewater containing nitrate was served as nrbr while the other identical bioreactor fed with the synthetic wastewater without nitrate served as the anaerobic control bioreactor the working temperature of both bioreactors was maintained at 30 c via thermostatic circulating water pump the seeding activated sludge that has been previously enriched in our laboratory and the initial mlss of the seeding sludge was 3 0 g l 1 before the experiment the seeding sludge washed for three times with 500 ml synthetic wastewater in order to remove nutrient medium the composition of the synthetic wastewater was formulated as follows g l 1 na2hpo4 12h2o 1 53 kh2po4 0 38 mgso4 7h2o 0 10 cacl2 0 05 and 10 ml l 1 trace element solution wang et al 2020 before fed into both bioreactors the dissolved oxygen concentration of the synthetic wastewater was 0 08 0 1 mg l 1 4 bp and nano3 were added at desired content and the molar ratio of 4 bp nitrate was 1 25 to create nitrate reducing environment 2 2 experimental operation both bioreactors were continuously operated for 215 days at different operating conditions with five phases table 1 in phase i i e the first 30 days both bioreactors were fed with the synthetic wastewater containing 4 bp concentration raised from 0 29 mm to 0 58 mm while hrt was controlled at 24 h resulting in influent 4 bp loading rate raised from 0 15 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 in addition the nitrate was dosed into nrbr with a corresponding loading rate ranged from 0 11 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 23 mol m 3 d 1 with ph was controlled at 7 0 in phase ii in order to investigate the nrbr performance when sustaining high strength 4 bp loading influent 4 bp concentration gradually raised from 0 58 mm to 1 45 mm while hrt was maintained at 24 h and thus 4 bp loading rate gradually increased from 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 73 mol m 3 d 1 in phase iii in order to examine the influence of hrt on 4 bp biodegradation nrbr were conducted with hrt declined from 72 h to 24 h while the influent 4 bp loading rate and ph were maintained at 0 73 mol m 3 d 1 and 7 0 respectively in phase iv the effect of initial ph on 4 bp removal performance was explored through adjusting the influent ph ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 meanwhile the influent 4 bp loading rate and hrt were controlled at 0 44 mol m 3 d 1 and 24 h respectively in phase v both bioreactors were continuously operated for another 60 days to explore the long term stability of reactor performance while the influent 4 bp loading rate hrt and ph were maintained at 0 44 mol m 3 d 1 24 h and 7 0 respectively 2 3 analytical methods 4 bp was quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc thermo scientific u3000 usa unit equipped with a c18 column while water sample was filtered through 0 22 μm filters before hplc analysis metabolites of 4 bp biodegradation were identified using an hplc ms unit equipped with dionex 3000 hplc system while the mass spectrometer was conducted in both positive and negative electrospray ionization mode and m z values were detected as previous reported wang et al 2019 before hplc ms analysis metabolites in water samples were concentrated and extracted according to our previous study wang et al 2018 toc concentration was detected by a toc analyzer vario elementar germany the br no3 and no2 contents were analyzed using an ion chromatography ic ics 2100 dionex usa both atp and nadh contents were detected using the commercial kits jingkang biological china and the activity of electron transport system ets was determined similar to previous paper wang et al 2019 2 4 microbial community analysis high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted to explore community structures of sludge samples at the end of the long term operation day 215 sludge samples were collected from both bioreactors to explore community structure and a sample taken from raw seeding sludge day 0 for 16s rrna gene sequencing as a contrast both amplification and sequencing process were carried out in majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified with the forward primer 338f 50 actcctacgggaggcagca 30 and the reverse primer 806r 50 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 30 for the v4 region the sequencing and data analysis were conducted according to our previous study wang et al 2020 2 5 metagenomic sequencing and analysis the sludge samples for metagenomic analysis were taken from both bioreactors on day 215 and then stored at 80 c for dna extraction genomic dna was extracted using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to manufacturer s instructions the content and purity of extracted genomic dna were confirmed by tbs 380 and nanodrop2000 respectively the genomic dna was fragmented to 400 bp used for paired end library construction sequencing library was generated using the nextflex rapid dna seq for illumina paired end sequencing was conducted on an illumina novaseq6000 platform at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china thereafter clean sequences were assembled into contigs 300 bp by megahit version 1 1 2 and then used for gene prediction and annotation the open reading frames orfs prediction of assembled contigs was performed using metagene the abundances of functional genes were calculated and compared using soap aligner version 2 21 with 95 identity the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and cluster of orthologous groups of proteins cog annotations were carried out using diamond software version 0 8 35 additionally the raw metagenomic sequencing data from both bioreactors was referred to ncbi s sequence read archive database with the numbers of srr23974524 and srr23974525 respectively 3 results 3 1 enhanced 4 bp biodegradation under nitrate reducing condition both nrbr and anaerobic control bioreactor were continuously operated and monitored to explore the effect of nitrate injection on 4 bp removal performance it was noticing that 4 bp could be efficiently removed in nrbr while the 4 bp removal efficiency rapidly increased from 88 56 1 34 on day 3 to 100 on day 5 at 4 bp loading rate of 0 15 mol m 3 d 1 thereafter the 4 bp could be completely degraded in the following 25 days in spite of the 4 bp loading rate raised up to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 fig 1 a however 4 bp biodegradation efficiency in the anaerobic control system was invariably within the low scope of 30 40 additionally more than 85 of toc could be removed in nrbr after day 11 while it was only account for 10 20 in the anaerobic control system fig 1b importantly 4 bp biodegradation without or minuscule phenol was produced in nrbr suggesting that the injection of nitrate activated 4 bp biodegradation without phenol accumulation fig 1c however 4 bp biodegradation resulted in significantly phenol production in the anaerobic control system while the content of phenol reached from 0 09 0 01 mm to 0 21 0 02 mm as influent 4 bp loading rate increased from 0 15 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 fig 1d the release of br was the key evidence for 4 bp biodegradation since previous reports indicated that halogenated organic compounds was usually converted to relative less toxicity dehalogenation products during biodegradation process yang et al 2021 in nrbr br content in the effluent was well matched with the bromine in the influent 4 bp as indicated by the effluent br concentration increased from 0 27 0 02 mm on day 7 to 0 54 0 03 mm on day 11 as 4 bp loading rate raised up to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 after day 10 fig 1b however the effluent br concentration in the anaerobic control system was only ranged from 0 11 0 02 mm to 0 20 0 01 mm despite influent 4 bp concentration raised from 0 29 mm to 0 58 mm fig 1d this phenomenon could be possibly attributed to the suppression of microbial activity caused by the residual 4 bp considering the fact that 4 bp was poorly removed under anaerobic fermentation condition wang et al 2020 specially nitrate was well reduced along with 4 bp debromination and biodegradation in nrbr as demonstrated by effluent no3 n concentration kept below 0 01 mm after day 7 fig 1a the effluent no2 n concentration was reached up to 0 05 mm within the first 11 days and then gradually lower than the detection line in the following 19 days fig 1a possibly due to the inadequate of electrons in the initial adaptation period wang et al 2019 based on the above analysis about 4 bp removal toc decrease no3 n reduction br release and phenol formation it could be speculated that 4 bp could be efficiently mineralized in nrbr whereas the involved microbial metabolic mechanism especially the bacterial response mechanism to nitrate injection is still unclear 3 2 possible biodegradation pathway of 4 bp under nitrate reducing condition in this study possible intermediates of 4 bp biodegradation in nrbr and anaerobic control system were detected using hplc and hplc ms analyses for anaerobic control system only phenol was detected at retention time of 4 63 min via comparison with the standard which was not further converted fig s2 however three new peaks were identified in nrbr at retention time of 3 03 min and 12 76 min fig s3 which could be presumed to 4 bromocatechol 4 bromo 6 oxo hexanoic acid and succinic acid respectively yang et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 luo et al 2014 based on the molecular stereochemistry structure and relative information of the inferred and detected intermediates probably 4 bp biodegradation pathways with and without nitrate injection are proposed as shown in fig 2 in the anaerobic control system 4 bp biodegradation resulted in phenol production via reductive debromination reaction generally the subsequent metabolism for debromination product that is anaerobic phenol biodegradation phenol needs to be converted into 4 hydroxybenzoate catalyzed by decarboxylase yang et al 2021 however phenol was the only observed metabolite in the anaerobic control system which was no further transformed probably due to the lack of available electron acceptor yang et al 2021 moreover the 4 bp removal efficiency in the anaerobic control system were around 35 40 fig 1c while the molar ratio of detected phenol to influent 4 bp was 30 35 indicating that the limited 4 bp anaerobic biodegradation resulted in obvious phenol accumulation agreeing with previous studies chen et al 2019b liang et al 2019 nitrate as the favorable thermodynamic electron acceptor can produce energy as much as oxygen that is essential to oxidation and mineralization of organic substrates thus accelerating aromatic compounds biodegradation xu et al 2015 zhai et al 2021 compared to the anaerobic control system there was no or trace phenol produced in nrbr suggesting the injection of nitrate plays the key role that affect the biotransformation pathway of 4 bp under activated nitrate reducing condition which was completely opposite to the observed 4 bp biodegradation pathway under anaerobic fermentation condition therefore it could be inferred that hydroxylation might be the first step during 4 bp biodegradation in nrbr with 4 bromocatechol produced via this reaction fig 2 then 4 bromocatechol could be converted into 4 bromo 6 oxo hexanoic acid through the cleavage of benzene ring which might be accomplished by denitrifying bacteria zhai et al 2021 luo et al 2014 after the sequential oxidation debromination and carboxylation another an important metabolite namely succinic acid was detected which could be further converted through tca cycle and then provide energy and electrons for microbial metabolism including nitrate reduction zhang et al 2023c this 4 bp biodegradation pathway has been reported in pure culture system by strain cupriavidus sp cnp 8 min et al 2022 the cluster hnpabc from cupriavidus sp cnp 8 that encoded functional enzymes dominating oxidation and hydrolytic dehalogenation reactions of hps which obviously different from the biodegradation pathways in other reported hps degraders such as reduction or oxidation dehalogenations min et al 2022 wang et al 2022b it could be speculated that hydrolytic debromination might be play a crucial role during 4 bp biodegradation process under activated nitrate reducing condition which was rather conducive to better reactor performance thus hydrolytic debromination of 4 bp in nrbr was analyzed and presented in another section below as discussed above the reductive debromination of 4 bp resulted in over 30 transformation into phenol during 4 bp biodegradation process in the anaerobic control system the occurrence of nitrate reduction was the key factor that affected 4 bp biodegradation pathway away from phenol generation in nrbr yang et al 2021 chen et al 2019b hydroxylation oxidation and debromination during 4 bp biodegradation process were accomplished by various functional microorganisms under activated nitrate reducing condition such as aromatic compounds degraders denitrifiers and electron transporters that is microorganisms dominating 4 bp biodegradation without phenol accumulation for example via aromatic ring cleavage pathway may have been displayed in the denitrifying culture which was utilized as the inoculum in nrbr therefore microbial metabolic mechanism and community evolution are analyzed and presented in another section below 3 3 the effect of key operational parameters 3 3 1 influent 4 bp concentration as illustrated in fig 3 with the influent 4 bp concentration increased from 0 58 mm to 0 87 mm 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were achieving 100 and 85 respectively indicating the excellent 4 bp removal performance in nrbr however with the influent 4 bp concentration increased to 1 16 mm 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were obviously decreased to 73 47 3 21 and 70 76 2 32 respectively thereafter both 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies sharply dropped to 54 43 2 21 and 50 11 1 78 when the influent 4 bp concentration was further raised up to 1 45 mm probably due to the toxicity exposed by high loading 4 bp in addition 4 bp debromination efficiency was slower along with the increase of influent 4 bp concentration as indicated by effluent br concentration was slightly increased from 0 51 0 07 mm to 0 67 0 03 mm with influent 4 bp concentration increased from 0 58 mm to 1 45 mm similarly no3 n removal efficiency was maintained above 95 with influent 4 bp concentration increased from 0 58 mm to 0 87 mm but then sharply dropped to 53 12 1 87 when the influent 4 bp concentration further raised up to 1 45 mm this result was mostly explained by the lower microbial activity and insufficient electron supply at the high strength 4 bp stress since 4 bp was the only possible electron donor for nitrate reduction in nrbr fang et al 2020 3 3 2 hrt it was reported that hrt plays a crucial role in biological wastewater treatment system due to recalcitrant pollutants biodegradation is directly linked to hrt wang et al 2022a as illustrated in fig 3 the nrbr indicated a stable reactor performance related to 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies when hrt was ranged from 72 h to 48 h under activated nitrate reducing condition however with the decrease of hrt to 36 h both 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were dropped to around 80 and 70 respectively further decrease of hrt to 24 h resulted in significant exacerbation of reactor in terms of 4 bp and toc removal in nrbr similarly br was well released along with 4 bp biodegradation while the debromination efficiency was always above 95 with hrt decreased from 72 h to 48 h but then sharply declined to 54 50 4 79 with hrt further declined to 24 h additionally as hrt dropped from 72 h to 48 h no3 n reduction efficiency was well above 97 whereas abundant remanent of no3 was detected in the effluent at hrt decreased to 24 h this phenomenon could be caused by the low nitrate reducing activity when high strength recalcitrant contaminants was utilized as carbon source jin et al 2022 li et al 2022 consequently longer hrt was supposed to consider when low quality substrate such as 4 bp was used 3 3 3 ph it was well known that ph value is an important factor for xenobiotics bioprocess due to the removal performance of various contaminants is associated with ph closely wang et al 2020 during phase iv the initial ph value was adjusted from 6 0 to 8 0 so as to explore the impact of initial ph on 4 bp biodegradation in nrbr as illustrated in fig 3 with the influent ph increased from 6 0 to 7 0 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were increased from 91 35 2 45 and 83 45 2 21 to 100 and 94 65 3 23 respectively however obvious deterioration of the reactor performance related to 4 bp and toc removal was monitored when the initial ph raised up to 8 0 which might be due to the suppression of microbial activity under alkaline environment wang et al 2022a du et al 2022 in addition the optimal nitrate reduction performance was detected at ph of 7 0 while the debromination and no3 n reduction efficiencies were well above 95 therefore in consideration of 4 bp removal debromination toc removal and no3 n reduction profiles in nrbr it could be inferred that the optimum microbial activity and reactor performance were obtained under the neutral condition consistent with our previous report wang et al 2020 3 3 4 long term performance during phase v reactor performance was monitored for another 60 days at influent 4 bp concentration and hrt adjusted to 0 87 mm and 24 h respectively in order to further explore the effect of long term nitrate injection on 4 bp biodegradation as shown in fig 3 completely 4 bp removal was obtained after day 165 while the measured br concentration of 0 83 0 02 mm which was well matched with the theoretical br releasing concentration meanwhile toc removal efficiency increased from 75 26 3 41 on day 158 to 82 47 2 53 on day 162 whereafter maintained above 85 in the rest of the long term period correspondingly no3 n reduction efficiency increased from 88 54 2 43 on day 156 to 98 45 1 51 on day 165 which was then kept above 95 in the following 50 days however 4 bp removal and toc removal efficiencies always in the low range of 30 45 and 20 30 in the anaerobic control bioreactor fig s4 these results demonstrated that the stable long term reactor performance could be obtained in nrbr indicating that the practical application of nrbr would be viable for bioremediation of hps contaminated environment 3 4 microbial community structure in order to gain better insight into the impact of nitrate injection on microbial evolution microbial community structure was analyzed via high throughput sequencing the key parameters associated with community diversity and richness were summarized in table s1 compared with the seeding sludge long term 4 bp loading caused apparent decrease in community diversity and richness as indicated by the relative lower chao1 ace and shannon indexes in both bioreactors in addition the principal component analysis showed that community structure in the anaerobic control system and nrbr have been markedly changed from the seeding sludge while the microbial composition in nrbr was also significantly changed from the anaerobic control system fig s5 these results indicated that bacterial metabolism sensitive to the toxicity of 4 bp could be repressed which agrees with the observation that the injection of nitrate could be induce the microbial community selection enrichment jin et al 2022 du et al 2022 community composition analysis at the phylum level indicated that the microbial population in seeding sludge was dominated by proteobacteria 25 58 chloroflexi 22 65 actinobacteriota 19 26 and bacteroidota 11 01 fig 4 a after the long term habituation to high 4 bp loading community composition was changed distinctly among them the relative abundance of actinobacteriota control 8 44 nrbr 3 26 was significantly decreased in both bioreactors suggesting the suppression of bacteria within this phylum it was reported that patescibacteria and fibrobacterota were the excellent organic contaminants degrading bacteria capable of denitrifying while the relative abundances significantly increased from 4 66 and 0 07 to 15 33 and 5 33 in nrbr frey et al 2016 azizan et al 2022 xu et al 2022 the enrichment of bacteria within these phyla might be play the key role in microbial metabolism in contrast the relative abundance of proteobacteria which was the important aromatic compound degrader capable of denitrifying sharply dropped to 20 80 in nrbr suggesting the inhibition of proteobacteria by the toxicity of 4 bp ren et al 2022 huang et al 2022 the bacterial category classification at the genus level showed that candidatus peregrinibacteria 11 04 denitratisoma 9 90 chitinivibrionia 5 33 sbr1031 5 28 olb14 5 12 anaerolineaceae 3 44 candidatus protochlamydia 2 71 abditibacterium 2 49 sumerlaeia 1 91 thiobacillus denitrifier 1 88 limnobacter denitrifier 1 44 zixibacteria 1 15 taonella 1 08 and ignavibacterium denitrifier 1 02 were the dominant genera in nrbr as compared to the anaerobic control system fig 4b 4c among the 17 abundant genera relative abundance 0 5 observed in nrbr candidatus peregrinibacteria was present with the most abundant species in nrbr candidatus peregrinibacteria was frequently detected in the contaminated wastewater containing br and no3 which showing positively correlated with br content the high abundance of candidatus peregrinibacteria might be account for the enhanced 4 bp debromination and biodegradation sulowicz et al 2020 chen et al 2019a genus denitratisoma were the representative denitrifying bacteria could degrade various complex substrates and halogenated contaminants qin et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 the high relative abundance of denitratisoma might be responsible for the enhanced debromination and biodegradation of 4 bp sbr1031 which was a member of the class anaerolineae might be responsible for the catabolism of aromatic heterocyclic compounds via hydrolysis and acidification pathways zheng et al 2021 hua et al 2020 genus anaerolineaceae which was an excellent nitrite reductor showing excellent performance in terms of efficient biodegradation of brominated aromatic hydrocarbon han et al 2021 wei et al 2022 the bacteria olb14 was found to be involved in nitrogen metabolism via establishing nitrate and nitrite cycle whereas the high strength 4 bp loading inhibit its proliferation zhao et al 2021 candidatus protochlamydia might be responsible for the efficient mineralization of 4 bp since genus candidatus protochlamydia strongly correlated with pharmaceutical and personal care product especially in halogenated compound sufficient condition liu et al 2021 thiobacillus was reported to be involved in nitrate reduction through utilizing recalcitrant pollutants as electron donor and energy source shi et al 2022 limnobacter was a distinguished denitrifier which was demonstrated to has capacity of degrading phenol catalyzed by hydroxylase even under hypoxic and anoxic conditions povedano priego et al 2022 vedler et al 2013 taonella could metabolize aromatic compounds and hydrocarbon contaminations kong et al 2021 ignavibacterium was found to be a representative heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium could degrade aromatic compounds and methane through oxidation pathway wan et al 2022 chai et al 2020 as compared with the anaerobic control system the growth of bps debromination and biodegradation functional species candidatus peregrinibacteria denitratisoma anaerolineae anaerolineaceae candidatus protochlamydia limnobacter taonella ignavibacterium as well as nitrate reducing species denitratisoma anaerolineaceae thiobacillus limnobacter taonella ignavibacterium was significantly facilitated in nrbr after the long term adaption to high 4 bp loading therefore the enrichment of these functional bacteria would be conducive to the incremental 4 bp debromination and bio mineralization as well as nitrate reduction in nrbr 3 5 the injection of nitrate stimulated microbial metabolism the response system of bacteria it has been reported that the injection of nitrate can accelerate organic matters biodegradation through promoting electron production and consumption among others wang et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 electron transport system ets deemed a key mechanism of substrates catabolism which plays an important protection role against biotoxicity stress from contaminants accumulation wang et al 2020 in this study metagenomic analysis results indicated that the transmembrane transport of substrate electron and among others were enhanced as evidenced by the key genes encoding these transporters were significantly up regulated in nrbr such as abc type transporters table s2 the ets activity assay indicated that the relative activity of microbial ets in nrbr was 2 fold of that in the anaerobic control system fig 5 a which was consistent with the up regulated cytochrome c fbch ccon table s3 moreover the up regulation of protein export ko03060 also supporting this point fig s6 suggesting that the bacterial secretion system was activated after the injection of nitrate and thus the microbial ets was triggered these results indicated that the injection of nitrate stimulated bacterial response system bacterial secretion system and protein export resulting in the enhanced microbial activity and metabolism as shown in fig s6 kegg pathway analysis indicated that the enrichment functional genes in nrbr were related to seven metabolic pathways including citrate tca cycle ko00020 degradation of aromatic compounds ko01220 protein export ko03060 bacterial secretion system ko03070 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 d glutamate metabolism ko00471 carbon metabolism ko01200 and ribosome ko03010 the significant enrichment of tca cycle further indicated that electron provision and energy metabolism could be enhanced after the injection of nitrate which was also responsible for the enhanced enzymatic reaction resulting in the enhanced microbial metabolism xiao et al 2023 cog enrichments revealed that energy production and conversion amino acid transport and metabolism coenzyme transport and metabolism lipid transport and metabolism signal transduction mechanism intracellular trafficking secretion and vesicular transport were significantly enrichment in nrbr fig s7 most of them were responsible for the decomposition and synthesis of substances in order to sustain cell growth and energy metabolism xiao et al 2023 moreover the up regulated transporters might be conducive to substrate such as 4 bp diffusion into intracellular during microbial metabolism since most of transmembrane transporters could transport substrate binding proteins such as abc transporter wang et al 2020 lu et al 2019 these results indicated that the injection of nitrate induced microbes were more active and energetic in nrbr compared to the anaerobic control system resulting in the enhanced microbial activity metabolism and energy provision nitrogen metabolism it was well known that microbial denitrification was often accomplished intracellularly through the sequence of biological reduction reactions which were driven by electron transport system wang et al 2020 from metagenomic analysis results the abundance of key genes responsible for microbial denitrification and nitrate reduction such as nitrate reductase nar narb ferredoxin nasab unknown acceptors narghi quinone napab cytochrome nitrite reductase nir nira ferredoxin nrfah cytochrome ammonia forming nirks nitric oxide reductase nor norbc cytochrome c and nitrous oxide reductase n2or nosz were significantly up regulated in nrbr compared to the anaerobic control system fig 6 table s4 the most importantly reason was that the injection of nitrate stimulated microbes created more appropriate circumstance for multiplication of microorganisms dominating nitrate reduction resulting in up regulated of the above functional enzymes and thus promoting nitrogen metabolism in contrast fewer nitrate reducers denitratisoma anaerolineaceae limnobacter and ignavibacterium etc appeared in the anaerobic control system fig 4 these results were consistent with the profile of nitrate removal which might be the most likely reason for enhanced enzymatic activities and nitrogen metabolism in nrbr in addition the nitrogen sources could be further converted into ammonium through nira or nrfah dominated nitrogen transformation pathway and then metabolized via l glutamate pathway which could be further utilized by functional microorganisms such as nitrate reducers to sustain cell growth and other nitrogen related metabolism xiao et al 2023 carbon metabolism nitrate reduction is an energy consuming pathway that requires electron and reducing power for biological transformation of nitrate to nitrogen xu et al 2015 similar to our previous studies 4 bp metabolites could enter into tca cycle to neutralize the toxic effects from 4 bp accumulation wang et al 2019 2022a the up regulated tca cycle in nrbr indicated that electron provision and energy metabolism could be enhanced after nitrate injection since 4 bp metabolism is an energy generating pathway moreover the up regulated nitrogen metabolism would be contributed to the enhanced 4 bp catabolism since nitrate as electron acceptor can produce nearly as much energy as oxygen leading to organic contaminants catabolism and thus enhancing oxidation and mineralization of 4 bp zhai et al 2021 it was found that the key genes encoding functional enzymes dominating 4 bp biodegradation were significantly up regulated in nrbr such as ethylbenzene hydroxylase ebda ec 1 17 99 2 and hydratase dch ec 4 2 1 100 which were responsible for 4 bp hydroxylation at the beginning of aromatic ring catabolism 6 hydroxycyclohex 1 ene 1 carbonyl coa dehydrogenase had ec 1 1 1 368 and phthalate 4 5 cis dihydrodiol dehydrogenase pht4 ec 1 3 1 64 which both activated the ring opening and oxidation of aromatic compounds s 2 haloacid dehalogenase ec 3 8 1 2 which was responsible for hydrolysis dehalogenase of 4 bp and bromine intermediates 1 butanol dehydrogenase quinone boh ec 1 1 5 11 and s s butanediol dehydrogenase buta ec 1 1 1 76 which were accounted for the dehydrogenation and mineralization of 4 bp and intermediates fig 6 table s4 as the dominating metabolites of 4 bp biodegradation succinate semialdehyde and succinate acid can reach tca cycle to provide electrons and energy for supporting microbial metabolism while the functional genes encoding succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gabd ec 1 2 1 16 ec 1 2 1 79 and succinate dehydrogenase sdha ec 1 3 5 1 were significantly up regulated in nrbr wang et al 2019 contents of the electron carrier nadh and energy atp was thereby increased while the concentrations of nadh and atp in nrbr was 1 65 fold and 2 15 fold of those in the anaerobic control system fig 5a moreover the up regulated functional gene encoding nadh reductase e g ec 1 6 5 9 and ec 7 2 1 1 and atpase e g ec 5 6 1 9 well match with the enhanced nadh and atp concentrations suggesting that the injection of nitrate promoted the microbial ets activity and atp synthesis fig 5b 5c table s3 clearly the injection of nitrate promoted electron provision and energy metabolism thus accelerated electron donor catabolism and electron supplying capacity and finally enhanced 4 bp biodegradation biosynthesis of amino acids the up regulation of amino acid biosynthesis pathway in nrbr promoted 10 amino acid metabolisms including histidine tryptophan tyrosine valine leucine isoleucine lysine arginine proline glutamine fig 6 table s5 most of them especially tyrosine and lysine are the dominating components of protein synthesis that play a protective role against recalcitrant substances by absorbing toxic contaminants such as 4 bp jia et al 2022 in addition the hydrophobic amino acids such as tryptophan valine leucine and isoleucine metabolisms were remarkably up regulated in nrbr which might be respond to the requirement of protein synthesis and export for enhancing extracellular structures fig s7 table s5 suggesting that nitrate mediated microorganisms had a high capacity for amino acids synthesis jia et al 2022 in addition the key genes encoding functional enzymes responsible for atp synthesis ec 5 6 1 9 and ec 7 2 2 21 etc nadh synthesis ec 1 6 5 9 and ec 7 2 1 1 etc and electron proton transfer ec 7 1 1 8 and ec 7 1 1 9 were dramatically enriched in nrbr assisted with nitrate injection table s3 correspondingly the contents of atp and nadh as well as the relative activity of microbial ets in nrbr were obviously higher than those in the anaerobic control system without nitrate fig 5a 4 discussion the widespread pollution of deleterious and persistent hps in aquatic ecosystem has caused the serious environmental problem the intervention of electron acceptor such as nitrate has been considered as a feasible approach to enhance hps biodegradation in wastewater treatment system wang et al 2020 xu et al 2015 long et al 2021 studying the mechanism involved in bacterial response system 4 bp biodegradation and nitrate reduction respond to the injection of nitrate is essential for developing bioremediation strategy however limited studies had previously explored the effect of nitrate injection on ecosystem and microbiomes during bps biodegradation process especially the microbial response mechanism to bps stress under nitrate reducing condition herein we explored the effect of long term nitrate injection on 4 bp biodegradation microbial metabolism community evolution and genomic characteristics in a nitrate reducing system the above results indicated that long term nitrate injection significantly accelerated debromination and mineralization of 4 bp suggesting that microorganisms adapted to nitrate reducing environment changes induced by the injection of nitrate and preserve the stability of nitrate reducing system 4 bp biodegradation pathway activated by nitrate injection in nrbr which was overcoming the limits of 4 bp partial biodegradation and phenol accumulation in the anaerobic control system resulting in the efficient hydrolysis debromination oxidation and mineralization of 4 bp microbial community analysis revealed that the injection of nitrate remarkably affected community structure in which a prominent enrichment of functional species with high tolerance to 4 bp loading under nitrate reducing condition e g candidatus peregrinibacteria peregrinibacteria and denitratisoma etc therefore these microbes became the predominant in nrbr and various strategies were developed by these bacteria to cope with 4 bp and nitrate induced stress as illustrated in fig 7 first exogenous 4 bp and nitrate stress message was promptly conveyed through ribosome hif 1 and p53 signaling pathways involving ribosomal proteins and signal peptidases e g ribosomal protein l3 and signal peptidase i table s6 as indicated by the up regulation of the key genes encoding these signaling proteins jia et al 2022 thereafter bacterial response system such as bacterial secretion system and electron transport system were activated in order to accelerate 4 bp catabolism and reduce the cell damage caused by toxic 4 bp accumulation subsequently the up regulated bacterial response system stimulated protein synthesis and export as well as biofilm formation resulting in the enhanced stability of cell member skeleton and reduce cell breakage which was also conducive to degrade 4 bp after tightly binding with 4 bp importantly intracellular 4 bp could be converted into less toxic metabolites such as succinate acid which catalyzed by the corresponding functional enzymes e g hydrolase dehydrogenase and dehalogenase etc it was worth noting that the relative abundances of the key functional enzymes dominating 4 bp biodegradation such as hydroxylase ebda and hydratase dch dehydrogenase had s 2 haloacid dehalogenase 1 butanol dehydrogenase quinone boh and s s butanediol dehydrogenase buta succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gabd and succinate dehydrogenase frda were largely increased in nrbr among them s 2 haloacid dehalogenase activated the debromination of 4 bp and its bromine intermediates via hydrolysis dehalogenation pathway without electron or energy consumption which was rather conducive to better debromination and mineralization performance of 4 bp moreover the up regulated protein synthesis and export activated nitrogen metabolism while the functional genes involved in nitrate reduction were significantly up regulated table s4 bacterial secretion system responds to exogenous stress e g 4 bp and nitrate protein export and nitrate metabolism all require electron donors nadh and reduction energy atp which produced from 4 bp catabolism wang et al 2020 jia et al 2022 enzymatic activity assays demonstrated that the injection of nitrate stimulated an increase in atp and nadh contents as well as the relative activity of microbial ets fig 5 while the key functional genes were up regulated table s3 these results clearly confirmed that the injection of nitrate dramatically enhanced energy generation and electron transport furthermore these findings also indicated that nitrate injection activated carbon metabolism to accelerate energy generation and electron provision as evidenced by the up regulation of functional genes responsible for 4 bp biodegradation and tca cycle fig 6 table s4 while the metabolites such as succinate acid could be utilized as electron donor via enter into tca cycle wang et al 2019 similar microbial response behavior had been reported in previous studies that nitrate stimulated microbial metabolism including energy metabolism and carbon metabolism while the complete biodegradation of aromatic compounds and phenolic compounds could be obtained under activated nitrate reducing condition xu et al 2015 zhai et al 2021 this means that the microorganisms in nrbr tended to form a particular pattern to maintain better microbial activity and overcome the biotoxicity from recalcitrant contaminants accumulation to our knowledge this is the first exploration of microbial metabolic mechanism involved in bacterial response system 4 bp biodegradation and nitrate reduction from the reactor performance community evolution microbial metabolism and genetic characteristic which would provide fundamental information and aid our mechanistic understanding for biological wastewater treatment containing recalcitrant contaminants such as bps generally 4 bp was usually transformed into phenol under anaerobic fermentative condition surprisingly 4 bp biotransformation in nrbr is completely opposite to the conventional anaerobic 4 bp biodegradation pathway while the hydrolysis debromination of 4 bp was different from reduction or oxidation dehalogenation pathways fig 6 these might be explained by the injection of nitrate has stimulating microbial activity and enzymatic reactions resulting in the enhanced aromatic ring opening hydrolysis debromination and bio mineralization performance of 4 bp looking into the microbial metabolic mechanism involved 4 bp biodegradation in nitrate mediated biological treatment system could guidance us in discovering of potential bioremediation strategy in order to maintain the stability of biological treatment system when suffering hps contaminated wastewater conclusion the present study explored the impact of nitrate injection on reactor performance 4 bp biodegradation pathway and community evolution in a nitrate reducing system and the synergetic microbial metabolic mechanism was comprehensively clarified our results revealed that hydrolysis debromination and mineralization of 4 bp were significantly enhanced in nrbr compared to the anaerobic control system nitrate injection changed community structure leading to the enrichment of species related to 4 bp debromination biodegradation and nitrate reduction based on metagenomics analyses and enzymatic activity assays the injection of nitrate induced bacterial secretion system including protein synthesis and export as well as electron transport thus stimulating carbon nitrogen energy and amino acid metabolisms to promote energy generation and electron provision and then enhanced microbial activities importantly 4 bp biodegradation pathway activated by nitrate injection which overcomes the limit of 4 bp partial biodegradation and phenol accumulation under anaerobic condition resulting in efficient hydrolysis oxidation and mineralization of 4 bp in nrbr the above findings would be providing a new insight into the development of bioremediation strategies to maintain the stability of biological treatment system when treating high strength hps polluted wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

14649,due to the recalcitrant nature of halogenated phenol conventional anaerobic bioprocess is often limited by low removal efficiency and poor process stability at the presence of electron acceptors such as nitrate 4 bromophenol 4 bp removal efficiency is significantly higher than that in the anaerobic control system but the mechanism involved is still unclear therefore an up flow nitrate reducing bioreactor nrbr was designed and consecutively performed for 215 days to explore the synergistic mechanism for bps biodegradation and nitrate reduction complete 4 bp biodegradation could be obtained in nrbr at hrt and 4 bp loading rate of 24 h and 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 while the toc removal and nitrate reduction efficiencies were as high as 91 33 2 11 and 98 31 1 33 respectively population evolution analyses revealed that the microorganisms involved in 4 bp debromination and biodegradation candidatus peregrinibacteria denitratisoma anaerolineaceae and ignavibacterium as well as nitrate reduction denitratisoma anaerolineaceae limnobacter and ignavibacterium were significantly enriched in nrbr major intermediates during 4 bp biodegradation including 4 bromocatechol 4 bromo 6 oxo hexanoic acid and succinic acid were identified while a distinct 4 bp biodegradation pathway via hydration aromatic ring cleavage hydrolysis debromination and oxidation was expounded metagenomic analysis indicated that oxidation had pht4 boh buta hydrolysis debromination s 2 haloacid dehalogenase and bio mineralization gabd sdha of 4 bp were largely enhanced in nrbr moreover carbon nitrogen energy and amino acid metabolisms were significantly facilitated with the injection of nitrate in order to provide energy and electron thus enhanced microbial activities and enzymatic reactions in nrbr the proposed mechanism provides new insights into our mechanistic understanding of halogenated phenol biodegradation and the development of sustainable bioremediation strategies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords 4 bromophenol nitrate reduction hydrolysis debromination mineralization synergistic mechanism 1 introduction halophenols hps compounds are considered as the potential endocrine disruptors and caused great environmental concern because their persistence bioaccumulation and high toxicity han et al 2022 among them bromophenols bps have received less attention as compared to others hps such as chlorophenols although their production has been much higher in recent years smulek et al 2017 bps as the important monomer have been widely employed in the production of propellants flame retardants herbicides preservatives and antifungal agent industries smulek et al 2017 min et al 2022 bps are rather persistent in natural environment and recalcitrant to biodegradation because their chemical stability lin et al 2021 with the extensive usage of the related products and effluent discharge bps will be ultimately released into the aquatic ecosystem thus posing significant hazards to environment and human health zhang et al 2023a 2023b accordingly it is critical to eliminate bps from contaminated wastewater and understand their environmental fate the existence of bromine atom with electron withdrawing property on aromatic ring makes bps electron deficient resulting in difficulty for benzene ring cleavage aerobically min et al 2022 li et al 2018 thus major bioremediation strategy for bps is anaerobic biodegradation while the reductive debromination process could be accomplished due to the lower oxidation reduction potential under anaerobic condition debromination process can make bps more biodegradable where debromination reaction was mainly mediated by reductive dehalogenase and then achieving toxic reduction products such as phenol yang et al 2021 however due to the lack of available electron acceptors the conventional anaerobic phenol biodegradation is usually limited by low removal efficiency and poor process stability recently the substantial promotion of recalcitrant pollutants biodegradation via the introduction of exogenous electron acceptors such as nitrate has been confirmed wang et al 2020 the injection of electron acceptors such as nitrate could serve as the electron reception tank which might be conducive to the enhanced organic contaminants catabolism xu et al 2015 nitrate as an essential nitrogenous composition and more favorable thermodynamic electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration plays the key role in the biological treatment of wastewater contaminated by aromatic compounds wang et al 2020 hou et al 2022 it was reported that aromatic compounds could be efficiently removed from contaminated wastewater under nitrate reduction condition wang et al 2020 derakhshan et al 2018 reported that the efficient removal of toxicity contamination atrazine was achieved with the introduction of nitrate and its removal rate was 6 fold of that in the control attribute to the occurrence of nitrate respiration pathway long et al 2020 2021 indicated that completely bio mineralization of 4 cp could be achieved at the presence of microbial denitrification our previous studies also have found that microbial denitrification could act as electronic receiving pools thus enhanced recalcitrant contaminants biodegradation via improving the activities of electron transport system and the key enzymes wang et al 2019 2022a however little is known regarding the changes in bps biodegradation performance microbial composition and metabolic mechanism under nitrate reducing condition moreover it was reported that aromatic compounds metabolism would be altered by the available electron acceptors for microbial respiration because of the limited reactive activity of aromatic compounds xu et al 2015 generally hydroxylation and ring cleavage reaction are the main steps for aromatic compounds biodegradation with oxygen as electron acceptor lu et al 2021 the involvement of fumaric acid plays the key activation role dominating organic contaminants biodegradation under sulfate reducing condition zhang et al 2021 under activated nitrate reducing condition carboxylation and methylation usually reported as the initial steps dominating organic contaminants metabolism zhang et al 2020 increasing evidences indicated that denitrifying bacteria could utilize various electron acceptors for microbial respiration when coupled with organic matters biodegradation aromatic ring cleavage and mineralization could be performed by denitrifying bacteria even under oxygen free condition li et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 found that microbial carboxylation could be activated and thus enhanced petroleum hydrocarbons biodegradation via the activated nitrate respiration yang et al 2020 indicated that the expression of functional genes responsible for aromatic compounds biodegradation would be up regulated under activated nitrate reducing condition our previous studies also demonstrated that the catalytic activities of functional enzymes mainly responsible for contaminant biodegradation were significantly enhanced in a nitrate reducing system wang et al 2019 these results well suggested that microbial metabolism would be accelerated via the injection of nitrate and the functional genes from nitrate respiration with bps catabolism capability might play the key roles however to our best knowledge microbial metabolic mechanism involved in bps biodegradation and the corresponding genomic characteristic under nitrate reducing condition have not been studied systematically therefore in this study two up flow bioreactors nitrate reducing bioreactor nrbr and anaerobic control bioreactor were designed to 1 reveal the effect of nitrate injection on bps biodegradation and microbial community evolution meanwhile 4 bromphenol 4 bp was selected as the typical bps compounds 2 explore the microbial metabolic mechanism involved in 4 bp biodegradation and nitrate reduction at the genetic level and further guidance the application of nitrate mediated bioremediation for bps contaminated wastewater these finding would enable the development of better strategies for facilitating the application of nitrate mediated bioremediation in the context of hps contaminated wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor setup and synthetic wastewater in order to explore the impact of nitrate injection on 4 bp biodegradation two identical up flow bioreactors with available volume of 2 l were designed fig s1 one of the bioreactors fed with the synthetic wastewater containing nitrate was served as nrbr while the other identical bioreactor fed with the synthetic wastewater without nitrate served as the anaerobic control bioreactor the working temperature of both bioreactors was maintained at 30 c via thermostatic circulating water pump the seeding activated sludge that has been previously enriched in our laboratory and the initial mlss of the seeding sludge was 3 0 g l 1 before the experiment the seeding sludge washed for three times with 500 ml synthetic wastewater in order to remove nutrient medium the composition of the synthetic wastewater was formulated as follows g l 1 na2hpo4 12h2o 1 53 kh2po4 0 38 mgso4 7h2o 0 10 cacl2 0 05 and 10 ml l 1 trace element solution wang et al 2020 before fed into both bioreactors the dissolved oxygen concentration of the synthetic wastewater was 0 08 0 1 mg l 1 4 bp and nano3 were added at desired content and the molar ratio of 4 bp nitrate was 1 25 to create nitrate reducing environment 2 2 experimental operation both bioreactors were continuously operated for 215 days at different operating conditions with five phases table 1 in phase i i e the first 30 days both bioreactors were fed with the synthetic wastewater containing 4 bp concentration raised from 0 29 mm to 0 58 mm while hrt was controlled at 24 h resulting in influent 4 bp loading rate raised from 0 15 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 in addition the nitrate was dosed into nrbr with a corresponding loading rate ranged from 0 11 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 23 mol m 3 d 1 with ph was controlled at 7 0 in phase ii in order to investigate the nrbr performance when sustaining high strength 4 bp loading influent 4 bp concentration gradually raised from 0 58 mm to 1 45 mm while hrt was maintained at 24 h and thus 4 bp loading rate gradually increased from 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 73 mol m 3 d 1 in phase iii in order to examine the influence of hrt on 4 bp biodegradation nrbr were conducted with hrt declined from 72 h to 24 h while the influent 4 bp loading rate and ph were maintained at 0 73 mol m 3 d 1 and 7 0 respectively in phase iv the effect of initial ph on 4 bp removal performance was explored through adjusting the influent ph ranged from 6 0 to 8 0 meanwhile the influent 4 bp loading rate and hrt were controlled at 0 44 mol m 3 d 1 and 24 h respectively in phase v both bioreactors were continuously operated for another 60 days to explore the long term stability of reactor performance while the influent 4 bp loading rate hrt and ph were maintained at 0 44 mol m 3 d 1 24 h and 7 0 respectively 2 3 analytical methods 4 bp was quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc thermo scientific u3000 usa unit equipped with a c18 column while water sample was filtered through 0 22 μm filters before hplc analysis metabolites of 4 bp biodegradation were identified using an hplc ms unit equipped with dionex 3000 hplc system while the mass spectrometer was conducted in both positive and negative electrospray ionization mode and m z values were detected as previous reported wang et al 2019 before hplc ms analysis metabolites in water samples were concentrated and extracted according to our previous study wang et al 2018 toc concentration was detected by a toc analyzer vario elementar germany the br no3 and no2 contents were analyzed using an ion chromatography ic ics 2100 dionex usa both atp and nadh contents were detected using the commercial kits jingkang biological china and the activity of electron transport system ets was determined similar to previous paper wang et al 2019 2 4 microbial community analysis high throughput 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted to explore community structures of sludge samples at the end of the long term operation day 215 sludge samples were collected from both bioreactors to explore community structure and a sample taken from raw seeding sludge day 0 for 16s rrna gene sequencing as a contrast both amplification and sequencing process were carried out in majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified with the forward primer 338f 50 actcctacgggaggcagca 30 and the reverse primer 806r 50 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 30 for the v4 region the sequencing and data analysis were conducted according to our previous study wang et al 2020 2 5 metagenomic sequencing and analysis the sludge samples for metagenomic analysis were taken from both bioreactors on day 215 and then stored at 80 c for dna extraction genomic dna was extracted using e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to manufacturer s instructions the content and purity of extracted genomic dna were confirmed by tbs 380 and nanodrop2000 respectively the genomic dna was fragmented to 400 bp used for paired end library construction sequencing library was generated using the nextflex rapid dna seq for illumina paired end sequencing was conducted on an illumina novaseq6000 platform at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china thereafter clean sequences were assembled into contigs 300 bp by megahit version 1 1 2 and then used for gene prediction and annotation the open reading frames orfs prediction of assembled contigs was performed using metagene the abundances of functional genes were calculated and compared using soap aligner version 2 21 with 95 identity the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg and cluster of orthologous groups of proteins cog annotations were carried out using diamond software version 0 8 35 additionally the raw metagenomic sequencing data from both bioreactors was referred to ncbi s sequence read archive database with the numbers of srr23974524 and srr23974525 respectively 3 results 3 1 enhanced 4 bp biodegradation under nitrate reducing condition both nrbr and anaerobic control bioreactor were continuously operated and monitored to explore the effect of nitrate injection on 4 bp removal performance it was noticing that 4 bp could be efficiently removed in nrbr while the 4 bp removal efficiency rapidly increased from 88 56 1 34 on day 3 to 100 on day 5 at 4 bp loading rate of 0 15 mol m 3 d 1 thereafter the 4 bp could be completely degraded in the following 25 days in spite of the 4 bp loading rate raised up to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 fig 1 a however 4 bp biodegradation efficiency in the anaerobic control system was invariably within the low scope of 30 40 additionally more than 85 of toc could be removed in nrbr after day 11 while it was only account for 10 20 in the anaerobic control system fig 1b importantly 4 bp biodegradation without or minuscule phenol was produced in nrbr suggesting that the injection of nitrate activated 4 bp biodegradation without phenol accumulation fig 1c however 4 bp biodegradation resulted in significantly phenol production in the anaerobic control system while the content of phenol reached from 0 09 0 01 mm to 0 21 0 02 mm as influent 4 bp loading rate increased from 0 15 mol m 3 d 1 to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 fig 1d the release of br was the key evidence for 4 bp biodegradation since previous reports indicated that halogenated organic compounds was usually converted to relative less toxicity dehalogenation products during biodegradation process yang et al 2021 in nrbr br content in the effluent was well matched with the bromine in the influent 4 bp as indicated by the effluent br concentration increased from 0 27 0 02 mm on day 7 to 0 54 0 03 mm on day 11 as 4 bp loading rate raised up to 0 29 mol m 3 d 1 after day 10 fig 1b however the effluent br concentration in the anaerobic control system was only ranged from 0 11 0 02 mm to 0 20 0 01 mm despite influent 4 bp concentration raised from 0 29 mm to 0 58 mm fig 1d this phenomenon could be possibly attributed to the suppression of microbial activity caused by the residual 4 bp considering the fact that 4 bp was poorly removed under anaerobic fermentation condition wang et al 2020 specially nitrate was well reduced along with 4 bp debromination and biodegradation in nrbr as demonstrated by effluent no3 n concentration kept below 0 01 mm after day 7 fig 1a the effluent no2 n concentration was reached up to 0 05 mm within the first 11 days and then gradually lower than the detection line in the following 19 days fig 1a possibly due to the inadequate of electrons in the initial adaptation period wang et al 2019 based on the above analysis about 4 bp removal toc decrease no3 n reduction br release and phenol formation it could be speculated that 4 bp could be efficiently mineralized in nrbr whereas the involved microbial metabolic mechanism especially the bacterial response mechanism to nitrate injection is still unclear 3 2 possible biodegradation pathway of 4 bp under nitrate reducing condition in this study possible intermediates of 4 bp biodegradation in nrbr and anaerobic control system were detected using hplc and hplc ms analyses for anaerobic control system only phenol was detected at retention time of 4 63 min via comparison with the standard which was not further converted fig s2 however three new peaks were identified in nrbr at retention time of 3 03 min and 12 76 min fig s3 which could be presumed to 4 bromocatechol 4 bromo 6 oxo hexanoic acid and succinic acid respectively yang et al 2021 zhai et al 2021 luo et al 2014 based on the molecular stereochemistry structure and relative information of the inferred and detected intermediates probably 4 bp biodegradation pathways with and without nitrate injection are proposed as shown in fig 2 in the anaerobic control system 4 bp biodegradation resulted in phenol production via reductive debromination reaction generally the subsequent metabolism for debromination product that is anaerobic phenol biodegradation phenol needs to be converted into 4 hydroxybenzoate catalyzed by decarboxylase yang et al 2021 however phenol was the only observed metabolite in the anaerobic control system which was no further transformed probably due to the lack of available electron acceptor yang et al 2021 moreover the 4 bp removal efficiency in the anaerobic control system were around 35 40 fig 1c while the molar ratio of detected phenol to influent 4 bp was 30 35 indicating that the limited 4 bp anaerobic biodegradation resulted in obvious phenol accumulation agreeing with previous studies chen et al 2019b liang et al 2019 nitrate as the favorable thermodynamic electron acceptor can produce energy as much as oxygen that is essential to oxidation and mineralization of organic substrates thus accelerating aromatic compounds biodegradation xu et al 2015 zhai et al 2021 compared to the anaerobic control system there was no or trace phenol produced in nrbr suggesting the injection of nitrate plays the key role that affect the biotransformation pathway of 4 bp under activated nitrate reducing condition which was completely opposite to the observed 4 bp biodegradation pathway under anaerobic fermentation condition therefore it could be inferred that hydroxylation might be the first step during 4 bp biodegradation in nrbr with 4 bromocatechol produced via this reaction fig 2 then 4 bromocatechol could be converted into 4 bromo 6 oxo hexanoic acid through the cleavage of benzene ring which might be accomplished by denitrifying bacteria zhai et al 2021 luo et al 2014 after the sequential oxidation debromination and carboxylation another an important metabolite namely succinic acid was detected which could be further converted through tca cycle and then provide energy and electrons for microbial metabolism including nitrate reduction zhang et al 2023c this 4 bp biodegradation pathway has been reported in pure culture system by strain cupriavidus sp cnp 8 min et al 2022 the cluster hnpabc from cupriavidus sp cnp 8 that encoded functional enzymes dominating oxidation and hydrolytic dehalogenation reactions of hps which obviously different from the biodegradation pathways in other reported hps degraders such as reduction or oxidation dehalogenations min et al 2022 wang et al 2022b it could be speculated that hydrolytic debromination might be play a crucial role during 4 bp biodegradation process under activated nitrate reducing condition which was rather conducive to better reactor performance thus hydrolytic debromination of 4 bp in nrbr was analyzed and presented in another section below as discussed above the reductive debromination of 4 bp resulted in over 30 transformation into phenol during 4 bp biodegradation process in the anaerobic control system the occurrence of nitrate reduction was the key factor that affected 4 bp biodegradation pathway away from phenol generation in nrbr yang et al 2021 chen et al 2019b hydroxylation oxidation and debromination during 4 bp biodegradation process were accomplished by various functional microorganisms under activated nitrate reducing condition such as aromatic compounds degraders denitrifiers and electron transporters that is microorganisms dominating 4 bp biodegradation without phenol accumulation for example via aromatic ring cleavage pathway may have been displayed in the denitrifying culture which was utilized as the inoculum in nrbr therefore microbial metabolic mechanism and community evolution are analyzed and presented in another section below 3 3 the effect of key operational parameters 3 3 1 influent 4 bp concentration as illustrated in fig 3 with the influent 4 bp concentration increased from 0 58 mm to 0 87 mm 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were achieving 100 and 85 respectively indicating the excellent 4 bp removal performance in nrbr however with the influent 4 bp concentration increased to 1 16 mm 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were obviously decreased to 73 47 3 21 and 70 76 2 32 respectively thereafter both 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies sharply dropped to 54 43 2 21 and 50 11 1 78 when the influent 4 bp concentration was further raised up to 1 45 mm probably due to the toxicity exposed by high loading 4 bp in addition 4 bp debromination efficiency was slower along with the increase of influent 4 bp concentration as indicated by effluent br concentration was slightly increased from 0 51 0 07 mm to 0 67 0 03 mm with influent 4 bp concentration increased from 0 58 mm to 1 45 mm similarly no3 n removal efficiency was maintained above 95 with influent 4 bp concentration increased from 0 58 mm to 0 87 mm but then sharply dropped to 53 12 1 87 when the influent 4 bp concentration further raised up to 1 45 mm this result was mostly explained by the lower microbial activity and insufficient electron supply at the high strength 4 bp stress since 4 bp was the only possible electron donor for nitrate reduction in nrbr fang et al 2020 3 3 2 hrt it was reported that hrt plays a crucial role in biological wastewater treatment system due to recalcitrant pollutants biodegradation is directly linked to hrt wang et al 2022a as illustrated in fig 3 the nrbr indicated a stable reactor performance related to 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies when hrt was ranged from 72 h to 48 h under activated nitrate reducing condition however with the decrease of hrt to 36 h both 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were dropped to around 80 and 70 respectively further decrease of hrt to 24 h resulted in significant exacerbation of reactor in terms of 4 bp and toc removal in nrbr similarly br was well released along with 4 bp biodegradation while the debromination efficiency was always above 95 with hrt decreased from 72 h to 48 h but then sharply declined to 54 50 4 79 with hrt further declined to 24 h additionally as hrt dropped from 72 h to 48 h no3 n reduction efficiency was well above 97 whereas abundant remanent of no3 was detected in the effluent at hrt decreased to 24 h this phenomenon could be caused by the low nitrate reducing activity when high strength recalcitrant contaminants was utilized as carbon source jin et al 2022 li et al 2022 consequently longer hrt was supposed to consider when low quality substrate such as 4 bp was used 3 3 3 ph it was well known that ph value is an important factor for xenobiotics bioprocess due to the removal performance of various contaminants is associated with ph closely wang et al 2020 during phase iv the initial ph value was adjusted from 6 0 to 8 0 so as to explore the impact of initial ph on 4 bp biodegradation in nrbr as illustrated in fig 3 with the influent ph increased from 6 0 to 7 0 4 bp and toc removal efficiencies were increased from 91 35 2 45 and 83 45 2 21 to 100 and 94 65 3 23 respectively however obvious deterioration of the reactor performance related to 4 bp and toc removal was monitored when the initial ph raised up to 8 0 which might be due to the suppression of microbial activity under alkaline environment wang et al 2022a du et al 2022 in addition the optimal nitrate reduction performance was detected at ph of 7 0 while the debromination and no3 n reduction efficiencies were well above 95 therefore in consideration of 4 bp removal debromination toc removal and no3 n reduction profiles in nrbr it could be inferred that the optimum microbial activity and reactor performance were obtained under the neutral condition consistent with our previous report wang et al 2020 3 3 4 long term performance during phase v reactor performance was monitored for another 60 days at influent 4 bp concentration and hrt adjusted to 0 87 mm and 24 h respectively in order to further explore the effect of long term nitrate injection on 4 bp biodegradation as shown in fig 3 completely 4 bp removal was obtained after day 165 while the measured br concentration of 0 83 0 02 mm which was well matched with the theoretical br releasing concentration meanwhile toc removal efficiency increased from 75 26 3 41 on day 158 to 82 47 2 53 on day 162 whereafter maintained above 85 in the rest of the long term period correspondingly no3 n reduction efficiency increased from 88 54 2 43 on day 156 to 98 45 1 51 on day 165 which was then kept above 95 in the following 50 days however 4 bp removal and toc removal efficiencies always in the low range of 30 45 and 20 30 in the anaerobic control bioreactor fig s4 these results demonstrated that the stable long term reactor performance could be obtained in nrbr indicating that the practical application of nrbr would be viable for bioremediation of hps contaminated environment 3 4 microbial community structure in order to gain better insight into the impact of nitrate injection on microbial evolution microbial community structure was analyzed via high throughput sequencing the key parameters associated with community diversity and richness were summarized in table s1 compared with the seeding sludge long term 4 bp loading caused apparent decrease in community diversity and richness as indicated by the relative lower chao1 ace and shannon indexes in both bioreactors in addition the principal component analysis showed that community structure in the anaerobic control system and nrbr have been markedly changed from the seeding sludge while the microbial composition in nrbr was also significantly changed from the anaerobic control system fig s5 these results indicated that bacterial metabolism sensitive to the toxicity of 4 bp could be repressed which agrees with the observation that the injection of nitrate could be induce the microbial community selection enrichment jin et al 2022 du et al 2022 community composition analysis at the phylum level indicated that the microbial population in seeding sludge was dominated by proteobacteria 25 58 chloroflexi 22 65 actinobacteriota 19 26 and bacteroidota 11 01 fig 4 a after the long term habituation to high 4 bp loading community composition was changed distinctly among them the relative abundance of actinobacteriota control 8 44 nrbr 3 26 was significantly decreased in both bioreactors suggesting the suppression of bacteria within this phylum it was reported that patescibacteria and fibrobacterota were the excellent organic contaminants degrading bacteria capable of denitrifying while the relative abundances significantly increased from 4 66 and 0 07 to 15 33 and 5 33 in nrbr frey et al 2016 azizan et al 2022 xu et al 2022 the enrichment of bacteria within these phyla might be play the key role in microbial metabolism in contrast the relative abundance of proteobacteria which was the important aromatic compound degrader capable of denitrifying sharply dropped to 20 80 in nrbr suggesting the inhibition of proteobacteria by the toxicity of 4 bp ren et al 2022 huang et al 2022 the bacterial category classification at the genus level showed that candidatus peregrinibacteria 11 04 denitratisoma 9 90 chitinivibrionia 5 33 sbr1031 5 28 olb14 5 12 anaerolineaceae 3 44 candidatus protochlamydia 2 71 abditibacterium 2 49 sumerlaeia 1 91 thiobacillus denitrifier 1 88 limnobacter denitrifier 1 44 zixibacteria 1 15 taonella 1 08 and ignavibacterium denitrifier 1 02 were the dominant genera in nrbr as compared to the anaerobic control system fig 4b 4c among the 17 abundant genera relative abundance 0 5 observed in nrbr candidatus peregrinibacteria was present with the most abundant species in nrbr candidatus peregrinibacteria was frequently detected in the contaminated wastewater containing br and no3 which showing positively correlated with br content the high abundance of candidatus peregrinibacteria might be account for the enhanced 4 bp debromination and biodegradation sulowicz et al 2020 chen et al 2019a genus denitratisoma were the representative denitrifying bacteria could degrade various complex substrates and halogenated contaminants qin et al 2020 zheng et al 2022 the high relative abundance of denitratisoma might be responsible for the enhanced debromination and biodegradation of 4 bp sbr1031 which was a member of the class anaerolineae might be responsible for the catabolism of aromatic heterocyclic compounds via hydrolysis and acidification pathways zheng et al 2021 hua et al 2020 genus anaerolineaceae which was an excellent nitrite reductor showing excellent performance in terms of efficient biodegradation of brominated aromatic hydrocarbon han et al 2021 wei et al 2022 the bacteria olb14 was found to be involved in nitrogen metabolism via establishing nitrate and nitrite cycle whereas the high strength 4 bp loading inhibit its proliferation zhao et al 2021 candidatus protochlamydia might be responsible for the efficient mineralization of 4 bp since genus candidatus protochlamydia strongly correlated with pharmaceutical and personal care product especially in halogenated compound sufficient condition liu et al 2021 thiobacillus was reported to be involved in nitrate reduction through utilizing recalcitrant pollutants as electron donor and energy source shi et al 2022 limnobacter was a distinguished denitrifier which was demonstrated to has capacity of degrading phenol catalyzed by hydroxylase even under hypoxic and anoxic conditions povedano priego et al 2022 vedler et al 2013 taonella could metabolize aromatic compounds and hydrocarbon contaminations kong et al 2021 ignavibacterium was found to be a representative heterotrophic denitrifying bacterium could degrade aromatic compounds and methane through oxidation pathway wan et al 2022 chai et al 2020 as compared with the anaerobic control system the growth of bps debromination and biodegradation functional species candidatus peregrinibacteria denitratisoma anaerolineae anaerolineaceae candidatus protochlamydia limnobacter taonella ignavibacterium as well as nitrate reducing species denitratisoma anaerolineaceae thiobacillus limnobacter taonella ignavibacterium was significantly facilitated in nrbr after the long term adaption to high 4 bp loading therefore the enrichment of these functional bacteria would be conducive to the incremental 4 bp debromination and bio mineralization as well as nitrate reduction in nrbr 3 5 the injection of nitrate stimulated microbial metabolism the response system of bacteria it has been reported that the injection of nitrate can accelerate organic matters biodegradation through promoting electron production and consumption among others wang et al 2020 zhai et al 2021 electron transport system ets deemed a key mechanism of substrates catabolism which plays an important protection role against biotoxicity stress from contaminants accumulation wang et al 2020 in this study metagenomic analysis results indicated that the transmembrane transport of substrate electron and among others were enhanced as evidenced by the key genes encoding these transporters were significantly up regulated in nrbr such as abc type transporters table s2 the ets activity assay indicated that the relative activity of microbial ets in nrbr was 2 fold of that in the anaerobic control system fig 5 a which was consistent with the up regulated cytochrome c fbch ccon table s3 moreover the up regulation of protein export ko03060 also supporting this point fig s6 suggesting that the bacterial secretion system was activated after the injection of nitrate and thus the microbial ets was triggered these results indicated that the injection of nitrate stimulated bacterial response system bacterial secretion system and protein export resulting in the enhanced microbial activity and metabolism as shown in fig s6 kegg pathway analysis indicated that the enrichment functional genes in nrbr were related to seven metabolic pathways including citrate tca cycle ko00020 degradation of aromatic compounds ko01220 protein export ko03060 bacterial secretion system ko03070 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 d glutamate metabolism ko00471 carbon metabolism ko01200 and ribosome ko03010 the significant enrichment of tca cycle further indicated that electron provision and energy metabolism could be enhanced after the injection of nitrate which was also responsible for the enhanced enzymatic reaction resulting in the enhanced microbial metabolism xiao et al 2023 cog enrichments revealed that energy production and conversion amino acid transport and metabolism coenzyme transport and metabolism lipid transport and metabolism signal transduction mechanism intracellular trafficking secretion and vesicular transport were significantly enrichment in nrbr fig s7 most of them were responsible for the decomposition and synthesis of substances in order to sustain cell growth and energy metabolism xiao et al 2023 moreover the up regulated transporters might be conducive to substrate such as 4 bp diffusion into intracellular during microbial metabolism since most of transmembrane transporters could transport substrate binding proteins such as abc transporter wang et al 2020 lu et al 2019 these results indicated that the injection of nitrate induced microbes were more active and energetic in nrbr compared to the anaerobic control system resulting in the enhanced microbial activity metabolism and energy provision nitrogen metabolism it was well known that microbial denitrification was often accomplished intracellularly through the sequence of biological reduction reactions which were driven by electron transport system wang et al 2020 from metagenomic analysis results the abundance of key genes responsible for microbial denitrification and nitrate reduction such as nitrate reductase nar narb ferredoxin nasab unknown acceptors narghi quinone napab cytochrome nitrite reductase nir nira ferredoxin nrfah cytochrome ammonia forming nirks nitric oxide reductase nor norbc cytochrome c and nitrous oxide reductase n2or nosz were significantly up regulated in nrbr compared to the anaerobic control system fig 6 table s4 the most importantly reason was that the injection of nitrate stimulated microbes created more appropriate circumstance for multiplication of microorganisms dominating nitrate reduction resulting in up regulated of the above functional enzymes and thus promoting nitrogen metabolism in contrast fewer nitrate reducers denitratisoma anaerolineaceae limnobacter and ignavibacterium etc appeared in the anaerobic control system fig 4 these results were consistent with the profile of nitrate removal which might be the most likely reason for enhanced enzymatic activities and nitrogen metabolism in nrbr in addition the nitrogen sources could be further converted into ammonium through nira or nrfah dominated nitrogen transformation pathway and then metabolized via l glutamate pathway which could be further utilized by functional microorganisms such as nitrate reducers to sustain cell growth and other nitrogen related metabolism xiao et al 2023 carbon metabolism nitrate reduction is an energy consuming pathway that requires electron and reducing power for biological transformation of nitrate to nitrogen xu et al 2015 similar to our previous studies 4 bp metabolites could enter into tca cycle to neutralize the toxic effects from 4 bp accumulation wang et al 2019 2022a the up regulated tca cycle in nrbr indicated that electron provision and energy metabolism could be enhanced after nitrate injection since 4 bp metabolism is an energy generating pathway moreover the up regulated nitrogen metabolism would be contributed to the enhanced 4 bp catabolism since nitrate as electron acceptor can produce nearly as much energy as oxygen leading to organic contaminants catabolism and thus enhancing oxidation and mineralization of 4 bp zhai et al 2021 it was found that the key genes encoding functional enzymes dominating 4 bp biodegradation were significantly up regulated in nrbr such as ethylbenzene hydroxylase ebda ec 1 17 99 2 and hydratase dch ec 4 2 1 100 which were responsible for 4 bp hydroxylation at the beginning of aromatic ring catabolism 6 hydroxycyclohex 1 ene 1 carbonyl coa dehydrogenase had ec 1 1 1 368 and phthalate 4 5 cis dihydrodiol dehydrogenase pht4 ec 1 3 1 64 which both activated the ring opening and oxidation of aromatic compounds s 2 haloacid dehalogenase ec 3 8 1 2 which was responsible for hydrolysis dehalogenase of 4 bp and bromine intermediates 1 butanol dehydrogenase quinone boh ec 1 1 5 11 and s s butanediol dehydrogenase buta ec 1 1 1 76 which were accounted for the dehydrogenation and mineralization of 4 bp and intermediates fig 6 table s4 as the dominating metabolites of 4 bp biodegradation succinate semialdehyde and succinate acid can reach tca cycle to provide electrons and energy for supporting microbial metabolism while the functional genes encoding succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gabd ec 1 2 1 16 ec 1 2 1 79 and succinate dehydrogenase sdha ec 1 3 5 1 were significantly up regulated in nrbr wang et al 2019 contents of the electron carrier nadh and energy atp was thereby increased while the concentrations of nadh and atp in nrbr was 1 65 fold and 2 15 fold of those in the anaerobic control system fig 5a moreover the up regulated functional gene encoding nadh reductase e g ec 1 6 5 9 and ec 7 2 1 1 and atpase e g ec 5 6 1 9 well match with the enhanced nadh and atp concentrations suggesting that the injection of nitrate promoted the microbial ets activity and atp synthesis fig 5b 5c table s3 clearly the injection of nitrate promoted electron provision and energy metabolism thus accelerated electron donor catabolism and electron supplying capacity and finally enhanced 4 bp biodegradation biosynthesis of amino acids the up regulation of amino acid biosynthesis pathway in nrbr promoted 10 amino acid metabolisms including histidine tryptophan tyrosine valine leucine isoleucine lysine arginine proline glutamine fig 6 table s5 most of them especially tyrosine and lysine are the dominating components of protein synthesis that play a protective role against recalcitrant substances by absorbing toxic contaminants such as 4 bp jia et al 2022 in addition the hydrophobic amino acids such as tryptophan valine leucine and isoleucine metabolisms were remarkably up regulated in nrbr which might be respond to the requirement of protein synthesis and export for enhancing extracellular structures fig s7 table s5 suggesting that nitrate mediated microorganisms had a high capacity for amino acids synthesis jia et al 2022 in addition the key genes encoding functional enzymes responsible for atp synthesis ec 5 6 1 9 and ec 7 2 2 21 etc nadh synthesis ec 1 6 5 9 and ec 7 2 1 1 etc and electron proton transfer ec 7 1 1 8 and ec 7 1 1 9 were dramatically enriched in nrbr assisted with nitrate injection table s3 correspondingly the contents of atp and nadh as well as the relative activity of microbial ets in nrbr were obviously higher than those in the anaerobic control system without nitrate fig 5a 4 discussion the widespread pollution of deleterious and persistent hps in aquatic ecosystem has caused the serious environmental problem the intervention of electron acceptor such as nitrate has been considered as a feasible approach to enhance hps biodegradation in wastewater treatment system wang et al 2020 xu et al 2015 long et al 2021 studying the mechanism involved in bacterial response system 4 bp biodegradation and nitrate reduction respond to the injection of nitrate is essential for developing bioremediation strategy however limited studies had previously explored the effect of nitrate injection on ecosystem and microbiomes during bps biodegradation process especially the microbial response mechanism to bps stress under nitrate reducing condition herein we explored the effect of long term nitrate injection on 4 bp biodegradation microbial metabolism community evolution and genomic characteristics in a nitrate reducing system the above results indicated that long term nitrate injection significantly accelerated debromination and mineralization of 4 bp suggesting that microorganisms adapted to nitrate reducing environment changes induced by the injection of nitrate and preserve the stability of nitrate reducing system 4 bp biodegradation pathway activated by nitrate injection in nrbr which was overcoming the limits of 4 bp partial biodegradation and phenol accumulation in the anaerobic control system resulting in the efficient hydrolysis debromination oxidation and mineralization of 4 bp microbial community analysis revealed that the injection of nitrate remarkably affected community structure in which a prominent enrichment of functional species with high tolerance to 4 bp loading under nitrate reducing condition e g candidatus peregrinibacteria peregrinibacteria and denitratisoma etc therefore these microbes became the predominant in nrbr and various strategies were developed by these bacteria to cope with 4 bp and nitrate induced stress as illustrated in fig 7 first exogenous 4 bp and nitrate stress message was promptly conveyed through ribosome hif 1 and p53 signaling pathways involving ribosomal proteins and signal peptidases e g ribosomal protein l3 and signal peptidase i table s6 as indicated by the up regulation of the key genes encoding these signaling proteins jia et al 2022 thereafter bacterial response system such as bacterial secretion system and electron transport system were activated in order to accelerate 4 bp catabolism and reduce the cell damage caused by toxic 4 bp accumulation subsequently the up regulated bacterial response system stimulated protein synthesis and export as well as biofilm formation resulting in the enhanced stability of cell member skeleton and reduce cell breakage which was also conducive to degrade 4 bp after tightly binding with 4 bp importantly intracellular 4 bp could be converted into less toxic metabolites such as succinate acid which catalyzed by the corresponding functional enzymes e g hydrolase dehydrogenase and dehalogenase etc it was worth noting that the relative abundances of the key functional enzymes dominating 4 bp biodegradation such as hydroxylase ebda and hydratase dch dehydrogenase had s 2 haloacid dehalogenase 1 butanol dehydrogenase quinone boh and s s butanediol dehydrogenase buta succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase gabd and succinate dehydrogenase frda were largely increased in nrbr among them s 2 haloacid dehalogenase activated the debromination of 4 bp and its bromine intermediates via hydrolysis dehalogenation pathway without electron or energy consumption which was rather conducive to better debromination and mineralization performance of 4 bp moreover the up regulated protein synthesis and export activated nitrogen metabolism while the functional genes involved in nitrate reduction were significantly up regulated table s4 bacterial secretion system responds to exogenous stress e g 4 bp and nitrate protein export and nitrate metabolism all require electron donors nadh and reduction energy atp which produced from 4 bp catabolism wang et al 2020 jia et al 2022 enzymatic activity assays demonstrated that the injection of nitrate stimulated an increase in atp and nadh contents as well as the relative activity of microbial ets fig 5 while the key functional genes were up regulated table s3 these results clearly confirmed that the injection of nitrate dramatically enhanced energy generation and electron transport furthermore these findings also indicated that nitrate injection activated carbon metabolism to accelerate energy generation and electron provision as evidenced by the up regulation of functional genes responsible for 4 bp biodegradation and tca cycle fig 6 table s4 while the metabolites such as succinate acid could be utilized as electron donor via enter into tca cycle wang et al 2019 similar microbial response behavior had been reported in previous studies that nitrate stimulated microbial metabolism including energy metabolism and carbon metabolism while the complete biodegradation of aromatic compounds and phenolic compounds could be obtained under activated nitrate reducing condition xu et al 2015 zhai et al 2021 this means that the microorganisms in nrbr tended to form a particular pattern to maintain better microbial activity and overcome the biotoxicity from recalcitrant contaminants accumulation to our knowledge this is the first exploration of microbial metabolic mechanism involved in bacterial response system 4 bp biodegradation and nitrate reduction from the reactor performance community evolution microbial metabolism and genetic characteristic which would provide fundamental information and aid our mechanistic understanding for biological wastewater treatment containing recalcitrant contaminants such as bps generally 4 bp was usually transformed into phenol under anaerobic fermentative condition surprisingly 4 bp biotransformation in nrbr is completely opposite to the conventional anaerobic 4 bp biodegradation pathway while the hydrolysis debromination of 4 bp was different from reduction or oxidation dehalogenation pathways fig 6 these might be explained by the injection of nitrate has stimulating microbial activity and enzymatic reactions resulting in the enhanced aromatic ring opening hydrolysis debromination and bio mineralization performance of 4 bp looking into the microbial metabolic mechanism involved 4 bp biodegradation in nitrate mediated biological treatment system could guidance us in discovering of potential bioremediation strategy in order to maintain the stability of biological treatment system when suffering hps contaminated wastewater conclusion the present study explored the impact of nitrate injection on reactor performance 4 bp biodegradation pathway and community evolution in a nitrate reducing system and the synergetic microbial metabolic mechanism was comprehensively clarified our results revealed that hydrolysis debromination and mineralization of 4 bp were significantly enhanced in nrbr compared to the anaerobic control system nitrate injection changed community structure leading to the enrichment of species related to 4 bp debromination biodegradation and nitrate reduction based on metagenomics analyses and enzymatic activity assays the injection of nitrate induced bacterial secretion system including protein synthesis and export as well as electron transport thus stimulating carbon nitrogen energy and amino acid metabolisms to promote energy generation and electron provision and then enhanced microbial activities importantly 4 bp biodegradation pathway activated by nitrate injection which overcomes the limit of 4 bp partial biodegradation and phenol accumulation under anaerobic condition resulting in efficient hydrolysis oxidation and mineralization of 4 bp in nrbr the above findings would be providing a new insight into the development of bioremediation strategies to maintain the stability of biological treatment system when treating high strength hps polluted wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they
