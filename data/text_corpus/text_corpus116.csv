580,a realistic temperature estimation is crucial for many earth science applications ranging from hydro thermal systems to plant physiology the most common approach to calculate the temperature in multi phase systems assumes immediate local thermal equilibrium lte between the phases however local thermal equilibrium between the phases is not applicable in various scenarios like during the infiltration of rain or melt water in frozen soil limiting the applicability of the approach and inhibiting the implementation of separate initial and boundary conditions for non equilibrium situations in local thermal non equilibrium ltne models phase temperatures are described separately to the cost of additional differential equations and an explicitly formulated heat transfer between the phases especially a cumbersome parameterization of the explicit heat transfer restricts the use of the ltne models in multi phase conditions so far in this work we derive a general local thermal non equilibrium model for dynamic partly saturated porous media heat transfer between the phases is described explicitly using well known semi empirical parameterization accounting for velocity changes of the mobile phases the change in volume fraction introduces an additional term in the heat equation causing a coupling with the hydraulic model we validate our model with a numerical simulation of historic experimental data from soil infiltration experiments of warm and cold water into drained soil posing a perfect example of local thermal non equilibrium conditions between the phases experimentally obtained mixture temperatures are reproduced within experimental accuracy we further show the benefits of our model by applying it to rainwater infiltration into cold soil

extraction might decide about economic feasibility of a project in soil science and agriculture temperature e g controls biological activity and soil hydraulic properties in hydrology temperature can be used as a thermal tracer to estimate water pathways in glaciology and under permafrost conditions temperature is connected to ice content and slope stability the most common and simplest approach to describe heat transfer and transport in multi phase systems is based on the assumption of immediate local thermal equilibrium lte between the phases consisting of a single diffusion advection equation with volume averaged thermal parameters the lte model is easy to implement and fast in numerical calculations and while the lte assumption is valid in many scenarios its validity depends besides others on the thermal phase conductivity their ratios as well as on porosity permeability and mean particle diameter e g alazmi and vafai 2004 yang and vafai 2011 dehghan et al 2015 hamidi et al 2019 additionally the lte model can not be applied when the temperature difference between the phases is characteristic for the system already the formulation of correct boundary conditions often requires separate phase temperatures alazmi and vafai 2002 ouyang et al 2013 examples include the use of thermal tracers pastore et al 2018 or a dynamic heat source sink minkowycz et al 1999 in enhanced geothermal systems the difference in phase temperatures is caused by the injection of a cold water into a hot rock shaik et al 2011 during stimulation of such a geothermal system only separate phase temperatures could cause the thermal stress regime around a borehole necessary to explain the observed fracturing gelet et al 2012 describing the dynamics during melt water infiltration into a frozen ground also requires separate phase temperatures the approach considering separate phase temperatures is called local thermal non equilibrium ltne as the lte assumption is rejected it consists of a separate diffusion advection equation for each phase with an additional heat transfer term depending on heat transfer area and heat transfer coefficient besides the increased numerical costs due to an additional equation especially the parameterization of the heat transfer term remains cumbersome for implementation and formulation of boundary conditions for the ltne assumption at micro and macro scale see dehghan et al 2016a b recently the importance of the heat transfer term has been emphasized for the application of ltne in geothermal systems zhang et al 2014 estimation of the transfer area is mainly a geometrical problem and can be addressed by assumptions about the pore geometry and or fracture density for fracture there are some recent approaches for an analytical expression for the heat transfer coefficient zhao 2014 heinze et al 2017 parameterization for the pore space is based on empirical relations the most common parameterization derived from various experimental data depends on the dimensionless nusselt reynolds and prandtl number wakao et al 1979 this formulation has been recently extended for lower reynolds numbers by roshan et al 2014 alternative formulations have smaller ranges of validity or are variations of the one above mcadams 1942 nield and bejan 2013 heat transfer in partially saturated media has been addressed in detail especially in the context of evaporation and vapor movement in the ground fundamental research on this issue dates back to the 1950s de vries 1958 bear et al 1991 or et al 2013 with various discussions and extensions up to recent years e g shokri et al 2009 shahraeeni and or 2012 iden et al 2019 temperature especially influences the movement of the wetting front bachmann et al 2002 however so far models mostly consider a thermal equilibrium between the phases e g bennethum and cushman 1999 smits et al 2011 vanderborght et al 2017 very recently a numerical ltne model for unsaturated conditions was presented but without a physical description of the heat transfer coefficient focusing on numerical issues instead kačur et al 2019 in sözen and vafai 1990 a model for condensing flow of a gas through a porous medium was described using the ltne approach the model was designed for mechanical engineering applications like heat storage and heat transfer e g in refrigerators based on the chosen range of applications the model focused on flows of high speed at high pressures taking condensation into account the volume fraction of the liquid phase was considered negligible as well as the interaction between both phases sözen and vafai 1990 in the context of melt water infiltration existing models for freeze thaw approaches rely on lte models shoop and bigl 1997 karra et al 2014 as well as more general models sophocleous 1979 molina giraldo et al 2011 varnosfaderani et al 2017 temperature of the liquid phase controls the phase transition in the freezing thawing processes which also strongly influences hydraulic permeability watanabe and flury 2008 in this work we will derive a mathematical model for heat transfer with separate phase temperatures for all three phases solid liquid and gas such a three phase system requires three heat equations to be solved and the definition of three separate heat transfer terms a model of similar structure has been applied successfully before separating porous matrix stored pore water and fast flowing fracture water heinze and hamidi 2017 this approach will be transferred to unsaturated porous media 2 model description 2 1 heat transfer model in the unsaturated domain there are three phases referred to with the index i s g l for solid s gas g and liquid l the total thermal energy etot j m3 per unit volume in a local thermal non equilibrium model can be expressed as the sum of the thermal energies of the separate phases ei j m3 1 e t o t e s e l e g with the thermal energy of each phase per unit volume 2 e i ϵ i ρ i c i t i with volumetric content ϵ density ρ kg m3 specific heat capacity c j kg k and phase temperature ti k the solid volume fraction ϵ s is related to porosity ϕ by ϵ s 1 ϕ linking volume fractions to the water content θ it is ϵ l θ and ϵ g ϕ θ therefore it is ϵ l ϵ g with the time derivative indicated by the dot a change in total thermal energy per unit volume is expressed by 3 e t o t e s e l e g and can be caused by a change of the phase temperatures or by a change of the volumetric fractions 4 e i c i ρ i t i ϵ i ϵ i t i for each phase conservation of energy can be formulated as 5 e i j i q i with a flux term j w m2 incorporating diffusive and advective fluxes and a source sink term q w m3 using fouriers law j can be defined as 6 j i j a d v i j d i f f i c i ρ i q i t i ϵ i λ i t i with thermal conductivity λ w m k and darcy velocity q m s true flow velocity v is related to darcy velocity q m s through q i ϵ i v i the diffusive term is weighted by the volume fractions assuming that surface fraction is equal to volume fraction for each phase for the three phases the energy conservation can then be written as 7 ϵ s c s ρ s t s ϵ s λ s

fraction and to be immobile heat transfer in the solid phase is governed by diffusion while liquid and gas include an additional advection term considering the liquid and gas incompressible we can further conclude that liquid and gas move with the same darcy velocity q we further assume that the materials are homogeneous with respect to c λ and ρ the heat equations then simplify to 10 ϵ s c s ρ s t s λ s ϵ s t s q s 11 c l ρ l t l ϵ l ϵ l c l ρ l t l λ l ϵ l t l c l ρ l q t l t l q q l 12 c g ρ g t g ϵ g ϵ g c g ρ g t g λ g ϵ g t g c g ρ g q t g t g q q g with the dot product between q and the gradient of ti decaria and sikora 2010 notice the non vanishing gradient of the volume fraction in the diffusive flux which is due to a possible gradient in surface area for the fluxes of the liquid and gas phase when the volume fraction of a phase within a control volume is changing this is caused by in or out flowing mass if we neglect any other possible causes such as compression or dilation under these assumptions the conservation of mass for the liquid phase can be written as 13 θ q with the relation ϵ l θ and ϵ l ϵ g described above and the conservation of mass the heat equations for fluid and gas can be simplified further 14 ϵ s c s ρ s t s λ s ϵ s δ t s q s 15 ϵ l c l ρ l t l λ l ϵ l t l c l ρ l q t l q l 16 ϵ g c g ρ g t g λ g ϵ g t g c g ρ g q t g q g due to the local thermal non equilibrium each phase interacts with the other phases through a heat transfer term qij fig 1 this transfer term is similar to a heat source or sink for each phase depending on the temperature difference between both phases we set q s q s l q s g q l q s l q l g and q g q s g q l g and so the final model equations are written as 17 ϵ s c s ρ s t s t λ s ϵ s δ t s q s l q s g 18

described by almost any hydraulic model depending on pressure head ψ we neglect any other heat source such as the latent heat exchange from evaporation or condensation in general qij is described by the product of the heat transfer coefficient h w m2 k the specific contact area a 1 m which is surface area per volume and the temperature difference δt k between the phase 21 q h a δ t therefore qsl denotes the heat transfer rate between the solid and the liquid phase based on transfer coefficient specific contact area and the temperature difference of both phases for the interaction between a moving phase and the porous solid the specific contact area as is described for spherical grains by 22 a s 6 1 ϕ d p with grain diameter dp m the heat transfer coefficient h is associated with the dimensionless nusselt number nu 23 n u h d p λ parameterization of h based on empirical parameters taken from wakao et al 1979 roshan et al 2014 can be expressed for small reynolds numbers as 24 h λ d p 2 4 10 5 285 6 p r 1 3 r e 2 7 using the dimensionless prandtl number 25 p r c μ λ and reynolds number 26 r e ρ q d p μ which are defined by viscosity μ pa s and other parameters of the mobile phase this parameterization dates back to wakao et al 1979 and has recently been re defined for a broader range of reynolds numbers by roshan et al 2014 this semi empirical relationship has been validated for reynolds number down to r e 2 4 10 4 and for sand silt and gravel roshan et al 2014 empirical parameters have been derived for solid grains interacting with liquids as well as gases but not for a mixture e g sözen and vafai 1990 amiri and vafai 1994 characteristics of flow and mobile phase are introduced through the dimensionless numbers pr and re for the heat transfer between the liquid and gaseous phase holman 1986 presented various empirical formulas in dependence of rayleigh and reynolds numbers also considering relative motion for simplification often constant values are used e g sodha et al 1982 mcadams 1942 a typical value range of both methods is around 5 20 w m 2 k and therefore in a similar range as for the solid however the contact area between both phases is significantly smaller than for each phase with the solid matrix for illustration we consider the pore space to consist of cylindrical twisted tubes in which water is replacing air partial saturation within a control volume is described by tubes being filled with water and air fig 2 depending on the chosen model all pores might be partly filled or some tubes are empty and some are full depending on their radii and the resulting capillary forces for the derivation of this model we only require a straight wetting front independent of the flow model we assume that the effect of surface tension between water air and soil can be neglected corresponding to a negligible contact angle due to this limitation this model is also not applicable for bubbly or slug flow narayanan and lakehal 2008 assuming a clear wetting front the contact area between the liquid and the gaseous phase is the cross sectional area ai m2 of each tube i with a i π r i 2 at the water air interface while the contact area with the solid is the whole lateral area mi m2 of the tube with m i 2 π r i l with tube radius r m and tube length l m in a capillary tube model the total cross sectional area a of the tubes as well as their total mantle area m within a control volume is given by the sum of the separate cross sections and mantle areas with i 1 n assuming a control volume in the order of meters and the pore radius in the order of millimeters or less the ratio of mantle area to cross sectional area is under any circumstance larger than 1 considering tortuosity this factor would even more increase 27 i 1 n m i i 1 n a i 2 l i 1 n r i i 1 n r i 2 for a cubic control volume with length l 1 m and equal sized pores with radius r the cross sectional porosity is defined as ϕ i 1 n π r i 2 l 2 n j π r 2 with nj as number of capillary tubes per unit area setting r 1 mm which is a typical value for coarse sand and a porosity of 30 we obtain nj 95500 1 m2 for those values the ratio of mantle area to cross sectional area is approximately 2000 based on these considerations we neglect the heat transfer between liquid and gas due to the small contact area the amount of heat transferred between gas and liquid is much smaller than between these phases and the solid qlg qsl qsg although in this model liquid and gaseous phase do not interact directly both exchange heat with the solid phase and can so indirectly interact with each other a similar process has been observed in a ltne approach for dual porosity models in those models pore water and fracture water are separated due to different hydraulic regimes while the direct heat and mass exchange between both domains is negligibly small the pore water acts as additional heat reservoir for the solid matrix the fracture water transports this heat through the system heinze and hamidi 2017 based on the conceptual model described above the heat transfer between solid and liquid or the gaseous phase is weighted by saturation s hence the heat transfer terms between solid and liquid qsl and solid and gas qsg can be defined as 28 q s l s h s l t l t s a s 29 q s g 1 s h s g t g t s a s however considering the values for air with λ g 28 10 3 w m k c g 1000 j kg k ρ g 1 1 kg m 3 μ g 1 9 10 5 pa s a mean grain size of d p 30 μ m and a darcy velocity of v 10 5 m s the heat transfer coefficient is h s g 0 022 w m 2 k and roughly a factor 100 smaller than for the liquid phase for short term infiltrations with small variations in the boundary conditions and only a few degrees dynamic temperature range it is reasonable to assume that the gaseous phase does not contribute significantly to the heat transfer and that the air temperature remains almost constant however the model derived in this work is fully functional without this assumption as all relevant governing equations are given above and can be applied to more extreme conditions than the ones used below 3 model verification an intrinsic problem when verifying theoretical and numerical ltne models is the experimental inability to obtain separate phase temperatures in the porous medium we therefore reproduce mixture temperature profiles of an in situ infiltration experiment with cool and warm irrigation water conducted and presented by wierenga et al 1970 in this experiment phase temperatures were intrinsically in local thermal non equilibrium at the upper boundary as the water had a different temperature than the unsaturated soil at two separate plots water with an initial height of 13 6 cm was infiltrated at 6 30 pm for roughly 1 h at the 28th of august 1969 with a water temperature of 4 1 c and 21 6 c temperatures and water contents were recorded down to 125 cm depth but measured temperatures below 50 cm were not influenced by the infiltration wierenga et al 1970 details on sensor installation and calibration can be found in wierenga et al 1970 further the water infiltration itself was found independent of the water temperature wierenga et al 1970 soil temperatures of a non irrigated plot were recorded for comparison the soil at the test site at the university of california at davis was described as heterogeneous yolo silt loam which has been characterized thermally in wierenga et al 1969 for this infiltration experiment we describe water infiltration into the soil by the green ampt approach e g warrick et al 2005 ma and zheng 2010 kale and sahoo 2011 in this model the infiltration rate i m s into the soil is given as 30 i t k s a t 1 ψ i n i ψ d θ s a t θ i n i f with accumulated infiltration i t m 31 i t 0 t i t d t k i n i t here ψini is equal to the negative of the soil suction head and ψd is the capillary pressure head resulting from the ponding depth the position of the water front zw m can be determined through the total infiltrated amount and the available space θ s a t θ i n i a time dependent height of the ponding water ψd m has been introduced e g by freyberg et al 1980 and warrick et al 2005 discussion of handling non uniform initial conditions can be found in bouwer 1969 for initial heterogeneity in water content the initial hydraulic conductivity is calculated following the model of van genuchten 1980 with empirical parameters n and m 1 1 n 32 k i n i k s a t s e f f 1 1 s e f f 1 m 2 with effective saturation s e f f 33 s e f f θ θ r e s θ s a t θ r e s where indices res and sat

with water column height z m and total water amount vsat m youngs and aggelides 1976 the sharp water front of the green ampt approach represents a discontinuous flow model which requires a small modification to the thermal model as outlined in the appendix for model validation the thermal and hydraulic model have been implemented in a one dimensional finite difference framework thermal diffusion is calculated using a forward in time centered in space scheme advection is included with a third order upwind scheme the modeling domain covers the upper 100 cm the spatial distance between numerical grid points is set to 1 cm but the model results have been found to be independent of the spatial grid resolution position of the wetting front and subsequent water content distribution in the ground are calculated for each time step determined by the explicit stability criteria of the thermal diffusion dt 0 04 s first we matched the infiltration model to the experimental data neglecting possible influences of temperature on the infiltration process fig 3 hydraulic conductivity ksat of 3 8 10 5 m s and capillary pressure head ψini of 30 cm are adjusted to match the experimental data and are in good agreement with other studies using this type of soil e g inoue et al 1998 further values used in our numerical simulation are presented in table 1 water infiltration into the soil and phase temperatures are calculated for an eight hour span after infiltration started initial and saturated water content with depth are taken from the experimental data following the experimental procedure we set the initial ponding depth to 13 6 cm as top boundary condition the ponding depth ψd is reduced depending on the infiltrated amount i t the calculated infiltration duration is 1 h and 3 min and in good agreement with the experimental findings of 1 h wierenga et al 1970 due to the spacing of water content sensors the position of the wetting front can only be approximated therefore the use of the green ampt infiltration model does not introduce any significant inaccuracy in the hydraulic comparison between model results and experimental data secondly based on the adjusted hydraulic model the thermal model is set up the calculated flow velocities result in reynolds numbers much smaller than 1 so that the ltne parameters of roshan et al 2014 are used thermal boundary condition at the bottom is chosen as dirichlet conditions equal for all phases matching the mixture temperature obtained from the experimental data 35 t s z 1 m t t g z 1 m t t l z 1 m t 27 7 c at the top dirichlet boundary conditions are used for the water top boundary temperatures are set according to the experimental water infiltration temperatures of 4 1 c and 21 6 c for soil and air the top boundary temperatures are given by the obtained soil temperatures from the non irrigated soil these soil and air temperatures in degree celsius at the surface can sufficiently be described by a function derived by fitting the surface temperatures of the non irrigated plot for t in hours the top boundary conditions are then given by 36 t s z 0 m t 13 5 c cos π 21 0 t 2 0 2 10 0 c 37 t g z 0 m t t s z 0 m t 38 t l z 0 m t 4 1 c if ψ d 0 t s z 0 m t if ψ d 0 and accordingly for the case of 21 6 c water infiltration the thermal initial conditions are a piece wise linear approximation of the experimental data shown in fig 4 to compare the obtained mixture temperatures with our model results we calculated the mixture temperature weighting the phase temperatures by their volumetric fraction and heat capacity the separate phase temperatures differ by more than one degree at the surface but this difference vanishes quickly within the first couple decimeters of the soil down to 0 05 c and less the proposed model reproduces the experimental findings within the experimental error while naturally falling short to reproduce micro scale heterogeneity due to missing information e g about the grain size distribution fig 4 such heterogeneity is already mentioned in the original experimental publication referencing to the thermal sensors at 20 cm depth wierenga et al 1970 using the newly developed local thermal non equilibrium mode we are able to reproduce experimental data with thermal gradients between the involved phases given in the initial and boundary conditions 4 infiltration into cold soil one application of the local thermal non equilibrium model for partly saturated porous media is the infiltration of rainwater into cold soil this is of special interest as small temperature variations might cause freezing or melting of water in the pore space which greatly influences the hydraulics further it is a clear local thermal non equilibrium condition as soil and rain water have different temperatures initially we use the richards equation in the head based formulation to describe the water infiltration in this scenario 39 c ψ ψ t k ψ ψ 1 with c ψ 1 m as specific moisture capacity and using eq 32 for parameterization of k ψ we assume infiltration at the surface with the maximum possible rate without ponding and assume a constant groundwater level at 3 m depth the model domain is one dimensional similar to above and the hydraulic and thermal parameters are the same as given in table 1 again hydraulic and thermal model are discretized using an explicit forward in time centered in space finite differences scheme advection is included with a third order upwind scheme thermally we assume soil air and initially stored water to be at thermal equilibrium at 0 c 40 t s z t 0 s t g z t 0 s t l z t 0 s 0 c for simplicity we will not consider freezing of the water and related observed phenomena such as reduction of hydraulic conductivity due to the presence of ice e g watanabe and flury 2008 this assumption can be justified as due to supercooling and freezing temperature depression in fine grained material the water will remain liquid bittelli et al 2003 wilson 2012 neglecting thermal gradients in the soil also avoids water movement due to a temperature dependent water potential philip and de vries 1957 the boundary conditions for the thermal part at the top are chosen as dirichlet boundary conditions for the infiltrating water to be 3 c and for the air to be 0 c while neumann boundary conditions are used for the soil bottom boundary conditions for the temperature is set equal for all phases to 0 c assuming that all phases will reach thermal equilibrium till that depth as in the example above 41 t s z z 0 m t 0 42 t g z 0 m t 0 c 43 t l z 0 m t 3 c 44 t s z 1 m t t g z 1 m t t l z 1 m t 0 c the above derived model allows consistent implementation of these boundary conditions the temperature evolution of the soil is closely connected to the moving infiltration front as expected fig 5 using the parameters similar to the section above again temperature differences between the phases are too small to be seen in this plot with less than 0 1 c however for different grain size and hydraulic conductivity the temperature difference between the phases is larger in the following we vary dp and ksat separately while keeping all other values as in table 1 due to the multiple effects of the grain size on the heat transfer such as on contact area nusselt and reynolds number the effect of varying grain size on the phase temperatures is complex in the setup presented here phase temperatures can vary up to a maximum of approximately 0 8 c for d p 1 mm fig 6 based on the initial difference between the phase temperatures at the upper boundary the difference in phase temperatures propagates downwards and becomes smaller over time as the soil warms towards the infiltrating fluid temperature different grain sizes and hydraulic conductivity cause the maximum difference between phase temperatures at different infiltration depths corresponding to varying times of infiltration as we consider the infiltration process independent from the temperature propagation hydraulic conductivity controls advection but also the heat transfer is velocity dependent through the reynolds number in eq 24 therefore an increased hydraulic conductivity also effects the phase temperatures temperature difference between solid and water decreases as hydraulic conductivity decreases for a hydraulic conductivity smaller than 10 6 m s it might happen that locally the soil below the wetting front becomes warmer than the water due to diffusion as advection effects become comparably small as velocity influences the advection term in eq 18 linearly but the heat transfer term with the third root the heat transfer does not increase with the same rate as the advection term for an increased hydraulic conductivity a small comparison to a local thermal equilibrium lte model as it is described for example in de vries 1958 shows the differences of both models beyond a pure temperature divergence the depth profile of lte and ltne models diverges in slope although similar hydraulic properties were used fig 7 further the lte model does not depend on the grain size although the phase temperatures of the water and the soil using the ltne model do not diverge significantly for a grain radius of d p 10 5 m there is a significant temperature difference to the lte model such a behavior has been observed before e g in hamidi et al 2019 a small difference in phase temperatures does not necessarily justify the application of a lte model as it may require additional assumptions e g with respect to the definition of boundary conditions 5 discussion the derived model for local thermal non equilibrium heat conditions in unsaturated porous media and its numerical implementation reproduce the experimental results from wierenga et al 1969 within a range of a few degree celsius in these experiments cold 4 c and warm water 21 c was infiltrated and the changes in water content and temperature were measured naturally in the field only mixture temperatures were obtained so that mixture temperatures of the ltne model had to be calculated assuming that at the thermometer thermal equilibrium is reached as long as there are no experimental procedures to obtain separate phase temperatures this is the only way for model validation largest deviation between model and experimental results is caused by soil heterogeneity e g by probable preferential path ways between 15 20 cm depth in the plot irrigated with 4 1 c cold water wierenga et al 1969 more precise information about soil heterogeneity in the context of hydraulic properties e g preferential path ways and structural as well as thermal parameters such as grain size could contribute to an even better match between model and experiments while the model was developed with a broad scope of applications in mind there are several limitations to consider we neglect any external heat source beside the heat transferred between the phases such an extension can easily be incorporated by adding another source term e g in eqs 17 to 19 we further assume that the flow is laminar and can be reasonably approximated through capillary tubes but the choice of a respective flow model and its parameterization is arbitrary as long as it is in agreement with this assumption further the model requires a clear wetting front within the tubes we further assume flow and grain size to be in a range suited for the parameterization used in roshan et al 2014 for the infiltration in the test case a green ampt model is used for simplification and because it very well describes the water infiltration in this specific scenario due to the coarse sensor installation in the field experiment the exact position of the wetting front and the capillary fringe can only be roughly estimated the use of the green ampt model therefore does not introduce any inaccuracy or error the sharp wetting front emphasizes the concentration of the water heat change through a saturation change along the wetting front discontinuous models can pose a challenge to numerical implementations and might require advanced numerical techniques however the derived heat transfer model could be successfully coupled with discontinuous flow models considering separate phase temperatures in partly saturated porous media allows the consistent definition and implementation of initial and boundary conditions as shown exemplary for rainwater infiltration into frozen soil using the richards equation the split in separate heat equations also allows a straight forward usage of easily obtainable thermal parameters for the different phases and therefore makes empirical formulations e g of partly saturated soil thermal conductivity obsolete cf saito et al 2006 in comparison to the local thermal equilibrium approach our model requires a larger set of parameters some of those are based on empirical findings which could be considered a drawback there is also a lack in experimental validation of separate phase temperatures in the ltne model as pointed out above the numerical implementation is more computationally demanding through the larger number of equations to be solved and there are limitations on the time step for stability and accuracy through the explicit heat transfer term this paper does not focus on the validity of the lte ltne assumptions as such discussions can be found in literature also for geoscientific applications e g hamidi et al 2019 however the test case presented in this work shows that based on boundary conditions and soil parameters the difference in phase temperatures can be significant although the dependence of heat transfer on grain size and hydraulic conductivity is non linear some combinations can cause the differences between the phase temperatures to sustain over hours and remain up to a significant fraction of the initial difference differences in phase temperatures are of special interest in strongly temperature dependent processes like freezing and melting as well as for chemical or biological activity for grain sizes and hydraulic conductivity tested a derivation of 0 2 c has most commonly observed in many scenarios this derivation might be sufficient to assume thermal equilibrium between the phases however equilibrium temperatures calculated using the ltne approach might differ from models assuming lte in the first hand due to the different temporal evolution hamidi et al 2019 the developed theoretical and numerical model can easily be applied for heterogeneous grain size distributions that significantly influence heat transfer between the phases in the case of frozen soil an extension towards melting and freezing models to include e g ice content dependent hydraulic conductivity is desirable this would enable to model rainwater infiltration for a broader temperature range than tested in this work the model is also independent of the chosen parameterization of the heat transfer coefficient besides the one used here based on the parameterization of wakao et al 1979 and roshan et al 2014 other models can be applied e g nield and bejan 2013 extension towards fractured porous material is also possible however the heat transfer coefficient for fracture flow is significantly different and shows for example a linear velocity dependency zhao and tso 1993 in the porous media following the model of roshan et al 2014 the advection depends linearly on velocity while the heat transfer includes the third root of the velocity therefore a velocity increase causes advection effects to dominate as the increase in heat transfer is smaller 6 conclusion a model for local thermal non equilibrium heat transfer and transport under water infiltration in porous media has been derived and validated with historic field measurements due to its small heat transfer coefficient the air phase has been found negligible in the tested infiltration scenarios the derived model allows consistent implementation of initial and boundary conditions that include separate phase temperatures separate parameterization of the thermal phase

environmental sciences of the czech university of life sciences prague no 20184236 appendix extension for discontinuous flow models several infiltration models such as green ampt green and ampt 1911 include a sharp wetting front which poses a discontinuity in the model across the discontinuity heat transport can not be calculated in the same way as for a continuous model because ϵ i and q can not be defined accordingly this can be resolved by introducing a source term h w m3 in the heat conservation equation corresponding to the changing volume fraction at the wetting front this heat source described by an arbitrary temperature t k of the incoming mass is given relative to the present temperature 45 h c l ρ l ϵ l t t in this formulation the energy gain or loss due to the change in volume fraction based on the temperature difference of incoming mass is written as the difference of temperatures between the added and the present mass the difference in temperature expresses that the incoming mass already has a substantial energy contributing to the thermal energy of the respective volume naturally we can assume t t for an outgoing mass meaning ϵ 0 as everything else would be nonphysical in the case of ϵ 0 the temperature increases if the temperature of the incoming mass t is larger than the original temperature t and vice versa in the context of an infiltration model in a one dimensional setup t z t at a discrete point i with a time discretization using an increment dt can be written as 46 t i t t i 1 t d t assuming the mass is flowing in positive z direction due to the sharp wetting front this term is non vanishing for any kind of spatial or temporal discretization and only occurs at the wetting front as for all other points ϵ 0 on both sides of the discontinuity the heat transport and water flow is considered continuous assuming that the air temperature remains constant as described above and the solid heat equation remains unaltered the heat equation for the fluid in a discontinuous infiltration model can be described as 47 ϵ l c l ρ l t l h l q s l at the wetting front ϵ l λ l δ t l c l ρ l q l t l q s l anywhere else as ϵ l is either θsat on the upper side of the wetting front or θini on the other so ϵ l 0 anywhere else besides at the wetting front we neglect heat diffusion across the discontinuity as we assume the infiltration to be the much faster and dominant process taking into account that in the described scenario the initial water content is comparably small 
580,a realistic temperature estimation is crucial for many earth science applications ranging from hydro thermal systems to plant physiology the most common approach to calculate the temperature in multi phase systems assumes immediate local thermal equilibrium lte between the phases however local thermal equilibrium between the phases is not applicable in various scenarios like during the infiltration of rain or melt water in frozen soil limiting the applicability of the approach and inhibiting the implementation of separate initial and boundary conditions for non equilibrium situations in local thermal non equilibrium ltne models phase temperatures are described separately to the cost of additional differential equations and an explicitly formulated heat transfer between the phases especially a cumbersome parameterization of the explicit heat transfer restricts the use of the ltne models in multi phase conditions so far in this work we derive a general local thermal non equilibrium model for dynamic partly saturated porous media heat transfer between the phases is described explicitly using well known semi empirical parameterization accounting for velocity changes of the mobile phases the change in volume fraction introduces an additional term in the heat equation causing a coupling with the hydraulic model we validate our model with a numerical simulation of historic experimental data from soil infiltration experiments of warm and cold water into drained soil posing a perfect example of local thermal non equilibrium conditions between the phases experimentally obtained mixture temperatures are reproduced within experimental accuracy we further show the benefits of our model by applying it to rainwater infiltration into cold soil

extraction might decide about economic feasibility of a project in soil science and agriculture temperature e g controls biological activity and soil hydraulic properties in hydrology temperature can be used as a thermal tracer to estimate water pathways in glaciology and under permafrost conditions temperature is connected to ice content and slope stability the most common and simplest approach to describe heat transfer and transport in multi phase systems is based on the assumption of immediate local thermal equilibrium lte between the phases consisting of a single diffusion advection equation with volume averaged thermal parameters the lte model is easy to implement and fast in numerical calculations and while the lte assumption is valid in many scenarios its validity depends besides others on the thermal phase conductivity their ratios as well as on porosity permeability and mean particle diameter e g alazmi and vafai 2004 yang and vafai 2011 dehghan et al 2015 hamidi et al 2019 additionally the lte model can not be applied when the temperature difference between the phases is characteristic for the system already the formulation of correct boundary conditions often requires separate phase temperatures alazmi and vafai 2002 ouyang et al 2013 examples include the use of thermal tracers pastore et al 2018 or a dynamic heat source sink minkowycz et al 1999 in enhanced geothermal systems the difference in phase temperatures is caused by the injection of a cold water into a hot rock shaik et al 2011 during stimulation of such a geothermal system only separate phase temperatures could cause the thermal stress regime around a borehole necessary to explain the observed fracturing gelet et al 2012 describing the dynamics during melt water infiltration into a frozen ground also requires separate phase temperatures the approach considering separate phase temperatures is called local thermal non equilibrium ltne as the lte assumption is rejected it consists of a separate diffusion advection equation for each phase with an additional heat transfer term depending on heat transfer area and heat transfer coefficient besides the increased numerical costs due to an additional equation especially the parameterization of the heat transfer term remains cumbersome for implementation and formulation of boundary conditions for the ltne assumption at micro and macro scale see dehghan et al 2016a b recently the importance of the heat transfer term has been emphasized for the application of ltne in geothermal systems zhang et al 2014 estimation of the transfer area is mainly a geometrical problem and can be addressed by assumptions about the pore geometry and or fracture density for fracture there are some recent approaches for an analytical expression for the heat transfer coefficient zhao 2014 heinze et al 2017 parameterization for the pore space is based on empirical relations the most common parameterization derived from various experimental data depends on the dimensionless nusselt reynolds and prandtl number wakao et al 1979 this formulation has been recently extended for lower reynolds numbers by roshan et al 2014 alternative formulations have smaller ranges of validity or are variations of the one above mcadams 1942 nield and bejan 2013 heat transfer in partially saturated media has been addressed in detail especially in the context of evaporation and vapor movement in the ground fundamental research on this issue dates back to the 1950s de vries 1958 bear et al 1991 or et al 2013 with various discussions and extensions up to recent years e g shokri et al 2009 shahraeeni and or 2012 iden et al 2019 temperature especially influences the movement of the wetting front bachmann et al 2002 however so far models mostly consider a thermal equilibrium between the phases e g bennethum and cushman 1999 smits et al 2011 vanderborght et al 2017 very recently a numerical ltne model for unsaturated conditions was presented but without a physical description of the heat transfer coefficient focusing on numerical issues instead kačur et al 2019 in sözen and vafai 1990 a model for condensing flow of a gas through a porous medium was described using the ltne approach the model was designed for mechanical engineering applications like heat storage and heat transfer e g in refrigerators based on the chosen range of applications the model focused on flows of high speed at high pressures taking condensation into account the volume fraction of the liquid phase was considered negligible as well as the interaction between both phases sözen and vafai 1990 in the context of melt water infiltration existing models for freeze thaw approaches rely on lte models shoop and bigl 1997 karra et al 2014 as well as more general models sophocleous 1979 molina giraldo et al 2011 varnosfaderani et al 2017 temperature of the liquid phase controls the phase transition in the freezing thawing processes which also strongly influences hydraulic permeability watanabe and flury 2008 in this work we will derive a mathematical model for heat transfer with separate phase temperatures for all three phases solid liquid and gas such a three phase system requires three heat equations to be solved and the definition of three separate heat transfer terms a model of similar structure has been applied successfully before separating porous matrix stored pore water and fast flowing fracture water heinze and hamidi 2017 this approach will be transferred to unsaturated porous media 2 model description 2 1 heat transfer model in the unsaturated domain there are three phases referred to with the index i s g l for solid s gas g and liquid l the total thermal energy etot j m3 per unit volume in a local thermal non equilibrium model can be expressed as the sum of the thermal energies of the separate phases ei j m3 1 e t o t e s e l e g with the thermal energy of each phase per unit volume 2 e i ϵ i ρ i c i t i with volumetric content ϵ density ρ kg m3 specific heat capacity c j kg k and phase temperature ti k the solid volume fraction ϵ s is related to porosity ϕ by ϵ s 1 ϕ linking volume fractions to the water content θ it is ϵ l θ and ϵ g ϕ θ therefore it is ϵ l ϵ g with the time derivative indicated by the dot a change in total thermal energy per unit volume is expressed by 3 e t o t e s e l e g and can be caused by a change of the phase temperatures or by a change of the volumetric fractions 4 e i c i ρ i t i ϵ i ϵ i t i for each phase conservation of energy can be formulated as 5 e i j i q i with a flux term j w m2 incorporating diffusive and advective fluxes and a source sink term q w m3 using fouriers law j can be defined as 6 j i j a d v i j d i f f i c i ρ i q i t i ϵ i λ i t i with thermal conductivity λ w m k and darcy velocity q m s true flow velocity v is related to darcy velocity q m s through q i ϵ i v i the diffusive term is weighted by the volume fractions assuming that surface fraction is equal to volume fraction for each phase for the three phases the energy conservation can then be written as 7 ϵ s c s ρ s t s ϵ s λ s t s q s 8 c l ρ l t l ϵ l ϵ l c l ρ l t l ϵ l λ l t l c l ρ l q l t l q l 9 c g ρ g t g ϵ g ϵ g c g ρ g t g ϵ g λ g t g c g ρ g q g t g q g as we assume the solid phase to have a constant volume fraction and to be immobile heat transfer in the solid phase is governed by diffusion while liquid and gas include an additional advection term considering the liquid and gas incompressible we can further conclude that liquid and gas move with the same darcy velocity q we further assume that the materials are homogeneous with respect to c λ and ρ the heat equations then simplify to 10 ϵ s c s ρ s t s λ s ϵ s t s q s 11 c l ρ l t l ϵ l ϵ l c l ρ l t l λ l ϵ l t l c l ρ l q t l t l q q l 12 c g ρ g t g ϵ g ϵ g c g ρ g t g λ g ϵ g t g c g ρ g q t g t g q q g with the dot product between q and the gradient of ti decaria and sikora 2010 notice the non vanishing gradient of the volume fraction in the diffusive flux which is due to a possible gradient in surface area for the fluxes of the liquid and gas phase when the volume fraction of a phase within a control volume is changing this is caused by in or out flowing mass if we neglect any other possible causes such as compression or dilation under these assumptions the conservation of mass for the liquid phase can be written as 13 θ q with the relation ϵ l θ and ϵ l ϵ g described above and the conservation of mass the heat equations for fluid and gas can be simplified further 14 ϵ s c s ρ s t s λ s ϵ s δ t s q s 15 ϵ l c l ρ l t l λ l ϵ l t l c l ρ l q t l q l 16 ϵ g c g ρ g t g λ g ϵ g t g c g ρ g q t g q g due to the local thermal non equilibrium each phase interacts with the other phases through a heat transfer term qij fig 1 this transfer term is similar to a heat source or sink for each phase depending on the temperature difference between both phases we set q s q s l q s g q l q s l q l g and q g q s g q l g and so the final model equations are written as 17 ϵ s c s ρ s t s t λ s ϵ s δ t s q s l q s g 18

described by almost any hydraulic model depending on pressure head ψ we neglect any other heat source such as the latent heat exchange from evaporation or condensation in general qij is described by the product of the heat transfer coefficient h w m2 k the specific contact area a 1 m which is surface area per volume and the temperature difference δt k between the phase 21 q h a δ t therefore qsl denotes the heat transfer rate between the solid and the liquid phase based on transfer coefficient specific contact area and the temperature difference of both phases for the interaction between a moving phase and the porous solid the specific contact area as is described for spherical grains by 22 a s 6 1 ϕ d p with grain diameter dp m the heat transfer coefficient h is associated with the dimensionless nusselt number nu 23 n u h d p λ parameterization of h based on empirical parameters taken from wakao et al 1979 roshan et al 2014 can be expressed for small reynolds numbers as 24 h λ d p 2 4 10 5 285 6 p r 1 3 r e 2 7 using the dimensionless prandtl number 25 p r c μ λ and reynolds number 26 r e ρ q d p μ which are defined by viscosity μ pa s and other parameters of the mobile phase this parameterization dates back to wakao et al 1979 and has recently been re defined for a broader range of reynolds numbers by roshan et al 2014 this semi empirical relationship has been validated for reynolds number down to r e 2 4 10 4 and for sand silt and gravel roshan et al 2014 empirical parameters have been derived for solid grains interacting with liquids as well as gases but not for a mixture e g sözen and vafai 1990 amiri and vafai 1994 characteristics of flow and mobile phase are introduced through the dimensionless numbers pr and re for the heat transfer between the liquid and gaseous phase holman 1986 presented various empirical formulas in dependence of rayleigh and reynolds numbers also considering relative motion for simplification often constant values are used e g sodha et al 1982 mcadams 1942 a typical value range of both methods is around 5 20 w m 2 k and therefore in a similar range as for the solid however the contact area between both phases is significantly smaller than for each phase with the solid matrix for illustration we consider the pore space to consist of cylindrical twisted tubes in which water is replacing air partial saturation within a control volume is described by tubes being filled with water and air fig 2 depending on the chosen model all pores might be partly filled or some tubes are empty and some are full depending on their radii and the resulting capillary forces for the derivation of this model we only require a straight wetting front independent of the flow model we assume that the effect of surface tension between water air and soil can be neglected corresponding to a negligible contact angle due to this limitation this model is also not applicable for bubbly or slug flow narayanan and lakehal 2008 assuming a clear wetting front the contact area between the liquid and the gaseous phase is the cross sectional area ai m2 of each tube i with a i π r i 2 at the water air interface while the contact area with the solid is the whole lateral area mi m2 of the tube with m i 2 π r i l with tube radius r m and tube length l m in a capillary tube model the total cross sectional area a of the tubes as well as their total mantle area m within a control volume is given by the sum of the separate cross sections and mantle areas with i 1 n assuming a control volume in the order of meters and the pore radius in the order of millimeters or less the ratio of mantle area to cross sectional area is under any circumstance larger than 1 considering tortuosity this factor would even more increase 27 i 1 n m i i 1 n a i 2 l i 1 n r i i 1 n r i 2 for a cubic control volume with length l 1 m and equal sized pores with radius r the cross sectional porosity is defined as ϕ i 1 n π r i 2 l 2 n j π r 2 with nj as number of capillary tubes per unit area setting r 1 mm which is a typical value for coarse sand and a porosity of 30 we obtain nj 95500 1 m2 for those values the ratio of mantle area to cross sectional area is approximately 2000 based on these considerations we neglect the heat transfer between liquid and gas due to the small contact area the amount of heat transferred between gas and liquid is much smaller than between these phases and the solid qlg qsl qsg although in this model liquid and gaseous phase do not interact directly both exchange heat with the solid phase and can so indirectly interact with each other a similar process has been observed in a ltne approach for dual porosity models in those models pore water and fracture water are separated due to different hydraulic regimes while the direct heat and mass exchange between both domains is negligibly small the pore water acts as additional heat reservoir for the solid matrix the fracture water transports this heat through the system heinze and hamidi 2017 based on the conceptual model described above the heat transfer between solid and liquid or the gaseous phase is weighted by saturation s hence the heat transfer terms between solid and liquid qsl and solid and gas qsg can be defined as 28 q s l s h s l t l t s a s 29 q s g 1 s h s g t g t s a s however considering the values for air with λ g 28 10 3 w m k c g 1000 j kg k ρ g 1 1 kg m 3 μ g 1 9 10 5 pa s a mean grain size of d p 30 μ m and a darcy velocity of v 10 5 m s the heat transfer coefficient is h s g 0 022 w m 2 k and roughly a factor 100 smaller than for the liquid phase for short term infiltrations with small variations in the boundary conditions and only a few degrees dynamic temperature range it is reasonable to assume that the gaseous phase does not contribute significantly to the heat transfer and that the air temperature remains almost constant however the model derived in this work is fully functional without this assumption as all relevant governing equations are given above and can be applied to more extreme conditions than the ones used below 3 model verification an intrinsic problem when verifying theoretical and numerical ltne models is the experimental inability to obtain separate phase temperatures in the porous medium we therefore reproduce mixture temperature profiles of an in situ infiltration experiment with cool and warm irrigation water conducted and presented by wierenga et al 1970 in this experiment phase temperatures were intrinsically in local thermal non equilibrium at the upper boundary as the water had a different temperature than the unsaturated soil at two separate plots water with an initial height of 13 6 cm was infiltrated at 6 30 pm for roughly 1 h at the 28th of august 1969 with a water temperature of 4 1 c and 21 6 c temperatures and water contents were recorded down to 125 cm depth but measured temperatures below 50 cm were not influenced by the infiltration wierenga et al 1970 details on sensor installation and calibration can be found in wierenga et al 1970 further the water infiltration itself was found independent of the water temperature wierenga et al 1970 soil temperatures of a non irrigated plot were recorded for comparison the soil at the test site at the university of california at davis was described as heterogeneous yolo silt loam which has been characterized thermally in wierenga et al 1969 for this infiltration experiment we describe water infiltration into the soil by the green ampt approach e g warrick et al 2005 ma and zheng 2010 kale and sahoo 2011 in this model the infiltration rate i m s into the soil is given as 30 i t k s a t 1 ψ i n i ψ d θ s a t θ i n i f with accumulated infiltration i t m 31 i t 0 t i t d t k i n i t here ψini is equal to the negative of the soil suction head and ψd is the capillary pressure head resulting from the ponding depth the position of the water front zw m can be determined through the total infiltrated amount and the available space θ s a t θ i n i a time dependent height of the ponding water ψd m has been introduced e g by freyberg et al 1980 and warrick et al 2005 discussion of handling non uniform initial conditions can be found in bouwer 1969 for initial heterogeneity in water content the initial hydraulic conductivity is calculated following the model of van

with water column height z m and total water amount vsat m youngs and aggelides 1976 the sharp water front of the green ampt approach represents a discontinuous flow model which requires a small modification to the thermal model as outlined in the appendix for model validation the thermal and hydraulic model have been implemented in a one dimensional finite difference framework thermal diffusion is calculated using a forward in time centered in space scheme advection is included with a third order upwind scheme the modeling domain covers the upper 100 cm the spatial distance between numerical grid points is set to 1 cm but the model results have been found to be independent of the spatial grid resolution position of the wetting front and subsequent water content distribution in the ground are calculated for each time step determined by the explicit stability criteria of the thermal diffusion dt 0 04 s first we matched the infiltration model to the experimental data neglecting possible influences of temperature on the infiltration process fig 3 hydraulic conductivity ksat of 3 8 10 5 m s and capillary pressure head ψini of 30 cm are adjusted to match the experimental data and are in good agreement with other studies using this type of soil e g inoue et al 1998 further values used in our numerical simulation are presented in table 1 water infiltration into the soil and phase temperatures are calculated for an eight hour span after infiltration started initial and saturated water content with depth are taken from the experimental data following the experimental procedure we set the initial ponding depth to 13 6 cm as top boundary condition the ponding depth ψd is reduced depending on the infiltrated amount i t the calculated infiltration duration is 1 h and 3 min and in good agreement with the experimental findings of 1 h wierenga et al 1970 due to the spacing of water content sensors the position of the wetting front can only be approximated therefore the use of the green ampt infiltration model does not introduce any significant inaccuracy in the hydraulic comparison between model results and experimental data secondly based on the adjusted hydraulic model the thermal model is set up the calculated flow velocities result in reynolds numbers much smaller than 1 so that the ltne parameters of roshan et al 2014 are used thermal boundary condition at the bottom is chosen as dirichlet conditions equal for all phases matching the mixture temperature obtained from the experimental data 35 t s z 1 m t t g z 1 m t t l z 1 m t 27 7 c at the top dirichlet boundary conditions are used for the water top boundary temperatures are set according to the experimental water infiltration temperatures of 4 1 c and 21 6 c for soil and air the top boundary temperatures are given by the obtained soil temperatures from the non irrigated soil these soil and air temperatures in degree celsius at the surface can sufficiently be described by a function derived by fitting the surface temperatures of the non irrigated plot for t in hours the top boundary conditions are then given by 36 t s z 0 m t 13 5 c cos π 21 0 t 2 0 2 10 0 c 37 t g z 0 m t t s z 0 m t 38 t l z 0 m t 4 1 c if ψ d 0 t s z 0 m t if ψ d 0 and accordingly for the case of 21 6 c water infiltration the thermal initial conditions are a piece wise linear approximation of the experimental data shown in fig 4 to compare the obtained mixture temperatures with our model results we calculated the mixture temperature weighting the phase temperatures by their volumetric fraction and heat capacity the separate phase temperatures differ by more than one degree at the surface but this difference vanishes quickly within the first couple decimeters of the soil down to 0 05 c and less the proposed model reproduces the experimental findings within the experimental error while naturally falling short to reproduce micro scale heterogeneity due to missing information e g about the grain size distribution fig 4 such heterogeneity is already mentioned in the original experimental publication referencing to the thermal sensors at 20 cm depth wierenga et al 1970 using the newly developed local thermal non equilibrium mode we are able to reproduce experimental data with thermal gradients between the involved phases given in the initial and boundary conditions 4 infiltration into cold soil one application of the local thermal non equilibrium model for partly saturated porous media is the infiltration of rainwater into cold soil this is of special interest as small temperature variations might cause freezing or melting of water in the pore space which greatly influences the hydraulics further it is a clear local thermal non equilibrium condition as soil and rain water have different temperatures initially we use the richards equation in the head based formulation to describe the water infiltration in this scenario 39 c ψ ψ t k ψ ψ 1 with c ψ 1 m as specific moisture capacity and using eq 32 for parameterization of k ψ we assume infiltration at the surface with the maximum possible rate without ponding and assume a constant groundwater level at 3 m depth the model domain is one dimensional similar to above and the hydraulic and thermal parameters are the same as given in table 1 again hydraulic and thermal model are discretized using an explicit forward in time centered in space finite differences scheme advection is included with a third order upwind scheme thermally we assume soil air and initially stored water to be at thermal equilibrium at 0 c 40 t s z t 0 s t g z t 0 s t l z t 0 s 0 c for simplicity we will not consider freezing of the water and related observed phenomena such as reduction of hydraulic conductivity due to the presence of ice e g watanabe and flury 2008 this assumption can be justified as due to supercooling and freezing temperature depression in fine grained material the water will remain liquid bittelli et al 2003 wilson 2012 neglecting thermal gradients in the soil also avoids water movement due to a temperature dependent water potential philip and de vries 1957 the boundary conditions for the thermal part at the top are chosen as dirichlet boundary conditions for the infiltrating water to be 3 c and for the air to be 0 c while neumann boundary conditions are used for the soil bottom boundary conditions for the temperature is set equal for all phases to 0 c assuming that all phases will reach thermal equilibrium till that depth as in the example above 41 t s z z 0 m t 0 42 t g z 0 m t 0 c 43 t l z 0 m t 3 c 44 t s z 1 m t t g z 1 m t t l z 1 m t 0 c the above derived model allows consistent implementation of these boundary conditions the temperature evolution of the soil is closely connected to the moving infiltration front as expected fig 5 using the parameters similar to the section above again temperature differences between the phases are too small to be seen in this plot with less than 0 1 c however for different grain size and hydraulic conductivity the temperature difference between the phases is larger in the following we vary dp and ksat separately while keeping all other values as in table 1 due to the multiple effects of the grain size on the heat transfer such as on contact area nusselt and reynolds number the effect of varying grain size on the phase temperatures is complex in the setup presented here phase temperatures can vary up to a maximum of approximately 0 8 c for d p 1 mm fig 6 based on the initial difference between the phase temperatures at the upper boundary the difference in phase temperatures propagates downwards and becomes smaller over time as the soil warms towards the infiltrating fluid temperature different grain sizes and hydraulic conductivity cause the maximum difference between phase temperatures at different infiltration depths corresponding to varying times of infiltration as we consider the infiltration process independent from the temperature propagation hydraulic conductivity controls advection but also the heat transfer is velocity dependent through the reynolds number in eq 24 therefore an increased hydraulic conductivity also effects the phase temperatures temperature difference between solid and water decreases as hydraulic conductivity decreases for a hydraulic conductivity smaller than 10 6 m s it might happen that locally the soil below the wetting front becomes warmer than the water due to diffusion as advection effects become comparably small as velocity influences the advection term in eq 18 linearly but the heat transfer term with the third root the heat transfer does not increase with the same rate as the advection term for an increased hydraulic conductivity a small comparison to a local thermal equilibrium lte model as it is described for example in de vries 1958 shows the differences of both models beyond a pure temperature divergence the depth profile of lte and ltne models diverges in slope although similar hydraulic properties were used fig 7 further the lte model does not depend on the grain size although the phase temperatures of the water and the soil using the ltne model do not diverge significantly for a grain radius of d p 10 5 m there is a significant temperature difference to the lte model such a behavior has been observed before e g in hamidi et al 2019 a small difference in phase temperatures does not necessarily justify the application of a lte model as it may require additional assumptions e g with respect to the definition of boundary conditions 5 discussion the derived model for local thermal non equilibrium heat conditions in unsaturated porous media and its numerical implementation reproduce the experimental results from wierenga et al 1969 within a range of a few degree celsius in these experiments cold 4 c and warm water 21 c was infiltrated and the changes in water content and temperature were measured naturally in the field only mixture temperatures were obtained so that mixture temperatures of the ltne model had to be calculated assuming that at the thermometer thermal equilibrium is reached as long as there are no experimental procedures to obtain separate phase temperatures this is the only way for model validation largest deviation between model and experimental results is caused by soil heterogeneity e g by probable preferential path ways between 15 20 cm depth in the plot irrigated with 4 1 c cold water wierenga et al 1969 more precise information about soil heterogeneity in the context of hydraulic properties e g preferential path ways and structural as well as thermal parameters such as grain size could contribute to an even better match between model and experiments while the model was developed with a broad scope of applications in mind there are several limitations to consider we neglect any external heat source beside the heat transferred between the phases such an extension can easily be incorporated by adding another source term e g in eqs 17 to 19 we further assume that the flow is laminar and can be reasonably approximated through capillary tubes but the choice of a respective flow model and its parameterization is arbitrary as long as it is in agreement with this assumption further the model requires a clear wetting front within the tubes we further assume flow and grain size to be in a range suited for the parameterization used in roshan et al 2014 for the infiltration in the test case a green ampt model is used for simplification and because it very well describes the water infiltration in this specific scenario due to the coarse sensor installation in the field experiment the exact position of the wetting front and the capillary fringe can only be roughly estimated the use of the green ampt model therefore does not introduce any inaccuracy or error the sharp wetting front emphasizes the concentration of the water heat change through a saturation change along the wetting front discontinuous models can pose a challenge to numerical implementations and might require advanced numerical techniques however the derived heat transfer model could be successfully coupled with discontinuous flow models considering separate phase temperatures in partly saturated porous media allows the consistent definition and implementation of initial and boundary conditions as shown exemplary for rainwater infiltration into frozen soil using the richards equation the split in separate heat equations also allows a straight forward usage of easily obtainable thermal parameters for the different phases and therefore makes empirical formulations e g of partly saturated soil thermal conductivity obsolete cf saito et al 2006 in comparison to the local thermal equilibrium approach our model requires a larger set of parameters some of those are based on empirical findings which could be considered a drawback there is also a lack in experimental validation of separate phase temperatures in the ltne model as pointed out above the numerical implementation is more computationally demanding through the larger number of equations to be solved and there are limitations on the time step for stability and accuracy through the explicit heat transfer term this paper does not focus on the validity of the lte ltne assumptions as such discussions can be found in literature also for geoscientific applications e g hamidi et al 2019 however the test case presented in this work shows that based on boundary conditions and soil parameters the difference in phase temperatures can be significant although the dependence of heat transfer on grain size and hydraulic conductivity is non linear some combinations can cause the differences between the phase temperatures to sustain over hours and remain up to a significant fraction of the initial difference differences in phase temperatures are of special interest in strongly temperature dependent processes like freezing and melting as well as for chemical or biological activity for grain sizes and hydraulic conductivity tested a derivation of 0 2 c has most commonly observed in many scenarios this derivation might be sufficient to assume thermal equilibrium between the phases however equilibrium temperatures calculated using the ltne approach might differ from models assuming lte in the first hand due to the different temporal evolution hamidi et al 2019 the developed theoretical and numerical model can easily be applied for heterogeneous grain size distributions that significantly influence heat transfer between the phases in the case of frozen soil an extension towards melting and freezing models to include e g ice content dependent hydraulic conductivity is desirable this would enable to model rainwater infiltration for a broader temperature range than tested in this work the model is also independent of the chosen parameterization of the heat transfer coefficient besides the one used here based on the parameterization of wakao et al 1979 and roshan et al 2014 other models can be applied e g nield and bejan 2013 extension towards fractured porous material is also possible however the heat transfer coefficient for fracture flow is significantly different and shows for example a linear velocity dependency zhao and tso 1993 in the porous media following the model of roshan et al 2014 the advection depends linearly on velocity while the heat transfer includes the third root of the velocity therefore a velocity increase causes advection effects to dominate as the increase in heat transfer is smaller 6 conclusion a model for local thermal non equilibrium heat transfer and transport under water infiltration in porous media has been derived and validated with historic field measurements due to its small heat transfer coefficient the air phase has been found negligible in the tested infiltration scenarios the derived model allows consistent implementation of initial and boundary conditions that include separate phase temperatures separate parameterization of the thermal phase parameters and deeper insights into the thermal processes during non equilibrium conditions depending on the parameterization of soil and water the difference in phase temperatures can sustain several

include a sharp wetting front which poses a discontinuity in the model across the discontinuity heat transport can not be calculated in the same way as for a continuous model because ϵ i and q can not be defined accordingly this can be resolved by introducing a source term h w m3 in the heat conservation equation corresponding to the changing volume fraction at the wetting front this heat source described by an arbitrary temperature t k of the incoming mass is given relative to the present temperature 45 h c l ρ l ϵ l t t in this formulation the energy gain or loss due to the change in volume fraction based on the temperature difference of incoming mass is written as the difference of temperatures between the added and the present mass the difference in temperature expresses that the incoming mass already has a substantial energy contributing to the thermal energy of the respective volume naturally we can assume t t for an outgoing mass meaning ϵ 0 as everything else would be nonphysical in the case of ϵ 0 the temperature increases if the temperature of the incoming mass t is larger than the original temperature t and vice versa in the context of an infiltration model in a one dimensional setup t z t at a discrete point i with a time discretization using an increment dt can be written as 46 t i t t i 1 t d t assuming the mass is flowing in positive z direction due to the sharp wetting front this term is non vanishing for any kind of spatial or temporal discretization and only occurs at the wetting front as for all other points ϵ 0 on both sides of the discontinuity the heat transport and water flow is considered continuous assuming that the air temperature remains constant as described above and the solid heat equation remains unaltered the heat equation for the fluid in a discontinuous infiltration model can be described as 47 ϵ l c l ρ l t l h l q s l at the wetting front ϵ l λ l δ t l c l ρ l q l t l q s l anywhere else as ϵ l is either θsat on the upper side of the wetting front or θini on the other so ϵ l 0 anywhere else besides at the wetting front we neglect heat diffusion across the discontinuity as we assume the infiltration to be the much faster and dominant process taking into account that in the described scenario the initial water content is comparably small 
581,well placement design refers to finding the optimal well locations to install with a set of constraints this is important for both petroleum engineering and water resource management this study presents a novel optimization method for well placement design in groundwater management the proposed method eo wpp is based on the extremal optimization eo algorithm eo works by modifying the components of a solution that contribute the least to its overall performance eo wpp extends the eo algorithm to the fields of groundwater management and well field optimization for the first time groundwater management program gwm is coupled with eo wpp and used to rank wells in terms of pumping rate given well locations in the first testing phases of this work eo wpp was applied to a problem of simple geometry and a simple synthetic model in order to study its performance and its emergent spatial behaviors results show that the proposed method was faster than particle swarm optimization pso and the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithms eo wpp then was applied to a field problem involving the aberdeen groundwater model in south dakota the results show that eo wpp was able to generate a series of possible of well fields that can be used to pump effectively groundwater from the elm aquifer keywords extremal optimization gwm well placement aberdeen 1 introduction well placement design refers to finding the optimal well locations to install with a set of constraints such as drawdown this is a common problem found in many fields of natural resource management in the petroleum industry solving the well placement problem allows the design of optimal well fields that can efficiently and economically produce hydrocarbon in reservoirs sarma et al 2008 feng et al 2012 nwankwor et al 2013 nozohour leilabady and fazelabdolabadi 2016 for water resource management solving the well placement problem can lead to efficient well field design for pumping groundwater or for aquifer remediation park and aral 2004 bayer et al 2009 elçi and ayvaz 2014 wang and ahlfeld 1994 in previous decades many algorithms have been developed to solve the well placement problem minton 2012 these optimization algorithms can be classified into two main categories global search algorithms and local search algorithms global search algorithms refer to optimization algorithms designed to seek the global minimum or maximum of a given optimization problem chong and zak 2013 global search algorithms are the common type of methods used for well placement optimization minton 2012 examples of algorithms include differential evolution particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms elçi and ayvaz 2014 feng et al 2012 emerick et al 2009 to improve performance researchers have also developed hybrids of these methods nwankwor et al 2013 guyaguler et al 2001 these algorithms gain popularity likely due to their ability to avoid local minimums by relying on stochastic methods and evaluating a population of solutions unlike global search algorithms local search algorithms are optimization algorithms that are susceptible to converging to sub optimal solutions but in exchange for the risk of getting trapped at local minimums local search algorithms can reach an optimal solution faster than global search algorithms mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 humphries et al 2014 local search methods are faster because assumptions are usually made for the optimization problem that allows fewer evaluations of the objective function reducing the number of times for evaluating the objective function is a valuable technique for speed especially when the objective function involves a large numerical model that is computationally expensive examples of local search algorithms include the nelder mead method the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm gradient descent algorithms and other pattern search algorithms nelder and mead 1965 liu and nocedal 1989 ruder 2016 torczon 1997 to reduce risk of getting stuck on local minimums while still retaining the speed of requiring few objective function evaluations researchers have developed hybrids of global and local search optimization methods mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 humphries et al 2014 our proposed method seeks a similar goal however we approach the task using the unique perspective of extremal optimization extremal optimization eo is an optimization algorithm introduced by boettcher and percus 1999 the main heuristic of eo is that in order to improve the performance of a given solution simply identify the least performing component of a solution and replace it with something randomly generated by iteratively changing the worst component of the solution the performance of the overall solution will improve after its introduction in 1999 eo was used in many disciplines of science and engineering in mechanical engineering de sousa et al 2004 used a variant of eo called generalized extremal optimization to design a heat pipe for satellite thermal control in distributed computing de falco et al 2015 used eo as a part of a load balancing algorithm for clusters of multi core processors additional applications include fractional order proportional integral derivative pid controllers wind speed forecasting and spin glass e g zeng et al 2015 chen et al 2018 boettcher 2005 although eo has been used in a variety of applications it has received less attention in hydrogeology this is mainly because eo requires a fitness function that can rank the fitness of each of the components of a solution boettcher and percus 2002 most optimization algorithms use an objective function that outputs a single value however eo also needs a function that determines how much each component of a solution contributes to the overall objective function for many problems such a function might be too ambiguous or impossible to define variants of eo such as general extremal optimization de sousa et al 2004 try to solve this problem by defining a general way to partition the objective function into components that correspond to components of a solution in this work we introduce eo to the well placement problem in groundwater management for the first time and propose a novel component based fitness function specific for the problem domain termed as extremal optimization for the well placement problem eo wpp the eo wpp algorithm will employ this new fitness function to allow the use of eo on well placement problems without significantly changing the structure of the original eo algorithm we show that eo wpp with its unique fitness function allows the algorithm to adopt both the local minimum avoidance behavior of global search algorithms and the speed of local search algorithms by the nature of the heuristic used to replace the worst performing components eo wpp also displays emergent spatial behaviors that are useful for the design of well fields a simple geometry and synthetic examples will be used to demonstrate the method the method then will be applied in aberdeen aquifer in south dakota for a field example of the well placement problem 2 methodology 2 1 groundwater flow equation the governing equation for three dimensional transient groundwater flow in heterogeneous and anisotropic conditions is given as follows anderson et al 2015 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w s s h t where k is hydraulic conductivity h is hydraulic head ss is specific storage and t is time w is a source or sink in this study modflow mcdonald et al 2003 a modular finite difference flow model program developed by the u s geological survey usgs is used to solve the groundwater flow equation numerically a groundwater model is a conceptual representation of a real aquifer when building a model errors can be introduced through measurement conceptual framework or other sources anderson et al 2015 this means that if a well field configuration is optimized using a groundwater model the optimal solution for the model could be different from the optimal solution for the real aquifer for example optimization algorithms may place wells next to constant head boundaries since there is effectively no limit on the flow rate when interpreting any well field solution ensure that the solution takes advantage of the underlying hydrogeological structure of the study area instead of improbably using characteristics only unique to the computer model 2 2 extremal optimization for well placement problems eo wpp the eo wpp algorithm is very similar to the original eo algorithm that was proposed by boettcher and percus 1999 the main difference is how the fitness function was defined and how the least fit component of the solution was adjusted the fitness function quantifies how much a given component of the solution contributes to the overall performance of the solution within the context of well placement problems the fitness function determines how much a given pumping well contributes to the overall discharge of the well field for eo wpp the fitness function evaluated at a well is defined to be the total volume of water produced by the well after operating at its optimal pumping rates for all time periods therefore wells with a high fitness will produce a greater cumulative discharge than other wells one of the main assumptions in eo wpp is that the well which produces the most amount of water with the constraint of drawdown is the most fit well the goal of eo is to adjust the components of a solution in order to maximize their fitness thus the goal of eo wpp is to adjust the location of the wells such that their cumulative output is maximized the purpose of eo wpp s fitness function is to determine optimal pumping rates given the well locations these optimal pumping rates are computed using a separate optimization method for this study eo wpp s fitness function was implemented using a computer program called gwm ahlfeld et al 2005 see section 2 4 for details about gwm however any other local optimization algorithm can be used eo wpp only uses the fitness function to identify the best and worst wells therefore the accuracy of the optimal pumping rates only needs to be good enough to identify the best and worst wells approximations of the optimal pumping rates can be quickly reached by adjusting the convergence criterion of the optimization algorithm this modification reduces the computational requirement for evaluating the fitness function in the original eo algorithm the least fit component is replaced by a randomly generated component in eo wpp the least fit well is removed and replaced with a new well that is randomly placed near the most fit well this heuristic assumes that the best place to put a new well will likely be near the best well the heuristic allows the eo algorithm to quickly converge toward an optimal solution but it also generates a bias and makes the algorithm more susceptible to being trapped at local maximums this can be resolved by implementing the τ eo method introduced by boettcher and percus 1999 2 3 eo wpp algorithm the original eo algorithm was detailed in boettcher and percus 1999 the proposed eo wpp has the following steps step 1 initialize the solution matrix the algorithm begins by initializing the solution matrix w for eo wpp w is the matrix that contains the locations of all the wells that are to be optimized when expanded the locations of the wells can be encoded as such 2 w w 1 w i w i x 1 y 1 x i y i x i y i where i is the total number of wells w i is the location row vector of the ith well and xi yi are the row and column locations of the ith well the goal of eo wpp is to determine the w matrix that maximizes the objective function it does this by starting with an initial randomly generated w matrix and then iteratively adjusting this matrix until it converges onto a solution when initializing the solution matrix a given number of wells are randomly placed within the model domain this must be done in way that makes the constraint function return true as shown below the constraint function c is the function that checks if a given solution matrix respects all constraints for eo wpp the c function checks spatial constraints between wells and boundary conditions examples of spatial constraints may include minimum distances to the boundary or defining areas of the domain to avoid another important spatial constraint is that no two wells can have the same location or occupy the same cell 3 c w c w true if w respects all constraints c w false if w fails to meet all constraints the constraint function simply returns true if the solution matrix respects all constraints and returns false if it does not when initializing the solution matrix the generated matrix must satisfy c w l 0 true constraints for the drawdown and the pumping rates are handled by the fitness function step 2 evaluate the fitness function given the solution matrix w the corresponding fitness vector is calculated the fitness vector q is the vector that contains the fitness for all the components of the solution for eo wpp q is the vector that contains the cumulative volumes for each of the wells the vector can be constructed as such 4 q q 1 q i q i where qi is the cumulative volume of water the ith well produces after operating through all time periods using its optimal pumping rates note that if only one stress period exists then qi can also represent the pumping rate of the ith well to calculate the fitness vector the fitness function is applied to the solution matrix the fitness function f is the function that takes a solution matrix as its input and determines the corresponding fitness vector for eo wpp f takes the well locations w and calculates their corresponding fitness q 5 q f w with every iteration of eo wpp the previous optimal values are discarded and new optimal values are recalculated this is because the placement of new wells may affect the optimal values of adjacent wells when implementing the f function its computer code incorporates both the groundwater model and the optimization program that determines the optimal pumping rates in this paper the groundwater flow model was simulated by modflow mcdonald et al 2003 and the pumping rate optimization was performed by gwm ahlfeld et al 2005 note that the initial pumping rates are determined by the optimization program used for this study gwm initializes the pumping rates to 20 of their maximum pumping rate step 3 remove the worst well with the new fitness vector the worst well is identified the worst well is the well that has the lowest fitness value 6 w w o r s t w i w o r s t w q i w o r s t q i q i q after the worst well is identified it is removed from the solution matrix this is done by defining a new solution matrix w that contains everything but the worst well 7 w w w w w o r s t w step 4 insert a new well to replace the removed well a new well is generated the location of the new well w n e w is dependent on the location of the best well w b e s t the maximum distance between wells d max and a random vector u 8 w b e s t w i b e s t w q i b e s t q i q i q 9 d m a x maximum euclidean distance between any two wells within w 10 u random vector with a length within 0 1 and the same dimensions

field respects all constraints c w true after w passes all constraint checks the temporary well field becomes accepted as the new well field configuration for the current iteration of the algorithm w c w true w step 5 check if a new best solution is found to check the performance of the new solution its objective function is evaluated o is the objective function that eo wpp tries to maximize it is a function of the location of the wells w and can be calculated with the fitness function f 13 o w f w 1 1 i 1 i 1 i q i unlike the fitness function the objective function does not require a separate optimization process the objective function simply takes the results of the fitness function q and reports the sum of the fitness values of all the components in other words the objective function represents the cumulative volume of water a given well field produces when their optimal rates are applied for all stress periods the objective function of the new well field configuration w is calculated and if the result is strictly greater than the best solution found so far o w o wbest then w is saved as the new best solution wbest step 6 check if the stopping criterion is met steps 2 to 5 are repeated for a set number of iterations l however if computational power is not a limitation then l should be set to the maximum value lconvergence lconvergence is the number of eo wpp

algorithm 1 2 4 groundwater management program gwm gwm is a groundwater management process optimization program and its purpose is to determine the pumping rates which maximizes the overall output of a given well field while respecting a set of constraints the objective function maximized by gwm can be described as ahlfeld et al 2005 15 n 1 n β n q w n t q w n m 1 m γ m e x m t e x m l 1 l κ l i l where βn is the cost or benefit per unit volume of water withdrawn or injected at well site n γm is the cost or benefit per unit volume of water imported or exported at external site m κl is the unit cost or benefit associated with the binary variable il qwn is the withdrawal or injection rate at well site n exm is the import or export rate at external site m il is a binary variable at site l i l 1 o r 0 t q w n is the total duration of flow at well site n t e x m is the total duration of flow at external site m n m l are the total number of flow rate external and binary decision variables note that the objective function is composed of a summation term for the wells a term for any external sources and a term for any external sources with a binary attribute for this work only the summation term was used and the other two were disregarded set to zero this was done to simplify synthetic examples during testing however eo wpp can operate with the entire objective function to modify the objective function to give the cumulative water output let βn gammam and κ l 1 if the optimization problem is nonlinear then gwm uses a technique called using sequential linear programming slp to maximize the objective function ahlfeld et al 2005 slp works by calculating the response matrix and then using this matrix and the list of constraints to calculate how to adjust the parameters such as pumping rates to maximize the objective function the response matrix also termed the jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to each of the parameters of interest the elements of the response matrix are calculated by the finite difference perturbation method for an optimization problem with n parameters to adjust the objective function and so the groundwater model runs n 1 iterations every time the response matrix is calculated for linear optimization problems the response matrix only needs to be calculated once unfortunately most groundwater models contain rivers or other head dependent boundaries thereby making these optimization problems nonlinear with nonlinear optimization problems a new response matrix is calculated every time the parameters are adjusted compared to linear optimization problems the need for repeated calculations of the response matrix makes optimizing nonlinear problems a computationally expensive process 3 demonstration of eo wpp 3 1 case 1 simple geometric problem to examine the spatial behaviors of eo wpp the algorithm was first tested on an optimization problem with simple geometry the optimal solutions for these problems are simple and known so these problems can give insight into how eo wpp converges toward a solution 3 1 1 set up of problem one of the geometry problems is a point target problem given a set of points randomly placed on a 2d plane the goal of eo wpp is to adjust the position of the points to be as close to the origin point as possible the fitness function used by eo wpp is just the distance from the point to the origin 16 f i t n e s s o f w i w i l 2 x i 2 y i 2 2 unlike the well placement problem the goal for this optimization problem is to find a solution that minimizes the objective function simply multiplying the fitness function by negative one converts the minimization problem into a maximization problem otherwise all other mechanisms of the algorithm remain the same with every iteration of eo wpp points that are farthest from the origin have the lowest fitness and so will be removed a removed point will be replaced by a point that is randomly placed near the point of highest fitness which is the point that is closest to the origin points are free to be placed anywhere within the bounds of the domain the location of these points are defined on a continuous 2d cartesian plane that extends from 100 to 100 in both the x and y axis the parameter i the number of points was set to three six and twelve points during testing to observe how eo wpp would respond with increasing numbers of points ten runs for each set of points were performed and the average performances with each set of runs were calculated and compared performance of the overall solution was measured by the average distance between the points and the origin to test for how the heuristic for placing a new well affects the performance of eo wpp algorithm a comparison of three different placement heuristics was performed with the simple geometric problem used as a benchmark the first heuristic randomly places the new well anywhere within the domain the second heuristic places the new well within a circle centered around the best well the radius of this circle the placement radius is set to the distance between two different and randomly chosen wells the third heuristic is similar to the second heuristic except that it sets the placement radius equal to the maximum distance between any two wells this is also the heuristic used by the proposed eo wpp algorithm for each heuristic 100 runs were performed with each run consisting of 300 iterations of the eo wpp algorithm each run was initialized with a random starting positions for the wells the number of wells was set to six for all tests the eo wpp algorithm was also compared against particle swarm optimization pso and the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm pso was selected because it is a popular global search optimization algorithm likewise the bfgs was also selected because it was a common local search algorithm by comparing eo wpp to pso and bfgs eo wpp s performance can be compared to different modes of optimization for each method 100 runs were performed with the goal of optimally placing six wells the number of times for evaluating the simple geometric objective function was recorded to allow proper comparison among the three optimization methods 3 1 2 results fig 2 displays the results for running eo wpp on the point target problem with various numbers of points i the results show that the performance of the eo wpp algorithm is partially sensitive to the number of points to optimize for for all values of i the algorithm converged toward a solution that minimized the objective function on average eo wpp quickly generated a solution with the lowest objective function value when i 6 for values larger than i 6 the algorithm took longer to converge toward a solution because each iteration of eo wpp can only move one point with larger numbers of points more iterations are needed to adjust the entire set of points for values smaller than i 6 eo wpp initially outperformed the i 6 curve however around 10 iterations the i 3 curve changes into slower rate thereby losing to the i 6 curve by iteration 20 this change of eo wpps performance for small point numbers was from premature convergence fig 3 displays the results of the three different new well placement heuristics in the figure the mode total fitness value objective function value is plotted against the number of iterations of the eo wpp algorithm the results show that among the three heuristics the best heuristic is to set the placement radius equal to the maximum distance between any two wells within the well field this is the same heuristic used by the proposed eo wpp algorithm algorithm 1 for the heuristic of randomly placing the well within the domain the algorithm converges slower than the other two methods for the heuristic where the placement radius was set to the distant of two distinct and randomly chosen wells it initially converged the fastest but the algorithm plateaus and fails to converge any further after 25 evaluations fig 4 displays the results for comparing eo wpp to the pso and bfgs optimization algorithms the mode objective function value is plotted against the number of times the objective function was evaluated the results indicate that eo wpp performs better than both the pso and bfgs algorithms with eo wpp achieving near full convergence after just 60 evaluations of the objective function bfgs then follows up as the second best performer leaving pso as the slowest algorithm for this benchmark 3 2 case 2 synthetic groundwater model to test how the eo wpp algorithm would perform on optimization problems with a groundwater model a synthetic groundwater model was constructed the synthetic example was built and based on the benchmark example provided by ahlfeld et al 2005 in the paper that was used to verify the gwm optimization algorithm 3 2 1 set up of synthetic model the modeling domain was one layer discretized by 25 by 30 grid of cells all cells were squares and have a side length of 200 ft the model was bounded by constant heads that varied from 86 to 100 ft at the top and bottom of the model with no flow boundary conditions to the left and right in the middle of the model was a river composed of three stream segments with flow from left to right all stream segments were 20 ft wide and had a stream bed conductance of 20 000 ft2 day the main stream had a slope of 0 0025 whereas the tributary stream had a slope of 0 0010 fig 5 shows details for the modeling domain to test how eo wpp handles constraints four conditions for streamflow depletion were placed along the river the streamflow depletion constraints were defined as such ahlfeld et al 2005 17 q s d r q s f r 0 q s f r 18 q s d r q s d r u streamflow depletion qsdr is defined as the difference between the initial streamflow at stream location r at the end of the stress period qsfr 0 and the streamflow calculated at the location at the end of the stress period after implementation of the optimal pumping strategy qsfr the upper bound streamflow depletion constraint values q s d r u and the times when the constraints are enforced were different for each site this was done to test how eo wpp handles constraint complexity across different stress periods the transmissivity for the model was set to the synthetic heterogenous field shown on fig 6 for simplicity of analysis the transmissivity was set to either 50 or 500 ft2 day transmissivity was 500 ft2 day across most of the model except for three regions of low transmissivity the first region was at the top and bottom of the model where the constant head boundaries were located any optimization algorithm can cheat in maximizing the objective function by pumping near constant head boundaries where nearly infinite flow is possible with little or no change of hydraulic head to deter this behavior low transmissivity cells were placed near the boundaries to prevent eo wpp from taking advantage of this edge effect the second region of low transmissivity was in the left middle section of the model domain this was done to see how eo wpp would handle a situation in which a large region of the model would be a non ideal area to place wells the hope was that after placing a well in this region the algorithm would quickly learn to avoid the area the third low transmissivity region was in the lower right section of the model prior tests with this model have shown that the best place to put the wells was at the bottom right side of the model by placing a region of low transmissivity in the same area eo wpp was forced to find a well field solution that somehow navigated around this low transmissivity region the groundwater model simulated a three year period divided into 12 stress periods one stress period for each season the aquifer had a homogenous recharge at a rate of 0 005 ft day in the winter 0 002 ft day in the spring 0 ft day in the summer and 0 001 ft day in the fall the goal for eo wpp was to determine the best locations to place four wells the wells ran at a single pumping rate for the entire three year period the pumping rates for the wells could vary between zero and 50 000 ft3 day the drawdown limit for all wells was set to 10 ft the task of gwm was to determine the optimal rates that maximized the cumulative output of the field for a given well field configuration while respecting all constraints for the tests eo wpp was given 128 iterations to find an optimal solution the entire eo wpp process was restarted 128 times with a random initial well field solution each time this was done to determine eo wpps average performance the performance of the eo wpp algorithm was measured by using the cumulative output of the optimal field the unit and absolute value of the cumulative output was not important because these values were only compared to each other therefore the cumulative output could be treated as the total fitness of a solution 3 2 2 results a sample of a well field solution generated by eo wpp is shown on fig 7 the results of the test show that eo wpp can converge toward optimal well solutions on average the well field solutions involved wells that were placed close to the river fig 5 this is reasonable because of the high conductivity the river offered eo wpp often placed the wells on the bottom right side of the model domain and next to the southeastern stream because the water in the model was flowing into that region while converging eo wpp was able to generate well field solutions that avoided the low transmissivity regions this shows that relying on a global constant drawdown constraint works as a method for eo wpp to identify regions of low productivity many of the solutions also had wells that were placed far from streamflow constraint sites therefore the eo wpp algorithm generated well field solutions that took constraint sites into consideration for eo wpps overall performance fig 8 shows the statistics computed for all 128 runs case 2 results shows that the eo wpp functions and that it can statistically perform better than the best out of n algorithm in other words on average it is computationally more efficient to run the eo wpp algorithm n times than to randomly generate n well field solutions and report the best one for this groundwater model based on the 128 eo wpp runs fig 8 a randomly generated well field solution had a total fitness between 12 000 and 42 000 with a median of 30 000 with each iteration the entire distribution of the solution fitness improves by the 30th iteration the median solution fitness matched and exceeded the maximum fitness of the zeroth iteration of the solution that means for this groundwater model there is a 50 chance that running the eo wpp algorithm for 30 iterations will yield a well field solution that is better than what could be achieved by randomly placing wells in the model this method of comparing with the best out of n algorithm is a valid technique that has been performed by other groups such as feng et al 2012 with each eo wpp iteration the groundwater model was evaluated 15 times so after 30 iterations the model ran a total of 450 times note that the number of times for evaluating the groundwater model is dependent on the optimization function used by the fitness function 3 3 case 3 aberdeen groundwater model after developing and testing eo wpp with the synthetic example the eo wpp algorithm was applied to the aberdeen aquifer in south dakota for model details see valder et al 2018 3 3 1 set up of aberdeen model the city of aberdeen is in brown county in the northeastern part of south dakota the study area encompassed 490 mi 2 north of aberdeen in the james river lowland and lake dakota plain physiographic provinces fig 9 the study area included the glacial aquifer system north of aberdeen between foot creek and the james river because that area supports the citys current municipal well field currently most of the citys water is supplied from the elm river when the streamflow of the river becomes too low water is pumped from a well field seven miles north of aberdeen these wells were completed in the elm aquifer a shallow alluvial aquifer system in hydraulic connection with the elm river ideally the eo wpp algorithm paired with the aberdeen groundwater model can provide insight on where to place new wells to efficiently use the elm aquifer the aberdeen groundwater model was presented in valder et al 2018 the aberdeen model consisted of seven layers three layers were for the elm aquifer the middle james aquifer and the deep james aquifer and the remaining four layers were confining layers that bound the three aquifers the elm aquifer layer 2 from the top is of interest because it is the shallowest and most accessible aquifer the average thickness of the elm aquifer is 24 ft and the average depth to the aquifer is 30 ft the model was discretized into a finite difference grid consisting of 368 rows and 410 columns with a cell size of 200 by 200 ft the model was bounded by recharge river drainage and well boundary conditions the model contained 99 stress periods that simulates the years 1975 2015 the revised model used the usgs finite difference groundwater flow model modflow nwt to calculate all water budgets and flows additional details for the model are in the report by valder et al 2018 3 3 2 eo wpp for the aberdeen model the goal for eo wpp was to determine the best way to place six wells the number of wells used was inspired by the results of case 2 fig 8 in the model these wells ran at a constant pumping rate for one year october 1974 to october 1975 all pumping wells were installed in the elm aquifer layer 2 and all wells were subject to a drawdown constraint of 10 ft to prevent eo wpp from exploiting boundary conditions a distant constraint was defined such that all wells were at least 600 feet away from rivers boundaries and each other to deter cheating wells also were forced to be placed in a bounded region within the model domain for the first optimization run of eo wpp the well locations are bounded by 10 row 300 and 100 column 300 for the remaining runs the extent of the bounding region was reduced to 100 row 300 four runs of the eo wpp algorithm were performed each run involved initializing the solution with six randomly placed wells then iteratively improving the solution by applying eo wpp for 100 iterations each run took approximately two days to complete when performed on a single intel core i7 6600u cpu running at 2 8 ghz with each iteration the majority of the time was spent on calculating the fitness function the fitness function requires the optimal pumping rates for a given well field solution these pumping rates were determined with gwm which was set to solve for the optimal pumping rates using slp to reduce computation time the convergence criterion used by slp was adjusted such that the slp loop terminates early although this reduced the accuracy of the optimal values it does not significantly affect the performance of the fitness function the main purpose of the fitness function was to identify the well that will likely produce the least amount of water therefore an approximation of the optimal pumping rates is enough this method is similar to how τ eo operates introduced by boettcher and percus 1999 τ eo is a version of eo that randomly removes one of the low fitness components instead of strictly removing the component of lowest fitness this allows τ eo to behave like a global search algorithm and avoid local minimums by using approximately optimal pumping rates eo wpp exhibits the same behavior as τ eo 3 3 3 results of aberdeen model results of the four runs show that eo wpp was able to optimize the well field and converge toward a solution for all runs eo wpp was able to perform at least 90 of optimization progress within 50 iterations the remaining iterations were spent on refining the solution this agreed with results found with the synthetic examples in case 2 an example of eo wpp s optimization progress during a run is shown on fig 10 with each iteration the fitness of the best solution steadily increased yet the fitness of the current solution either increased or decreased with each iteration in fig 10 during iteration 40 60 the fitness of the current solution dropped significantly before later recovering this behavior was expected because removing the worst well and replacing it with a randomly placed new well did not guarantee an improvement of the total field output even without this guarantee the fitness of the current solution still generally increased with increasing number of iterations this indicates that the heuristic of strictly modifying the worst performing well allowed eo wpp to generate new well field solutions that were more likely to be better than previous solutions for all runs the eo wpp algorithm placed wells in locations that seemed to correlate with the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the layer the wells were pumping from layer 2 the well field solutions and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity are shown on fig 11 in the first run eo wpp placed some wells close to the top boundary fig 11 a to ensure that eo wpp was not taking advantage of boundary conditions the remaining runs had the bounding region adjusted so that wells were placed below row 100 the effects of adjusting the bounding region affected the total output of the well field before the adjustment the maximum well field output was 2 6 108 ft3 yr after the adjustment the well field output was reduced to a maximum of 1 3 108 ft3 yr regardless of the bounding region eo wpp consistently placed a majority of the wells near or upon sites with high horizontal hydraulic conductivity recall that eo wpp only uses pumping rates and drawdown at the wells the algorithm does not use explicit knowledge of hydraulic conductivity yet for the aberdeen groundwater model the well field solutions appear to correlate best with the horizontal hydraulic conductivity this indicates that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity plays a crucial role when determining optimal well field configurations well locations that deviate from peak horizontal hydraulic conductivity were caused by eo wpp s consideration of other factors such as recharge aquifer thickness or vertical hydraulic conductivity 4 discussion within the eo wpp algorithm the placement of the new well is dependent on the location of the best well this was done to introduce a clustering behavior into the eo wpp algorithm though it seems like this placement heuristic may cause the eo wpp algorithm to get stuck at local minimums our results show that by abiding to certain guidelines this can be avoided for example fig 2 shows that with a low number of points eo wpp is more likely to display behavior that causes stagnation at local minimums in fig 2 this premature convergence behavior can be seen in the curve for i 3 note that by 10 iterations the slope of the curve changes significantly yet for the other two curves this change of slope does not exist this is because with a low number of points it becomes more likely for the points to become too close to each other and cause premature convergence for a sufficiently large number of points this behavior disappears based on these results there must be at least six points to ensure eo wpp does not exhibit this behavior the eo wpp algorithm places the new well within a certain distance from the best well this distance called the placement radius is set to be the maximum distance between any two wells within the well field the results on fig 3 show that this placement heuristic is ideal for the eo wpp algorithm if the placement radius was set too small such as the distance between two random and distinct wells then the clustering behavior becomes too strong and causes eo wpp to converge prematurely in fig 3 this shows as an early plateau in the performance curve if the placement radius was set too large such as randomly placing the new well anywhere in the model domain then eo wpp converges too slowly towards the solution eo wpp s placement heuristic introduces a clustering behavior that can be sensitive to the configuration of the initial solution to ensure the initial solution does not have an influence in the shape of the final solution eo wpp must iterate a larger number of times with a large number of iterations eo wpp s stochastic mechanisms allow the algorithm to properly explore the search space before converging towards a set of solutions this was shown to be true in the results for the synthetic model fig 7 and the aberdeen model fig 11 for both cases the eo wpp algorithm generated very similar solutions even when going through the eo wpp algorithm with 100 different randomly generated initial solutions tests show that as eo wpp s performance reaches its stall limit the solutions begin to look similar to each other this makes sense since the number of possible well field configurations decreases as the performance of these solutions approach the global optimum value to gain greater confidence in the stability of the solutions multiple instances of eo wpp can be ran with the iteration process terminated once all instances generate the same solution eo wpp is essentially a combination of mechanisms from both global and local search algorithms eo wpp relies on a population of wells a technique similar to the population mechanisms used by global search algorithms eo wpp also operates on a single well field solution and modifies the solution based on the information gained by the solution s components this mechanism is similar to how local search algorithms operates eo wpp combines these techniques in a way that allows it to avoid local minimums and quickly converge towards a solution fig 4 shows that at least for the simple geometric case eo wpp converges faster than the pso global search algorithm and the bfgs local search algorithm another advantage eo wpp provides is its ability to find well field solutions with the wells close to each other fig 11 shows eo wpp s clustering behavior found solutions where some wells are nearby each other e g run 2 and run 3 this behavior is desirable for well field design since reducing distances between wells can reduce the amount of infrastructure needed to connect the wells together what is interesting about this behavior is that it is not explicitly defined in the objective function or in the constraints instead this spatial behavior emerges from the definition of the placement heuristic 5 conclusions this paper introduced a novel well placement optimization algorithm eo wpp which was inspired by the optimization algorithm called extremal optimization eo wpp works by removing the least productive wells and replacing them with new wells placed randomly near the most productive wells by following this heuristic eo wpp can quickly generate well fields optimized for cumulative well field output a simple geometric benchmark shows that eo wpp was able to perform faster than common global search and local search methods a synthetic groundwater model shows that with a large enough well count and number of iterations eo wpp was able to avoid local minimums and yield consistent well field solutions results also verify that eo wpp exhibits an emergent spatial behavior of clustering a behavior that is useful during the design of optimal well fields eo wpp then was applied to the aberdeen groundwater model eo wpp was able to generate multiple potential well field solutions that maximized total water discharge from the elm aquifer while respecting drawdown and spatial constraints the locations of the wells indicated that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity was an important factor when designing a well field for the region north of aberdeen although eo wpp was applied only to a model built to help the city of aberdeen the methods introduced in this paper are applicable to groundwater management in general eo wpp can be used for designing well fields to use groundwater resources efficiently placement optimization problems extend beyond groundwater management and the methods introduced by eo wpp can be applied to other fields such as mining operations petroleum production groundwater monitoring and more

581,well placement design refers to finding the optimal well locations to install with a set of constraints this is important for both petroleum engineering and water resource management this study presents a novel optimization method for well placement design in groundwater management the proposed method eo wpp is based on the extremal optimization eo algorithm eo works by modifying the components of a solution that contribute the least to its overall performance eo wpp extends the eo algorithm to the fields of groundwater management and well field optimization for the first time groundwater management program gwm is coupled with eo wpp and used to rank wells in terms of pumping rate given well locations in the first testing phases of this work eo wpp was applied to a problem

pso and the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithms eo wpp then was applied to a field problem involving the aberdeen groundwater model in south dakota the results show that eo wpp was able to generate a series of possible of well fields that can be used to pump effectively groundwater from the elm aquifer keywords extremal optimization gwm well placement aberdeen 1 introduction well placement design refers to finding the optimal well locations to install with a set of constraints such as drawdown this is a common problem found in many fields of natural resource management in the petroleum industry solving the well placement problem allows the design of optimal well fields that can efficiently and economically produce hydrocarbon in reservoirs sarma et al 2008 feng et al 2012 nwankwor et al 2013 nozohour leilabady and fazelabdolabadi 2016 for water resource management solving the well placement problem can lead to efficient well field design for pumping groundwater or for aquifer remediation park and aral 2004 bayer et al 2009 elçi and ayvaz 2014 wang and ahlfeld 1994 in previous decades many algorithms have been developed to solve the well placement problem minton 2012 these optimization algorithms can be classified into two main categories global search algorithms and local search algorithms global search algorithms refer to optimization algorithms designed to seek the global minimum or maximum of a given optimization problem chong and zak 2013 global search algorithms are the common type of methods used for well placement optimization minton 2012 examples of algorithms include differential evolution particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms elçi and ayvaz 2014 feng et al 2012 emerick et al 2009 to improve performance researchers have also developed hybrids of these methods nwankwor et al 2013 guyaguler et al 2001 these algorithms gain popularity likely due to their ability to avoid local minimums by relying on stochastic methods and evaluating a population of solutions unlike global search algorithms local search algorithms are optimization algorithms that are susceptible to converging to sub optimal solutions but in exchange for the risk of getting trapped at local minimums local search algorithms can reach an optimal solution faster than global search algorithms mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 humphries et al 2014 local search methods are faster because assumptions are usually made for the optimization problem that allows fewer evaluations of the objective function reducing the number of times for evaluating the objective function is a valuable technique for speed especially when the objective function involves a large numerical model that is computationally expensive examples of local search algorithms include the nelder mead method the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm gradient descent algorithms and other pattern search algorithms nelder and mead 1965 liu and nocedal 1989 ruder 2016 torczon 1997 to reduce risk of getting stuck on local minimums while still retaining the speed of requiring few objective function evaluations researchers have developed hybrids of global and local search optimization methods mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 humphries et al 2014 our proposed method seeks a similar goal however we approach the task using the unique perspective of extremal optimization extremal optimization eo is an optimization algorithm introduced by boettcher and percus 1999 the main heuristic of eo is that in order to improve the performance of a given solution simply identify the least performing component of a solution and replace it with something randomly generated by iteratively changing the worst component of the solution the performance of the overall solution will improve after its introduction in 1999 eo was used in many disciplines of science and engineering in mechanical engineering de sousa et al 2004 used a variant of eo called generalized extremal optimization to design a heat pipe for satellite thermal control in distributed computing de falco et al 2015 used eo as a part of a load balancing algorithm for clusters of multi core processors additional applications include fractional order proportional integral derivative pid controllers wind speed forecasting and spin glass e g zeng et al 2015 chen et al 2018 boettcher 2005 although eo has been used in a variety of applications it has received less attention in hydrogeology this is mainly because eo requires a fitness function that can rank the fitness of each of the components of a solution boettcher and percus 2002 most optimization algorithms use an objective function that outputs a single value however eo also needs a function that determines how much each component of a solution contributes to the overall objective function for many problems such a function might be too ambiguous or impossible to define variants of eo such as general extremal optimization de sousa et al 2004 try to solve this problem by defining a general way to partition the objective function into components that correspond to components of a solution in this work we introduce eo to the well placement problem in groundwater management for the first time and propose a novel component based fitness function specific for the problem domain termed as extremal optimization for the well placement problem eo wpp the eo wpp algorithm will employ this new fitness function to allow the use of eo on well placement problems without significantly changing the structure of the original eo algorithm we show that eo wpp with its unique fitness function allows the algorithm to adopt both the local minimum avoidance behavior of global search algorithms and the speed of local search algorithms by the nature of the heuristic used to replace the worst performing components eo wpp also displays emergent spatial behaviors that are useful for the design of well fields a simple geometry and synthetic examples will be used to demonstrate the method the method then will be applied in aberdeen aquifer in south dakota for a field example of the well placement problem 2 methodology 2 1 groundwater flow equation the governing equation for three dimensional transient groundwater flow in heterogeneous and anisotropic conditions is given as follows anderson et al 2015 1 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z w s s h t where k is hydraulic conductivity h is hydraulic head ss is specific storage and t is time w is a source or sink in this study modflow mcdonald et al 2003 a modular finite difference flow model program developed by the u s geological survey usgs is used to solve the groundwater flow equation numerically a groundwater model is a conceptual representation of a real aquifer when building a model errors can be introduced through measurement conceptual framework or other sources anderson et al 2015 this means that if a well field configuration is optimized using a groundwater model the optimal solution for the model could be different from the optimal solution for the real aquifer for example optimization algorithms may place wells next to constant head boundaries since there is effectively no limit on the flow rate when interpreting any well field solution ensure that the solution takes advantage of the underlying hydrogeological structure of the study area instead of improbably using characteristics only unique to the computer model 2 2 extremal optimization for well placement problems eo wpp the eo wpp algorithm is very similar to the original eo algorithm that was proposed by boettcher and percus 1999 the main difference is how the fitness function was defined and how the least fit component of the solution was adjusted the fitness function quantifies how much a given component of the solution contributes to the overall performance of the solution within the context of well placement problems the fitness function determines how much a given pumping well contributes to the overall discharge of the well field for eo wpp the fitness function evaluated at a well is defined to be the total volume of water produced by the well after operating at its optimal pumping rates for all time periods therefore wells with a high fitness will produce a greater cumulative discharge than other wells one of the main assumptions in eo wpp is that the well which produces the most amount of water with the constraint of drawdown is the most fit well the goal of eo is to adjust the components of a solution in order to maximize their fitness thus the goal of eo wpp is to adjust the location of the wells such that their cumulative output is maximized the purpose of eo wpp s fitness function is to determine optimal pumping rates given the well locations these optimal pumping rates are computed using a separate optimization method for this study eo wpp s fitness function was implemented using a computer program called gwm ahlfeld et al 2005 see section 2 4 for details about gwm however any other local optimization algorithm can be used eo wpp only uses the fitness function to identify the best and worst wells therefore the accuracy of the optimal pumping rates only needs to be good enough to identify the best and worst wells approximations of the optimal pumping rates can be quickly reached by adjusting the convergence criterion of the optimization algorithm this modification reduces the computational requirement for evaluating the fitness function in the original eo algorithm the least fit component is replaced by a randomly generated component in eo wpp the least fit well is removed and replaced with a new well that is randomly placed near the most fit well this heuristic assumes that the best place to put a new well will likely be near the best well the heuristic allows the eo algorithm to quickly converge toward an optimal solution but it also generates a bias and makes the algorithm more susceptible to being trapped at local maximums this can be resolved by implementing the τ eo method introduced by boettcher and percus 1999 2 3 eo wpp algorithm the original eo algorithm was detailed in boettcher and percus 1999 the proposed eo wpp has the following steps step 1 initialize the solution matrix the algorithm begins by initializing the solution matrix w for eo wpp w is the matrix that contains the locations of all the wells that are to be optimized when expanded the locations of the wells can be encoded as such 2 w w 1 w i w i x 1 y 1 x i y i x i y i where i is the total number of wells w i is the location row vector of the ith well and xi yi are the row and column locations of the ith well the goal of eo wpp is to determine the w matrix that maximizes the objective function it does this by starting with an initial randomly generated w matrix and then iteratively adjusting this matrix until it converges onto a solution when initializing the solution matrix a given number of wells are randomly placed within the model domain this must be done in way that makes the constraint function return true as shown below the constraint function c is the function that checks if a given solution matrix respects all constraints for eo wpp the c function checks spatial constraints between wells and boundary conditions examples of spatial constraints may include minimum distances to the boundary or defining areas of the domain to avoid another important spatial constraint is that no two wells can have the same location or occupy the same cell 3 c w c w true if w respects all constraints c w false if w fails to meet all constraints the constraint function simply returns true if the solution matrix respects all constraints and returns false if it does not when initializing the solution matrix the generated matrix must satisfy c w l 0 true constraints for the drawdown and the pumping rates are handled by the fitness function step 2 evaluate the fitness function given the solution matrix w the corresponding fitness vector is calculated the fitness vector q is the vector that contains the fitness for all the components of the solution for eo wpp q is the vector that contains the cumulative volumes for each of the wells the vector can be constructed as such 4 q q 1 q i q i where qi is the cumulative volume of water the ith well produces after operating through all time periods using its optimal pumping rates note that if only one stress period exists then qi can also represent the pumping rate of the ith well to calculate the fitness vector the fitness function is applied to the solution matrix the fitness function f is the function that takes a solution matrix as its input and determines the corresponding fitness vector for eo wpp f takes the well locations w and calculates their corresponding fitness q 5 q f w with every iteration of eo wpp the previous optimal values are discarded and new optimal values are recalculated this is because the placement of new wells may affect the optimal values of adjacent wells when implementing the f function its computer code incorporates both the groundwater model and the optimization program that determines the optimal pumping rates in this paper the groundwater flow model was simulated by modflow mcdonald et al 2003 and the pumping rate optimization was performed by gwm ahlfeld et al 2005 note that the initial pumping rates are determined by the optimization program used for this study gwm initializes the pumping rates to 20 of their maximum pumping rate step 3 remove the worst well with the new fitness vector the worst well is identified the worst well is the well that has the lowest fitness value 6 w w o r s t w i w o r s t w q i w o r s t q i q i q after the worst well is identified it is removed from the solution matrix this is done by defining a new solution matrix w that contains everything but the worst well 7 w w w w w o r s t w step 4 insert a new well to replace the removed well a new well is generated the location of the new well w n e w is dependent on the location of the best well w b e s t the maximum distance between wells d max and a

c w true w step 5 check if a new best solution is found to check the performance of the new solution its objective function is evaluated o is the objective function that eo wpp tries to maximize it is a function of the location of the wells w and can be calculated with the fitness function f 13 o w f w 1 1 i 1 i 1 i q i unlike the fitness function the objective function does not require a separate optimization process the objective function simply takes the results of the fitness function q and reports the sum of the fitness values of all the components in other words the objective function represents the cumulative volume of water a given well field produces when their optimal rates are applied for all stress periods the objective function of the new well field configuration w is calculated and if the result is strictly greater than the best solution found so far o w o wbest then w is saved as the new best solution wbest step 6 check if the stopping criterion is met steps 2 to

algorithm 1 2 4 groundwater management program gwm gwm is a groundwater management process optimization program and its purpose is to determine the pumping rates which maximizes the overall output of a given well field while respecting a set of constraints the objective function maximized by gwm can be described as ahlfeld et al 2005 15 n 1 n β n q w n t q w n m 1 m γ m e x m t e x m l 1 l κ l i l where βn is the cost or benefit per unit volume of water withdrawn or injected at well site n γm is the cost or benefit per unit volume of water imported or exported at external site m κl is the unit cost or benefit associated with the binary variable il qwn is the withdrawal or injection rate at well site n exm is the import or export rate at external site m il is a binary variable at site l i l 1 o r 0 t q w n is the total duration of flow at well site n t e x m is the total duration of flow at external site m n m l are the total number of flow rate external and binary decision variables note that the objective function is composed of a summation term for the wells a term for any external sources and a term for any external sources with a binary attribute for this work only the summation term was used and the other two were disregarded set to zero this was done to simplify synthetic examples during testing however eo wpp can operate with the entire objective function to modify the objective function to give the cumulative water output let βn gammam and κ l 1 if the optimization problem is nonlinear then gwm uses a technique called using sequential linear programming slp to maximize the objective function ahlfeld et al 2005 slp works by calculating the response matrix and then using this matrix and the list of constraints to calculate how to adjust the parameters such as pumping rates to maximize the objective function the response matrix also termed the jacobian matrix is a matrix of partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to each of the parameters of interest the elements of the response matrix are calculated by the finite difference perturbation method for an optimization problem with n parameters to adjust the objective function and so the groundwater model runs n 1 iterations every time the response matrix is calculated for linear optimization problems the response matrix only needs to be calculated once unfortunately most groundwater models contain rivers or other head dependent boundaries thereby making these optimization problems nonlinear with nonlinear optimization problems a new response matrix is calculated every time the parameters are adjusted compared to linear optimization problems the need for repeated calculations of the response matrix makes optimizing nonlinear problems a computationally expensive process 3 demonstration of eo wpp 3 1 case 1 simple geometric problem to examine the spatial behaviors of eo wpp the algorithm was first tested on an optimization problem with simple geometry the optimal solutions for these problems are simple and known so these problems can give insight into how eo wpp converges toward a solution 3 1 1 set up of problem one of the geometry problems is a point target problem given a set of points randomly placed on a 2d plane the goal of eo wpp is to adjust the position of the points to be as close to the origin point as possible the fitness function used by eo wpp is just the distance from the point to the origin 16 f i t n e s s o f w i w i l 2 x i 2 y i 2 2 unlike the well placement problem the goal for this optimization problem is to find a solution that minimizes the objective function simply multiplying the fitness function by negative one converts the minimization problem into a maximization problem otherwise all other mechanisms of the algorithm remain the same with every iteration of eo wpp points that are farthest from the origin have the lowest fitness and so will be removed a removed point will be replaced by a point that is randomly placed near the point of highest fitness which is the point that is closest to the origin points are free to be placed anywhere within the bounds of the domain the location of these points are defined on a continuous 2d cartesian plane that extends from 100 to 100 in both the x and y axis the parameter i the number of points was set to three six and twelve points during testing to observe how eo wpp would respond with increasing numbers of points ten runs for each set of points were performed and the average performances with each set of runs were calculated and compared performance of the overall solution was measured by the average distance between the points and the origin to test for how the heuristic for placing a new well affects the performance of eo wpp algorithm a comparison of three different placement heuristics was performed with the simple geometric problem used as a benchmark the first heuristic randomly places the new well anywhere within the domain the second heuristic places the new well within a circle centered around the best well the radius of this circle the placement radius is set to the distance between two different and randomly chosen wells the third heuristic is similar to the second heuristic except that it sets the placement radius equal to the maximum distance between any two wells this is also the heuristic used by the proposed eo wpp algorithm for each heuristic 100 runs were performed with each run consisting of 300 iterations of the eo wpp algorithm each run was initialized with a random starting positions for the wells the number of wells was set to six for all tests the eo wpp algorithm was also compared against particle swarm optimization pso and the broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno bfgs algorithm pso was selected because it is a popular global search optimization algorithm likewise the bfgs was also selected because it was a common local search algorithm by comparing eo wpp to pso and bfgs eo wpp s performance can be compared to different modes of optimization for each method 100 runs were performed with the goal of optimally placing six wells the number of times for evaluating the simple geometric objective function was recorded to allow proper comparison among the three optimization methods 3 1 2 results fig 2 displays the results for running eo wpp on the point target problem with various numbers of points i the results show that the performance of the eo wpp algorithm is partially sensitive to the number of points to optimize for for all values of i the algorithm converged toward a solution that minimized the objective function on average eo wpp quickly generated a solution with the lowest objective function value when i 6 for values larger than i 6 the algorithm took longer to converge toward a solution because each iteration of eo wpp can only move one point with larger numbers of points more iterations are needed to adjust the entire set of points for values smaller than i 6 eo wpp initially outperformed the i 6 curve however around 10 iterations the i 3 curve changes into slower rate thereby losing to the i 6 curve by iteration 20 this change of eo wpps performance for small point numbers was from premature convergence fig 3 displays the results of the three different new well placement heuristics in the figure the mode total fitness value objective function value is plotted against the number of iterations of the eo wpp algorithm the results show that among the three heuristics the best heuristic is to set the placement radius equal to the maximum distance between any two wells within the well field this is the same heuristic used by the proposed eo wpp algorithm algorithm 1 for the heuristic of randomly placing the well within the domain the algorithm converges slower than the other two methods for the heuristic where the placement radius was set to the distant of two distinct and randomly chosen wells it initially converged the fastest but the algorithm plateaus and fails to converge any further after 25 evaluations fig 4 displays the results for comparing eo wpp to the pso and bfgs optimization algorithms the mode objective function value is plotted against the number of times the objective function was evaluated the results indicate that eo wpp performs better than both the pso and bfgs algorithms with eo wpp achieving near full convergence after just 60 evaluations of the objective function bfgs then follows up as the second best performer leaving pso as the slowest algorithm for this benchmark 3 2 case 2 synthetic groundwater model to test how the eo wpp algorithm would perform on optimization problems with a groundwater model a synthetic groundwater model was constructed the synthetic example was built and based on the benchmark example provided by ahlfeld et al 2005 in the paper that was used to verify the gwm optimization algorithm 3 2 1 set up of synthetic model the modeling domain was one layer discretized by 25 by 30 grid of cells all cells were squares and have a side length of 200 ft the model was bounded by constant heads that varied from 86 to 100 ft at the top and bottom of the model with no flow boundary conditions to the left and right in the middle of the model was a river composed of three stream segments with flow from left to right all stream segments were 20 ft wide and had a stream bed conductance of 20 000 ft2 day the main stream had a slope of 0 0025 whereas the tributary stream had a slope of 0 0010 fig 5 shows details for the modeling domain to test how eo wpp handles constraints four conditions for streamflow depletion were placed along the river the streamflow depletion constraints were defined as such ahlfeld et al 2005 17 q s d r q s f r 0 q s f r 18 q s d r q s d r u streamflow depletion qsdr is defined as the difference between the initial streamflow at stream location r at the end of the stress period qsfr 0 and the streamflow calculated at the location at the end of the stress period after implementation of the optimal pumping strategy qsfr the upper bound streamflow depletion constraint values q s d r u and the times when the constraints are enforced were different for each site this was done to test how eo wpp handles constraint complexity across different stress periods the transmissivity for the model was set to the synthetic heterogenous field shown on fig 6 for simplicity of analysis the transmissivity was set to either 50 or 500 ft2 day transmissivity was 500 ft2 day across most of the model except for three regions of low transmissivity the first region was at the top and bottom of the model where the constant head boundaries were located any optimization algorithm can cheat in maximizing the objective function by pumping near constant head boundaries where nearly infinite flow is possible with little or no change of hydraulic head to deter this behavior low transmissivity cells were placed near the boundaries to prevent eo wpp from taking advantage of this edge effect the second region of low transmissivity was in the left middle section of the model domain this was done to see how eo wpp would handle a situation in which a large region of the model would be a non ideal area to place wells the hope was that after placing a well in this region the algorithm would quickly learn to avoid the area the third low transmissivity region was in the lower right section of the model prior tests with this model have shown that the best place to put the wells was at the bottom right side of the model by placing a region of low transmissivity in the same area eo wpp was forced to find a well field solution that somehow navigated around this low transmissivity region the groundwater model simulated a three year period divided into 12 stress periods one stress period for each season the aquifer had a homogenous recharge at a rate of 0 005 ft day in the winter 0 002 ft day in the spring 0 ft day in the summer and 0 001 ft day in the fall the goal for eo wpp was to determine the best locations to place four wells the wells ran at a single pumping rate for the entire three year period the pumping rates for the wells could vary between zero and 50 000 ft3 day the drawdown limit for all wells was set to 10 ft the task of gwm was to determine the optimal rates that maximized the cumulative output of the field for a given well field configuration while respecting all constraints for the tests eo wpp was given 128 iterations to find an optimal solution the entire eo wpp process was restarted 128 times with a random initial well field solution each time this was done to determine eo wpps average performance the performance of the eo wpp algorithm was measured by using the cumulative output of the optimal field the unit and absolute value of the cumulative output was not important because these values were only compared to each other therefore the cumulative output could be treated as the total fitness of a solution 3 2 2 results a sample of a well field solution generated by eo wpp is shown on fig 7 the results of the test show that eo wpp can converge toward optimal well solutions on average the well field solutions involved wells that were placed close to the river fig 5 this is reasonable because of the high conductivity the river offered eo wpp often placed the wells on the bottom right side of the model domain and next to the southeastern stream because the water in the model was flowing into that region while converging eo wpp was able to generate well field solutions that avoided the low transmissivity regions this shows that relying on a global constant drawdown constraint works as a method for eo wpp to identify regions of low productivity many of the solutions also had wells that were placed far from streamflow constraint sites therefore the eo wpp algorithm generated well field solutions that took constraint sites into consideration for eo wpps overall performance fig 8 shows the statistics computed for all 128 runs case 2 results shows that the eo wpp functions and that it can statistically perform better than the best out of n algorithm in other words on average it is computationally more efficient to run the eo wpp algorithm n times than to randomly generate n well field solutions and report the best one for this groundwater model based on the 128 eo wpp runs fig 8 a randomly generated well field solution had a total fitness between 12 000 and 42 000 with a median of 30 000 with each iteration the entire distribution of the solution fitness improves by the 30th iteration the median solution fitness matched and exceeded the maximum fitness of the zeroth iteration of the solution that means for this groundwater model there is a 50 chance that running the eo wpp algorithm for 30 iterations will yield a well field solution that is better than what could be achieved by randomly placing wells in the model this method of comparing with the best out of n algorithm is a valid technique that has been performed by other groups such as feng et al 2012 with each eo wpp iteration the groundwater model was evaluated 15 times so after 30 iterations the model ran a total of 450 times note that the number of times for evaluating the groundwater model is dependent on the optimization function used by the fitness function 3 3 case 3 aberdeen groundwater model after developing and testing eo wpp with the synthetic example the eo wpp algorithm was applied to the aberdeen aquifer in south dakota for model details see valder et al 2018 3 3 1 set up of aberdeen model the city of aberdeen is in brown county in the northeastern part of south dakota the study area encompassed 490 mi 2 north of aberdeen in the james river lowland and lake dakota plain physiographic provinces fig 9 the study area included the glacial aquifer system north of aberdeen between foot creek and the james river because that area supports the citys current municipal well field currently most of the citys water is supplied from the elm river when the streamflow of the river becomes too low water is pumped from a well field seven miles north of aberdeen these wells were completed in the elm aquifer a shallow alluvial aquifer system in hydraulic connection with the elm river ideally the eo wpp algorithm paired with the aberdeen groundwater model can provide insight on where to place new wells to efficiently use the elm aquifer the aberdeen groundwater model was presented in valder et al 2018 the aberdeen model consisted of seven layers three layers were for the elm aquifer the middle james aquifer and the deep james aquifer and the remaining four layers were confining layers that bound the three aquifers the elm aquifer layer 2 from the top is of interest because it is the shallowest and most accessible aquifer the average thickness of the elm aquifer is 24 ft and the average depth to the aquifer is 30 ft the model was discretized into a finite difference grid consisting of 368 rows and 410 columns with a cell size of 200 by 200 ft the model was bounded by recharge river drainage and well boundary conditions the model contained 99 stress periods that simulates the years 1975 2015 the revised model used the usgs finite difference groundwater flow model modflow nwt to calculate all water budgets and flows additional details for the model are in the report by valder et al 2018 3 3 2 eo wpp for the aberdeen model the goal for eo wpp was to determine the best way to place six wells the number of wells used was inspired by the results of case 2 fig 8 in the model these wells ran at a constant pumping rate for one year october 1974 to october 1975 all pumping wells were installed in the elm aquifer layer 2 and all wells were subject to a drawdown constraint of 10 ft to prevent eo wpp from exploiting boundary conditions a distant constraint was defined such that all wells were at least 600 feet away from rivers boundaries and each other to deter cheating wells also were forced to be placed in a bounded region within the model domain for the first optimization run of eo wpp the well locations are bounded by 10 row 300 and 100 column 300 for the remaining runs the extent of the bounding region was reduced to 100 row 300 four runs of the eo wpp algorithm were performed each run involved initializing the solution with six randomly placed wells then iteratively improving the solution by applying eo wpp for 100 iterations each run took approximately two days to complete when performed on a single intel core i7 6600u cpu running at 2 8 ghz with each iteration the majority of the time was spent on calculating the fitness function the fitness function requires the optimal pumping rates for a given well field solution these pumping rates were determined with gwm which was set to solve for the optimal pumping rates using slp to reduce computation time the convergence criterion used by slp was adjusted such that the slp loop terminates early although this reduced the accuracy of the optimal values it does not significantly affect the performance of the fitness function the main purpose of the fitness function was to identify the well that will likely produce the least amount of water therefore an approximation of the optimal pumping rates is enough this method is similar to how τ eo operates introduced by boettcher and percus 1999 τ eo is a version of eo that randomly removes one of the low fitness components instead of strictly removing the component of lowest fitness this allows τ eo to behave like a global search algorithm and avoid local minimums by using approximately optimal pumping rates eo wpp exhibits the same behavior as τ eo 3 3 3 results of aberdeen model results of the four runs show that eo wpp was able to optimize the well field and converge toward a solution for all runs eo wpp was able to perform at least 90 of optimization progress within 50 iterations the remaining iterations were spent on refining the solution this agreed with results found with the synthetic examples in case 2 an example of eo wpp s optimization progress during a run is shown on fig 10 with each iteration the fitness of the best solution steadily increased yet the fitness of the current solution either increased or decreased with each iteration in fig 10 during iteration 40 60 the fitness of the current solution dropped significantly before later recovering this behavior was expected because removing the worst well and replacing it with a randomly placed new well did not guarantee an improvement of the total field output even without this guarantee the fitness of the current solution still generally increased with increasing number of iterations this indicates that the heuristic of strictly modifying the worst performing well allowed eo wpp to generate new well field solutions that were more likely to be better than previous solutions for all runs the eo wpp algorithm placed wells in locations that seemed to correlate with the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the layer the wells were pumping from layer 2 the well field solutions and the horizontal hydraulic conductivity are shown on fig 11 in the first run eo wpp placed some wells close to the top boundary fig 11 a to ensure that eo wpp was not taking advantage of boundary conditions the remaining runs had the bounding region adjusted so that wells were placed below row 100 the effects of adjusting the bounding region affected the total output of the well field before the adjustment the maximum well field output was 2 6 108 ft3 yr after the adjustment the well field output was reduced to a maximum of 1 3 108 ft3 yr regardless of the bounding region eo wpp consistently placed a majority of the wells near or upon sites with high horizontal hydraulic conductivity recall that eo wpp only uses pumping rates and drawdown at the wells the algorithm does not use explicit knowledge of hydraulic conductivity yet for the aberdeen groundwater model the well field solutions appear to correlate best with the horizontal hydraulic conductivity this indicates that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity plays a crucial role when determining optimal well field configurations well locations that deviate from peak horizontal hydraulic conductivity were caused by eo wpp s consideration of other factors such as recharge aquifer thickness or vertical hydraulic conductivity 4 discussion within the eo wpp algorithm the placement of the new well is dependent on the location of the best well this was done to introduce a clustering behavior into the eo wpp algorithm though it seems like this placement heuristic may cause the eo wpp algorithm to get stuck at local minimums our results show that by abiding to certain guidelines this can be avoided for example fig 2 shows that with a low number of points eo wpp is more likely to display behavior that causes stagnation at local minimums in fig 2 this premature convergence behavior can be seen in the curve for i 3 note that by 10 iterations the slope of the curve changes significantly yet for the other two curves this change of slope does not exist this is because with a low number of points it becomes more likely for the points to become too close to each other and cause premature convergence for a sufficiently large number of points this behavior disappears based on these results there must be at least six points to ensure eo wpp does not exhibit this behavior the eo wpp algorithm places the new well within a certain distance from the best well this distance called the placement radius is set to be the maximum distance between any two wells within the well field the results on fig 3 show that this placement heuristic is ideal for the eo wpp algorithm if the placement radius was set too small such as the distance between two random and distinct wells then the clustering behavior becomes too strong and causes eo wpp to converge prematurely in fig 3 this shows as an early plateau in the performance curve if the placement radius was set too large such as randomly placing the new well anywhere in the model domain then eo wpp converges too slowly towards the solution eo wpp s placement heuristic introduces a clustering behavior that can be sensitive to the configuration of the initial solution to ensure the initial solution does not have an influence in the shape of the final solution eo wpp must iterate a larger number of times with a large number of iterations eo wpp s stochastic mechanisms allow the algorithm to properly explore the search space before converging towards a set of solutions this was shown to be true in the results for the synthetic model fig 7 and the aberdeen model fig 11 for both cases the eo wpp algorithm generated very similar solutions even when going through the eo wpp algorithm with 100 different randomly generated initial solutions tests show that as eo wpp s performance reaches its stall limit the solutions begin to look similar to each other this makes sense since the number of possible well field configurations decreases as the performance of these solutions approach the global optimum value to gain greater confidence in the stability of the solutions multiple instances of eo wpp can be ran with the iteration process terminated once all instances generate the same solution eo wpp is essentially a combination of mechanisms from both global and local search algorithms eo wpp relies on a population of wells a technique similar to the population mechanisms used by global search algorithms eo wpp also operates on a single well field solution and modifies the solution based on the information gained by the solution s components this mechanism is similar to how local search algorithms operates eo wpp combines these techniques in a way that allows it to avoid local minimums and quickly converge towards a solution fig 4 shows that at least for the simple geometric case eo wpp converges faster than the pso global search algorithm and the bfgs local search algorithm another advantage eo wpp provides is its ability to find well field solutions with the wells close to each other fig 11 shows eo wpp s clustering behavior found solutions where some wells are nearby each other e g run 2 and run 3 this behavior is desirable for well field design since reducing distances between wells can reduce the amount of infrastructure needed to connect the wells together what is interesting about this behavior is that it is not explicitly defined in the objective function or in the constraints instead this spatial behavior emerges from the definition of the placement heuristic 5 conclusions this paper introduced a novel well placement optimization algorithm eo wpp which was inspired by the optimization algorithm called extremal optimization eo wpp works by removing the least productive wells and replacing them with new wells placed randomly near the most productive wells by following this heuristic eo wpp can quickly generate well fields optimized for cumulative well field output a simple geometric benchmark shows that eo wpp was able to perform faster than common global search and local search methods a synthetic groundwater model shows that with a large enough well count and number of iterations eo wpp was able to avoid local minimums and yield consistent well field solutions results also verify that eo wpp exhibits an emergent spatial behavior of clustering a behavior that is useful during the design of optimal well fields eo wpp then was applied to the aberdeen groundwater model eo wpp was able to generate multiple potential well field solutions that maximized total water discharge from the elm aquifer while respecting drawdown and spatial constraints the locations of the wells indicated that the horizontal hydraulic conductivity was an important factor when designing a well field for the region north of aberdeen although eo wpp was applied only to a model built to help the city of aberdeen the methods introduced in this paper are applicable to groundwater management in general eo wpp can be used for designing well fields to use groundwater resources efficiently placement optimization problems extend beyond groundwater management and the methods introduced by eo wpp can be applied to other fields such as mining operations petroleum production groundwater monitoring and more

582,crab burrows can act as preferential flow conduits for pore water surface water interactions in salt marshes but the effect of preferential flow on subsurface transport in these tidally influenced systems is not fully understood we used numerical models based on salt marshes of north inlet south carolina to investigate the impacts of crab burrows on porewater salinity this modeling effort was inspired by field results from north inlet where prior field studies that used a combination of tension samplers and passive diffusion samplers measure salinity in crab burrows and in the adjacent sediment matrix found that the minimum salinity 28 psu reported by the tension samplers was larger than the maximum salinity 26 psu reported by passive diffusion samplers two kinds of numerical models were developed to investigate the effect of crab burrows on tidally driven groundwater flow and salt transport in the equivalent continuum model ecm crab burrows were included via a shallow surface layer with hydraulic properties representing a bulk average of sediment matrix and crab burrow properties in the preferential flow model pfm an independent high permeability material was embedded in the surface muddy layer to explicitly simulate preferential flow conduits the simulated results showed that both models can depict the effect of crab burrow on soil saturation and salt transport in salt marshes the presence of crab burrows can greatly increase tidally driven water exchange improve the intensity and duration of soil aeration and enhance salt transport in salt marshes the effect of crab burrows on groundwater flow and salt transport varied spatially from the creek bank to marsh interior pfm models demonstrated that salinity is likely to differ between crab burrows and the sediment matrix which supports observed differences in results between tension samplers and passive diffusion samplers these findings may have important implications for practical pore water sampling and hydrochemical investigation in coastal wetlands keywords coastal wetland macro pore bioturbation salt transport numerical simulation soil aeration 1 introduction salt marshes are characterized by high productivity and a variety of economic and ecological functions including storm buffering habitat provision nutrient cycling and blue carbon sequestration weigert and freeman 1990 costanza et al 1997 wieski et al 2010 salt marshes are strongly influenced by groundwater flow and transport moffett et al 2012 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2010 groundwater salinity in particular is an important direct control on plant zonation and productivity in salt marshes howes et al 1986 wilson et al 2015 but it is also a good tracer for other solute transport processes including nutrient and carbon transport groundwater flow and transport processes in salt marshes are very complex and affected by multiple physicochemical processes such as tidal fluctuations groundwater flow and evaporation li et al 2005 wilson and morris 2012 wilson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 an important challenge in salt marshes is to understand the salt balance in the root zone where the influence of groundwater on salt marsh macrophytes is the strongest saline water infiltrates into the marsh surface during inundation and this saline water can be diluted through infiltration of rainwater or through mixing with fresh groundwater discharging from adjacent uplands thibodeau et al 1998 carter et al 2008 wilson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 salt can also be concentrated in shallow sediments through direct evaporation and through exclusion by plant roots bradley and morris 1991 passioura et al 1992 which can lead to the formation of barren hypersaline zones salt removal mechanisms often appear to be extremely limited in low permeability marsh mud however macropores such as common crab burrows can not only improve the soil aeration harvey and nuttle 1995 hughes et al 1998 xin et al 2009 but also provide an efficient mechanism for removal of excess salt in the root zone by advection and diffusion stieglitz et al 2000 hollins 2001 2013 pestana et al 2017 field studies reveal complicated relationships between field conditions e g precipitation evaporation and surface water salinity and porewater salinity morris 1995 carter et al 2008 hughes et al 2012 ryan 2017 morris 1995 developed a salt mass balance model to simulate porewater salinity in the top 30 cm of sediments the simulations indicated that sediment physical properties evapotranspiration and elevation are important determinants of seasonal salinity extremes miklesh and meile 2018 applied similar methods in the top 10 cm of the sediments and found that the surface water salinity was an important control on the porewater salinity hughes et al 2012 used statistical models to investigate salinity as a function of depth upper 1 m in a salt marsh island they confirmed that porewater salinity was controlled by interactions among surface water salinity precipitation and evaporation and they noted that these interactions can be enhanced or moderated by the inundation frequency of the marsh surface these previous studies reached similar general conclusions about controls on porewater salinity in salt marshes but used different methods to obtain porewater samples tension samplers morris 1995 miklesh and meile 2018 and diffusion samplers hughes et al 2012 this is significant because tension samplers such as the rhizon sampler and pushpoint sampler depend on suction pressure which disrupts the porewater equilibrium and draws porewater preferentially from macropores harvey 1993 in contrast the passive diffusion sampler provides a time weighted average chemical composition of porewater from the sediment matrix as well as from macropores roll and halden 2016 recently ryan 2017 investigated the pore water salinity using tension samplers and diffusion samplers in the upper 1 0 m of sediment in a north inlet south carolina salt marsh field results showed no correlation between the porewater salinity and the surface water salinity moreover the salinities obtained from the tension samplers were significantly larger than those from the passive diffusion samplers supporting information figures s1 and s2 the two types of samplers were placed as close to each other as possible while avoiding mutual interference so that the vegetation density vegetation type elevation and hydroperiod were essentially the same thus the salinities observed at all three comparison sites were expected to be very similar ryan 2017 speculated that this disagreement reflected differences in salinity between the macropores and the sediment matrix which were caused by preferential flow associated with macropores previous studies have described the differences in salinity between macropores and the sediment matrix in virginia salt marshes but the matrix was found to be more saline than the macropores harvey and nuttle 1995 in explaining their results harvey and nuttle 1995 suggested that surface water can infiltrate much faster through crab burrows than through the sediment matrix when the marsh surface is flooded when the marsh surface is exposed the water in a crab burrow can act as a reservoir to resupply water lost through evaporation from the matrix resulting in salt enrichment and higher salinity in the matrix fig 1 this conceptual model however is not consistent with the observations of ryan 2017 rather than speculate about the cause of the differences in these two cases we propose to address the underlying problem which is that the influence of crab burrows on groundwater flow and transport is currently poorly understood thus the goal of this work is to develop contrasting numerical models of an idealized salt marsh to gain a mechanistic understanding of how crab burrows influence groundwater flow and salinity in salt marshes we also address the impact of crab burrows on soil aeration because it is clear that soil aeration salinity and crab burrows are closely linked and because soil aeration and salinity together place strong controls on salt marsh plant productivity as will be shown the results provide insight into the field observations of ryan 2017 and confirm that crab burrows can serve as preferential flow conduits that influence the salt balance in salt marshes 2 methods 2 1 conceptual crab burrow models we based our conceptual models on salt marshes at north inlet south carolina typical of marshes in the region salt marsh sediments at north inlet are composed of an organic rich mud layer with crab burrows overlying a fine grained well sorted sand layer weigert and freeman 1990 gardner and porter 2001 gardner 2007 wilson and morris 2012 given this type of stratigraphy groundwater flow is focused in the sand layer exchange with the creek may be focused through the creek bottom gardner 2007 wilson et al 2011 2015 there are several crab species in north inlet salt marshes in the higher marsh middle of the spartina alterniflora zone to the forest edge the burrows are predominantly due to the three species of fiddler crab uca pugnax mud fiddler uca pugilator sand fiddler and uca minax red jointed fiddler in the lower marsh the burrows are predominantly from eurytium limnosum broadback mud crab two common models have been widely used to depict the effect of macropores on groundwater flow the equivalent continuum model ecm in which a composite layer includes the bulk properties of the combined macropores and matrix bear et al 1993 hughes et al 1998 and the preferential flow model pfm which includes variations of the dual domain approach e g dual porosity and dual permeability aller 1980 bear et al 1993 finsterle et al 2002 zinn et al 2004 samardzioska and popov 2005 shull et al 2009 xin et al 2009 2016 preferential flow through permeable macropores results in faster processes of wetting and or drying bear et al 1993 hendrickx and flury 2001 cushman and tartakovsky 2017 moreover water and solutes can move much faster and to far greater depths than those predicted by the richards equation in pfms beven 1991 the pfm can provide insights into realistic processes of groundwater flow and solute transport in two different media but this kind of model typically requires very fine model resolution to resolve flow in macropores in contrast the ecm is much simpler involving only the consideration of sediment stratification but ecm models do not handle solute transport effectively where preferential flow pathways exist smith and schwartz 1993 given these trade offs we designed comparative models to 1 assess the utility of the ecm model in salt marshes and 2 investigate the small scale effects of macropores on salinity in salt marshes via the pfm to better compare water samples obtained by tension samplers and diffusion samplers for the convenience of comparison all models described here have the same domain size 35 m length fig 2 the marsh domains include a levee at the edge of the marsh platform where the local elevation was set to be 0 1 m higher than that of the interior marsh platform this is typical of creek structures in salt marshes along the southeast atlantic coast wiegert and freeman 1990 levees are cut by small creeks fig 2 which allows the rising tide to flood the main marsh platform before the levees are overtopped the abundance of crab burrows as well as the burrow geometry are key factors affecting the preferential flow process however crab burrows are irregularly distributed and irregularly shaped in coastal wetlands supporting information figure s3 so it is impractical to exactly replicate the geometry of any given burrow aller 1980 heron and ridd 2008 shull et al 2009 xin et al 2009 tait et al 2016 2016 thus for the simplification and feasibility of the numerical simulations we simulated idealized burrows with constant depth aperture and density based on general characteristics of mud fiddler crab uca pugnax burrows for the ecm the upper 20 cm of the marsh surface became a homogeneous crab burrow layer with a higher porosity and permeability than the underlying bulk mud fig 2a in the pfm three zones of crab burrows were set in the creek bank zone a on the levee at the edge of the marsh platform zone b and in the marsh interior zone c respectively fig 2b each zone has four crab burrows set 19 8 cm apart i e crab burrow density 25 m 2 this distance is roughly twice the 12 2 cm reported by mccraith et al 2003 but is sufficient to observe the impact of crab burrows on solute transport as shown in fig 3 mccraith et al 2003 investigated the spatial distributions of the characteristics of crab burrows along an intertidal transect perpendicular to the bly creek in order to investigate the greatest impact of small scale crab burrow on salt transport we used the maximum depth 20 cm and aperture 2 cm of crab burrows in the pfm for purposes of comparison a set of numerical models without crab burrows were also constructed hereafter referred to as the no crab burrow model ncbm 2 2 governing equation and flux calculation simulations were conducted using the finite element computer program sutra which can simulate saturated unsaturated variable density fluid flow and transport of either dissolved substances or energy

the total amount of water flux that pass through the marsh surface including the crab burrows and the sediment matrix over a complete tidal cycle 2 3 boundary and initial conditions our simulation domain was conceptualized as reaching from the forest marsh boundary to the creek boundary conditions for the model domains consisted of a no flow boundary on the assumed low permeability bottom specified head on the landward vertical boundary and a time variable combined specified pressure and flux surface boundary fig 2c any surface node that was below the level of the tide was set to a specified pressure boundary condition where the pressure reflected the depth of the tide evapotranspiration and rainfall were implemented in the model as a specified flux at the surface cell when the elevation of the surface cell was higher than the tide level evapotranspiration and rainfall were allowed to occur if the sediment remained fully saturated at that node during tide retrieval a seepage face formed wilson and gardner 2006 it was assumed that the landward end of the creek normal transect reached the forest marsh boundary in this situation fresh groundwater can enter the marsh from the adjacent upland thibodeau et al 1998 carter et al 2008 wilson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 therefore a specified head boundary condition was imposed on this boundary to allow continuous input of fresh groundwater this arrangement allowed salinity gradients to develop between the saline creek water infiltrating into the marsh during high tide and fresh groundwater entering on the other side of the domain note that the models in this paper are theoretical so the volume of fresh groundwater entering the model was chosen to support useful salinity variations within the model domain rather than to replicate flow at a specific site tidal variations were simulated using a sinusoidal tidal function with known amplitudes 1 5 m on average noaa tide gage 8662299 and tidal cycle 12 h based on north inlet study area gardner and porter 2001 i e 8 h t h m e a n a c o s ω t where h t is the water level in the creek l t is the time t hmean is the mean water level in the creek l a is the tidal range l and ω is the tidal angular frequency t 1 the mean creek water level was set to 3 25 m for simplicity the tidal boundary only includes spring tidal variations no neap tides included using these parameters the whole platform of the salt marsh was inundated to a depth of 0 2 m at high tides representative of common field conditions in north inlet salt marshes initial conditions were generated in two steps first the groundwater flow model using a simple sinusoidal tide was allowed to run until hydraulic heads reached a repeatable tidal cycle then salt transport was added to the tidal flow models and run for a relatively long period 1 year with the time step of 180 s to ensure that the numerical solutions reached a quasi steady state i e periodic solutions were unaffected by the initial condition 2 4 parameter values used in the simulations the parameter values used in the base simulation were set to reflect the soil porosities based on north inlet table 1 crab burrows were set as a high permeability tube with saturated permeability ks 10 6 m2 and porosity 1 0 grisak and pickens 1980 xin et al 2009 2016 the mud layer was given a low permeability ks 4 0 10 13 m2 and a high porosity 0 65 wilson and morris 2012 the bottom sand layer was set as a high permeability layer with ks 1 0 10 11 m2 xin et al 2009 wilson and morris 2012 and porosity 0 36 wilson and morris 2012 the compressibilities of the sand and mud in salt marsh were 10 7 and 10 6 pa 1 respectively wilson and morris 2012 the crab burrow layer covered the upper 20 cm of the marsh platform and creek bank this layer was given a relatively high porosity 0 85 aller 1984 we considered two methods for calculating the equivalent permeability of the crab layer kecm the volumetric weighted equivalent method gerke and van genuchten 1993 and length weighted equivalent method supporting information figure s4 both methods incorporated the spacing between crab burrows i e the density with a positive correlation between the density and kecm this analysis also showed that small burrows can greatly influence the equivalent permeability easily creating very high kecm for example if the permeability of the crab burrow was assumed to be 1 0 10 7 m2 the kecm was larger than 1 0 10 10 m2 supporting information figure s5 more than three orders of magnitude higher than the permeability of the mud laboratory tests comparing field samples with and without crab burrows suggest that crab burrows can increase the average hydraulic conductivity by only 1 2 orders of magnitude hughes et al 1998 we found that numerical models with kecm one order of magnitude larger than the matrix permeability allowed far more salt transport than we observed in the pfm such high values not only created large contrasts in permeability in the models which is known to cause errors in numerical simulations but also allowed far more salt transport than we observed in the pfm given these mismatches in this paper we show results for models in which the equivalent permeability of the crab layer was 1 5 times larger than that of the mud layer 6 0 10 13 m2 this value produces results that are intermediate between the ncbm and the pfm soil water retention curves for different sediment media are presented in supporting information figure s6 for the pfm we considered individual crab burrows as high permeability coarse sand material with the following van genuchten parameter values α 0 18 cm 1 n 2 9 sr 0 01 boufadel 2000 for the ecm the crab burrow layer was parameterized as a fine sand layer the van genuchten parameter values were obtained by the volumetric weighted equivalent method α 0 03 cm 1 n 2 115 sr 0 6 all simulations used the same numerical mesh which had 10 513 nodes and 10 216 elements the mesh density increased in burrow zones and at the interface between the mud layer and the sand layer with a minimum δx of 7 mm the values for the courant number and numerical peclet number did not exceed 1 and 2 respectively in our simulations the temperature was kept constant resulting in constant dynamic viscosity 2 5 seepage face parameter the development of seepage faces may influence plant zonation xiao et al 2017 therefore the likely impact of crab burrows on seepage faces was examined via the analytical seepage face parameter σ turner 1995 ma et al 2014 that was originally developed for beaches 9 π r t n k sin 2 β where r is the tidal range l t is the tidal period t n is the effective porosity of sediment k is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity lt 1 β is the beach slope for the mud crab burrow equivalent matrix the effective porosity n and the hydraulic conductivity k were linearly weighted based on area as measured in the horizontal plane if the slope is assumed to be uniform then for σ 1 a seepage face develops 2 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of changes in et rainfall tidal range permeability compressibility and dispersivity on sediment saturation and porewater salinity nearly 20 different cases were tested table 2 for example we tested different meteorological conditions ranging from et of 8 mm d to rainfall of 8 mm d tidal range can influence the sediment hydroperiod the average tidal range in north inlet salt marshes is 1 5 m but can be up to 1 8 m or more spring tide in 3 12 2017 noaa tide gage 8662299 longitudinal dispersivities ranging from 0 5 to 2 m were tested with the constant ratio of α l α t at a value of 10 gelhar et al 1992 smith 2004 evans and wilson 2017 six observation points were set in the three crab burrow zones in order to monitor or compare the variations of soil saturation and porewater salinity between crab burrows and surrounding sediment matrix fig 2b 3 results 3 1 groundwater flow patterns and fluxes in all of our models the net movement of groundwater was vertically downward in the marsh interior and groundwater velocities were greatest at the intersection of the creek bank and creek bottom the tidally averaged groundwater flow patterns of different models fig 4 a b and c are similar to the corresponding patterns of groundwater flow at low tides supporting information figure s7 flow patterns in the ncbm simulations fig 4a were generally similar to the other two models but flow rates in the shallow layer were predictably lower than those in the ecm and pfm models fig 4b and c the tidally averaged exchange rate between the surface water and groundwater was strongly influenced by the presence of crab burrows for the ncbm groundwater discharge occurred only on the creek bank and creek bottom fig 4d infiltration of the surface water into the sediment occurred across the entire upper boundary reaching a peak at the intersection point between the creek bottom and the creek bank x 2 m in fig 4d note that the slight stair step increases in surface water infiltration rate from the marsh interior to the creek bank in the ecm are likely a numerical artifact due to the non regular size of mesh although the overall increase reflects a real increase in the hydraulic gradient from the marsh interior to the levee zone b in fig 4e the pfm also had similar steps fig 4f but they are not as prominent as in the ecm where the average infiltration rate through the high permeability crab burrow layer in the ecm was nearly 2 0 times larger than in pfm fig 4e and f the distribution of porewater exchange in the pfm was similar to that of the ncbm in zones lacking crab burrows in the three crab burrow zones zones a b and c exchange rates were much higher for example the average porewater velocity through crab burrows in zone a was as much as 9 3 m d which is nearly 2 0 104 times as high as that of the adjacent sediment matrix interestingly groundwater was found to discharge through the crab burrows in zone b fig 4f this discharge occurred during falling tides supporting information figure s7 when groundwater flowed toward to the creek bank although there is net downward flow in the region of the crab burrows during falling tides some water travels out of the sediment matrix into the crab burrows before re entering the sediments along the head gradient towards the creek these results may potentially affect plant zonation and or contribute to the plants growth by affecting aeration and nutrient transport the simulated fluxes showed that crab burrows can enhance groundwater discharge by factors of 6 47 and 46 in zones a and b respectively fig 5 crab burrows also enhanced the infiltration of surface water by a factor of 8 37 in zone a the ecm showed a slight increase of groundwater discharge by a factor of 1 8 but only at zone a however surface water infiltration was enhanced in all the crab burrow zones by an average factor of 1 18 these results demonstrate that crab burrows can significantly change groundwater exchange with the largest impacts near the creek bank 3 2 effects of crab burrows on soil aeration saturation is the fraction of the pore space in the sediment that is occupied by water the tidally averaged saturation in the ecm was lower than in the ncbm and pfm over a single tidal cycle indicating greater soil aeration and drainage fig 6 in contrast the pfm and ncbm have similar saturation patterns except in the crab burrow zones for example a small mound of higher saturation appears at the bottom of the crab burrows in the pfm but does not appear in the corresponding location in the ncbm these results suggest that crab burrows allow greater aeration in the root zone by redistributing water more quickly to the sediments below the influence of the crab burrows depended on the tidal stage at low tides crab burrows decreased the local soil saturation in the three crab burrow zones fig 7 a the saturation in zone b was the lowest among the three crab burrow zones a seepage face also appeared from the low tide line to the first crab burrow but its upper extent was limited by the existence of crab burrow at rising mid tides the saturation became larger in zone a but lower in zones b and c fig 7b this difference was caused by the time delay of water propagation from the creek bank to the marsh platform at high tide the whole marsh was fully saturated results not shown when the tide receded the marsh soil became unsaturated again until the next low tide in general the soil saturation in the marsh surface in ecm was significantly lower than in pfm fig 7c and d reflecting the fact that the pfm only had crab burrows in very limited locations the timing and duration of unsaturated conditions at six observation points in the three crab burrow zones showed that the saturation in the sediment matrix in the pfm was nearly the same as the ncbm fig 8 however the saturations in crab burrows tended to zero at low tides in zone b and unsaturated conditions persisted 1 2 h longer in the crab burrows than in the sediment matrix the unsaturated period in zone a was the shortest only 1 3 of the total tidal period in contrast the unsaturated periods in zone b and zone c were nearly 2 3 and 1 2 of total tidal periods respectively the patterns from the pfm different periods of unsaturated conditions in zones a b and c also developed in the ecm fig 8 sensitivity studies confirmed that the permeability of the mud layer can significantly affect the soil saturation in the pfm supporting information figure s8 for example an increase of an order of magnitude in the permeability of the mud layer from 4 10 13 m2 to 4 10 12 m2 greatly decreased the soil saturation and increased the unsaturated period in the soil matrix however variations of an order of magnitude in the permeability of the crab burrows had very little effect on soil saturation as is common in situations with large contrasts in permeability once a certain threshold has been reached further increasing the contrast in permeability has very little impact on the flow system in the ecm increases in the permeabilities of the mud layer and crab burrow layer predictably increased the soil aeration supporting information figure s9 variations in sediment compressibility also had a large impact on soil saturation in the ecm the larger the sediment compressibility the higher the soil aeration as the tidal range in the base case was set to inundate the whole marsh platform increasing the tidal range caused very little change in the soil saturation but decreasing the tidal range from 1 5 m to 1 2 m the marsh surface not inundated decreased the hydroperiod and hence decreased the soil saturation supporting information figure s10 changes in et and rainfall had very little effect on soil saturation figure s10 sensitivity studies showed that crab burrows can significantly affect the development of seepage faces along the creek bank fig 9 for the mud layer in the creek bank of the ncbm the seepage parameter is 635 93 indicating the development of seepage face in contrast for crab burrows in the pfm and the equivalent crab burrow layer in the ecm the seepage parameters were far less than 1 0 indicating no seepage face development we also tested other conditions with different tidal ranges and slopes the results showed that the smaller the slope and or the larger the tidal range the larger the seepage face parameter increasing the density of crab burrows by decreasing the neighbor distance of crab burrows from 19 8 cm to 12 2 cm also decreased the possibility of the development of seepage face fig 9 3 3 effects of crab burrows on porewater salinity all simulations were run until salinity reached a periodic quasi steady state supporting information figure s11 the distribution of salinity in all simulations reflects a balance between tidally driven infiltration of saline creek water and the influx of fresh groundwater from the upland fig 10 and in this scenario simulations or zones that allowed greater influx of saline water are clearly visible the simulated results showed that the ecm allowed significantly more salt to infiltrate through the marsh platform than the ncbm moreover the high salinity plume reached deeper in the middle zone of marsh platform in the ecm indicating a higher infiltration rate of surface water figs 4 and 5 comparison of the pfm and ncbm confirms that the crab burrows locally enhanced salt infiltration in the crab burrow zones fig 10 the distribution of salinity in the crab burrow zones in the pfm confirms that salinity gradients can develop between macropores and the sediment matrix fig 11 although the simulated variations 2 psu in salinity are not as large as those 5 10 psu observed by ryan 2017 overall we found that the salinity fluctuated within and or adjacent to the crab burrows and was nearly stable below the upper crab burrow layer at low tide fig 11a the pore water drained continuously with the greatest drainage rate in the crab burrows and the salinity gradually decreased downward in zone a groundwater flowed towards the low tide line in zones b and c groundwater flowed downward and the salinity gradually decreased with distance from the creek bank interestingly in zone c salinity in the sediment matrix was higher than in the crab burrows this was consistent with the conceptual model of harvey and nuttle 1995 fig 1 but not consistent with field observations of ryan 2017 specifically the salinity differences between the crab burrows and surrounding sediment matrix were limited to the upper 10 cm fig 11a whereas field observed differences i e the differences between the tension and diffusion samplers go down to 50 cm and beyond ryan 2017 visually the salinity distribution formed the shape of inverse funnel shaped contours especially at zone c fig 11a at high tide surface water inundated the whole salt marsh and simulated groundwater flow nearly halted except in the crab burrows fig 11b in zone a the infiltration of creek water into the sediment occurred largely through the crab burrows in zone b funnel shaped contours appeared and became more noticeable in zone c similar to fig 1c in short the crab burrows served as preferential conduits allowing salt to be transported to the bottom of the crab burrows much more quickly than in the surrounding sediment matrix this continuous infiltration led to a net increase in salinity around the crab burrow zones fig 10 sensitivity studies in which dispersivity was varied by a factor of 2 showed that increasing the dispersion decreased variations in salinity over a tidal cycle supporting information figure s11 decreased dispersion reduced mixing with the fresher porewaters which supported higher pore water salinity in the root zone than simulations with larger dispersivity supporting information figure s11 further sensitivity studies showed that the salinity distribution was very sensitive to the permeability of the crab burrow layer in the ecm larger equivalent permeabilities allowed the high salinity plume to reach deeper especially near the creek bank supporting information figure s12 4 discussion 4 1 salt transport and removal the effect of crab burrows on salt transport may be influenced by the residence time of water in crab burrows ridd 1996 and stieglitz et al 2000 found that a single tidal flush was sufficient for the complete renewal of the burrow water however hollins 2001 concluded that only one third of the burrow water was flushed in our simulations the salinity in the crab burrows in the creek bank was completely flushed during a tidal cycle indicating a short water residence time for example high salinities visible in the crab burrows at high tide vanished at low tide fig 11 however the simulated salinities show only partial flushing in the marsh interiors therefore whether complete tidal flushing occurs likely depends on the specific locations of the crab burrows in the intertidal zone an important goal of our work was to understand how crab burrows could support differences in salinity between macropores and the sediment matrix as identified by ryan 2017 and harvey and nuttle 1995 the field sampling sites of both studies were located in the interior of the salt marsh so we focused on zone c of our models the simulated salinity in the sediment matrix was higher than that in the crab burrows at low tides fig 11 which is consistent with the conceptual model of harvey and nuttle 1995 but inconsistent with ryan 2017 supporting information figure s2 given our new process based understanding of transport through crab burrows we re examined the conditions surrounding ryan s field sampling first we found that all of ryan s field samples were collected after a large rainfall resulting in surface water that was fresher at the beginning of the record supporting information figure s2 our simulations indicate that the residence time of rainwater in the crab burrows is shorter than the residence time of porewater in the matrix due to the large differences of water flow velocity fig 11 thus once precipitation and low salinity creek water enter the system following a large rain event the sediment matrix will remain fresh longer than the crab burrows second ryan s observations were collected during the winter when evapotranspiration is greatly reduced and the conceptual model of harvey and nuttle 1995 is least likely to apply finally all of ryan s samples were collected in the first 3 5 h after the sampling sites were exposed during falling tide ryan 2017 this is immediately after the infiltration of saline surface water during high tide and presumably when differences in salinity between the macropores and sediment matrix would be the largest in short the sampling work depends on temporal variability such as tidal cycles and seasonality the large salinity difference between the tension samplers and diffusion samplers also suggests that continuous sampling may be necessary in salt marshes 4 2 research limitations and prospects the aim of this paper was to find out whether salinity differs between the macropores and the sediment matrix providing some important insights into the physical processes of water and salt exchange however the models were theoretical based on an intertidal transect in a north inlet salt marsh with a layer of mud 1 m thick overlying fine sand where groundwater flow is apparent in the subsurface more complex field conditions such as different thicknesses or lack of mud and variations in burrow morphology were not considered for example the mud layer in many of salt marshes along the atlantic may be much thicker than 1 0 m wilson et al 2011 2015 where the mud layer is thicker it is likely that less fresh groundwater would come near the surface in this situation precipitation and et might be much more important controls than crab bioturbation in that case and pore water salinity could be diluted by the recharge of rainwater in addition the differences between our ideal burrows and real burrows may also greatly impact the simulated results crab burrows may be more complex in muddier sediments due to the more cohesive nature of the sediments katrak et al 2008 different crab species also create burrows that differ in morphology connectivity and depth in salt marshes worldwide allen and curran 1974 katrak et al 2008 sharma et al 1987 escapa et al 2008 wang et al 2010 wilson et al 2012 for example more than one opening may exist in burrows and pressure gradients between different openings may lead to enhanced water flow heron and ridd 2008 ridd 1996 susilo and ridd 2005 stieglitz et al 2000 therefore future investigations of how burrows with different depths and connectivity impact water and salt transport in actual field sites are warranted the sensitivity analysis of the ecm and pfm showed that substantially different results can be obtained depending on the chosen parameters particularly the sediment permeability strongly influences the porewater salinity consistent with other recent results miklesh and meile 2018 this means that determining the bulk permeability used in the ecm is particularly important but our results suggest full dual permeability or dual porosity models will be required for systems in which solute transport is important in this paper we calculated the equivalent permeability using two analytical methods supporting information figures s4 and s5 but both methods showed that the equivalent permeability was easily 1 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the mud layer as previously indicated tests of field samples also suggest an increase of 1 2 orders of magnitude when crab burrows are present hughes et al 1998 in our numerical models increasing the equivalent permeability of the upper 20 cm of sediments by an order of magnitude allowed far more salt to enter the subsurface than in the crab burrow zones of the pfm it is not unexpected for models that correctly approximate bulk flow properties to fail to approximate solute transport properly but normally the problem is that preferential flow paths allow more transport than is predicted by models that use bulk averages one reason that the pfm may have shown less salt in the subsurface is that the pfm had crab burrows in only a few locations dispersive loss of salt surrounding the crab burrow zones in the pfm likely reduced the salinity somewhat compared to what it would have been if there had been crab burrows throughout the marsh surface the other reason that the salinity increased more in the ecm than the pfm is that adding the crab burrow layer shifted the interface between fresh and saline water downward that is the differences between the ecm and the pfm are caused not by differences in transport associated with preferential flow paths but by systematic changes in the groundwater flow field this question clearly warrants further investigation but that investigation will have to include observations from field sites rather than purely theoretical models in view of our two different approaches to simulating the effects of crab burrows we conclude that each approach has its advantages for specific research purposes the pfm can be used to quantify small scale groundwater flow and salt transport processes but it requires high computational effort in contrast the ecm cannot provide insights into the local processes of flow and solute transport in the two different media but it is much easier to implement field measurement of the permeability of sediments with and without crab burrows will likely be required to estimate the bulk equivalent characteristics of the crab burrow layer overall the pfm will be the preferential option if cm scale salinity variations are of interest the ecm has the potential to very useful for larger scale models finally our results suggest that salinity gradients can develop between crab burrows and the sediment matrix and it is logical to assume that concentrations of other solutes such as carbon and nitrogen in the crab burrow would also differ from the sediment matrix wang et al 2010 further the concentrations of other solutes in and around crab burrows are also worth monitoring over longer periods including seasons to capture variations associated with changing precipitation patterns and variations in mean water level this will be a challenge but such effort will be necessary to revise the estimation of material exchange across the sediment interface in salt marshes our results also suggest that the choice of porewater sampler is highly dependent on the specific problem being studied as the chemical composition of porewater is not homogeneous between macropores and soil matrix litaor 1988 therefore use of a combination of tension and passive sampling devices simultaneously in salt marshes may potentially enhance the overall information garnered in a sampling campaign the selection of sampler s for monitoring porewater in salt marshes may also be guided by research objectives if the research intends to collect useful information on physicochemical processes such as sorption processes in preferential flow paths peranginangin et al 2009 field sampling work should be conducted through use of tension samplers as it can draw porewater preferentially from macropores harvey 1993 otherwise the use of passive samplers is a good choice because it is easier to collect a large number of samples optimizing the temporal coverage of porewater chemistry roll and halden 2016 5 conclusion in this paper process based numerical studies were performed to reveal the effect of crab burrows on soil aeration and salt transport in an idealized salt marsh the numerical results of both of the preferential flow models pfm and the equivalent continuum model ecm confirmed that crab burrows in salt marshes can enhance soil aeration and salt transport both of which support higher plant productivity in coastal marsh systems in the pfm the high permeability crab burrows acted as preferential conduits for faster infiltration of surface water when the marsh surface was flooded and faster drainage when the marsh surface was exposed local salinity differences developed between the small scale macropores and the sediment matrix the pfm is significantly more suitable to depict cm scale salinity variations in the salt marsh system in contrast the ecm is not designed to depict the small scale process of salt transport but shows the potential to be very useful at larger scales therefore the ecm will be a good option for larger scale models as it is much easier to implement with an estimation of the equivalent characteristics of background sediment matrix and macropores these results underscore the basic need to monitor hydraulic head salinity and other chemical solute concentrations in and around crab burrows this new information will be necessary to fully quantify material exchange in salt marshes our results provide insight into the field conditions that lead to differences in porewater salinity depending on the sampling method at north inlet field sampling showed that porewaters sampled by tension samplers emphasizing the macropores were consistently more saline 5 10 psu than the porewater sampled by passive diffusion samplers which likely reflect the salinity of the macropores and the sediment matrix whereas previous conceptual models for sustaining differences between macropores and the sediment matrix assumed long term balances between saline recharge and evapotranspiration we suggest that these differences may also reflect transient conditions our results show that the residence time of porewater differs significantly between the matrix and the macropores variations in surface water salinity and rainfall are a fact of life in coastal systems so differences in salinity between the matrix and the macropores should be extremely common acknowledgments this work is based

582,crab burrows can act as preferential flow conduits for pore water surface water interactions in salt marshes but the effect of preferential flow on subsurface transport in these tidally influenced systems is not fully understood we used numerical models based on salt marshes of north inlet south carolina to investigate the impacts of crab burrows on porewater salinity this modeling effort was inspired by field results from north inlet where prior field studies that used a combination of tension samplers and passive diffusion samplers measure salinity in crab burrows and in the adjacent sediment matrix found that the minimum salinity 28 psu reported by the tension samplers was larger than the maximum salinity 26 psu reported by passive diffusion samplers two kinds of numerical models were developed to investigate the effect of crab burrows on tidally driven groundwater flow and salt transport in the equivalent continuum model ecm crab burrows were included via a shallow surface layer with hydraulic properties representing a bulk average of sediment matrix and crab burrow properties in the preferential flow model pfm an independent high permeability material was embedded in the surface muddy layer to explicitly simulate preferential flow conduits the simulated results showed that both models can depict the effect of crab burrow on soil saturation and salt transport in salt marshes the presence of crab burrows can greatly increase tidally driven water exchange improve the intensity and duration of soil aeration and enhance salt transport in salt marshes the effect of crab burrows on groundwater flow and salt transport varied spatially from the creek bank to marsh interior pfm models demonstrated that salinity is likely to differ between crab burrows and the sediment matrix which supports observed differences in results between tension samplers and passive diffusion samplers these findings may have important implications for practical pore water sampling and hydrochemical investigation in coastal wetlands keywords coastal wetland macro pore bioturbation salt transport numerical simulation soil aeration 1 introduction salt marshes are characterized by high productivity and a variety of economic and ecological functions including storm buffering habitat provision nutrient cycling and blue carbon sequestration weigert and freeman 1990 costanza et al 1997 wieski et al 2010 salt marshes are strongly influenced by groundwater flow and transport moffett et al 2012 wilson et al 2015 xin et al 2010 groundwater salinity in particular is an important direct control on plant zonation and productivity in salt marshes howes et al 1986 wilson et al 2015 but it is also a good tracer for other solute transport processes including nutrient and carbon transport groundwater flow and transport processes in salt marshes are very complex and affected by multiple physicochemical processes such as tidal fluctuations groundwater flow and evaporation li et al 2005 wilson and morris 2012 wilson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 an important challenge in salt marshes is to understand the salt balance in the root zone where the influence of groundwater on salt marsh macrophytes is the strongest saline water infiltrates into the marsh surface during inundation and this saline water can be diluted through infiltration of rainwater or through mixing with fresh groundwater discharging from adjacent uplands thibodeau et al 1998 carter et al 2008 wilson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 salt can also be concentrated in shallow sediments through direct evaporation and through exclusion by plant roots bradley and morris 1991 passioura et al 1992 which can lead to the formation of barren hypersaline zones salt removal mechanisms often appear to be extremely limited in low permeability marsh mud however macropores such as common crab burrows can not only improve the soil aeration harvey and nuttle 1995 hughes et al 1998 xin et al 2009 but also provide an efficient mechanism for removal of excess salt in the root zone by advection and diffusion stieglitz et al 2000 hollins 2001 2013 pestana et al 2017 field studies reveal complicated relationships between field conditions e g precipitation evaporation and surface water salinity and porewater salinity morris 1995 carter et al 2008 hughes et al 2012 ryan 2017 morris 1995 developed a salt mass balance model to simulate porewater salinity in the top 30 cm of sediments the simulations indicated that sediment physical properties evapotranspiration and elevation are important determinants of seasonal salinity extremes miklesh and meile 2018 applied similar methods in the top 10 cm of the sediments and found that the surface water salinity was an important control on the porewater salinity hughes et al 2012 used statistical models to investigate salinity as a function of depth upper 1 m in a salt marsh island they confirmed that porewater salinity was controlled by interactions among surface water salinity precipitation and evaporation and they noted that these interactions can be enhanced or moderated by the inundation frequency of the marsh surface these previous studies reached similar general conclusions about controls on porewater salinity in salt marshes but used different methods to obtain porewater samples tension samplers morris 1995 miklesh and meile 2018 and diffusion samplers hughes et al 2012 this is significant because tension samplers such as the rhizon sampler and pushpoint sampler depend on suction pressure which disrupts the porewater equilibrium and draws porewater preferentially from macropores harvey 1993 in contrast the passive diffusion sampler provides a time weighted average chemical composition of porewater from the sediment matrix as well as from macropores roll and halden 2016 recently ryan 2017 investigated the pore water salinity using tension samplers and diffusion samplers in the upper 1 0 m of sediment in a north inlet south carolina salt marsh field results showed no correlation between the porewater salinity and the surface water salinity moreover the salinities obtained from the tension samplers were significantly larger than those from the passive diffusion samplers supporting information figures s1 and s2 the two types of samplers were placed as close to each other as possible while avoiding mutual interference so that the vegetation density vegetation type elevation and hydroperiod were essentially the same thus the salinities observed at all three comparison sites were expected to be very similar ryan 2017 speculated that this disagreement reflected differences in salinity between the macropores and the sediment matrix which were caused by preferential flow associated with macropores previous studies have described the differences in salinity between macropores and the sediment matrix in virginia salt marshes but the matrix was found to be more saline than the macropores harvey and nuttle 1995 in explaining their results harvey and nuttle 1995 suggested that surface water can infiltrate much faster through crab burrows than through the sediment matrix when the marsh surface is flooded when the marsh surface is exposed the water in a crab burrow can act as a reservoir to resupply water lost through evaporation from the matrix resulting in salt enrichment and higher salinity in the matrix fig 1 this conceptual model however is not consistent with the observations of ryan 2017 rather than speculate about the cause of the differences in these two cases we propose to address the underlying problem which is that the influence of crab burrows on groundwater flow and transport is currently poorly understood thus the goal of this work is to develop contrasting numerical models of an idealized salt marsh to gain a mechanistic understanding of how crab burrows influence groundwater flow and salinity in salt marshes we also address the impact of crab burrows on soil aeration because it is clear that soil aeration salinity and crab burrows are closely linked and because soil aeration and salinity together place strong controls on salt marsh plant productivity as will be shown the results provide insight into the field observations of ryan 2017 and confirm that crab burrows can serve as preferential flow conduits that influence the salt balance in salt marshes 2 methods 2 1 conceptual crab burrow models we based our conceptual models on salt marshes at north inlet south carolina typical of marshes in the region salt marsh sediments at north inlet are composed of an organic rich mud layer with crab burrows overlying a fine grained well sorted sand layer weigert and freeman 1990 gardner and porter 2001 gardner 2007 wilson and morris 2012 given this type of stratigraphy groundwater flow is focused in the sand layer exchange with the creek may be focused through the creek bottom gardner 2007 wilson et al 2011 2015 there are several crab species in north inlet salt marshes in the higher marsh middle of the spartina alterniflora zone to the forest edge the burrows are predominantly due to the three species of fiddler crab uca pugnax mud fiddler uca pugilator sand fiddler and uca minax red jointed fiddler in the lower marsh the burrows are predominantly from eurytium limnosum broadback mud crab two common models have been widely used to depict the effect of macropores on groundwater flow the equivalent continuum model ecm in which a composite layer includes the bulk properties of the combined macropores and matrix bear et al 1993 hughes et al 1998 and the preferential flow model pfm which includes variations of the dual domain approach e g dual porosity and dual permeability aller 1980 bear et al 1993 finsterle et al 2002 zinn et al 2004 samardzioska and popov 2005 shull et al 2009 xin et al 2009 2016 preferential flow through permeable macropores results in faster processes of wetting and or drying bear et al 1993 hendrickx and flury 2001 cushman and tartakovsky 2017 moreover water and solutes can move much faster and to far greater depths than those predicted by the richards equation in pfms beven 1991 the pfm can provide insights into realistic processes of groundwater flow and solute transport in two different media but this kind of model typically requires very fine model resolution to resolve flow in macropores in contrast the ecm is much simpler involving only the consideration of sediment stratification but ecm models do not handle solute transport effectively where preferential flow pathways exist smith and schwartz 1993 given these trade offs we designed comparative models to 1 assess the utility of the ecm model in salt marshes and 2 investigate the small scale effects of macropores on salinity in salt marshes via the pfm to better compare water samples obtained by tension samplers and diffusion samplers for the convenience of comparison all models described here have the same domain size 35 m length fig 2 the marsh domains include a levee at the edge of the marsh platform where the local elevation was set to be 0 1 m higher than that of the interior marsh platform this is typical of creek structures in salt marshes along the southeast atlantic coast wiegert and freeman 1990 levees are cut by small creeks fig 2 which allows the rising tide to flood the main marsh platform before the levees are overtopped the abundance of crab burrows as well as the burrow geometry are key factors affecting the preferential flow process however crab burrows are irregularly distributed and irregularly shaped in coastal wetlands supporting information figure s3 so it is impractical to exactly replicate the geometry of any given burrow aller 1980 heron and ridd 2008 shull et al 2009 xin et al 2009 tait et al 2016 2016 thus for the simplification and feasibility of the numerical simulations we simulated idealized burrows with constant depth aperture and density based on general characteristics of mud fiddler crab uca pugnax burrows for the ecm the upper 20 cm of the marsh surface became a homogeneous crab burrow layer with a higher porosity and permeability than the underlying bulk mud fig 2a in the pfm three zones of crab burrows were set in the creek bank zone a on the levee at the edge of the marsh platform zone b and in the marsh interior zone c respectively fig 2b each zone has four crab burrows set 19 8 cm apart i e crab burrow density 25 m 2 this distance is roughly twice the 12 2 cm reported by mccraith et al 2003 but is sufficient to observe the impact of crab burrows on solute transport as shown in fig 3 mccraith et al 2003 investigated the spatial distributions of the characteristics of crab burrows along an intertidal transect perpendicular to the bly creek in order to investigate the greatest impact of small scale crab burrow on salt transport we used the maximum depth 20 cm and aperture 2 cm of crab burrows in the pfm for purposes of comparison a set of numerical models without crab burrows were also constructed hereafter referred to as the no crab burrow model ncbm 2 2 governing equation and flux calculation simulations were conducted using the finite element computer program sutra which can simulate saturated unsaturated variable density fluid flow and transport of either dissolved substances or energy

the total amount of water flux that pass through the marsh surface including the crab burrows and the sediment matrix over a complete tidal cycle 2 3 boundary and initial conditions our simulation domain was conceptualized as reaching from the forest marsh boundary to the creek boundary conditions for the model domains consisted of a no flow boundary on the assumed low permeability bottom specified head on the landward vertical boundary and a time variable combined specified pressure and flux surface boundary fig 2c any surface node that was below the level of the tide was set to a specified pressure boundary condition where the pressure reflected the depth of the tide evapotranspiration and rainfall were implemented in the model as a specified flux at the surface cell when the elevation of the surface cell was higher than the tide level evapotranspiration and rainfall were allowed to occur if the sediment remained fully saturated at that node during tide retrieval a seepage face formed wilson and gardner 2006 it was assumed that the landward end of the creek normal transect reached the forest marsh boundary in this situation fresh groundwater can enter the marsh from the adjacent upland thibodeau et al 1998 carter et al 2008 wilson et al 2015 xiao et al 2017 therefore a specified head boundary condition was imposed on this boundary to allow continuous input of fresh groundwater this arrangement allowed salinity gradients to develop between the saline creek water infiltrating into the marsh during high tide and fresh groundwater entering on the other side of the domain note that the models in this paper are theoretical so the volume of fresh groundwater entering the model was chosen to support useful salinity variations within the model domain rather than to replicate flow at a specific site tidal variations were simulated using a sinusoidal tidal function with known amplitudes 1 5 m on average noaa tide gage 8662299 and tidal cycle 12 h based on north

and ω is the tidal angular frequency t 1 the mean creek water level was set to 3 25 m for simplicity the tidal boundary only includes spring tidal variations no neap tides included using these parameters the whole platform of the salt marsh was inundated to a depth of 0 2 m at high tides representative of common field conditions in north inlet salt marshes initial conditions were generated in two steps first the groundwater flow model using a simple sinusoidal tide was allowed to run until hydraulic heads reached a repeatable tidal cycle then salt transport was added to the tidal flow models and run for a relatively long period 1 year with the time step of 180 s to ensure that the numerical solutions reached a quasi steady state i e periodic solutions were unaffected by the initial condition 2 4 parameter values used in the simulations the parameter values used in the base simulation were set to reflect the soil porosities based on north inlet table 1 crab burrows were set as a high permeability tube with saturated permeability ks 10 6 m2 and porosity 1 0 grisak and pickens 1980 xin et al 2009 2016 the mud layer was given a low permeability ks 4 0 10 13 m2 and a high porosity 0 65 wilson and morris 2012 the bottom sand layer was set as a high permeability layer with ks 1 0 10 11 m2 xin et al 2009 wilson and morris 2012 and porosity 0 36 wilson and morris 2012 the compressibilities of the sand and mud in salt marsh were 10 7 and 10 6 pa 1 respectively wilson and morris 2012 the crab burrow layer covered the upper 20 cm of the marsh platform and creek bank this layer was given a relatively high porosity 0 85 aller 1984 we considered two methods for calculating the equivalent permeability of the crab layer kecm the volumetric weighted equivalent method gerke and van genuchten 1993 and length weighted equivalent method supporting information figure s4 both methods incorporated the spacing between crab burrows i e the density with a positive correlation between the density and kecm this analysis also showed that small burrows can greatly influence the equivalent permeability easily creating very high kecm for example if the permeability of the crab burrow was assumed to be 1 0 10 7 m2 the kecm was larger than 1 0 10 10 m2 supporting information figure s5 more than three orders of magnitude higher than the permeability of the mud laboratory tests comparing field samples with and without crab burrows suggest that crab burrows can increase the average hydraulic conductivity by only 1 2 orders of magnitude hughes et al 1998 we found that numerical models with kecm one order of magnitude larger than the matrix permeability allowed far more salt transport than we observed in the pfm such high values not only created large contrasts in permeability in the models which is known to cause errors in numerical simulations but also allowed far more salt transport than we observed in the pfm given these mismatches in this paper we show results for models in which the equivalent permeability of the crab layer was 1 5 times larger than that of the mud layer 6 0 10 13 m2 this value produces results that are intermediate between the ncbm and the pfm soil water retention curves for different sediment media are presented in supporting information figure s6 for the pfm we considered individual crab burrows as high permeability coarse sand material with the following van genuchten parameter values α 0 18 cm 1 n 2 9 sr 0 01 boufadel 2000 for the ecm the crab burrow layer was parameterized as a fine sand layer the van genuchten parameter values were obtained by the volumetric weighted equivalent method α 0 03 cm 1 n 2 115 sr 0 6 all simulations used the same numerical mesh which had 10 513 nodes and 10 216 elements the mesh density increased in burrow zones and at the interface between the mud layer and the sand layer with a minimum δx of 7 mm the values for the courant number and numerical peclet number did not exceed 1 and 2 respectively in our simulations the temperature was kept constant resulting in constant dynamic viscosity 2 5 seepage face parameter the development of seepage faces may influence plant zonation xiao et al 2017 therefore the likely impact of crab burrows on seepage faces was examined via the analytical seepage face parameter σ turner 1995 ma et al 2014 that was originally developed for beaches 9 π r t n k sin 2 β where r is the tidal range l t is the tidal period t n is the effective porosity of sediment k is the horizontal hydraulic conductivity lt 1 β is the beach slope for the mud crab burrow equivalent matrix the effective porosity n and the hydraulic conductivity k were linearly weighted based on area as measured in the horizontal plane if the slope is assumed to be uniform then for σ 1 a seepage face develops 2 6 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of changes in et rainfall tidal range permeability compressibility and dispersivity on sediment saturation and porewater salinity nearly 20 different cases were tested table 2 for example we tested different meteorological conditions ranging from et of 8 mm d to rainfall of 8 mm d tidal range can influence the sediment hydroperiod the average tidal range in north inlet salt marshes is 1 5 m but can be up to 1 8 m or more spring tide in 3 12 2017 noaa tide gage 8662299 longitudinal dispersivities ranging from 0 5 to 2 m were tested with the constant ratio of α l α t at a value of 10 gelhar et al 1992 smith 2004 evans and wilson 2017 six observation points were set in the three crab burrow zones in order to monitor or compare the variations of soil saturation and porewater salinity between crab burrows and surrounding sediment matrix fig 2b 3 results 3 1 groundwater flow patterns and fluxes in all of our models the net movement of groundwater was vertically downward in the marsh interior and groundwater velocities were greatest at the intersection of the creek bank and creek bottom the tidally averaged groundwater flow patterns of different models fig 4 a b and c are similar to the corresponding patterns of groundwater flow at low tides supporting information figure s7 flow patterns in the ncbm simulations fig 4a were generally similar to the other two models but flow rates in the shallow layer were predictably lower than those in the ecm and pfm models fig 4b and c the tidally averaged exchange rate between the surface water and groundwater was strongly influenced by the presence of crab burrows for the ncbm groundwater discharge occurred only on the creek bank and creek bottom fig 4d infiltration of the surface water into the sediment occurred across the entire upper boundary reaching a peak at the intersection point between the creek bottom and the creek bank x 2 m in fig 4d note that the slight stair step increases in surface water infiltration rate from the marsh interior to the creek bank in the ecm are likely a numerical artifact due to the non regular size of mesh although the overall increase reflects a real increase in the hydraulic gradient from the marsh interior to the levee zone b in fig 4e the pfm also had similar steps fig 4f but they are not as prominent as in the ecm where the average infiltration rate through the high permeability crab burrow layer in the ecm was nearly 2 0 times larger than in pfm fig 4e and f the distribution of porewater exchange in the pfm was similar to that of the ncbm in zones lacking crab burrows in the three crab burrow zones zones a b and c exchange rates were much higher for example the average porewater velocity through crab burrows in zone a was as much as 9 3 m d which is nearly 2 0 104 times as high as that of the adjacent sediment matrix interestingly groundwater was found to discharge through the crab burrows in zone b fig 4f this discharge occurred during falling tides supporting information figure s7 when groundwater flowed toward to the creek bank although there is net downward flow in the region of the crab burrows during falling tides some water travels out of the sediment matrix into the crab burrows before re entering the sediments along the head gradient towards the creek these results may potentially affect plant zonation and or contribute to the plants growth by affecting aeration and nutrient transport the simulated fluxes showed that crab burrows can enhance groundwater discharge by factors of 6 47 and 46 in zones a and b respectively fig 5 crab burrows also enhanced the infiltration of surface water by a factor of 8 37 in zone a the ecm showed a slight increase of groundwater discharge by a factor of 1 8 but only at zone a however surface water infiltration was enhanced in all the crab burrow zones by an average factor of 1 18 these results demonstrate that crab burrows can significantly change groundwater exchange with the largest impacts near the creek bank 3 2 effects of crab burrows on soil aeration saturation is the fraction of the pore space in the sediment that is occupied by water the tidally averaged saturation in the ecm was lower than in the ncbm and pfm over a single tidal cycle indicating greater soil aeration and drainage fig 6 in contrast the pfm and ncbm have similar saturation patterns except in the crab burrow zones for example a small mound of higher saturation appears at the bottom of the crab burrows in the pfm but does not appear in the corresponding location in the ncbm these results suggest that crab burrows allow greater aeration in the root zone by redistributing water more quickly to the sediments below the influence of the crab burrows depended on the tidal stage at low tides crab burrows decreased the local soil saturation in the three crab burrow zones fig 7 a the saturation in zone b was the lowest among the three crab burrow zones a seepage face also appeared from the low tide line to the first crab burrow but its upper extent was limited by the existence of crab burrow at rising mid tides the saturation became larger in zone a but lower in zones b and c fig 7b this difference was caused by the time delay of water propagation from the creek bank to the marsh platform at high tide the whole marsh was fully saturated results not shown when the tide receded the marsh soil became unsaturated again until the next low tide in general the soil saturation in the marsh surface in ecm was significantly lower than in pfm fig 7c and d reflecting the fact that the pfm only had crab burrows in very limited locations the timing and duration of unsaturated conditions at six observation points in the three crab burrow zones showed that the saturation in the sediment matrix in the pfm was nearly the same as the ncbm fig 8 however the saturations in crab burrows tended to zero at low tides in zone b and unsaturated conditions persisted 1 2 h longer in the crab burrows than in the sediment matrix the unsaturated period in zone a was the shortest only 1 3 of the total tidal period in contrast the unsaturated periods in zone b and zone c were nearly 2 3 and 1 2 of total tidal periods respectively the patterns from the pfm different periods of unsaturated conditions in zones a b and c also developed in the ecm fig 8 sensitivity studies confirmed that the permeability of the mud layer can significantly affect the soil saturation in the pfm supporting information figure s8 for example an increase of an order of magnitude in the permeability of the mud layer from 4 10 13 m2 to 4 10 12 m2 greatly decreased the soil saturation and increased the unsaturated period in the soil matrix however variations of an order of magnitude in the permeability of the crab burrows had very little effect on soil saturation as is common in situations with large contrasts in permeability once a certain threshold has been reached further increasing the contrast in permeability has very little impact on the flow system in the ecm increases in the permeabilities of the mud layer and crab burrow layer predictably increased the soil aeration supporting information figure s9 variations in sediment compressibility also had a large impact on soil saturation in the ecm the larger the sediment compressibility the higher the soil aeration as the tidal range in the base case was set to inundate the whole marsh platform increasing the tidal range caused very little change in the soil saturation but decreasing the tidal range from 1 5 m to 1 2 m the marsh surface not inundated decreased the hydroperiod and hence decreased the soil saturation supporting information figure s10 changes in et and rainfall had very little effect on soil saturation figure s10 sensitivity studies showed that crab burrows can significantly affect the development of seepage faces along the creek bank fig 9 for the mud layer in the creek bank of the ncbm the seepage parameter is 635 93 indicating the development of seepage face in contrast for crab burrows in the pfm and the equivalent crab burrow layer in the ecm the seepage parameters were far less than 1 0 indicating no seepage face development we also tested other conditions with different tidal ranges and slopes the results showed that the smaller the slope and or the larger the tidal range the larger the seepage face parameter increasing the density of crab burrows by decreasing the neighbor distance of crab burrows from 19 8 cm to 12 2 cm also decreased the possibility of the development of seepage face fig 9 3 3 effects of crab burrows on porewater salinity all simulations were run until salinity reached a periodic quasi steady state supporting information figure s11 the distribution of salinity in all simulations reflects a balance between tidally driven infiltration of saline creek water and the influx of fresh groundwater from the upland fig 10 and in this scenario simulations or zones that allowed greater influx of saline water are clearly visible the simulated results showed that the ecm allowed significantly more salt to infiltrate through the marsh platform than the ncbm moreover the high salinity plume reached deeper in the middle zone of marsh platform in the ecm indicating a higher infiltration rate of surface water figs 4 and 5 comparison of the pfm and ncbm confirms that the crab burrows locally enhanced salt infiltration in the crab burrow zones fig 10 the distribution of salinity in the crab burrow zones in the pfm confirms that salinity gradients can develop between macropores and the sediment matrix fig 11 although the simulated variations 2 psu in salinity are not as large as those 5 10 psu observed by ryan 2017 overall we found that the salinity fluctuated within and or adjacent to the crab burrows and was nearly stable below the upper crab burrow layer at low tide fig 11a the pore water drained continuously with the greatest drainage rate in the crab burrows and the salinity gradually decreased downward in zone a groundwater flowed towards the low tide line in zones b and c groundwater flowed downward and the salinity gradually decreased with distance from the creek bank interestingly in zone c salinity in the sediment matrix was higher than in the crab burrows this was consistent with the conceptual model of harvey and nuttle 1995 fig 1 but not consistent with field observations of ryan 2017 specifically the salinity differences between the crab burrows and surrounding sediment matrix were limited to the upper 10 cm fig 11a whereas field observed differences i e the differences between the tension and diffusion samplers go down to 50 cm and beyond ryan 2017 visually the salinity distribution formed the shape of inverse funnel shaped contours especially at zone c fig 11a at high tide surface water inundated the whole salt marsh and simulated groundwater flow nearly halted except in the crab burrows fig 11b in zone a the infiltration of creek water into the sediment occurred largely through the crab burrows in zone b funnel shaped contours appeared and became more noticeable in zone c similar to fig 1c in short the crab burrows served as preferential conduits allowing salt to be transported to the bottom of the crab burrows much more quickly than in the surrounding sediment matrix this continuous infiltration led to a net increase in salinity around the crab burrow zones fig 10 sensitivity studies in which dispersivity was varied by a factor of 2 showed that increasing the dispersion decreased variations in salinity over a tidal cycle supporting information figure s11 decreased dispersion reduced mixing with the fresher porewaters which supported higher pore water salinity in the root zone than simulations with larger dispersivity supporting information figure s11 further sensitivity studies showed that the salinity distribution was very sensitive to the permeability of the crab burrow layer in the ecm larger equivalent permeabilities allowed the high salinity plume to reach deeper especially near the creek bank supporting information figure s12 4 discussion 4 1 salt transport and removal the effect of crab burrows on salt transport may be influenced by the residence time of water in crab burrows ridd 1996 and stieglitz et al 2000 found that a single tidal flush was sufficient for the complete renewal of the burrow water however hollins 2001 concluded that only one third of the burrow water was flushed in our simulations the salinity in the crab burrows in the creek bank was completely flushed during a tidal cycle indicating a short water residence time for example high salinities visible in the crab burrows at high tide vanished at low tide fig 11 however the simulated salinities show only partial flushing in the marsh interiors therefore whether complete tidal flushing occurs likely depends on the specific locations of the crab burrows in the intertidal zone an important goal of our work was to understand how crab burrows could support differences in salinity between macropores and the sediment matrix as identified by ryan 2017 and harvey and nuttle 1995 the field sampling sites of both studies were located in the interior of the salt marsh so we focused on zone c of our models the simulated salinity in the sediment matrix was higher than that in the crab burrows at low tides fig 11 which is consistent with the conceptual model of harvey and nuttle 1995 but inconsistent with ryan 2017 supporting information figure s2 given our new process based understanding of transport through crab burrows we re examined the conditions surrounding ryan s field sampling first we found that all of ryan s field samples were collected after a large rainfall resulting in surface water that was fresher at the beginning of the record supporting information figure s2 our simulations indicate that the residence time of rainwater in the crab burrows is shorter than the residence time of porewater in the matrix due to the large differences of water flow velocity fig 11 thus once precipitation and low salinity creek water enter the system following a large rain event the sediment matrix will remain fresh longer than the crab burrows second ryan s observations were collected during the winter when evapotranspiration is greatly reduced and the conceptual model of harvey and nuttle 1995 is least likely to apply finally all of ryan s samples were collected in the first 3 5 h after the sampling sites were exposed during falling tide ryan 2017 this is immediately after the infiltration of saline surface water during high tide and presumably when differences in salinity between the macropores and sediment matrix would be the largest in short the sampling work depends on temporal variability such as tidal cycles and seasonality the large salinity difference between the tension samplers and diffusion samplers also suggests that continuous sampling may be necessary in salt marshes 4 2 research limitations and prospects the aim of this paper was to find out whether salinity differs between the macropores and the sediment matrix providing some important insights into the physical processes of water and salt exchange however the models were theoretical based on an intertidal transect in a north inlet salt marsh with a layer of mud 1 m thick overlying fine sand where groundwater flow is apparent in the subsurface more complex field conditions such as different thicknesses or lack of mud and variations in burrow morphology were not considered for example the mud layer in many of salt marshes along the atlantic may be much thicker than 1 0 m wilson et al 2011 2015 where the mud layer is thicker it is likely that less fresh groundwater would come near the surface in this situation precipitation and et might be much more important controls than crab bioturbation in that case and pore water salinity could be diluted by the recharge of rainwater in addition the differences between our ideal burrows and real burrows may also greatly impact the simulated results crab burrows may be more complex in muddier sediments due to the more cohesive nature of the sediments katrak et al 2008 different crab species also create burrows that differ in morphology connectivity and depth in salt marshes worldwide allen and curran 1974 katrak et al 2008 sharma et al 1987 escapa et al 2008 wang et al 2010 wilson et al 2012 for example more than one opening may exist in burrows and pressure gradients between different openings may lead to enhanced water flow heron and ridd 2008 ridd 1996 susilo and ridd 2005 stieglitz et al 2000 therefore future investigations of how burrows with different depths and connectivity impact water and salt transport in actual field sites are warranted the sensitivity analysis of the ecm and pfm showed that substantially different results can be obtained depending on the chosen parameters particularly the sediment permeability strongly influences the porewater salinity consistent with other recent results miklesh and meile 2018 this means that determining the bulk permeability used in the ecm is particularly important but our results suggest full dual permeability or dual porosity models will be required for systems in which solute transport is important in this paper we calculated the equivalent permeability using two analytical methods supporting information figures s4 and s5 but both methods showed that the equivalent permeability was easily 1 3 orders of magnitude larger than that of the mud layer as previously indicated tests of field samples also suggest an increase of 1 2 orders of magnitude when crab burrows are present hughes et al 1998 in our numerical models increasing the equivalent permeability of the upper 20 cm of sediments by an order of magnitude allowed far more salt to enter the subsurface than in the crab burrow zones of the pfm it is not unexpected for models that correctly approximate bulk flow properties to fail to approximate solute transport properly but normally the problem is that preferential flow paths allow more transport than is predicted by models that use bulk averages one reason that the pfm may have shown less salt in the subsurface is that the pfm had crab burrows in only a few locations dispersive loss of salt surrounding the crab burrow zones in the pfm likely reduced the salinity somewhat compared to what it would have been if there had been crab burrows throughout the marsh surface the other reason that the salinity increased more in the ecm than the pfm is that adding the crab burrow layer shifted the interface between fresh and saline water downward that is the differences between the ecm and the pfm are caused not by differences in transport associated with preferential flow paths but by systematic changes in the groundwater flow field this question clearly warrants further investigation but that investigation will have to include observations from field sites rather than purely theoretical models in view of our two different approaches to simulating the effects of crab burrows we conclude that each approach has its advantages for specific research purposes the pfm can be used to quantify small scale groundwater flow and salt transport processes but it requires high computational effort in contrast the ecm cannot provide insights into the local processes of flow and solute transport in the two different media but it is much easier to implement field measurement of the permeability of sediments with and without crab burrows will likely be required to estimate the bulk equivalent characteristics of the crab burrow layer overall the pfm will be the preferential option if cm scale salinity variations are of interest the ecm has the potential to very useful for larger scale models finally our results suggest that salinity gradients can develop between crab burrows and the sediment matrix and it is logical to assume that concentrations of other solutes such as carbon and nitrogen in the crab burrow would also differ from the sediment matrix wang et al 2010 further the concentrations of other solutes in and around crab burrows are also worth monitoring over longer periods including seasons to capture variations associated with changing precipitation patterns and variations in mean water level this will be a challenge but such effort will be necessary to revise the estimation of material exchange across the sediment interface in salt marshes our results also suggest that the choice of porewater sampler is highly dependent on the specific problem being studied as the chemical composition of porewater is not homogeneous between macropores and soil matrix litaor 1988 therefore use of a combination of tension and passive sampling devices simultaneously in salt marshes may potentially enhance the overall information garnered in a sampling campaign the selection of sampler s for monitoring porewater in salt marshes may also be guided by research objectives if the research intends to collect useful information on physicochemical processes such as sorption processes in preferential flow paths peranginangin et al 2009 field sampling work should be conducted through use of tension samplers as it can draw porewater preferentially from macropores harvey 1993 otherwise the use of passive samplers is a good choice because it is easier to collect a large number of samples optimizing the temporal coverage of porewater chemistry roll and halden 2016 5 conclusion in this paper process based numerical studies were performed to reveal the effect of crab burrows on soil aeration and salt transport in an idealized salt marsh the numerical results of both of the preferential flow models pfm and the equivalent continuum model ecm confirmed that crab burrows in salt marshes can enhance soil aeration and salt transport both of which support higher plant productivity in coastal marsh systems in the pfm the high permeability crab burrows acted as preferential conduits for faster infiltration of surface water when the marsh surface was flooded and faster drainage when the marsh surface was exposed local salinity differences developed between the small scale macropores and the sediment matrix the pfm is significantly more suitable to depict cm scale salinity variations in the salt marsh system in contrast the ecm is not designed to depict the small scale process of salt transport but shows the potential to be very useful at larger scales therefore the ecm will be a good option for larger scale models as it is much easier to implement with an estimation of the equivalent characteristics of background sediment matrix and macropores these results underscore the basic need to monitor hydraulic head salinity and other chemical solute concentrations in and around crab burrows this new information will be necessary to fully quantify material exchange in salt marshes our results provide insight into the field conditions that lead to differences in porewater salinity depending on the sampling method at north inlet field sampling showed that porewaters sampled by tension samplers emphasizing the macropores were consistently more saline 5 10 psu than the porewater sampled by passive diffusion samplers which likely reflect the salinity of the macropores and the sediment matrix whereas previous conceptual models for sustaining differences between macropores and the sediment matrix assumed long term balances between saline recharge and evapotranspiration we

583,the optimal impoundment operation of cascade reservoirs can dramatically improve the utilization of water resources however their complex non convexity and computational costs pose challenges to optimal hydroelectricity output and limit further development of joint operation within larger scale cascade reservoirs in recent decades parallel dynamic programming pdp has emerged as a means of alleviating the curse of dimensionality in the mid long term reservoir operation with more involved computing processors but it still can t effectively solve the daily impoundment operation of more than three reservoirs here we propose a novel method called importance sampling pdp is pdp algorithm in which the merits of pdp are integrated with importance sampling and successive approximation strategy importance sampling is first used to construct the state vectors of each period by introducing manhattan distance in the discrete state space then the pdp recursive equation is used to find an improved solution during the iteration the is pdp method is tested to optimize hydropower output for the joint operation of an 11 reservoir system located in the upper yangtze river basin of china after establishing impoundment operation by advancing impoundment timings and rising water levels we find that our methodology could effectively deal with the curse of dimensionality for such mega reservoir systems and make better use of water resources in comparison to the standard operation policy sop given its computational efficiency and robust convergence the methodology is an attractive alternative for non convex operation of large scale cascade reservoirs keywords joint impoundment operation cascade reservoir curse of dimensionality parallel dynamic programming importance sampling successive approximation 1 introduction with growing attention being paid to suitable economic development in recent decades water related challenges have increased which has led to great stress on water resources management solomatine and shrestha 2009 wu et al 2017 reservoirs as a key part of a water conservancy project are of great importance to regulate water resources through altering natural streamflow across temporal distribution ng et al 2017 uen et al 2018 conventionally a large amount of water should be spilled to secure enough reservoir storage for flood protection during the wet seasons while it is refilled during the following dry seasons to meet the demands guo et al 2004 kim and georgakakos 2014 but both engineering experience and academic researches frequently highlighted the importance of advancing replenishment of reservoir storage that can be further updated to boost utilization benefits for power generation navigation as well as water supply li et al 2018 2014b and the key scientific issue is to deal with the optimal initial impoundment time and impoundment process where the stochastic characteristics of natural streamflow and the occurrence of flooding events are considered wang et al 2014 to overcome this issue a prescribed set of operating rules can be designed to guide the reservoir impoundment operation turner and galelli 2016 wan et al 2016 yeh 1985 zhao et al 2012 researchers have proposed several types of conceptual reservoir impoundment operation rules the new york city rule clark 1956 was firstly introduced to guide reservoir impoundment through probability of spills rather than direct amounts of the physical spill in the pursuit of minimization of expected shortages with the development of computation impoundment operation rule for one reservoir could be derived by the intelligent algorithms and the start of the impounding period can be further developed to the beginning of the post flood season liu et al 2011 recently research focus has been shifted to joint impoundment operation rules of cascade reservoirs the artificial impoundment rules for the multi purpose 3 reservoir model that consisted of a flood control risk analysis module and a utilization benefits analysis module were assessed by zhou et al 2015 a stochastic programming model for 3 reservoir hydropower system which incorporated a joint chance constraint to identify the trade off between flood control risk and operational benefits was used to develop the optimal refill policy xu et al 2017 above mentioned impoundment operation rules of the small scale reservoir system could be easily optimized that offers a great contribution to water resources utilization nevertheless it is almost impossible to derive optimal rule curves to operate cascade reservoirs involving large scale trans basin chang and chang 2006 feng et al 2018a trans province and trans regions issues cheng et al 2012 jurasz and ciapala 2017 major barriers exist in the complex non convexity and high dimensionality of the whole system jurasz and ciapala 2017 where a large number of decision variables are required for modeling joint impoundment operation castelletti et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 for example a hybrid two stage stochastic method li et al 2018 is effective for reservoir impoundment operation by using scenario based forecasts but the computational burden trends a rapid growth celeste and billib 2009 feng et al 2018b galelli and castelletti 2013 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii coupled with a successive approximation approach zhou et al 2018 can not only provide a large number of impoundment rule curves for the high dimensional and multi objective cascade reservoirs but supply the best solution for each objective whereas it is still considered too time consuming and computationally intensive to be applied in practical engineering giuliani et al 2016 tsai et al 2015 thus it is necessary to explore some competent tools for the derivation of large scale reservoir system operating rules from the universal frameworks of explicit stochastic optimization eso implicit stochastic optimization iso or parameterization simulation optimization pso among the three frameworks eso behaves in an arguably more complex way than iso and pso with another additional state variable inflow to directly describe inflow stochastically celeste and billib 2009 as the most successful method to solve the computational problems of the eso framework stochastic dual dynamic programming sddp presented by pereira and pinto 1991 secures a wide application in hydrothermal scheduling poorsepahy samian et al 2016 in spite of considerable research effort the sddp method does not easily facilitate non convexities pritchard 2015 tilmant and kelman 2007 once non convexities of the large scale reservoir community arise for instance when representing the detailed relationship between power output and water discharge the exact unit commitment of generators sddp will lose its generality non convexities and dimensionality pressure of cascade reservoirs force the iso framework to be the first attempt in this study which formulates deterministic problems for simplicity the reasonable ameliorated orientation in the iso framework can be roughly divided into two categories labadie 2004 modern evolutionary algorithms eas and conventional optimization methods eas are approved to have near global convergence ability and made some achievements in multi objective reservoir problems pan et al 2015 nevertheless large number of iterations and premature convergence make eas still difficult to have immediate applicability to practical engineering issue where large scale and non convex operations are involved cai et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 conventional optimization methods such as progressive optimality algorithm poa bai et al 2015 discrete differential dynamic programming dddp feng et al 2017a and dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa turgeon 1981 yi et al 2003 tend to decompose the multi stage sequential structure of optimization problem into stages bellman 1954 and have been proved suitable for a certain number of reservoir management these algorithms also fail to comply with intolerable computational cost once the problem scale expands to a large degree and therefore some improvements based on these conventional optimization methods become a hot research topic with focus on reducing the curse of dimensionality feng et al 2017b ouyang et al 2015 shen et al 2018 as a modified version of dynamic programming method the parallel dynamic programming pdp algorithm implements computer techniques to improve computational efficiency and mitigate the curse of dimensionality to some extent li et al 2014a liu et al 2018 it has been widely used in medium and long term non convex reservoir operation cheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 but the standard pdp mechanism will lose its applicability to daily impoundment operation when the number of reservoirs is more than three li et al 2014a it is difficult to traverse all combinations of discrete states of all reservoirs as the number of combinations trends exponentially with the increasing number of reservoirs and discrete states actually many combinations have no need to be traversed because they have violated complex operation constraints of the large scale reservoir community e g hydraulic electricity connections and so on importance sampling is a proper method that can select some small but representative combinations through the introduction of manhattan distance to make a sharp reduction in computational complexity beichl and sullivan 1999 naturally a novel method that integrates the standard pdp with importance sampling and successive approximation is presented in the paper where importance sampling is firstly applied to choose some cross sectional combinations in the state space and then a pdp recursive equation seeks for an improved solution among these representatives while the successive approximation strategy is used to gradually improve the solution quality two main foci are explored in this study 1 coupling the parallel dynamic programming pdp with importance sampling to cope with the curse of dimensionality in the large scale non convex reservoir operation 2 boosting hydropower generation through two preset strategies that advance impoundment operation timing and lift reservoir water level for impoundment reservoirs the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the mathematical formulation of cascade reservoirs impoundment operation problem section 3 analyzes the curse of dimensionality in pdp and shows the detailed procedure of the proposed is pdp algorithm section 4 tests the performance of our methodology for large scale cascade reservoirs and then section 5 concludes our findings 2

the mass balance equation energy production equation reservoir water level limits and boundary conditions can be easily satisfied when the state variables are defined however water discharge limits hydropower generation limits and water level fluctuation rate may be violated because of some infeasible reservoir storage policies found during iterations to deal with these infeasibilities penalty

operation when applied to address high dimensional cascade reservoir operation the conventional dynamic programming that involved three layered loops will be confronted with huge memory usage and long execution time see procedure i in fig 1 yeh 1985 zhang et al 2015 as a modified dynamic programming method parallel dynamic programming pdp is used to alleviate the dimensionality problem which can be represented as follows 13 f t z t max o t s j o f t z t 1 o t f t 1 z t 1 z t 1 s j z f t z t 1 o t i 1 m n i t z t 1 o t δ t where f t z t is the maximum cumulative return from the first stage to the tth time and there is f 0 0 s j z and s j o denote the discrete state variable set and discrete decision variable set respectively z t is the state vector of the cascade reservoirs at tth time z t z 1 t z 2 t z m t t o t is the decision vector of the cascade reservoirs at tth time o t o 1 t o 2 t o m t t fig 2 illustrates the sketch map of pdp for solving a high dimensional reservoir operation problem for the impoundment operation of cascade reservoirs the state value of each reservoir is fixed at the initial and terminal stage and there is only one state vector composed of the preset water level for each reservoir at other stages the reservoir water level varies in the feasible region and consists of different state combinations the calculation of the state combination is independent of each other i e the calculation of the discrete state combination at a stage is only related to the discrete state combination of the last stage and itself and it also has no effect on the optimization calculation of other state combinations in the stage wu et al 2018 the pdp algorithm skillfully utilizes calculation independence to implement parallel computing in a multi core environment as can be analyzed from fig 2 under the same total amount of calculation time efficiency in the parallel mode is much higher than the conventional serial dp algorithm in fig 1 this is a breakthrough in optimal operation of large scale cascade reservoirs 3 2 a hidden dimension problem in pdp similar to the dynamic programming pdp seeks for the optimal value in the discrete state space composed of all the possible states of each reservoir if f discrete points are assumed in the feasible region of water level the hidden dimension disaster of pdp can be analyzed from two aspects 1 in terms of memory usage two elements should be stored at least for any of the state vector the first is the optimal cumulative return while the second one is the corresponding state vector index at the beginning of this stage thus during the entire scheduling horizon the size of elements is proportional to the total number of state vectors that is fm t 1 2 the space complexity of pdp is about o fmt 2 in terms of the calculations pdp decomposes the original calculation task into several sub tasks which are simultaneously tackled by different involved processors in stage 1 and stage t the number of state vectors at the beginning and end of the stage are 1 and fm respectively the optimal state vector can be found after fm p calculations of each processor where p represents the number of computing processors in other stages with fm state vectors each state vector must choose the best among the fm state vectors at the beginning of this stage which means that f 2 m k calculations of each processor must be done at the same stage if the communication time fraction of each processor is ignored the time complexity of pdp is about o f 2m t p from the above analysis the computational complexity of pdp will grow exponentially with the increase of reservoir number and discrete states li et al 2014a as the number of cascade reservoirs expands to a larger scale pdp still suffers from the serious dimensionality disaster and it is difficult for operators to tolerate the long execution time due to this reason only a few studies involve optimizing the daily impoundment operation of more than three reservoirs li et al 2014a zhou et al 2018 to resolve the curse of dimensionality in pdp the idea of using importance sampling is applied to construct the representative set of discrete state vectors at each period enhancing the performance of pdp without changing its excellent characteristics 3 3 importance sampling as one of the most successful sampling techniques importance sampling was proposed to balance the cost and efficiency of experiments melchers 1989 more details about importance sampling can be found in other reported literature beichl and sullivan 1999 and here s a brief introduction of importance sampling suppose there is a sum f n j 1 n f σ j to be estimated where f is a known function σj belongs to some set of size n where n is very large a simple monte carlo method would be to choose n n samples if any particular σj is equally important then the importance p σj can be represented by 1 n so we can compute j 1 n f σ j n n i e j 1 n f σ j n p σ j to get an estimate of f n however the importance of σj is usually different and importance sampling is to use a non uniform probability p σj to sample a small but representative subset from all the possible level combinations for experimentation which is somehow better than uniform to improve result reliability when n is properly acquired the variance of the estimator can be effectively reduced which can be proved as follows 14 j 1 n f σ j n p σ j σ j f σ j p σ j p σ j f n 3 4 pdp coupled with importance sampling is pdp from the perspective of statistics sampling the comprehensive combination of state variable set at each stage can be viewed as the all possible experiments the objective value is treated as the test index to diagnose the performance of an experiment each reservoir is regarded as one factor with certain influences on the test index the discrete states of the ith reservoir are treated as the levels of the ith factor and one state combination can be seen as an possible experiment feng et al 2017b he et al 2018 then importance sampling can be adopted to decrease the size of state vectors by introducing manhattan distance in the discrete state space here one unit manhattan distance is supposed to be the absolute difference between adjacent levels of the reservoir based on the above analysis the pdp coupled with importance sampling is pdp approach is introduced to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in pdp similar to the classical successive approximation strategy in modified dp variants such as poa and dpsa the is pdp approach divides the whole search space into several disjoint sub spaces and enhances the quality of solution by means of iterative strategy generally it requires an initial trajectory where the states of each reservoir during the scheduling horizon are assigned the initial trajectory obtained by expert judgments or other methods should cater to all the operational constraints imposed on the cascade reservoirs as much as possible in this study the initial trajectory is obtained by progressively optimizing each reservoir from upstream to downstream theoretically the closer state vectors are to the initial state vectors the easier it is to meet a set of strong constraints which includes the hydraulic and electricity connections between high dimensional cascade reservoirs that is to say the smaller manhattan distance value the state vectors have the more important the experiments are to be sampled by calculating the numbers of the different manhattan distance to quantify importance of all state vectors importance sampling can be employed to structure the candidate state vectors in the feasible region at each stage making an obvious reduction in the computational overhead of pdp where it is impossible for the later pdp to calculate all the possible discrete state vectors then pdp resolves the dynamic programming recursive equation in eq 13 to seek for an improved solution pertaining to the current trajectory as the final iteration procedure proceeds the quality of solution will be improved gradually the solution is used to guide the scientific operation of the cascade reservoirs once the terminal conditions are satisfied the is pdp approach with a successive approximation strategy implements the computation framework as follows step 1 designate the basic computing parameters including the number of reservoirs m the number of discrete state values f the number of computing process k and the terminal precision ε step 2 utilize the standard dynamic programming to generate the initial solution in the feasible space fig 3 a which is denoted as z 0 z i t 0 m t then define the corresponding search step array of the cascade reservoirs which is denoted as l 0 l i t 0 m t here z i t 0 and l i t 0 are the initial water level and search step for each reservoir at t stage respectively step 3 based on the number of reservoirs m and discrete state values f implement the importance sampling approach to construct the appropriate state combinations we used eq 15 to construct the discrete state combinations of each stage where the state value of each reservoir in any one of state combination is in the feasible region 15 z i t max min z i t 0 α l i t 0 z i t m a x z i t m i n step 4 use pdp to resolve the dynamic recursion equation in eq 13 for an improved trajectory fig 3b which is denoted as z 1 z i t 1 m t step 5 if z 1 z 0 go to step 6 otherwise set z 0 z 1 and go back to step 3 step 6 if l 0 ε go to step 7 otherwise set l 0 a l 0 and go back to step 3 where a is the scaling factor used to control the search step and is set to be 0 5 in this case step 7 after terminating the iteration the current trajectory z 1 is exported as the final optimal solution fig 3c in order to intuitively illustrate the difference between the pdp and is pdp approaches fig 4 takes an example with 2 reservoir and 5 levels per reservoir at each stage pdp using the complete factorial experiment has 5 5 25 state combinations but is pdp only needs 6 state combinations as can be seen from fig 4 is pdp starts with the initial trajectory while the manhattan distance to the initial trajectory has five different values 0 4 the corresponding number of these values is 1 4 8 8 and 4 the sum is 25 respectively and the number extracted by expert judgment could be 1 2 1 1 and 1 the sum is 6 respectively szirmay kalos and szecsi 2009 obviously is pdp can obtain adequate information on the experiment problem with a small cost improving work efficiency in practical engineering glynn and iglehart 1989 stordal and elsheikh 2015 its superior performance will be more prominent with the expansion of problem scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 mega cascade reservoirs description the yangtze river the longest river in china has a main stream length of 6300 km with a total drainage area of 1 8 million km2 the river owns huge vertical water head and abundant hydropower resources in recent decades a set of dams have been constructed along the yangtze river for multiple purposes including flood control hydropower production water supply navigation and so on among these 11 cascade reservoirs fig 5 serve as the largest hydroelectric project to date and we selected it as our case study the task of optimal impoundment operation for the entire 11 cascade reservoirs is to fill up the reservoir storages during the impoundment period such that hydropower generation is maximized while other objectives are treated as constraints the daily recorded flow data series from august 1st october 31st 92 days spanning over sixty years 1951 2014 for these reservoirs and neighboring hydrological gauging stations are provided by the yangtze river commission the basic information of these reservoirs is listed in table 1 the designed operation rules i e standard operation policy sop of these reservoirs suggest that the reservoir storage level should be linearly raised from the annual top of buffer pool at the impoundment starting time to the top of conservation pool at the end of flood seasons in fig 3c the impoundment operation period of the cascade reservoirs should be implemented between august 1st and october 31st according to geological distributions of reservoirs along the yangtze river wang et al 2014 generally the upstream reservoir should impound water earlier than the downstream reservoirs except guan yin yan gyy reservoir located at the midstream jinsha river which requires to impound later for the purpose of ensuring flood prevention safety at downstream in consideration of joint impoundment operation of cascade reservoirs two operational strategies i e earlier initial impoundment time and higher water levels water head for hydropower generation could be applied after cross examining the climatic and hydrological data of this study area see table 1 these two strategies will pave the way for boosting hydropower output simultaneously meanwhile seasonal top of buffer pools seasonal tbp in table 2 are designed to limit the maximum allowable storage at different stages of the impoundment period which could guide excess outflow discharge to be released downstream for the safety of the levee seasonal tbp and sop construct the upper and lower bound of the search scope respectively 4 2 comparison of the is pdp and pdp algorithms in order to verify algorithmic performance the results of is pdp with different numbers of reservoirs and discrete state vectors are compared with the effective pdp method respectively 4 2 1 performance of algorithms with different reservoirs in this case is pdp is systematically compared with pdp when both are applied to the impoundment operation with a different number of reservoirs including a 2 reseroivr ly ah and a 3 reservoir ly ah jaq system the number of discrete state values for each reservoir is set to be 30 and the number of computing cores is 16 consequently the numbers of state vectors for the 2 reservoir and 3 reservoir system are 302 and 303 in the pdp approach respectively and is pdp employs importance sampling technique to reduce the number of state vectors to 9 for the 2 reservoir system and 27 for the 3 reservoir system table 3 shows the average generation and computing time of these two different algorithms it can be found from table 3 that the computing time of the 3 reservoir system is intolerable even if it can obtain the optimal solution as the number of reservoir continuously expands the curse of dimensionality makes it impossible to effectively solve the optimal operation however is pdp demonstrates its effectiveness in different sized cascade reservoirs the hydropower generation of is pdp is close to the optimal value but it takes far less computation time than that of pdp it proves the feasibility of importance sampling in reducing discrete state vectors it can be concluded that when solving large scale hydropower operation problem the number of cascade reservoirs is more than three the traditional pdp approach cannot meet the practical requirement from dispatching department while is pdp provides a new possibility to alleviate the curse of dimensionality 4 2 2 performance of algorithms with different discrete state vectors several cases with different discrete state vectors in the 3 reservoir system ly ah jaq are designed to compare the performance of is pdp and pdp fig 6 draws the detailed result with respect to power generation and computing time it can be seen that is pdp with 2 discrete state vectors provides less generation due to the smaller search space the search ability can be effectively strengthened and the gross generation gradually converges to the best solution of pdp with the increasing number of discrete state vectors on the other hand discrete states increase from 2 to 100 and time increases from 108 to 1001s it is owed that a larger number of discretized states makes a larger search space which results in the better solution but simultaneously spends more time on the computation of decision combinations in practical engineering the number of discrete states should be larger to procure a better solution meanwhile it is required to be smaller for the convergence speed of algorithm a number of discretization should be set properly to achieve a balance between search efficiency and solution quality 4 3 comparison with two representative optimization algorithms to explore the necessity of our proposed approach the most applied poa a kind of conventional optimization methods and genetic algorithm ga a kind of eas are also selected to optimize the multi reservoir system and compared to is pdp where the number of computing cores and state vectors of is pdp still remains 16 and 27 respectively the experimental setup of ga is described in table 4 the results in table 5 present the optimization ability of the three different algorithms poa can optimize impoundment operation of no more than 6 reservoirs in comparison to is pdp it spends more time but has inferior solution of the 6 reservoir system located in the midstream jin sha river it will trouble in the curse of dimensionality with endless running time in our case study of an 11 reservoir system ga can accomplish the computation task of an 11 reservoir system in a limited time but has poor optimization performance the optimal solution of ga not only highly relies on many feasible initial solutions but has almost no change with initial solutions in a limited 1000 iterations which illustrates that ga easily falls into local optimum when it solves the large scale complex and non linear impoundment operation with so many constraints and 64 768 decision variables 11 reservoirs 64 years 92 days what s more ga spends plenty of time more than 7 h to produce and calculate lots of infeasible solutions which is also intolerable in practical engineering the details of the 11 reservoir system optimized by our is pdp method are illustrated in the next section 4 4 4 4 application to the 11 reservoir system is pdp is such a proper method that it can select some small but representative combinations through the introduction of manhattan distance to make a sharp reduction of combinations from 3011 to 100 on the one hand it is almost impossible for the existing methods to traverse all combinations for 11 reservoirs on the other hand a lot of combinations do not have to be traversed because they violate complex operation constraints of the large scale reservoir community e g hydraulic electricity connections and so on and with the help of the initial trajectory obtained by progressively optimizing reservoirs from upstream to downstream the successive approximation strategy is pdp adopts can gradually improve the optimal solution quality in order to verify the practicability of the proposed method the results of the 11 reservoir system solved by is pdp are still analyzed from two aspects computational efficiency and optimization result for hydropower generation 4 4 1 computational efficiency the parallel computing can greatly shorten the run time and improve the computational efficiency zhang et al 2015 generally the more processors are involved the more efficient the algorithm is the run time of one iteration in parallel program tp parallel acceleration ratio sp and parallel efficiency ep piccardi and soncinisessa 1991 are introduced as three main evaluation indices for parallel algorithm performance sp is equal to ratio of the run time of a serial application on a processor ts to tp denoting the degree of run time reduction from serial calculation mode to parallel calculation mode ep is equal to ratio of sp to the number of processors p evaluating the effective utilization degree of a processor s computing ability table 6 shows the statistical index in several different trials by varying the numbers of the processors besides the results calculated by one processor i e serial model are also introduced for comparison as can be seen from table 6 one iteration for serial model takes 978 43 s time cost significantly decreases with more processors due to the lessened amounts of task assigned to each processor it only takes 115 65 s when computational processors are up to 16 and the value of sp is trending rise it can be inferred that computational efficiency will be further improved with more processors which makes possible for water resources managers possible to take rational actions in time however the parallel efficiency value ep ranging from 0 to 1 becomes smaller with more computational processors it dues to that when the number of processors is small 50 the workload imbalance is significant because various numbers of unfeasible solutions assigned to each processor will be discarded and these fast processors must wait until the slowest processor finishes its task at the same stage li et al 2014a fig 7 draws the convergence curves of the proposed method in the typical year of 2002 with different processors where all start from the same initial solution obtained by expert knowledge it can be seen that different scenarios have similar iteration numbers convergence curves and final optimization objective fig 7 and table 6 illustrate that different numbers of the processors can not only improve computational efficiency of iteration but also has no effect on iteration numbers or optimization results the convergence curves have two obvious steep increase procedure with one at the beginning the search mechanism quickly finds the better solution in the neighborhood of the initial trajectory as the iterations proceed the optimized results only have slight increasing disturbances another one occurs at the intermediate iteration procedure where search step changes finally the proposed method can converge to a satisfactory outcome at the cost of extra iterations the final objective values in these scenarios are almost same it indicates that although importance sampling technique generates different random combinations in each experiment it can ultimately converge to the optimal solution in other words a large quantity of state vectors is not required because importance sampling can select valuable ones 4 4 2 optimal result for hydropower generation hydropower generation is the only optimization objective of the cascade reservoirs in this study it occupies vital place as one kind of renewable energy to replace a part of power produced on the basis of fossil fuels as well as to be fed into the power supply system of the china power grid for the sop scheme each reservoir generates hydropower in isolation the annual average power generation of region a and b cascades is 23 06 billion and 101 99 billion kw h respectively total power generation 125 05 billion kw h since the proposed method make it possible to jointly operate the large scale cascade reservoirs the annual average power generation of region a and b would be 23 32 billion kw h and 108 19 billion kw h total power generation 131 51 billion kw h this means that the optimal solution can annually generate 5 17 more hydropower than sop the annual average power generations of the scheduling schemes are shown in fig 8 compared with sop the optimal solution mainly increases 6 20 billion kw h hydropower generation of region b with a little improvement of 0 26 billion kw h power generation of region a relatively little improvement of region a can be owed to all the reservoirs in region a except guanyinyan reservoir start impoundment operation on august 1st according to sop while the optimal solution can only raise water head but not further advance the initial impoundment time in table 1 which makes these reservoirs with small installed capacity increase a little hydropower generation for region b the optimal solution has tried both two strategies to produce much larger hydropower outputs than region a this is because region b not only embraces massive water aggregated from upstream and tributaries to generate hydropower through converting kinetic energy to electricity at high efficiency but also has larger total installed hydropower capacity the installed hydropower capacity of the five reservoirs wdd bht xld xjb and tgr reaches 70 31 gw among which the tgr and bht are the first and second biggest hydropower plants in china 4 4 3 other evaluation indicators considering the complex water energy nexus of cascade reservoirs one should not rely solely on one single criterion li et al 2018 pereira cardenal et al 2014 in addition to hydropower generation the following evaluation indicators are also applied to make a comprehensive assessment annual average water supply and annual average reservoir impoundment efficiency water supply denotes the sum of final excess storage over inactive pool of each reservoir reservoir impoundment efficiency is the ratio of water supply to the whole conservation pool of the system information of each indicator is furthermore referred to zhou et al 2018 fig 9 presents the results of sop the initial solution and the optimal solution in comparison with sop and the initial solution the optimal solution can largely improve water supply by 3376 million m3 year and 2420 million m3 year reservoir impoundment efficiency by 7 76 and 5 40 accordingly it is noticed that in comparison to the sop solution the optimal solution has a little reduction of water supply and reservoir impoundment efficiency in region a but has a tremendous increase in region b regarding these two evaluation indicators it could be inferred based on our proposed methodology that reservoirs with larger flood control capacities e g bht and tgr will have a greater potential for significantly improving the efficiency of water supply and reservoir impoundment efficiency with the pre set initial impoundment timings table 1 we suggest that reservoirs located in the upper zone regions a can implement reservoir impoundment operation earlier while reservoirs located in the lower zone region b could implement reservoir impoundment operation later to synergistically optimize water utilization besides the water supply of bht and tgr is much larger than that of the other reservoirs under similar reservoir impoundment rates 90 99 this could be a consequence of the large reservoir capacities of the two reservoirs where the total reservoir storage capacities are 20 60 billion m3 and 45 07 billion m3 respectively table 1 4 4 4 operational results of typical year to verify the rationality of the optimal solution the tgr is selected as an example according to the historical records two years i e 1980 and 2010 are selected as the wet and dry year respectively fig 10 shows the different impoundment simulation results of the sop and optimal solution it indicates that different impounding policies yield different results of occurrence time and magnitude of outflow peaks in the wet year 1980 the optimal impoundment policy guides the tgr reservoir to raise water level no higher than 165 m at the end of september in order to release more reservoir storage capacity for flood control on the other hand it not only advances the timing of full impounding operation but also keeps the outflow discharge of the tgr below 39900m3 s to ensure downstream safety in the dry year 2010 the tgr is guided to produce considerable hydropower generation with a reasonable and fast impoundment rate it decreases the spillage volume as more floodwater is used in the early stage it raises the water level from 145 m to 175 m top of conservation pool in tgr compared to sop besides the outflow discharge is more than minimum water release to satisfy downstream ecological water use and shipping requirement which demonstrates that the optimal solution also conducts satisfactory results in the dry year 5 conclusion the joint cascade reservoirs operation uses water resources more efficiently and boosts hydropower output however the curse of dimensionality soars as the number of reservoirs increases above three novel techniques are essential to overcome this computational cost and this study has proposed such a methodology to overcome this curse of dimensionality it integrates the merits of parallel dynamic programming pdp importance sampling and successive approximation approach an 11 reservoir system in the upper yangtze river basin of china were selected as a case study to maximize the hydropower generation based on two designed impoundment strategies of advancing impoundment timings and raising water levels the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 after integrating the importance sampling technique into pdp we find that the cardinal number of state vectors in the discrete state space could be effectively reduced which is a core technique to solve the curse of dimensionality is pdp could further improve computational efficiency with more processors enabling decision makers and stakeholders to implement optimal non linear operation instead of sop linear operation 2 the proposed methodology can not only generate 6 46 billion kw h year more hydropower than the sop an improvement of 5 17 but also increase water supply by 3376 million m3 year and reservoir impoundment efficiency by 7 76 reservoirs with large storage capacity in particular can significantly improve their water resources utilization efficiency it can be seen that our exploratory method succeeds in solving the deterministic problem of non convex impoundment operations in an iso framework however it fails to work for a stochastic problem when inflow uncertainty is considered in reality there are several issues that need further research first work remains to improve the reported solutions quality of our is pdp approach which are locally optimal secondly hydrological forecasts with inflow uncertainty should be considered to derive the cascade reservoir rule curves for real time operation finally the curse of dimensionality within the eso framework can be explored using importance sampling or alternative sampling techniques acknowledgements this study is financially supported by the national key research and development project grant no 2016yfc0402206 of china the national

583,the optimal impoundment operation of cascade reservoirs can dramatically improve the utilization of water resources however their complex non convexity and computational costs pose challenges to optimal hydroelectricity output and limit further development of joint operation within larger scale cascade reservoirs in recent decades parallel dynamic programming pdp has emerged as a means of alleviating the curse of dimensionality in the mid long term reservoir operation with more involved computing processors but it still can t effectively solve the daily impoundment operation of more than three reservoirs here we propose a novel method called importance sampling pdp is pdp algorithm in which the merits of pdp are integrated with importance sampling and successive approximation strategy importance sampling is first used to construct the state vectors of each period by introducing manhattan distance in the discrete state space then the pdp recursive equation is used to find an improved solution during the iteration the is pdp method is tested to optimize hydropower output for the joint operation of an 11 reservoir system located in the upper yangtze river basin of china after establishing impoundment operation by advancing impoundment timings and rising water levels we find that our methodology could effectively deal with the curse of dimensionality for such mega reservoir systems and make better use of water resources in comparison to the standard operation policy sop given its computational efficiency and robust convergence the methodology is an attractive alternative for non convex operation of large scale cascade reservoirs keywords joint impoundment operation cascade reservoir curse of dimensionality parallel dynamic programming importance sampling successive approximation 1 introduction with growing attention being paid to suitable economic development in recent decades water related challenges have increased which has led to great stress on water resources management solomatine and shrestha 2009 wu et al 2017 reservoirs as a key part of a water conservancy project are of great importance to regulate water resources through altering natural streamflow across temporal distribution ng et al 2017 uen et al 2018 conventionally a large amount of water should be spilled to secure enough reservoir storage for flood protection during the wet seasons while it is refilled during the following dry seasons to meet the demands guo et al 2004 kim and georgakakos 2014 but both engineering experience and academic researches frequently highlighted the importance of advancing replenishment of reservoir storage that can be further updated to boost utilization benefits for power generation navigation as well as water supply li et al 2018 2014b and the key scientific issue is to deal with the optimal initial impoundment time and impoundment process where the stochastic characteristics of natural streamflow and the occurrence of flooding events are considered wang et al 2014 to overcome this issue a prescribed set of operating rules can be designed to guide the reservoir impoundment operation turner and galelli 2016 wan et al 2016 yeh 1985 zhao et al 2012 researchers have proposed several types of conceptual reservoir impoundment operation rules the new york city rule clark 1956 was firstly introduced to guide reservoir impoundment through probability of spills rather than direct amounts of the physical spill in the pursuit of minimization of expected shortages with the development of computation impoundment operation rule for one reservoir could be derived by the intelligent algorithms and the start of the impounding period can be further developed to the beginning of the post flood season liu et al 2011 recently research focus has been shifted to joint impoundment operation rules of cascade reservoirs the artificial impoundment rules for the multi purpose 3 reservoir model that consisted of a flood control risk analysis module and a utilization benefits analysis module were assessed by zhou et al 2015 a stochastic programming model for 3 reservoir hydropower system which incorporated a joint chance constraint to identify the trade off between flood control risk and operational benefits was used to develop the optimal refill policy xu et al 2017 above mentioned impoundment operation rules of the small scale reservoir system could be easily optimized that offers a great contribution to water resources utilization nevertheless it is almost impossible to derive optimal rule curves to operate cascade reservoirs involving large scale trans basin chang and chang 2006 feng et al 2018a trans province and trans regions issues cheng et al 2012 jurasz and ciapala 2017 major barriers exist in the complex non convexity and high dimensionality of the whole system jurasz and ciapala 2017 where a large number of decision variables are required for modeling joint impoundment operation castelletti et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 for example a hybrid two stage stochastic method li et al 2018 is effective for reservoir impoundment operation by using scenario based forecasts but the computational burden trends a rapid growth celeste and billib 2009 feng et al 2018b galelli and castelletti 2013 the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii coupled with a successive approximation approach zhou et al 2018 can not only provide a large number of impoundment rule curves for the high dimensional and multi objective cascade reservoirs but supply the best solution for each objective whereas it is still considered too time consuming and computationally intensive to be applied in practical engineering giuliani et al 2016 tsai et al 2015 thus it is necessary to explore some competent tools for the derivation of large scale reservoir system operating rules from the universal frameworks of explicit stochastic optimization eso implicit stochastic optimization iso or parameterization simulation optimization pso among the three frameworks eso behaves in an arguably more complex way than iso and pso with another additional state variable inflow to directly describe inflow stochastically celeste and billib 2009 as the most successful method to solve the computational problems of the eso framework stochastic dual dynamic programming sddp presented by pereira and pinto 1991 secures a wide application in hydrothermal scheduling poorsepahy samian et al 2016 in spite of considerable research effort the sddp method does not easily facilitate non convexities pritchard 2015 tilmant and kelman 2007 once non convexities of the large scale reservoir community arise for instance when representing the detailed relationship between power output and water discharge the exact unit commitment of generators sddp will lose its generality non convexities and dimensionality pressure of cascade reservoirs force the iso framework to be the first attempt in this study which formulates deterministic problems for simplicity the reasonable ameliorated orientation in the iso framework can be roughly divided into two categories labadie 2004 modern evolutionary algorithms eas and conventional optimization methods eas are approved to have near global convergence ability and made some achievements in multi objective reservoir problems pan et al 2015 nevertheless large number of iterations and premature convergence make eas still difficult to have immediate applicability to practical engineering issue where large scale and non convex operations are involved cai et al 2018 yang et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 conventional optimization methods such as progressive optimality algorithm poa bai et al 2015 discrete differential dynamic programming dddp feng et al 2017a and dynamic programming successive approximation dpsa turgeon 1981 yi et al 2003 tend to decompose the multi stage sequential structure of optimization problem into stages bellman 1954 and have been proved suitable for a certain number of reservoir management these algorithms also fail to comply with intolerable computational cost once the problem scale expands to a large degree and therefore some improvements based on these conventional optimization methods become a hot research topic with focus on reducing the curse of dimensionality feng et al 2017b ouyang et al 2015 shen et al 2018 as a modified version of dynamic programming method the parallel dynamic programming pdp algorithm implements computer techniques to improve computational efficiency and mitigate the curse of dimensionality to some extent li et al 2014a liu et al 2018 it has been widely used in medium and long term non convex reservoir operation cheng et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 but the standard pdp mechanism will lose its applicability to daily impoundment operation when the number of reservoirs is more than three li et al 2014a it is difficult to traverse all combinations of discrete states of all reservoirs as the number of combinations trends exponentially with the increasing number of reservoirs and discrete states actually many combinations have no need to be traversed because they have violated complex operation constraints of the large scale reservoir community e g hydraulic electricity connections and so on importance sampling is a proper method that can select some small but representative combinations through the introduction of manhattan distance to make a sharp reduction in computational complexity beichl and sullivan 1999 naturally a novel method that integrates the standard pdp with importance sampling and successive approximation is presented in the paper where importance sampling is firstly applied to choose some cross sectional combinations in the state space and then a pdp recursive equation seeks for an improved solution among these representatives while the successive approximation strategy is used to gradually improve the solution quality two main foci are explored in this study 1 coupling the parallel dynamic programming pdp with importance sampling to cope with the curse of dimensionality in the large scale non convex reservoir operation 2 boosting hydropower generation through two preset strategies that advance impoundment operation timing and lift reservoir water level for impoundment reservoirs the rest of the paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the mathematical formulation of cascade reservoirs impoundment operation problem section 3 analyzes the curse of dimensionality in pdp and shows the detailed procedure of the proposed is pdp algorithm section 4 tests the performance of our methodology for large scale cascade reservoirs and then section 5 concludes our findings 2

handling in this study the storage variables vi t are chosen as state variables as well as the total outflow discharge oi t are selected as the corresponding decision variables among above constraints the mass balance equation energy production equation reservoir water level limits and boundary conditions can be easily satisfied when the state variables are defined however water discharge limits hydropower generation limits and water level fluctuation rate may be violated because of some infeasible reservoir storage policies found during iterations to deal with these infeasibilities penalty

operation when applied to address high dimensional cascade reservoir operation the conventional dynamic programming that involved three layered loops will be confronted with huge memory usage and long execution time see procedure i in fig 1 yeh 1985 zhang et al 2015 as a modified dynamic programming method parallel dynamic programming pdp is used to alleviate the dimensionality problem which can be represented as follows 13 f t z t max o t s j o f t z t 1 o t f t 1 z t 1 z t 1 s j z f t z t 1 o t i 1 m n i t z t 1 o t δ t where f t z t is the maximum cumulative return from the first stage to the tth time and there is f 0 0 s j z and s j o denote the discrete state variable set and discrete decision variable set respectively z t is the state vector of the cascade reservoirs at tth time z t z 1 t z 2 t z m t t o t is the decision vector of the cascade reservoirs at tth time o t o 1 t o 2 t o m t t fig 2 illustrates the sketch map of pdp for solving a high dimensional reservoir operation problem for the impoundment operation of cascade reservoirs the state value of each reservoir is fixed at the initial and terminal stage and there is only one state vector composed of the preset water level for each reservoir at other stages the reservoir water level varies in the feasible region and consists of different state combinations the calculation of the state combination is independent of each other i e the calculation of the discrete state combination at a stage is only related to the discrete state combination of the last stage and itself and it also has no effect on the optimization calculation of other state combinations in the stage wu et al 2018 the pdp algorithm skillfully utilizes calculation independence to implement parallel computing in a multi core environment as can be analyzed from fig 2 under the same total amount of calculation time efficiency in the parallel mode is much higher than the conventional serial dp algorithm in fig 1 this is a breakthrough in optimal operation of large scale cascade reservoirs 3 2 a hidden dimension problem in pdp similar to the dynamic programming pdp seeks for the optimal value in the discrete state space composed of all the possible states of each reservoir if f discrete points are assumed in the feasible region of water level the hidden dimension disaster of pdp can be analyzed from two aspects 1 in terms of memory usage two elements should be stored at least for any of the state vector the first is the optimal cumulative return while the second one is the corresponding state vector index at the beginning of this stage thus during the entire scheduling horizon the size of elements is proportional to the total number of state vectors that is fm t 1 2 the space complexity of pdp is about o fmt 2 in terms of the calculations pdp decomposes the original calculation task into several sub tasks which are simultaneously tackled by different involved processors in stage 1 and stage t the number of state vectors at the beginning and end of the stage are 1 and fm respectively the optimal state vector can be found after fm p calculations of each processor where p represents the number of computing processors in other stages with fm state vectors each state vector must choose the best among the fm state vectors at the beginning of this stage which means that f 2 m k calculations of each processor must be done at the same stage if the communication time fraction of each processor is ignored the time complexity of pdp is about o f 2m t p from the above analysis the computational complexity of pdp will grow exponentially with the increase of reservoir number and discrete states li et al 2014a as the number of cascade reservoirs expands to a larger scale pdp still suffers from the serious dimensionality disaster and it is difficult for operators to tolerate the long execution time due to this reason only a few studies involve optimizing the daily impoundment operation of more than three reservoirs li et al 2014a zhou et al 2018 to resolve the curse of dimensionality in pdp the idea of using importance sampling is applied to construct the representative set of discrete state vectors at each period enhancing the performance of pdp without changing its excellent characteristics 3 3 importance sampling as one of the most successful sampling techniques importance sampling was proposed to balance the cost and efficiency of experiments melchers 1989 more details about importance sampling can be found in other reported literature beichl and sullivan 1999 and here s a brief introduction of importance sampling suppose there is a sum f n j 1 n f σ j to be estimated where f is a known function σj belongs to some set of size n where n is very large a simple monte carlo method would be to choose n n samples if any particular σj is equally important then the importance p σj can be represented by 1 n so we can compute j 1 n f σ j n n i e j 1 n f σ j n p σ j to get an estimate of f n however the importance of σj is usually different and importance sampling is to use a non uniform probability p σj to sample a small but representative subset from all the possible level combinations for experimentation which is somehow better than uniform to improve result reliability when n is properly acquired the variance of the estimator can be effectively reduced which can be proved as follows 14 j 1 n f σ j n p σ j σ j f σ j p σ j p σ j f n 3 4 pdp coupled with importance sampling is pdp from the perspective of statistics sampling the comprehensive combination of state variable set at each stage can be viewed as the all possible experiments the objective value is treated as the test index to diagnose the performance of an experiment each reservoir is regarded as one factor with certain influences on the test index the discrete states of the ith reservoir are treated as the levels of the ith factor and one state combination can be seen as an possible experiment feng et al 2017b he et al 2018 then importance sampling can be adopted to decrease the size of state vectors by introducing manhattan distance in the discrete state space here one unit manhattan distance is supposed to be the absolute difference between adjacent levels of the reservoir based on the above analysis the pdp coupled with importance sampling is pdp approach is introduced to alleviate the curse of dimensionality in pdp similar to the classical successive approximation strategy in modified dp variants such as poa and dpsa the is pdp approach divides the whole search space into several disjoint sub spaces and enhances the quality of solution by means of iterative strategy generally it requires an initial trajectory where the states of each reservoir during the scheduling horizon are assigned the initial trajectory obtained by expert judgments or other methods should cater to all the operational constraints imposed on the cascade reservoirs as much as possible in this study the initial trajectory is obtained by progressively optimizing each reservoir from upstream to downstream theoretically the closer state vectors are to the initial state vectors the easier it is to meet a set of strong constraints which includes the hydraulic and electricity connections between high dimensional cascade reservoirs that is to say the smaller manhattan distance value the state vectors have the more important the experiments are to be sampled by calculating the numbers of the different manhattan distance to quantify importance of all state vectors importance sampling can be employed to structure the candidate state vectors in the feasible region at each stage making an obvious reduction in the computational overhead of pdp where it is impossible for the later pdp to calculate all the possible discrete state vectors then pdp resolves the dynamic programming recursive equation in eq 13 to seek for an improved solution pertaining to the current trajectory as the final iteration procedure proceeds the quality of solution will be improved gradually the solution is used to guide the scientific operation of the cascade reservoirs once the terminal conditions are satisfied the is pdp approach with a successive approximation strategy implements the computation framework as follows step 1 designate the basic computing parameters including the number of reservoirs m the number of discrete state values f the number of computing process k and the terminal precision ε step 2 utilize the standard dynamic programming to generate the initial solution in the feasible space fig 3 a which is denoted as z 0 z i t 0 m t then define the corresponding search step array of the cascade reservoirs which is denoted as l 0 l i t 0 m t here z i t 0 and l i t 0 are the initial water level and search step for each reservoir at t stage respectively step 3 based on the number of reservoirs m and discrete state values f implement the importance sampling approach to construct the appropriate state combinations we used eq 15 to construct the discrete state combinations of each stage where the state value of each reservoir in any one of state combination is in the feasible region 15 z i t max min z i t 0 α l i t 0 z i t m a x z i t m i n step 4 use pdp to resolve the dynamic recursion equation in eq 13 for an improved trajectory fig 3b which is denoted as z 1 z i t 1 m t step 5 if z 1 z 0 go to step 6 otherwise set z 0 z 1 and go back to step 3 step 6 if l 0 ε go to step 7 otherwise set l 0 a l 0 and go back to step 3 where a is the scaling factor used to control the search step and is set to be 0 5 in this case step 7 after terminating the iteration the current trajectory z 1 is exported as the final optimal solution fig 3c in order to intuitively illustrate the difference between the pdp and is pdp approaches fig 4 takes an example with 2 reservoir and 5 levels per reservoir at each stage pdp using the complete factorial experiment has 5 5 25 state combinations but is pdp only needs 6 state combinations as can be seen from fig 4 is pdp starts with the initial trajectory while the manhattan distance to the initial trajectory has five different values 0 4 the corresponding number of these values is 1 4 8 8 and 4 the sum is 25 respectively and the number extracted by expert judgment could be 1 2 1 1 and 1 the sum is 6 respectively szirmay kalos and szecsi 2009 obviously is pdp can obtain adequate information on the experiment problem with a small cost improving work efficiency in practical engineering glynn and iglehart 1989 stordal and elsheikh 2015 its superior performance will be more prominent with the expansion of problem scale 4 results and discussion 4 1 mega cascade reservoirs description the yangtze river the longest river in china has a main stream length of 6300 km with a total drainage area of 1 8 million km2 the river owns huge vertical water head and abundant hydropower resources in recent decades a set of dams have been constructed along the yangtze river for multiple purposes including flood control hydropower production water supply navigation and so on among these 11 cascade reservoirs fig 5 serve as the largest hydroelectric project to date and we selected it as our case study the task of optimal impoundment operation for the entire 11 cascade reservoirs is to fill up the reservoir storages during the impoundment period such that hydropower generation is maximized while other objectives are treated as constraints the daily recorded flow data series from august 1st october 31st 92 days spanning over sixty years 1951 2014 for these reservoirs and neighboring hydrological gauging stations are provided by the yangtze river commission the basic information of these reservoirs is listed in table 1 the designed operation rules i e standard operation policy sop of these reservoirs suggest that the reservoir storage level should be linearly raised from the annual top of buffer pool at the impoundment starting time to the top of conservation pool at the end of flood seasons in fig 3c the impoundment operation period of the cascade reservoirs should be implemented between august 1st and october 31st according to geological distributions of reservoirs along the yangtze river wang et al 2014 generally the upstream reservoir should impound water earlier than the downstream reservoirs except guan yin yan gyy reservoir located at the midstream jinsha river which requires to impound later for the purpose of ensuring flood prevention safety at downstream in consideration of joint impoundment operation of cascade reservoirs two operational strategies i e earlier initial impoundment time and higher water levels water head for hydropower generation could be applied after cross examining the climatic and hydrological data of this study area see table 1 these two strategies will pave the way for boosting hydropower output simultaneously meanwhile seasonal top of buffer pools seasonal tbp in table 2 are designed to limit the maximum allowable storage at different stages of the impoundment period which could guide excess outflow discharge to be released downstream for the safety of the levee seasonal tbp and sop construct the upper and lower bound of the search scope respectively 4 2 comparison of the is pdp and pdp algorithms in order to verify algorithmic performance the results of is pdp with different numbers of reservoirs and discrete state vectors are compared with the effective pdp method respectively 4 2 1 performance of algorithms with different reservoirs in this case is pdp is systematically compared with pdp when both are applied to the impoundment operation with a different number of reservoirs including a 2 reseroivr ly ah and a 3 reservoir ly ah jaq system the number of discrete state values for each reservoir is set to be 30 and the number of computing cores is 16 consequently the numbers of state vectors for the 2 reservoir and 3 reservoir system are 302 and 303 in the pdp approach respectively and is pdp employs importance sampling technique to reduce the number of state vectors to 9 for the 2 reservoir system and 27 for the 3 reservoir system table 3 shows the average generation and computing time of these two different algorithms it can be found from table 3 that the computing time of the 3 reservoir system is intolerable even if it can obtain the optimal solution as the number of reservoir continuously expands the curse of dimensionality makes it impossible to effectively solve the optimal operation however is pdp demonstrates its effectiveness in different sized cascade reservoirs the hydropower generation of is pdp is close to the optimal value but it takes far less computation time than that of pdp it proves the feasibility of importance sampling in reducing discrete state vectors it can be concluded that when solving large scale hydropower operation problem the number of cascade reservoirs is more than three the traditional pdp approach cannot meet the practical requirement from dispatching department while is pdp provides a new possibility to alleviate the curse of dimensionality 4 2 2 performance of algorithms with different discrete state vectors several cases with different discrete state vectors in the 3 reservoir system ly ah jaq are designed to compare the performance of is pdp and pdp fig 6 draws the detailed result with respect to power generation and computing time it can be seen that is pdp with 2 discrete state vectors provides less generation due to the smaller search space the search ability can be effectively strengthened and the gross generation gradually converges to the best solution of pdp with the increasing number of discrete state vectors on the other hand discrete states increase from 2 to 100 and time increases from 108 to 1001s it is owed that a larger number of discretized states makes a larger search space which results in the better solution but simultaneously spends more time on the computation of decision combinations in practical engineering the number of discrete states should be larger to procure a better solution meanwhile it is required to be smaller for the convergence speed of algorithm a number of discretization should be set properly to achieve a balance between search efficiency and solution quality 4 3 comparison with two representative optimization algorithms to explore the necessity of our proposed approach the most applied poa a kind of conventional optimization methods and genetic algorithm ga a kind of eas are also selected to optimize the multi reservoir system and compared to is pdp where the number of computing cores and state vectors of is pdp still remains 16 and 27 respectively the experimental setup of ga is described in table 4 the results in table 5 present the optimization ability of the three different algorithms poa can optimize impoundment operation of no more than 6 reservoirs in comparison to is pdp it spends more time but has inferior solution of the 6 reservoir system located in the midstream jin sha river it will trouble in the curse of dimensionality with endless running time in our case study of an 11 reservoir system ga can accomplish the computation task of an 11 reservoir system in a limited time but has poor optimization performance the optimal solution of ga not only highly relies on many feasible initial solutions but has almost no change with initial solutions in a limited 1000 iterations which illustrates that ga easily falls into local optimum when it solves the large scale complex and non linear impoundment operation with so many constraints and 64 768 decision variables 11 reservoirs 64 years 92 days what s more ga spends plenty of time more than 7 h to produce and calculate lots of infeasible solutions which is also intolerable in practical engineering the details of the 11 reservoir system optimized by our is pdp method are illustrated in the next section 4 4 4 4 application to the 11 reservoir system is pdp is such a proper method that it can select some small but representative combinations through the introduction of manhattan distance to make a sharp reduction of combinations from 3011 to 100 on the one hand it is almost impossible for the existing methods to traverse all combinations for 11 reservoirs on the other hand a lot of combinations do not have to be traversed because they violate complex operation constraints of the large scale reservoir community e g hydraulic electricity connections and so on and with the help of the initial trajectory obtained by progressively optimizing reservoirs from upstream to downstream the successive approximation strategy is pdp adopts can gradually improve the optimal solution quality in order to verify the practicability of the proposed method the results of the 11 reservoir system solved by is pdp are still analyzed from two aspects computational efficiency and optimization result for hydropower generation 4 4 1 computational efficiency the parallel computing can greatly shorten the run time and improve the computational efficiency zhang et al 2015 generally the more processors are involved the more efficient the algorithm is the run time of one iteration in parallel program tp parallel acceleration ratio sp and parallel efficiency ep piccardi and soncinisessa 1991 are introduced as three main evaluation indices for parallel algorithm performance sp is equal to ratio of the run time of a serial application on a processor ts to tp denoting the degree of run time reduction from serial calculation mode to parallel calculation mode ep is equal to ratio of sp to the number of processors p evaluating the effective utilization degree of a processor s computing ability table 6 shows the statistical index in several different trials by varying the numbers of the processors besides the results calculated by one processor i e serial model are also introduced for comparison as can be seen from table 6 one iteration for serial model takes 978 43 s time cost significantly decreases with more processors due to the lessened amounts of task assigned to each processor it only takes 115 65 s when computational processors are up to 16 and the value of sp is trending rise it can be inferred that computational efficiency will be further improved with more processors which makes possible for water resources managers possible to take rational actions in time however the parallel efficiency value ep ranging from 0 to 1 becomes smaller with more computational processors it dues to that when the number of processors is small 50 the workload imbalance is significant because various numbers of unfeasible solutions assigned to each processor will be discarded and these fast processors must wait until the slowest processor finishes its task at the same stage li et al 2014a fig 7 draws the convergence curves of the proposed method in the typical year of 2002 with different processors where all start from the same initial solution obtained by expert knowledge it can be seen that different scenarios have similar iteration numbers convergence curves and final optimization objective fig 7 and table 6 illustrate that different numbers of the processors can not only improve computational efficiency of iteration but also has no effect on iteration numbers or optimization results the convergence curves have two obvious steep increase procedure with one at the beginning the search mechanism quickly finds the better solution in the neighborhood of the initial trajectory as the iterations proceed the optimized results only have slight increasing disturbances another one occurs at the intermediate iteration procedure where search step changes finally the proposed method can converge to a satisfactory outcome at the cost of extra iterations the final objective values in these scenarios are almost same it indicates that although importance sampling technique generates different random combinations in each experiment it can ultimately converge to the optimal solution in other words a large quantity of state vectors is not required because importance sampling can select valuable ones 4 4 2 optimal result for hydropower generation hydropower generation is the only optimization objective of the cascade reservoirs in this study it occupies vital place as one kind of renewable energy to replace a part of power produced on the basis of fossil fuels as well as to be fed into the power supply system of the china power grid for the sop scheme each reservoir generates hydropower in isolation the annual average power generation of region a and b cascades is 23 06 billion and 101 99 billion kw h respectively total power generation 125 05 billion kw h since the proposed method make it possible to jointly operate the large scale cascade reservoirs the annual average power generation of region a and b would be 23 32 billion kw h and 108 19 billion kw h total power generation 131 51 billion kw h this means that the optimal solution can annually generate 5 17 more hydropower than sop the annual average power generations of the scheduling schemes are shown in fig 8 compared with sop the optimal solution mainly increases 6 20 billion kw h hydropower generation of region b with a little improvement of 0 26 billion kw h power generation of region a relatively little improvement of region a can be owed to all the reservoirs in region a except guanyinyan reservoir start impoundment operation on august 1st according to sop while the optimal solution can only raise water head but not further advance the initial impoundment time in table 1 which makes these reservoirs with small installed capacity increase a little hydropower generation for region b the optimal solution has tried both two strategies to produce much larger hydropower outputs than region a this is because region b not only embraces massive water aggregated from upstream and tributaries to generate hydropower through converting kinetic energy to electricity at high efficiency but also has larger total installed hydropower capacity the installed hydropower capacity of the five reservoirs wdd bht xld xjb and tgr reaches 70 31 gw among which the tgr and bht are the first and second biggest hydropower plants in china 4 4 3 other evaluation indicators considering the complex water energy nexus of cascade reservoirs one should not rely solely on one single criterion li et al 2018 pereira cardenal et al 2014 in addition to hydropower generation the following evaluation indicators are also applied to make a comprehensive assessment annual average water supply and annual average reservoir impoundment efficiency water supply denotes the sum of final excess storage over inactive pool of each reservoir reservoir impoundment efficiency is the ratio of water supply to the whole conservation pool of the system information of each indicator is furthermore referred to zhou et al 2018 fig 9 presents the results of sop the initial solution and the optimal solution in comparison with sop and the initial solution the optimal solution can largely improve water supply by 3376 million m3 year and 2420 million m3 year reservoir impoundment efficiency by 7 76 and 5 40 accordingly it is noticed that in comparison to the sop solution the optimal solution has a little reduction of water supply and reservoir impoundment efficiency in region a but has a tremendous increase in region b regarding these two evaluation indicators it could be inferred based on our proposed methodology that reservoirs with larger flood control capacities e g bht and tgr will have a greater potential for significantly improving the efficiency of water supply and reservoir impoundment efficiency with the pre set initial impoundment timings table 1 we suggest that reservoirs located in the upper zone regions a can implement reservoir impoundment operation earlier while reservoirs located in the lower zone region b could implement reservoir impoundment operation later to synergistically optimize water utilization besides the water supply of bht and tgr is much larger than that of the other reservoirs under similar reservoir impoundment rates 90 99 this could be a consequence of the large reservoir capacities of the two reservoirs where the total reservoir storage capacities are 20 60 billion m3 and 45 07 billion m3 respectively table 1 4 4 4 operational results of typical year to verify the rationality of the optimal solution the tgr is selected as an example according to the historical records two years i e 1980 and 2010 are selected as the wet and dry year respectively fig 10 shows the different impoundment simulation results of the sop and optimal solution it indicates that different impounding policies yield different results of occurrence time and magnitude of outflow peaks in the wet year 1980 the optimal impoundment policy guides the tgr reservoir to raise water level no higher than 165 m at the end of september in order to release more reservoir storage capacity for flood control on the other hand it not only advances the timing of full impounding operation but also keeps the outflow discharge of the tgr below 39900m3 s to ensure downstream safety in the dry year 2010 the tgr is guided to produce considerable hydropower generation with a reasonable and fast impoundment rate it decreases the spillage volume as more floodwater is used in the early stage it raises the water level from 145 m to 175 m top of conservation pool in tgr compared to sop besides the outflow discharge is more than minimum water release to satisfy downstream ecological water use and shipping requirement which demonstrates that the optimal solution also conducts satisfactory results in the dry year 5 conclusion the joint cascade reservoirs operation uses water resources more efficiently and boosts hydropower output however the curse of dimensionality soars as the number of reservoirs increases above three novel techniques are essential to overcome this computational cost and this study has proposed such a methodology to overcome this curse of dimensionality it integrates the merits of parallel dynamic programming pdp importance sampling and successive approximation approach an 11 reservoir system in the upper yangtze river basin of china were selected as a case study to maximize the hydropower generation based on two designed impoundment strategies of advancing impoundment timings and raising water levels the main conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 after integrating the importance sampling technique into pdp we find that the cardinal number of state vectors in the discrete state space could be effectively reduced which is a core technique to solve the curse of dimensionality is pdp could further improve computational efficiency with more processors enabling decision makers and stakeholders to implement optimal non linear operation instead of sop linear operation 2 the proposed methodology can not only generate 6 46 billion kw h year more hydropower than the sop an improvement of 5 17 but also increase water supply by 3376 million m3 year and reservoir impoundment efficiency by 7 76 reservoirs with large storage capacity in particular can significantly improve their water resources utilization efficiency it can be seen that our exploratory method succeeds in solving the deterministic problem of non convex impoundment operations in an iso framework however it fails to work for a stochastic problem when inflow uncertainty is considered in reality there are several issues that need further research first work remains to improve the reported solutions quality of our is pdp approach which are locally optimal secondly hydrological forecasts with inflow uncertainty should be considered to derive the cascade reservoir rule curves for real time operation finally the curse of dimensionality within the eso framework can be explored using importance sampling or alternative sampling techniques acknowledgements this study is financially supported by the national key research and development project grant no 2016yfc0402206 of china the national

584,highly seasonal water supplies from the himalayan watersheds of jhelum kabul and upper indus basin uib are critical for managing the world s largest contiguous irrigation system of the indus basin and its dependent agrarian economy of pakistan here we assess changes in the contrasting hydrological regimes of these himalayan watersheds and subsequent water availability under the paris agreement 2015 targets that aim of limiting the mean global warming to 1 5 c plus1 5 and further well below 2 0 c plus2 0 relative to pre industrial level for this calibrated semi distributed hydrological model setups of the university of british columbia are coupled with the 80 member ensemble experiments of plus1 5 and plus2 0 performed under the half a degree additional warming projections prognosis and impacts happi framework our results suggest that during october to february happi ensembles project a median warming of up to 1 c under plus1 5 and of more than 1 5ºc under plus2 0 relative to the historical period 2006 2015 such warming is generally higher in daily minimum than daily maximum temperature and over high altitudes both scenarios project drying of the monsoon july september and the main snowpack accumulation melt seasons march june results of hydrological modeling suggest significant changes in the timings of contrasting hydrological regimes that collectively reflect on changes in the overall hydrology of the himalayan watersheds median changes generally indicate strengthening of the nival and glacial regimes for all basins under plus1 5 except for the nival regime of the jhelum basin whereas such changes are more pronounced under plus2 0 subsequently annual water availability from three himalayan watersheds will increase by 34 and 43 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively these findings provide an overall picture of the surface water availability in pakistan under the aspirations of the paris agreement 2015 and can inform on policy decisions together with the country s first ever national water policy approved recently keywords water availability paris agreement himalayan watersheds uib jhelum kabul 1 introduction alterations in the global hydrological cycle that are induced by anthropogenic climate change are anticipated to be adverse over the climate change hotspot of the south asia and for its high altitude headwaters within the hindukush karakoram himalayan hkh massifs de souza et al 2015 these alterations are particularly severe for those himalayan watersheds that are situated at the margins of distinct precipitation regimes and feature critical importance of their melt dominated hydrology to the drier mostly irrigated agricultural economy downstream bokhari et al 2018 masood et al 2018 such watersheds are the jhelum kabul and upper indus basin uib within the indus basin fig 1 not only the water budgets are projected to deplete for these watersheds throughout the century but also future warming and its elevation dependence indicating intense warming over high altitudes pose unprecedentedly increasing pressures on their frozen freshwater reservoirs hasson et al 2018 hence the assessment of changes in the water supplies from jhelum kabul and uib that collectively contribute around 80 of the total surface water available in pakistan is vital for adequate management and adaptation ali et al 2009 a number of studies have assessed the future water availability from the jhelum kabul and uib for instance lutz et al 2016 have reported highly uncertain future of the water availability shifts in its timings and rise in intensity and frequency of hydrological extremes for the upper indus based on cryosphere hydrological model forced with statistically downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 experiments for the representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 employing a positive degree day temperature index approach koppes et al 2015 have assessed the sensitivity of only the annual glacier melt water from the upper indus to seven reanalysis datasets they have reported a substantial spread in the annual glacier melt and its projected increase by more than 200 under hypothetical temperature increase of 2 4 c assuming it uniform across time and space ali et al 2015 have assessed the future flows from the upper indus employing an energy balance semi distributed model forced with the dynamically downscaled rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios and reported up to 87 increase in the water availability by the end of the 21st century using same watershed model hasson 2016b have assessed the future water availability from the uib under both the dynamically downscaled rcp8 5 scenario and the so called relevant near future hypothetical scenario that suggests distinct intra annual changes depending on the historical trends unlike a uniform increase he reported the water availability from the uib ranging from 10 decrease in near future under hypothetical scenario to up to 220 increase under rcp8 5 by the end of the 21st century nevertheless the above mentioned and other studies project the future water availability from the upper indus either under the downscaled rcp scenarios or under hypothetically assumed physically inconsistent climatic changes under the paris agreement 2015 the signatory countries have agreed upon holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 c above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c unfccc 2015 this garnered a great response from the impact assessment communities to assess the impacts of 1 5 c and 2 0 c increase above the pre industrial 1861 1880 levels on various sectors including water döll et al 2018 since the melt dominated hydrological regimes of the himalayan watersheds are directly sensitive to the warming it is important to assess their future nourishments and subsequent water supplies against discrete temperature increases ali et al 2018 however the multi model responses to a particular emission or radiative forcing scenario simulated under the cmip3 5 frameworks meehl and arblaster 2003 taylor et al 2012 are markedly different and feature enormous uncertainty in their suggested timings of when a certain level of temperature change will be achieved mitchell et al 2016 on the other hand hypothetical scenarios are either physically inconsistent as these are typically devised perturbing climatic variables arbitrarily and uniformly across spatio temporal scales or due to the fact that the magnitude of change over the himalayan watersheds will be different than that of on the global scale filling this gap under the half a degree additional warming projections prognosis and impacts happi framework a dedicated set of experiments has been designed as per the aspirations of the paris agreement to achieve 1 5 c and 2 0 c discrete global average temperature increases above the pre industrial level irrespective of the emission scenario mitchell et al 2017 the 1 5 c and 2 c global temperature increases relative to the pre industrial era refer to around 0 7 c and 1 2 c warmer conditions than that of the historical period of 2006 2015 respectively half a degree additional warming refers to additional warming in 2 c scenario as compared to 1 5 c scenario the happi experiments provide a great opportunity to drive the impact assessment models against discrete levels of mean global warming of 1 5ºc and 2ºc above the pre industrial level against this background this study assesses changes in the hydrological regimes and the subsequent water availability from three critically important himalayan watersheds namely jhelum kabul and uib specifically under the paris agreement 2005 targets of 1 5 c and 2 0 c warmer worlds than the pre industrial level for this a calibrated energy balance hydrological model of the university of british columbia ubc has been forced with the happi experiments encompassing 80 ensemble members simulated by four different climate models the results will provide a comprehensive look on the future surface water availability in pakistan under the aspirations of the paris agreement and can inform on policy decision together with the country s first ever national water policy approved recently 2 study area the study area comprises three himalayan watersheds namely jhelum kabul and uib which are unique in terms of their geophysical characteristics hydroclimatology and downstream importance of their water supplies fig 1 all three basins are transboundary sharing borders with afghanistan in the west china in the north and india in the east the jhelum lays at the most western edge of the himalaya kabul lies within the hindukush while the uib abodes mostly the karakoram massif all draining into the indus river in pakistan these basins are geographically positioned at the extreme margins of the south asian summer monsoon sasm system which travelling along the himalayan arc brings rain snow at lower higher altitudes markedly over the jhelum basin followed by kabul and the western uib hasson et al 2018 forming a clear east to west gradient sasm becomes weaker northwestward and prevails only for a shorter period of july september as compared to june september over india hasson et al 2018 the behavior of sasm at its extreme margins over the study watersheds is very erratic mainly owing to the region specific local forcing such as complex hkh terrain highly concentrated cryosphere and vastly irrigated plains local forcing play a significant role in modulating the strengths of sasm and of its precipitation regime adding to their natural variability chakraborty et al 2006 saeed et al 2009 boos and hurley 2013 such modulation subsequently can trigger flood or drought conditions over the study basins resulting into excess or shortage of water in pakistan during the rest of the year water supplies are mainly generated from melting of existing cryosphere apr aug which is nourished dominantly by spring followed by winter season solid moisture input from intermittent but year round western disturbances at their far eastern extremity wake 1989 hasson 2016a the north atlantic oscillation nao controls the strength and direction of prevailing western disturbances resulting into above below normal moisture supplies during the positive negative phase syed et al 2006 hence the topo climate of the study basins is influenced by distinct modes of large scale circulations at their extreme margins their interactions and their modulation by complex hkh terrain and region specific features subsequently the timings and the form of moisture received from prevailing precipitation regimes define the assorted hydrological regimes of the study basins the mountainous hydrological regimes feature high low flows during april september october march period and can be categorized either as mountain nival or mountain glacial krasovskaia 1994 based on the extent of glacier cover the timings of peak discharge and its correlation with different climatic variables according to such categorization jhelum and kabul basins are mainly snow fed while uib is mainly glacier fed archer 2003 mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 hasson et al 2014 hasson et al 2017 the long term mean annual discharges from the jhelum kabul and uib account to 810 850 and 2405 m3 s 1 which collectively contribute around 80 to the annual surface water availability in pakistan hasson et al 2018 such marked contribution from these watersheds is critical for ensuring sustainable water supplies to the mostly irrigated agriculture in pakistan and in turn for the socio economic well being of its burgeoning population qaisrani et al 2018 batool and saeed 2018 therefore future assessment of changes in the water supplies from the study basins is vital for the adequate management and adaptation 3 data and methods 3 1 date used future climate experiments limiting the global average temperature increase to 1 5 c and 2 0 c are obtained from the happi framework mitchell et al 2017 employing atmosphere only global climate models gcms happi experiments are performed for three time slices one for the historical period all hist 2006 2015 that represents the present day conditions while two for the hypothetical future period 2106 2115 each projecting 1 5 c plus1 5 and 2 0 c plus2 0 global average temperature increases above the pre industrial level supp table 5 all hist experiments consider the present day anthropogenic and natural forcing including the co2 concentration from 381 ppm to 403 ppm as observed over the 2006 2015 decade saeed et al 2018a for plus1 5 future scenario 2106 2115 constant radiative forcing as of the rcp2 6 have been used the all hist sea surface temperature is perturbed by the cmip5 multimodel mean for the rcp2 6 scenario and the co2 concentration is kept constant at 423 4 ppm for plus2 0 future scenario a linear combination of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 experiments is used to estimate the sea surface temperature and the co2 concentration where the latter is kept constant at 486 6 ppm non co2 greenhouse gases ozone and aerosol forcing are identical for both plus1 5 and plus2 0 mitchell et al 2017 in the present analysis we have obtained daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation from a set of 80 happi experiments consisting of 20 realizations from each of four gcms echam6 miroc5 cam4 2degree and noresm1 for all hist plus1 5 and plus2 0 warmer world scenarios saeed et al 2018b the observed meteorological and hydrological data for the calibration and validation of the ubc model were obtained from the pakistan meteorological department pmd and the water and power development authority wapda in pakistan table 1 the geophysical description of the watershed is based on freely available datasets elevation zones and their mid elevation were derived from the onc arc second global digital elevation model of the shuttle radar topographic mission forest cover and its canopy density for the himalayan watersheds are obtained from the united nations environment programme unep environmental data explorer as compiled form usgs nasa unep 2015 glacier coverage is taken from the randolf glacier inventory version 6 0 rgi6 rgi consortium 2017 the debris covered glacier area is estimated from the global dataset of scherler et al 2018 3 2 methods 3 2 1 hydrological model setup the study employs a semi distributed energy balance hydrological model of the university of british columbia ubc quick and pipes 1976 which is capable of simulating the nival glacial and pluvial runoff regimes on hourly to daily time scales requiring minimum hydrometeorological input considering the basin as a set of altitudinal zones ubc allows the formation of basin wide altitudinal barriers and the station wise correction factors for vertical and horizontal distribution of precipitation across the basin while temperatures are distributed using adequate lapse rates to melt snowpack and glaciers the model incorporates a comprehensive snowmelt routine for which requisite parameters are already tuned for the hkh environment pipes and quick 1987 the soil moisture routine apportions the generated runoff into surface sub surface shallow groundwater and deep zone groundwater which are routed to the watershed outlet using water conserved linear reservoir approach the schematic diagram of the ubc model is shown in fig 2 a the comprehensive details on snow melt routine distribution of meteorological parameters and soil moisture routine are already described in hasson 2016b loukas et al 2002 and loukas and vasiliades 2014 respectively to determine the hydrological response of the study basins under warmer worlds the ubc watershed model was setup using the best available physiogeographical watershed characteristics and the high altitude stations observations most representative of the himalayan topoclimate in combination with suitable valley floor observations to better account for the rainfall runoff dynamics the details of the altitudinal zones and their physiogeographical characteristics for each basin are given in the supplementary table 1 the details of the hydrometeorological observations used for the calibration and validation of the ubc models are listed in the table 1 the plausible ranges default values and the calibrated values of the most sensitive parameters of the ubc model parameters are listed in the table 2 the ubc model setups for the jhelum kabul and uib have been tuned over the 1994 2004 period considering its second half as a calibration 1999 2004 and first half 1994 1999 as a validation period for the robust evaluation of the ubc model performance on daily time scale multiple efficiency criteria krause et al 2005 have been used that include the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 volumetric efficiency percentage ve mean error me coefficient of determination d and root mean square error rmse since nse features a non linear relationship with the model performance it has been carefully interpreted based on four subjectively established classes by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 that range between the lower acceptable limit of nse 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 and its perfect fit of nse 1 0 nash and sutcliffe 1970 these subjective classes include unsatisfactory nse 0 65 acceptable nse 0 65 0 7999 good nse 0 800 0 899 and very good nse 0 900 1 000 the model performance was found very good for mainly the glacier fed uib followed by jhelum and kabul basins in terms of nse ve and d which largely remain between 0 8 and 0 9 for all the periods and study basins table 2 and fig 2b the me and rmse are generally higher for the calibration period as compared to the validation period however such statistics are very robust as the intentionally chosen calibration period observes a severe drought over the study basins during 1999 2003 the calibration during such dry period has minimized the risk of equifinality which typically arises from anomalous compensation between the snow and glacier melts in case of mixed hydrological regime as of the study basins overall the model efficiency statistics suggest that the ubc model successfully reproduces the hydrological behavior of the himalayan basins up to higher degree of satisfaction changes in the cryospheric extent are anticipated under the warmer climates which are required to be assimilated in the modeling process while assessing the future water availability unlike the reports of a balanced state of the karakoram cryospheric since 1970 significant negative changes are reported for the glacial mass and extent for the western himalaya and hindu kush ranges scherler et al 2011 bhambri et al 2013 minora et al 2013 hasson et al 2014 rankl et al 2014 rankl and braun 2016 bolch et al 2012 and 2017 further cryospheric changes may occur in future under warmer conditions and wetter drier precipitation regimes assessing the impacts of 1 5 c warming over the hkh glaciers based on rcp2 6 scenario kraaijenbrink et al 2017 have reported the glacier area loss of up to 27 for the karakoram range 83 7 area remaining and the glacier area loss of up to 56 for both the hindu kush 52 8 area remaining and the western himalaya 57 13 area remaining by the end of the 21st century since these estimates for the 1 5 c scenario are subject to single and simplest glacier mass balance model forced with the rcp based climate simulations and assuming a constant degree day factor on regional scale we assumed range of hypothetical scenarios in order to provide the assessment of water availability under a full spectrum of glacier area changes the assumed glacier scenarios include intact glacier 75 50 25 and 0 glacier referring to 0 25 50 75 and 100 glacier area loss by the end of the 21st century respectively as the jhelum and kabul basins encompass the hindu kush and the western himalayan ranges the scenario of 50 glacier area loss for these basins is consistent with the estimates of kraaijenbrink et al 2017 for the western himalaya and hindukush ranges on the other hand the uib mainly encompasses the karakoram range thus the scenario of 25 glacier area loss for the uib also seems in line with the projections of kraaijenbrink et al 2017 further 25 and 50 glacier area reduction for the uib and kabul basins is consistent with the rates of glacier area loss of 0 28 and 0 47 a 1 for the karakoram and hindukush ranges and 75 and 100 glacier area reduction for the jhelum basin is consistent with the rates of glacier area loss of 0 67 a 1 and 0 91 a 1 for the western himalayas as projected by zhao et al 2014 using calibrated and uncalibrated model respectively till 2050 under a1b scenario in view of these projected glacier area losses we assume 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier area losses for both kabul and jhelum basins as a plausible scenario 3 2 2 climate change scenarios to present future climate changes 80 happi experiments for all hist 2006 2015 plus1 5 2106 2115 and plus2 0 2106 2115 time slices were re gridded to a 0 5º x 0 5 regular grid future changes in the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation from both plus1 5 and plus2 0 were calculated for their each ensemble member as its difference with the corresponding ensemble member from all hist median of the change ensemble was presented on intra annual and annual scales for intra annual changes three seasons of october to february ondjf march to june mamj and july to september jas were objectively considered the ondjf and mamj refer to the snowpack accumulation season when the westerly precipitation regime dominates while jas corresponds to the monsoonal precipitation regime over the study watersheds moreover mamj spans over mainly the snowmelt season while jas spans over the glacier melt season both corresponding to the high flow period owing to the structural limitations in representing the region specific features and their related physical processes gcms systematically deviate from the reality this is consistent among cmip3 cmip5 and their downscaled invariants that feature substantial cold and wet biases over the himalayan watersheds hasson et al 2018 such bias from the happi experiments was adjusted against nine stations that are used to calibrate the ubc model using a sophisticated non parametric technique of the empirical quantile mapping eqm gudmundsson et al 2012 guo et al 2018 the eqm corrects each quantile of the modeled distribution of any climatic variable x so that it matches the observed distribution of the same variable based upon their empirical cumulative distributions cdfs foh for the local observed and fmh for the modeled data during historical period and a transfer function t 0 1 0 1 such that 1 t f m h x f o h x the local future cdf fof is approximated by applying t to the cdf of the modeled data for the future period fmf by replacing x in eq 1 with f m h 1 u where u fmh x and belongs to 0 1 2 t u f o h f m h 1 u assuming such transformation holds for the future the local future cdf is obtained as 3 f o f x f o h f m h 1 f m f x the ubc model was run for each ensemble member of the bias adjusted plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios the results are presented in terms of median annual cycles along with their ensemble spreads together with historically simulated discharges for each study watershed in order to assess delicate changes in the timings of the water availability to assess changes in the nival glacial and pluvial runoff regimes discharge contributions from the major hydrological components are separately calculated on seasonal and annual scale under plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios 4 results and discussions median ensemble changes in the seasonal and annual mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures and total precipitation are presented for both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios in figs 3 5 respectively to assess delicate impacts of plus1 5 and plus2 0 warming on the nival glacial and pluvial runoff regimes and in the timings of their runoff contributions the annual cycles of the spreads and medians of 80 member ensemble together with the ubc simulated historical discharges 1994 2004 for each hydrological component are presented in figs 6 8 for jhelum kabul and uib respectively the effect of glacier area loss as assumed in five different scenarios on the glacier melt runoff and on the overall hydrological regime of the study watershed is presented in fig 9 median discharge changes are presented as the percentage of the historical discharges on seasonal and annual time scale in tables 4 6 for the jhelum kabul and uib respectively likewise absolute discharge values of the ensemble median maximum and minimum are summarized on seasonal and annual time scales in the supplementary tables 2 4 for each study basin 4 1 climate changes under plus1 5 and plus2 0 fig 3 shows that changes in maximum temperature are higher in plus2 0 reaching above 1 5 c as compared to plus1 5 where warming mostly remains below 1 c exceptions are the monsoon dominated plains and the eastern uib in plus2 0 highest increase in maximum temperature is projected for winter months of ondjf over almost the whole study area during monsoon season and on annual timescale warming is higher over the high altitudes mostly the cryospheric region as compared to the lower plains such elevation dependent warming has been consistently reported by pepin et al 2015 based on station observations by hasson et al 2016a based on gridded observations and reanalysis datasets and by kaaijenbrink et al 2017 and palazzi et al 2017 from the cmip5 based rcp scenarios higher increase in the daytime temperatures over high altitude cryospheric region indicates twofold effect on the regional hydrology 1 transition of the incident solid moisture received from the monsoon or western disturbances into liquid 2 increased melting of snow and glaciers pattern of projected changes in daily minimum temperature is different relative to daily maximum temperature fig 4 the highest increase in minimum temperature is projected for ondjf and over the high altitudes relative to plains which is more than 1 c and 2ºc for plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively for the rest of seasons and on annual scale plus1 5 features a warming of around 0 5 c in contrast warming is higher in plus2 0 and the elevation dependent pattern is apparent almost for all seasons highest increase in minimum temperature is projected over the himalayan watersheds during ondjf that approaches above 2 c particularly over the highly glaciated sub basin of the uib such as shigar and shyok during mamj plus2 0 nighttime warming is above 1 5 c over parts of shyok sub basin and during jas over gilgit hunza and shigar sub basins the annual scale changes dominated by changes during ondjf reach above 1 5 c over the uib and upper kabul basins overall difference in the projected warming between high altitudes and lower plains is around 0 5 c whenever the projected median change was higher than 1 c fig 5 shows ensemble median precipitation increase of up to 1 mm day 1 over the kabul and jhelum basins and along the western himalayas during ondjf where such an increase is relatively small over the plains under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 major part of the uib do not feature any change in the incident precipitation under both warmer world scenarios precipitation change pattern are quite different for the only accumulation season of ondjf as compared to mamj which is mainly the season of snowpack accumulation as well as its melt under plus1 5 mamj precipitation will decrease by 0 2 mm day 1 over plains and lower parts of the study watersheds whereas such decrease over their upper parts is almost negligible as compared to plus1 5 projected decrease in mamj precipitation is not that marked over plains whereas it will increase over the kabul and jhelum basins by up to 0 2 mm day 1 it is to note that positive and negative changes in precipitation along with relatively intense warming over high altitudes may not only affect the melt runoff contribution but will change the distinct hydrological regimes hence the timings of their contribution projections of wetter ondjf but drier mamj are consistent with the reports from the cmip5 based rcp8 5 experiments hasson et al 2016b these changes further indicate shortening of the snowpack duration over the study watersheds and in turn increasing seasonality of subsequent melt runoff during jas both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios consistently suggest a substantial decrease in the monsoonal precipitation by up to 1 mm day 1 over its dominated area of lower parts of the study watersheds along the western himalayas and adjacent plains such decrease in the monsoonal precipitation under warming world is in contrast to the reports of hasson et al 2016b suggesting extension of the south asian summer monsoonal domain under the warmer worlds of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from the cmip5 experiments projections of the wetter western himalaya under plus2 0 may refer to such extension on annual time scale small decrease of 0 2 mm day 1 over the lower parts but a negligible change over the upper parts is projected for the study watersheds annual precipitation over the upper jhelum is distinctly on a rising trend under plus2 0 4 2 water availability under plus1 5 and plus2 0 4 2 1 nival regime the simulated nival regime of the jhelum basin spans over march june period and annually contributes minimum discharge among the study basins 36 m3 s 1 its main contribution comes during mamj period under plus1 5 and plus2 0 snowmelt contribution is projected to increase slightly in february and march but to decrease substantially during april june period fig 6 such changes are further associated with a month early occurrence of snowmelt onset and vanishing of snowpack and in turn shifting of slightly dampened discharge peak from may to april these findings indicate an early and reduced water availability and its high seasonality overall all ensemble members agree that the snowmelt contribution will decrease during the whole melt season and on annual scale under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 where such a decrease is slightly higher for plus2 0 fig 9 table 3 during mamj median maximum to minimum changes suggest that the snowmelt contribution will decrease by 19 60 to 32 and 25 62 to 42 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively fig 6 table 4 higher decrease in the mamj snowmelt runoff despite of projected increase in precipitation under plus2 0 is mainly associated with a decrease in the solid precipitation for the rest of seasons the snowmelt contribution is negligible hence their future changes are small on annual scale the historical snowmelt contribution is projected to be within the range of 36 increase to 62 decrease under plus1 5 and of 37 increase to 63 decrease under plus2 0 the median change however suggests a decrease in the snowmelt contribution by 22 and 26 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively it is to note that besides a remarkable disagreement amid the individual ensemble members on their projected magnitudes of change there is a high agreement on decreasing snowmelt runoff and on its earlier timings for instance few ensemble members suggest a slight intensification of the peak snowmelt runoff whereas the median change suggests dampening of peak discharge under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 we found a minute difference between plus1 5 and plus2 0 which may indicates that weak and short spanned nival regime of the jhelum basin will reach a tipping point under plus1 5 warming world in contrast to the jhelum basin the nival regime of the kabul basin contributes around 54 m3 s 1 to the mean annual discharge and spans over april to july period featuring a peak in july on seasonal scale the main snowmelt contribution comes during mamj 140 m3 s 1 followed by in jas 25 m3 s 1 table 5 under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 median change suggests that the historical peak discharge will slightly dampen whereas its timings will remain unchanged fig 7 most of the ensemble members agree on a slight increase in the snowmelt outflow during march april period and a slight decrease during may under both warmer world scenarios increase in the snowmelt during march april is generally associated with a pronounced warming over elevated snow dominant areas of the kabul basin whereas a decrease during may june is associated with 1 relatively less precipitation falling as snow owing to the transition of solid moisture into liquid 2 due to less snow available towards the end of the melting season under warmer world with a high agreement median change suggests that the snowmelt contribution during the main season of mamj will increase by 23 7 to 60 and 28 9 to 67 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively fig 7 table 5 for jas again the majority of individual ensemble members and the median change agree on an increase in the snowmelt contribution by 2 5 and 1 7 times the historical contribution of 25 m3 s 1 on annual scale snowmelt contribution is projected to increase by 53 13 to 126 under plus1 5 and by 47 2 to 127 under plus2 0 earlier shifts in the nival regime are more pronounced under plus2 0 relative to plus1 5 the simulated nival regime of the uib spans over march june period and features highest contribution among all study basins 216 m3 s 1 table 6 main contribution is received during mamj 526 m3 s 1 followed by in jas 156 m3 s 1 while peak is observed in june unlike jhelum basin our results suggest no shift in the timings of peak snowmelt discharge for the uib under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 fig 8 in contrast hasson 2016b has reported an early shift of such peak from june to may under extreme warming scenario of rcp8 5 this indicates that only warming that exceeds plus1 5 and plus2 0 will introduce notable alterations in the peak snowmelt of the uib besides no shift in timings peak discharge will become twice the peak discharge of the historical period interesting to note that the individual ensemble members feature huge spread in their projected magnitudes for the annual snowmelt contributions suggesting ranges from 46 to 1 8 times increase under plus1 5 and from 37 to 1 6 times increase under plus2 0 relative to the historical period featuring a high agreement median changes suggest an increase in the snowmelt of around 70 and 80 for mamj 2 1 and 1 2 times for jas and 88 and 93 on annual time scale under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively fig 8 summarizing median of the 80 member ensemble projects a weakening of nival regime of the jhelum 22 and 26 but strengthening of the kabul 53 and 47 increase and uib 88 and 93 increase under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively further median change suggests a month early shift in the timings of peak snowmelt outflow from may to april for the jhelum basin but no change for the kabul and uib the magnitude of such peaks are projected to decrease slightly for the jhelum and kabul basins but increase for the uib relative to the historical period the nival regimes are generally projected to start contributing earlier which is generally associated with warming resulting into early migration of melting temperatures over the elevated snow dominant areas nival regime of jhelum clearly indicates shortening of the snowpack duration on the other hand no change in the timings of the snowmelt outflow for the uib may indicate that only warming exceeding plus1 5 and plus2 0 can introduce notable alterations in the timings of the nival regime of the basin besides distinct changes in the nival regimes of the three watersheds their overall snowmelt contribution is projected to increase by 69 27 to 151 under plus1 5 and by 70 19 to 139 under plus2 0 scenarios 4 2 2 glacial regime featuring a smallest glacier cover of around 250 km2 that extends into lower latitudes glacier melt contribution from the jhelum basin is the lowest among all study basins and spans over the high flow period of april september fig 6 our results suggest no change in the timings of peak discharge but a consistent increase in the amount of contribution particularly in july which is higher in plus2 0 than in plus1 5 ensemble median projects an increase in the glacial melt contribution by 10 and 17 during mamj and 15 and 25 during the main glacier melt season of jas as well as on annual scale under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 4 figs 6 and 9 higher contribution projected for plus2 0 than for plus1 5 indicates a linear relationship of glacial melt with concomitant temperatures while marked increase during mamj is associated with an early depletion of snowpack in warmer conditions under plus1 5 decreased glacier melt contributions of 18 50 81 and 100 are associated with 25 50 75 and 100 glacier area loss such decrease is slightly up to 6 lower under plus2 0 due to higher projected warming that will generate more melt from the same glacier extent table 4 fig 9 note that 100 glacier area loss will result only 6 more decrease in the total discharge as compared to no glacier area loss indicating that glacier melt is not a dominant source of water availability for jhelum relative to the jhelum basin the kabul basin abodes larger glacial extent 2120 km2 which extending down to the lower altitude of 3100 m asl is concentrated within the northeastern sub basin of chitral the historical glacial regime spans over may september with a peak discharge during early july fig 7 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 warmer climates glacier melt contribution is projected to start one month early in april and will increase consistently till september such increase is more pronounced for plus2 0 than plus1 5 and well agreed among almost all ensemble members figs 7 and 9 for instance glacier melt is projected to rise by 13 and 40 during mamj and by 4 and 17 during jas under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 5 marked increase during mamj corresponds to early migration of melting temperatures up to the height of glacial extent as well as to reduction in overlaying snowpack under warmer mamj overall increase in the historical glacier melt contribution is projected to be around 9 under plus1 5 and 27 under plus2 0 scenarios under plus1 5 25 50 75 and 100 loss of glacier area will result into 46 67 84 and 100 reduction in the glacier melt contribution where such decrease is relatively lower by 4 13 under plus2 0 due to higher warming interestingly the 100 glacier area loss of the kabul basin will still provide more than 30 increase in total discharge under both scenarios indicating glacier melt is not a dominant source of water supply from the kabul basin the uib glacial extent corresponds to 12 of its basin area and starts from the lowest altitude 2300 m asl amid all study basins the glacial regime of the uib may september contributes mainly during jas followed by during mamj table 6 figs 8 and 9 there is a high agreement among the 80 ensemble members on no change in timings of peak glacier melt discharge in contrast there is no agreement on change in the timings of onset and retreat of glacier melt under both scenarios as median change is close to the observed timings almost all ensemble members and median change suggest that the historical glacier melt contribution will increase by 25 under plus1 5 and by 50 under plus2 0 during jas and on annual scale table 6 figs 8 and 9 a more pronounced increase under plus2 0 than plus1 5 indicates that linear relationship among glacier melt and temperature will hold for a highly glaciated basin until a tipping point is reached the assumed glacier area reductions of 25 50 75 and 100 suggest 32 63 84 and 100 decrease in the glacier melt contribution under plus1 5 whereas such decreases are relatively lower for the warmer scenario of plus2 0 given that 100 glacier area is lost the present day total discharge from the uib will decline to a half under both scenarios as glacier melt is a dominant source of water supply from the uib note that against 25 glacier area loss median change suggests a slightly higher total discharge under plus2 0 similarly roughly a half of the ensemble members agree on increased water availability under both scenarios from fig 9 we can see that the individual ensemble members fully agree on the declining trend of the water availability from the uib only when nearly 50 glacier area is lost which is consistent with the findings of hasson 2016b summarizing glacial regimes featuring a relatively better agreement amid the ensemble members particularly for the main glacier melt season of jas are projected to start contributing significantly during mamj period owing to early depletion of relatively short lived snowpack in a drier and warmer mamj projecting almost no change in the timings of the glacier melt peaks median change however suggests a consistent increase in contribution which is markedly higher under plus2 0 than under plus1 5 indicating a linear relationship amid the glacier melt and the concomitant temperatures such fact is notable for the elevated and highly glaciated watersheds median change suggests that the overall glacial melt contribution from three watersheds will increase by 21 1 to 69 and 46 16 to 115 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively given the glacier area will be lost by 25 50 75 and 100 glacier melt contribution will decrease by 33 63 84 and 100 under plus1 5 whereas by 17 53 80 and 100 under plus2 0 the 100 glacier area loss will reduce the historical total discharge by 46 for a plausible glacier change scenario of 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier area losses for the kabul and jhelum basin by the end of the 21st century median change projects decrease of the glacier melt contribution by 38 and 23 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively 4 2 3 rainfall runoff and groundwater for the jhelum basin there is huge uncertainty amid the 80 ensemble members for projected changes in the rainfall runoff contribution that mainly corresponds to the uncertainty in projected changes of prevailing precipitation regimes figs 5 and 6 however median changes with high agreement among ensemble members suggest that the rainfall runoff contribution will decrease during mamj by 15 under plus1 5 and by 9 under plus2 0 mainly due to relatively drier westerly precipitation regime under plus1 5 fig 5 table 4 monsoonal precipitation is also projected to increase by around 80 median and majority of the ensemble members agree on an increase in the rainfall runoff contribution by 12 and 18 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 4 fig 6 groundwater contribution will drop by around 6 mainly due to early depletion of the snowpack and weakening of the westerly precipitation regime similar to the jhelum basin the 80 member ensemble features huge uncertainty in the projected rainfall runoff contribution for the kabul basin fig 7 such uncertainty is mainly a result of uncertain projected changes in the monsoonal precipitation regime the ensemble members that project a weaker monsoon project the rainfall runoff contribution similar to that of the historical period median change suggests an increase in the rainfall runoff contribution by 77 and 103 for the westerly and by 78 and 92 for the monsoonal precipitation regimes under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 5 rainfall runoff increase during westerly precipitation regime mainly corresponds to more precipitation being received as rainfall under warmer future overall rainfall runoff contribution for the kabul basin is projected to increase by 96 and 102 under plus1 5 and plu2 0 respectively besides marked spread in their projected magnitudes the majority of ensemble members agree on an increased rainfall runoff contribution for the basin fig 7 groundwater contribution is also projected to increase by around 80 of the historical contribution the rainfall runoff for the uib is projected to drop by 12 during jas due to decrease in the monsoonal rainfall under plus1 5 whereas there is no change for plus2 0 similarly mamj rainfall runoff will increase by 4 under plus1 5 and by 44 under plus2 0 consistent with projected changes in mamj precipitation overall rainfall runoff contribution will decrease by 6 under plus1 5 but will increase by 15 under plus2 0 owing to relatively higher westerly rainfall under plus2 0 fig 8 table 6 groundwater contribution will increase by 39 under plus1 5 and by 45 under plus2 0 summarizing median change projects that the rainfall runoff will increase by 12 31 to 90 and 25 15 to 112 and the groundwater will increase by 36 8 to 75 and 39 7 to 81 collectively for the three watersheds under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively changes in the rainfall runoff are consistent with the projected changes in the prevailing precipitation regimes 4 2 4 overall hydrological regime for the jhelum basin median discharge contribution will decrease during high flow period of april june and will increase during monsoon period fig 6 such pattern is dominated by the early depletion of snowpack and enhanced monsoonal pluvial regime besides strengthening of the glacial regime median change suggests that the total discharge will decrease by around 10 during mamj but increase by 10 during jas resulting into overall slightly negative runoff of 3 under plus1 5 but no change under plus2 0 on annual scale table 4 given the glacier area is lost by 100 the annual total discharge for jhelum will be reduced maximum by 6 of the baseline discharge fig 9 this indicates that the glacier melt is not a dominant source of the jhelum basin discharge the kabul peak discharge timings remain unchanged while the high flow period will considerably be extended the total discharge will increase by nearly 60 on annual scale under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios the majority of ensemble members also agree on such changes in absolute terms the maximum increase is anticipated during the early half of the hydrological regime of the kabul basin under both scenarios mainly owing to changes in the pluvial and nival regimes given the glacier area will be lost by 25 50 75 and 100 the total discharge from the kabul will decrease by 47 42 39 and 35 of the historical discharge under plus1 5 whereas such changes under plus2 0 are either similar or relatively smaller the uib hydrological regime will be perturbed by substantial changes in its glacial regime featuring no change in the peak discharge timings median change suggests that the total discharge will increase by 38 and 52 on annual scale under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively given the glacier area is lost by 25 assumed plausible scenario total discharge will decrease slightly under plus1 5 but increase by 6 under plus2 0 relative to the historical discharge fig 9 the total discharge is projected to reduce by about half of the present day discharge given the 100 glacier area is lost for the uib summarizing the total discharge will increase throughout the year for all basins except for jhelum during april june overall median changes project that the total discharge from three watersheds will increase by 34 10 to 70 and 43 14 to 88 as compared to the present day conditions under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively interestingly despite a median decrease of 38 and 23 in the glacier melt contribution for a plausible glacier change scenario of 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier are loss for both kabul and jhelum basins median change suggests an increase in the total discharge by 5 and 11 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively 5 summary and conclusions we assess changes in the distinct hydrological regimes of three critically important himalayan watersheds namely jhelum kabul and uib and their subsequent water availability against two discrete mean global warming targets of 1 5ºc and 2ºc increase relative to the pre industrial level as mentioned in the paris agreement 2015 for this 80 member ensemble of climate change scenarios specifically designed for achieving the paris agreement targets under the happi framework are forced to the calibrated ubc watershed model in order to analyze the effect of glacier area loss five scenarios were assumed which include 25 50 75 and 100 glacier area loss and intact glacier extent in view of the projected glacier area loss of the himalayan glaciers under 1 5 c by kraaijenbrink et al 2017 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier area losses for both kabul and jhelum basins are assumed to be a plausible scenario ensemble spreads and median changes in the magnitude and timings of the water availability from three himalayan watersheds are presented for each assumed glacier change scenario the happi experiments project warming of up to 1 c and of above 1 5 c under plus1 5 and plus2 0 global warming scenarios respectively where such warming is relatively higher in minimum than maximum temperature during ondjf than other seasons and over high altitude himalayan watersheds than over lower plains the main snowpack accumulation and melt season of mamj under plus1 5 as well as the summer monsoon season of jas under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios are projected to be drier whereas precipitation will increase for the rest of seasons owing to substantial spread amid 80 member ensemble of the happi experiments regarding their projected climates subsequently simulated quantitative hydrological changes also feature marked uncertainty for all basins particularly for their nival and pluvial regimes however most of the ensemble members qualitatively agree on a sign of change median of simulated ensemble spread projects significant changes under highly ambitious warmer scenarios of plus1 5 and plus2 0 relative to the historical period changes in the timings of contrasting hydrological regimes collectively reflect on changes in the overall hydrology of the watersheds nival regime will experience distinct changes across the watersheds differences between plus1 5 and plus2 0 are notable from changes in the glacial regimes for all basins a median change with a high agreement amid almost all ensemble members projects that the annual water availability will decrease by 3 for the jhelum but increase by 60 and 38 for the kabul and uib respectively under plus1 5 scenario under plus2 0 median water availability will remain unchanged for the jhelum but will increase by 62 and 52 for the kabul and uib respectively overall water availability from all three himalayan watersheds is projected to increase by 34 10 to 70 under plus1 5 and by 43 14 to 88 under plus2 0 assuming no change in the glacier area given the glacier area is lost by 100 overall water availability will reduce by around 25 under both scenarios however under the assumed plausible glacier change scenario median change suggests an increase in the total discharge by 5 and 11 despite a median decrease of 38 and 23 in the glacier melt contribution under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively since increased water availability under warmer climates dominates by the higher glacier melt contribution it is vital to assess by when precisely the existing glacier will reach the tipping point after which the water availability will start decreasing in this regard transient simulation of the glacier mass conservation and area changes instead of assumed scenarios need to be incorporated in the present day watershed models since small changes in the westerly and monsoonal precipitation directly affect the nival and pluvial regimes of the himalayan basins the climate change induced responses of these precipitation regimes at their extreme margins over the study basin further needs to be assessed under a variety of climate change scenarios further assessing the overall future water availability based on several hydrological models can further improve our understanding of the model associated uncertainties and the robustness of the results despite the downstream water availability in pakistan is projected to rise under higher warming scenarios owing to enhanced melting of the himalayan glaciers burgeoning population can still designate the country as water stressed an increased water availability also emphasizes on increasing the presently depleting water storage capacity for the better management of irrigation and hydropower generation and for combating the hydrological disasters these results provide an overall picture of the surface water availability in pakistan under the aspirations of the

584,highly seasonal water supplies from the himalayan watersheds of jhelum kabul and upper indus basin uib are critical for managing the world s largest contiguous irrigation system of the indus basin and its dependent agrarian economy of pakistan here we assess changes in the contrasting hydrological regimes of these himalayan watersheds and subsequent water availability under the paris agreement 2015 targets that aim of limiting the mean global warming to 1 5 c plus1 5 and further well below 2 0 c plus2 0 relative to pre industrial level for this calibrated semi distributed hydrological model setups of the university of british columbia are coupled with the 80 member ensemble experiments of plus1 5 and plus2 0 performed under the half a degree additional warming projections prognosis and impacts happi framework our results suggest that during october to february happi ensembles project a median warming of up to 1 c under plus1 5 and of more than 1 5ºc under plus2 0 relative to the historical period 2006 2015 such warming is generally higher in daily minimum than daily maximum temperature and over high altitudes both scenarios project drying of the monsoon july september and the main snowpack accumulation melt seasons march june results of hydrological modeling suggest significant changes in the timings of contrasting hydrological regimes that collectively reflect on changes in the overall hydrology of the himalayan watersheds median changes generally indicate strengthening of the nival and glacial regimes for all basins under plus1 5 except for the nival regime of the jhelum basin whereas such changes are more pronounced under plus2 0 subsequently annual water availability from three himalayan watersheds will increase by 34 and 43 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively these findings provide an overall picture of the surface water availability in pakistan under the aspirations of the paris agreement 2015 and can inform on policy decisions together with the country s first ever national water policy approved recently keywords water availability paris agreement himalayan watersheds uib jhelum kabul 1 introduction alterations in the global hydrological cycle that are induced by anthropogenic climate change are anticipated to be adverse over the climate change hotspot of the south asia and for its high altitude headwaters within the hindukush karakoram himalayan hkh massifs de souza et al 2015 these alterations are particularly severe for those himalayan watersheds that are situated at the margins of distinct precipitation regimes and feature critical importance of their melt dominated hydrology to the drier mostly irrigated agricultural economy downstream bokhari et al 2018 masood et al 2018 such watersheds are the jhelum kabul and upper indus basin uib within the indus basin fig 1 not only the water budgets are projected to deplete for these watersheds throughout the century but also future warming and its elevation dependence indicating intense warming over high altitudes pose unprecedentedly increasing pressures on their frozen freshwater reservoirs hasson et al 2018 hence the assessment of changes in the water supplies from jhelum kabul and uib that collectively contribute around 80 of the total surface water available in pakistan is vital for adequate management and adaptation ali et al 2009 a number of studies have assessed the future water availability from the jhelum kabul and uib for instance lutz et al 2016 have reported highly uncertain future of the water availability shifts in its timings and rise in intensity and frequency of hydrological extremes for the upper indus based on cryosphere hydrological model forced with statistically downscaled coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 experiments for the representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 employing a positive degree day temperature index approach koppes et al 2015 have assessed the sensitivity of only the annual glacier melt water from the upper indus to seven reanalysis datasets they have reported a substantial spread in the annual glacier melt and its projected increase by more than 200 under hypothetical temperature increase of 2 4 c assuming it uniform across time and space ali et al 2015 have assessed the future flows from the upper indus employing an energy balance semi distributed model forced with the dynamically downscaled rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios and reported up to 87 increase in the water availability by the end of the 21st century using same watershed model hasson 2016b have assessed the future water availability from the uib under both the dynamically downscaled rcp8 5 scenario and the so called relevant near future hypothetical scenario that suggests distinct intra annual changes depending on the historical trends unlike a uniform increase he reported the water availability from the uib ranging from 10 decrease in near future under hypothetical scenario to up to 220 increase under rcp8 5 by the end of the 21st century nevertheless the above mentioned and other studies project the future water availability from the upper indus either under the downscaled rcp scenarios or under hypothetically assumed physically inconsistent climatic changes under the paris agreement 2015 the signatory countries have agreed upon holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 c above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c unfccc 2015 this garnered a great response from the impact assessment communities to assess the impacts of 1 5 c and 2 0 c increase above the pre industrial 1861 1880 levels on various sectors including water döll et al 2018 since the melt dominated hydrological regimes of the himalayan watersheds are directly sensitive to the warming it is important to assess their future nourishments and subsequent water supplies against discrete temperature increases ali et al 2018 however the multi model responses to a particular emission or radiative forcing scenario simulated under the cmip3 5 frameworks meehl and arblaster 2003 taylor et al 2012 are markedly different and feature enormous uncertainty in their suggested timings of when a certain level of temperature change will be achieved mitchell et al 2016 on the other hand hypothetical scenarios are either physically inconsistent as these are typically devised perturbing climatic variables arbitrarily and uniformly across spatio temporal scales or due to the fact that the magnitude of change over the himalayan watersheds will be different than that of on the global scale filling this gap under the half a degree additional warming projections prognosis and impacts happi framework a dedicated set of experiments has been designed as per the aspirations of the paris agreement to achieve 1 5 c and 2 0 c discrete global average temperature increases above the pre industrial level irrespective of the emission scenario mitchell et al 2017 the 1 5 c and 2 c global temperature increases relative to the pre industrial era refer to around 0 7 c and 1 2 c warmer conditions than that of the historical period of 2006 2015 respectively half a degree additional warming refers to additional warming in 2 c scenario as compared to 1 5 c scenario the happi experiments provide a great opportunity to drive the impact assessment models against discrete levels of mean global warming of 1 5ºc and 2ºc above the pre industrial level against this background this study assesses changes in the hydrological regimes and the subsequent water availability from three critically important himalayan watersheds namely jhelum kabul and uib specifically under the paris agreement 2005 targets of 1 5 c and 2 0 c warmer worlds than the pre industrial level for this a calibrated energy balance hydrological model of the university of british columbia ubc has been forced with the happi experiments encompassing 80 ensemble members simulated by four different climate models the results will provide a comprehensive look on the future surface water availability in pakistan under the aspirations of the paris agreement and can inform on policy decision together with the country s first ever national water policy approved recently 2 study area the study area comprises three himalayan watersheds namely jhelum kabul and uib which are unique in terms of their geophysical characteristics hydroclimatology and downstream importance of their water supplies fig 1 all three basins are transboundary sharing borders with afghanistan in the west china in the north and india in the east the jhelum lays at the most western edge of the himalaya kabul lies within the hindukush while the uib abodes mostly the karakoram massif all draining into the indus river in pakistan these basins are geographically positioned at the extreme margins of the south asian summer monsoon sasm system which travelling along the himalayan arc brings rain snow at lower higher altitudes markedly over the jhelum basin followed by kabul and the western uib hasson et al 2018 forming a clear east to west gradient sasm becomes weaker northwestward and prevails only for a shorter period of july september as compared to june september over india hasson et al 2018 the behavior of sasm at its extreme margins over the study watersheds is very erratic mainly owing to the region specific local forcing such as complex hkh terrain highly concentrated cryosphere and vastly irrigated plains local forcing play a significant role in modulating the strengths of sasm and of its precipitation regime adding to their natural variability chakraborty et al 2006 saeed et al 2009 boos and hurley 2013 such modulation subsequently can trigger flood or drought conditions over the study basins resulting into excess or shortage of water in pakistan during the rest of the year water supplies are mainly generated from melting of existing cryosphere apr aug which is nourished dominantly by spring followed by winter season solid moisture input from intermittent but year round western disturbances at their far eastern extremity wake 1989 hasson 2016a the north atlantic oscillation nao controls the strength and direction of prevailing western disturbances resulting into above below normal moisture supplies during the positive negative phase syed et al 2006 hence the topo climate of the study basins is influenced by distinct modes of large scale circulations at their extreme margins their interactions and their modulation by complex hkh terrain and region specific features subsequently the timings and the form of moisture received from prevailing precipitation regimes define the assorted hydrological regimes of the study basins the mountainous hydrological regimes feature high low flows during april september october march period and can be categorized either as mountain nival or mountain glacial krasovskaia 1994 based on the extent of glacier cover the timings of peak discharge and its correlation with different climatic variables according to such categorization jhelum and kabul basins are mainly snow fed while uib is mainly glacier fed archer 2003 mukhopadhyay and khan 2015 hasson et al 2014 hasson et al 2017 the long term mean annual discharges from the jhelum kabul and uib account to 810 850 and 2405 m3 s 1 which collectively contribute around 80 to the annual surface water availability in pakistan hasson et al 2018 such marked contribution from these watersheds is critical for ensuring sustainable water supplies to the mostly irrigated agriculture in pakistan and in turn for the socio economic well being of its burgeoning population qaisrani et al 2018 batool and saeed 2018 therefore future assessment of changes in the water supplies from the study basins is vital for the adequate management and adaptation 3 data and methods 3 1 date used future climate experiments limiting the global average temperature increase to 1 5 c and 2 0 c are obtained from the happi framework mitchell et al 2017 employing atmosphere only global climate models gcms happi experiments are performed for three time slices one for the historical period all hist 2006 2015 that represents the present day conditions while two for the hypothetical future period 2106 2115 each projecting 1 5 c plus1 5 and 2 0 c plus2 0 global average temperature increases above the pre industrial level supp table 5 all hist experiments consider the present day anthropogenic and natural forcing including the co2 concentration from 381 ppm to 403 ppm as observed over the 2006 2015 decade saeed et al 2018a for plus1 5 future scenario 2106 2115 constant radiative forcing as of the rcp2 6 have been used the all hist sea surface temperature is perturbed by the cmip5 multimodel mean for the rcp2 6 scenario and the co2 concentration is kept constant at 423 4 ppm for plus2 0 future scenario a linear combination of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 experiments is used to estimate the sea surface temperature and the co2 concentration where the latter is kept constant at 486 6 ppm non co2 greenhouse gases ozone and aerosol forcing are identical for both plus1 5 and plus2 0 mitchell et al 2017 in the present analysis we have obtained daily maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation from a set of 80 happi experiments consisting of 20 realizations from each of four gcms echam6 miroc5 cam4 2degree and noresm1 for all hist plus1 5 and plus2 0 warmer world scenarios saeed et al 2018b the observed meteorological and hydrological data for the calibration and validation of the ubc model were obtained from the pakistan meteorological department pmd and the water and power development authority wapda in pakistan table 1 the geophysical description of the watershed is based on freely available datasets elevation zones and their mid elevation were derived from the onc arc second global digital elevation model of the shuttle radar topographic mission forest cover and its canopy density for the himalayan watersheds are obtained from the united nations environment programme unep environmental data explorer as compiled form usgs nasa unep 2015 glacier coverage is taken from the randolf glacier inventory version 6 0 rgi6 rgi consortium 2017 the debris covered glacier area is estimated from the global dataset of scherler et al 2018 3 2 methods 3 2 1 hydrological model setup the study employs a semi distributed energy balance hydrological model of the university of british columbia ubc quick and pipes 1976 which is capable of simulating the nival glacial and pluvial runoff regimes on hourly to daily time scales requiring minimum hydrometeorological input considering the basin as a set of altitudinal zones ubc allows the formation of basin wide altitudinal barriers and the station wise correction factors for vertical and horizontal distribution of precipitation across the basin while temperatures are distributed using adequate lapse rates to melt snowpack and glaciers the model incorporates a comprehensive snowmelt routine for which requisite parameters are already tuned for the hkh environment pipes and quick 1987 the soil moisture routine apportions the generated runoff into surface sub surface shallow groundwater and deep zone groundwater which are routed to the watershed outlet using water conserved linear reservoir approach the schematic diagram of the ubc model is shown in fig 2 a the comprehensive details on snow melt routine distribution of meteorological parameters and soil moisture routine are already described in hasson 2016b loukas et al 2002 and loukas and vasiliades 2014 respectively to determine the hydrological response of the study basins under warmer worlds the ubc watershed model was setup using the best available physiogeographical watershed characteristics and the high altitude stations observations most representative of the himalayan topoclimate in combination with suitable valley floor observations to better account for the rainfall runoff dynamics the details of the altitudinal zones and their physiogeographical characteristics for each basin are given in the supplementary table 1 the details of the hydrometeorological observations used for the calibration and validation of the ubc models are listed in the table 1 the plausible ranges default values and the calibrated values of the most sensitive parameters of the ubc model parameters are listed in the table 2 the ubc model setups for the jhelum kabul and uib have been tuned over the 1994 2004 period considering its second half as a calibration 1999 2004 and first half 1994 1999 as a validation period for the robust evaluation of the ubc model performance on daily time scale multiple efficiency criteria krause et al 2005 have been used that include the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 volumetric efficiency percentage ve mean error me coefficient of determination d and root mean square error rmse since nse features a non linear relationship with the model performance it has been carefully interpreted based on four subjectively established classes by ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 that range between the lower acceptable limit of nse 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 and its perfect fit of nse 1 0 nash and sutcliffe 1970 these subjective classes include unsatisfactory nse 0 65 acceptable nse 0 65 0 7999 good nse 0 800 0 899 and very good nse 0 900 1 000 the model performance was found very good for mainly the glacier fed uib followed by jhelum and kabul basins in terms of nse ve and d which largely remain between 0 8 and 0 9 for all the periods and study basins table 2 and fig 2b the me and rmse are generally higher for the calibration period as compared to the validation period however such statistics are very robust as the intentionally chosen calibration period observes a severe drought over the study basins during 1999 2003 the calibration during such dry period has minimized the risk of equifinality which typically arises from anomalous compensation between the snow and glacier melts in case of mixed hydrological regime as of the study basins overall the model efficiency statistics suggest that the ubc model successfully reproduces the hydrological behavior of the himalayan basins up to higher degree of satisfaction changes in the cryospheric extent are anticipated under the warmer climates which are required to be assimilated in the modeling process while assessing the future water availability unlike the reports of a balanced state of the karakoram cryospheric since 1970 significant negative changes are reported for the glacial mass and extent for the western himalaya and hindu kush ranges scherler et al 2011 bhambri et al 2013 minora et al 2013 hasson et al 2014 rankl et al 2014 rankl and braun 2016 bolch et al 2012 and 2017 further cryospheric changes may occur in future under warmer conditions and wetter drier precipitation regimes assessing the impacts of 1 5 c warming over the hkh glaciers based on rcp2 6 scenario kraaijenbrink et al 2017 have reported the glacier area loss of up to 27 for the karakoram range 83 7 area remaining and the glacier area loss of up to 56 for both the hindu kush 52 8 area remaining and the western himalaya 57 13 area remaining by the end of the 21st century since these estimates for the 1 5 c scenario are subject to single and simplest glacier mass balance model forced with the rcp based climate simulations and assuming a constant degree day factor on regional scale we assumed range of hypothetical scenarios in order to provide the assessment of water availability under a full spectrum of glacier area changes the assumed glacier scenarios include intact glacier 75 50 25 and 0 glacier referring to 0 25 50 75 and 100 glacier area loss by the end of the 21st century respectively as the jhelum and kabul basins encompass the hindu kush and the western himalayan ranges the scenario of 50 glacier area loss for these basins is consistent with the estimates of kraaijenbrink et al 2017 for the western himalaya and hindukush ranges on the other hand the uib mainly encompasses the karakoram range thus the scenario of 25 glacier area loss for the uib also seems in line with the projections of kraaijenbrink et al 2017 further 25 and 50 glacier area reduction for the uib and kabul basins is consistent with the rates of glacier area loss of 0 28 and 0 47 a 1 for the karakoram and hindukush ranges and 75 and 100 glacier area reduction for the jhelum basin is consistent with the rates of glacier area loss of 0 67 a 1 and 0 91 a 1 for the western himalayas as projected by zhao et al 2014 using calibrated and uncalibrated model respectively till 2050 under a1b scenario in view of these projected glacier area losses we assume 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier area losses for both kabul and jhelum basins as a plausible scenario 3 2 2 climate change scenarios to present future climate changes 80 happi experiments for all hist 2006 2015 plus1 5 2106 2115 and plus2 0 2106 2115 time slices were re gridded to a 0 5º x 0 5 regular grid future changes in the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and precipitation from both plus1 5 and plus2 0 were calculated for their each ensemble member as its difference with the corresponding ensemble member from all hist median of the change ensemble was presented on intra annual and annual scales for intra annual changes three seasons of october to february ondjf march to june mamj and july to september jas were objectively considered the ondjf and mamj refer to the snowpack accumulation season when the westerly precipitation regime dominates while jas corresponds to the monsoonal precipitation regime over the study watersheds moreover mamj spans over mainly the snowmelt season while jas spans over the glacier melt season both corresponding to the high flow period owing to the structural limitations in representing the region specific features and their related physical processes gcms systematically deviate from the reality this is consistent among cmip3 cmip5 and their downscaled invariants that feature substantial cold and wet biases over the himalayan watersheds hasson et al 2018 such bias from the happi experiments was adjusted against nine stations that are used to calibrate the ubc model using a sophisticated non parametric technique of the empirical quantile mapping eqm gudmundsson et al 2012 guo et al 2018 the eqm corrects each quantile of the modeled distribution of any climatic variable x so that it matches the observed distribution of the same variable based upon their empirical cumulative distributions cdfs foh for the local observed and fmh for the modeled data during historical period and a transfer function t 0 1 0 1 such that 1 t f m h x f o h x the local future cdf fof is approximated by applying t to the cdf of the modeled data for the future period fmf by replacing x in eq 1 with f m h 1 u where u fmh x and belongs to 0 1 2 t u f o h f m h 1 u assuming such transformation holds for the future the local future cdf is obtained as 3 f o f x f o h f m h 1 f m f x the ubc model was run for each ensemble member of the bias adjusted plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios the results are presented in terms of median annual cycles along with their ensemble spreads together with historically simulated discharges for each study watershed in order to assess delicate changes in the timings of the water availability to assess changes in the nival glacial and pluvial runoff regimes discharge contributions from the major hydrological components are separately calculated on seasonal and annual scale under plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios 4 results and discussions median ensemble changes in the seasonal and annual mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures and total precipitation are presented for both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios in figs 3 5 respectively to assess delicate impacts of plus1 5 and plus2 0 warming on the nival glacial and pluvial runoff regimes and in the timings of their runoff contributions the annual cycles of the spreads and medians of 80 member ensemble together with the ubc simulated historical discharges 1994 2004 for each hydrological component are presented in figs 6 8 for jhelum kabul and uib respectively the effect of glacier area loss as assumed in five different scenarios on the glacier melt runoff and on the overall hydrological regime of the study watershed is presented in fig 9 median discharge changes are presented as the percentage of the historical discharges on seasonal and annual time scale in tables 4 6 for the jhelum kabul and uib respectively likewise absolute discharge values of the ensemble median maximum and minimum are summarized on seasonal and annual time scales in the supplementary tables 2 4 for each study basin 4 1 climate changes under plus1 5 and plus2 0 fig 3 shows that changes in maximum temperature are higher in plus2 0 reaching above 1 5 c as compared to plus1 5 where warming mostly remains below 1 c exceptions are the monsoon dominated plains and the eastern uib in plus2 0 highest increase in maximum temperature is projected for winter months of ondjf over almost the whole study area during monsoon season and on annual timescale warming is higher over the high altitudes mostly the cryospheric region as compared to the lower plains such elevation dependent warming has been consistently reported by pepin et al 2015 based on station observations by hasson et al 2016a based on gridded observations and reanalysis datasets and by kaaijenbrink et al 2017 and palazzi et al 2017 from the cmip5 based rcp scenarios higher increase in the daytime temperatures over high altitude cryospheric region indicates twofold effect on the regional hydrology 1 transition of the incident solid moisture received from the monsoon or western disturbances into liquid 2 increased melting of snow and glaciers pattern of projected changes in daily minimum temperature is different relative to daily maximum temperature fig 4 the highest increase in minimum temperature is projected for ondjf and over the high altitudes relative to plains which is more than 1 c and 2ºc for plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively for the rest of seasons and on annual scale plus1 5 features a warming of around 0 5 c in contrast warming is higher in plus2 0 and the elevation dependent pattern is apparent almost for all seasons highest increase in minimum temperature is projected over the himalayan watersheds during ondjf that approaches above 2 c particularly over the highly glaciated sub basin of the uib such as shigar and shyok during mamj plus2 0 nighttime warming is above 1 5 c over parts of shyok sub basin and during jas over gilgit hunza and shigar sub basins the annual scale changes dominated by changes during ondjf reach above 1 5 c over the uib and upper kabul basins overall difference in the projected warming between high altitudes and lower plains is around 0 5 c whenever the projected median change was higher than 1 c fig 5 shows ensemble median precipitation increase of up to 1 mm day 1 over the kabul and jhelum basins and along the western himalayas during ondjf where such an increase is relatively small over the plains under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 major part of the uib do not feature any change in the incident precipitation under both warmer world scenarios precipitation change pattern are quite different for the only accumulation season of ondjf as compared to mamj which is mainly the season of snowpack accumulation as well as its melt under plus1 5 mamj precipitation will decrease by 0 2 mm day 1 over plains and lower parts of the study watersheds whereas such decrease over their upper parts is almost negligible as compared to plus1 5 projected decrease in mamj precipitation is not that marked over plains whereas it will increase over the kabul and jhelum basins by up to 0 2 mm day 1 it is to note that positive and negative changes in precipitation along with relatively intense warming over high altitudes may not only affect the melt runoff contribution but will change the distinct hydrological regimes hence the timings of their contribution projections of wetter ondjf but drier mamj are consistent with the reports from the cmip5 based rcp8 5 experiments hasson et al 2016b these changes further indicate shortening of the snowpack duration over the study watersheds and in turn increasing seasonality of subsequent melt runoff during jas both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios consistently suggest a substantial decrease in the monsoonal precipitation by up to 1 mm day 1 over its dominated area of lower parts of the study watersheds along the western himalayas and adjacent plains such decrease in the monsoonal precipitation under warming world is in contrast to the reports of hasson et al 2016b suggesting extension of the south asian summer monsoonal domain under the warmer worlds of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from the cmip5 experiments projections of the wetter western himalaya under plus2 0 may refer to such extension on annual time scale small decrease of 0 2 mm day 1 over the lower parts but a negligible change over the upper parts is projected for the study watersheds annual precipitation over the upper jhelum is distinctly on a rising trend under plus2 0 4 2 water availability under plus1 5 and plus2 0 4 2 1 nival regime the simulated nival regime of the jhelum basin spans over march june period and annually contributes minimum discharge among the study basins 36 m3 s 1 its main contribution comes during mamj period under plus1 5 and plus2 0 snowmelt contribution is projected to increase slightly in february and march but to decrease substantially during april june period fig 6 such changes are further associated with a month early occurrence of snowmelt onset and vanishing of snowpack and in turn shifting of slightly dampened discharge peak from may to april these findings indicate an early and reduced water availability and its high seasonality overall all ensemble members agree that the snowmelt contribution will decrease during the whole melt season and on annual scale under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 where such a decrease is slightly higher for plus2 0 fig 9 table 3 during mamj median maximum to minimum changes suggest that the snowmelt contribution will decrease by 19 60 to 32 and 25 62 to 42 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively fig 6 table 4 higher decrease in the mamj snowmelt runoff despite of projected increase in precipitation under plus2 0 is mainly associated with a decrease in the solid precipitation for the rest of seasons the snowmelt contribution is negligible hence their future changes are small on annual scale the historical snowmelt contribution is projected to be within the range of 36 increase to 62 decrease under plus1 5 and of 37 increase to 63 decrease under plus2 0 the median change however suggests a decrease in the snowmelt contribution by 22 and 26 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively it is to note that besides a remarkable disagreement amid the individual ensemble members on their projected magnitudes of change there is a high agreement on decreasing snowmelt runoff and on its earlier timings for instance few ensemble members suggest a slight intensification of the peak snowmelt runoff whereas the median change suggests dampening of peak discharge under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 we found a minute difference between plus1 5 and plus2 0 which may indicates that weak and short spanned nival regime of the jhelum basin will reach a tipping point under plus1 5 warming world in contrast to the jhelum basin the nival regime of the kabul basin contributes around 54 m3 s 1 to the mean annual discharge and spans over april to july period featuring a peak in july on seasonal scale the main snowmelt contribution comes during mamj 140 m3 s 1 followed by in jas 25 m3 s 1 table 5 under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 median change suggests that the historical peak discharge will slightly dampen whereas its timings will remain unchanged fig 7 most of the ensemble members agree on a slight increase in the snowmelt outflow during march april period and a slight decrease during may under both warmer world scenarios increase in the snowmelt during march april is generally associated with a pronounced warming over elevated snow dominant areas of the kabul basin whereas a decrease during may june is associated with 1 relatively less precipitation falling as snow owing to the transition of solid moisture into liquid 2 due to less snow available towards the end of the melting season under warmer world with a high agreement median change suggests that the snowmelt contribution during the main season of mamj will increase by 23 7 to 60 and 28 9 to 67 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively fig 7 table 5 for jas again the majority of individual ensemble members and the median change agree on an increase in the snowmelt contribution by 2 5 and 1 7 times the historical contribution of 25 m3 s 1 on annual scale snowmelt contribution is projected to increase by 53 13 to 126 under plus1 5 and by 47 2 to 127 under plus2 0 earlier shifts in the nival regime are more pronounced under plus2 0 relative to plus1 5 the simulated nival regime of the uib spans over march june period and features highest contribution among all study basins 216 m3 s 1 table 6 main contribution is received during mamj 526 m3 s 1 followed by in jas 156 m3 s 1 while peak is observed in june unlike jhelum basin our results suggest no shift in the timings of peak snowmelt discharge for the uib under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 fig 8 in contrast hasson 2016b has reported an early shift of such peak from june to may under extreme warming scenario of rcp8 5 this indicates that only warming that exceeds plus1 5 and plus2 0 will introduce notable alterations in the peak snowmelt of the uib besides no shift in timings peak discharge will become twice the peak discharge of the historical period interesting to note that the individual ensemble members feature huge spread in their projected magnitudes for the annual snowmelt contributions suggesting ranges from 46 to 1 8 times increase under plus1 5 and from 37 to 1 6 times increase under plus2 0 relative to the historical period featuring a high agreement median changes suggest an increase in the snowmelt of around 70 and 80 for mamj 2 1 and 1 2 times for jas and 88 and 93 on annual time scale under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively fig 8 summarizing median of the 80 member ensemble projects a weakening of nival regime of the jhelum 22 and 26 but strengthening of the kabul 53 and 47 increase and uib 88 and 93 increase under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively further median change suggests a month early shift in the timings of peak snowmelt outflow from may to april for the jhelum basin but no change for the kabul and uib the magnitude of such peaks are projected to decrease slightly for the jhelum and kabul basins but increase for the uib relative to the historical period the nival regimes are generally projected to start contributing earlier which is generally associated with warming resulting into early migration of melting temperatures over the elevated snow dominant areas nival regime of jhelum clearly indicates shortening of the snowpack duration on the other hand no change in the timings of the snowmelt outflow for the uib may indicate that only warming exceeding plus1 5 and plus2 0 can introduce notable alterations in the timings of the nival regime of the basin besides distinct changes in the nival regimes of the three watersheds their overall snowmelt contribution is projected to increase by 69 27 to 151 under plus1 5 and by 70 19 to 139 under plus2 0 scenarios 4 2 2 glacial regime featuring a smallest glacier cover of around 250 km2 that extends into lower latitudes glacier melt contribution from the jhelum basin is the lowest among all study basins and spans over the high flow period of april september fig 6 our results suggest no change in the timings of peak discharge but a consistent increase in the amount of contribution particularly in july which is higher in plus2 0 than in plus1 5 ensemble median projects an increase in the glacial melt contribution by 10 and 17 during mamj and 15 and 25 during the main glacier melt season of jas as well as on annual scale under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 4 figs 6 and 9 higher contribution projected for plus2 0 than for plus1 5 indicates a linear relationship of glacial melt with concomitant temperatures while marked increase during mamj is associated with an early depletion of snowpack in warmer conditions under plus1 5 decreased glacier melt contributions of 18 50 81 and 100 are associated with 25 50 75 and 100 glacier area loss such decrease is slightly up to 6 lower under plus2 0 due to higher projected warming that will generate more melt from the same glacier extent table 4 fig 9 note that 100 glacier area loss will result only 6 more decrease in the total discharge as compared to no glacier area loss indicating that glacier melt is not a dominant source of water availability for jhelum relative to the jhelum basin the kabul basin abodes larger glacial extent 2120 km2 which extending down to the lower altitude of 3100 m asl is concentrated within the northeastern sub basin of chitral the historical glacial regime spans over may september with a peak discharge during early july fig 7 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 warmer climates glacier melt contribution is projected to start one month early in april and will increase consistently till september such increase is more pronounced for plus2 0 than plus1 5 and well agreed among almost all ensemble members figs 7 and 9 for instance glacier melt is projected to rise by 13 and 40 during mamj and by 4 and 17 during jas under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 5 marked increase during mamj corresponds to early migration of melting temperatures up to the height of glacial extent as well as to reduction in overlaying snowpack under warmer mamj overall increase in the historical glacier melt contribution is projected to be around 9 under plus1 5 and 27 under plus2 0 scenarios under plus1 5 25 50 75 and 100 loss of glacier area will result into 46 67 84 and 100 reduction in the glacier melt contribution where such decrease is relatively lower by 4 13 under plus2 0 due to higher warming interestingly the 100 glacier area loss of the kabul basin will still provide more than 30 increase in total discharge under both scenarios indicating glacier melt is not a dominant source of water supply from the kabul basin the uib glacial extent corresponds to 12 of its basin area and starts from the lowest altitude 2300 m asl amid all study basins the glacial regime of the uib may september contributes mainly during jas followed by during mamj table 6 figs 8 and 9 there is a high agreement among the 80 ensemble members on no change in timings of peak glacier melt discharge in contrast there is no agreement on change in the timings of onset and retreat of glacier melt under both scenarios as median change is close to the observed timings almost all ensemble members and median change suggest that the historical glacier melt contribution will increase by 25 under plus1 5 and by 50 under plus2 0 during jas and on annual scale table 6 figs 8 and 9 a more pronounced increase under plus2 0 than plus1 5 indicates that linear relationship among glacier melt and temperature will hold for a highly glaciated basin until a tipping point is reached the assumed glacier area reductions of 25 50 75 and 100 suggest 32 63 84 and 100 decrease in the glacier melt contribution under plus1 5 whereas such decreases are relatively lower for the warmer scenario of plus2 0 given that 100 glacier area is lost the present day total discharge from the uib will decline to a half under both scenarios as glacier melt is a dominant source of water supply from the uib note that against 25 glacier area loss median change suggests a slightly higher total discharge under plus2 0 similarly roughly a half of the ensemble members agree on increased water availability under both scenarios from fig 9 we can see that the individual ensemble members fully agree on the declining trend of the water availability from the uib only when nearly 50 glacier area is lost which is consistent with the findings of hasson 2016b summarizing glacial regimes featuring a relatively better agreement amid the ensemble members particularly for the main glacier melt season of jas are projected to start contributing significantly during mamj period owing to early depletion of relatively short lived snowpack in a drier and warmer mamj projecting almost no change in the timings of the glacier melt peaks median change however suggests a consistent increase in contribution which is markedly higher under plus2 0 than under plus1 5 indicating a linear relationship amid the glacier melt and the concomitant temperatures such fact is notable for the elevated and highly glaciated watersheds median change suggests that the overall glacial melt contribution from three watersheds will increase by 21 1 to 69 and 46 16 to 115 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively given the glacier area will be lost by 25 50 75 and 100 glacier melt contribution will decrease by 33 63 84 and 100 under plus1 5 whereas by 17 53 80 and 100 under plus2 0 the 100 glacier area loss will reduce the historical total discharge by 46 for a plausible glacier change scenario of 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier area losses for the kabul and jhelum basin by the end of the 21st century median change projects decrease of the glacier melt contribution by 38 and 23 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively 4 2 3 rainfall runoff and groundwater for the jhelum basin there is huge uncertainty amid the 80 ensemble members for projected changes in the rainfall runoff contribution that mainly corresponds to the uncertainty in projected changes of prevailing precipitation regimes figs 5 and 6 however median changes with high agreement among ensemble members suggest that the rainfall runoff contribution will decrease during mamj by 15 under plus1 5 and by 9 under plus2 0 mainly due to relatively drier westerly precipitation regime under plus1 5 fig 5 table 4 monsoonal precipitation is also projected to increase by around 80 median and majority of the ensemble members agree on an increase in the rainfall runoff contribution by 12 and 18 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 4 fig 6 groundwater contribution will drop by around 6 mainly due to early depletion of the snowpack and weakening of the westerly precipitation regime similar to the jhelum basin the 80 member ensemble features huge uncertainty in the projected rainfall runoff contribution for the kabul basin fig 7 such uncertainty is mainly a result of uncertain projected changes in the monsoonal precipitation regime the ensemble members that project a weaker monsoon project the rainfall runoff contribution similar to that of the historical period median change suggests an increase in the rainfall runoff contribution by 77 and 103 for the westerly and by 78 and 92 for the monsoonal precipitation regimes under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively table 5 rainfall runoff increase during westerly precipitation regime mainly corresponds to more precipitation being received as rainfall under warmer future overall rainfall runoff contribution for the kabul basin is projected to increase by 96 and 102 under plus1 5 and plu2 0 respectively besides marked spread in their projected magnitudes the majority of ensemble members agree on an increased rainfall runoff contribution for the basin fig 7 groundwater contribution is also projected to increase by around 80 of the historical contribution the rainfall runoff for the uib is projected to drop by 12 during jas due to decrease in the monsoonal rainfall under plus1 5 whereas there is no change for plus2 0 similarly mamj rainfall runoff will increase by 4 under plus1 5 and by 44 under plus2 0 consistent with projected changes in mamj precipitation overall rainfall runoff contribution will decrease by 6 under plus1 5 but will increase by 15 under plus2 0 owing to relatively higher westerly rainfall under plus2 0 fig 8 table 6 groundwater contribution will increase by 39 under plus1 5 and by 45 under plus2 0 summarizing median change projects that the rainfall runoff will increase by 12 31 to 90 and 25 15 to 112 and the groundwater will increase by 36 8 to 75 and 39 7 to 81 collectively for the three watersheds under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively changes in the rainfall runoff are consistent with the projected changes in the prevailing precipitation regimes 4 2 4 overall hydrological regime for the jhelum basin median discharge contribution will decrease during high flow period of april june and will increase during monsoon period fig 6 such pattern is dominated by the early depletion of snowpack and enhanced monsoonal pluvial regime besides strengthening of the glacial regime median change suggests that the total discharge will decrease by around 10 during mamj but increase by 10 during jas resulting into overall slightly negative runoff of 3 under plus1 5 but no change under plus2 0 on annual scale table 4 given the glacier area is lost by 100 the annual total discharge for jhelum will be reduced maximum by 6 of the baseline discharge fig 9 this indicates that the glacier melt is not a dominant source of the jhelum basin discharge the kabul peak discharge timings remain unchanged while the high flow period will considerably be extended the total discharge will increase by nearly 60 on annual scale under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios the majority of ensemble members also agree on such changes in absolute terms the maximum increase is anticipated during the early half of the hydrological regime of the kabul basin under both scenarios mainly owing to changes in the pluvial and nival regimes given the glacier area will be lost by 25 50 75 and 100 the total discharge from the kabul will decrease by 47 42 39 and 35 of the historical discharge under plus1 5 whereas such changes under plus2 0 are either similar or relatively smaller the uib hydrological regime will be perturbed by substantial changes in its glacial regime featuring no change in the peak discharge timings median change suggests that the total discharge will increase by 38 and 52 on annual scale under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively given the glacier area is lost by 25 assumed plausible scenario total discharge will decrease slightly under plus1 5 but increase by 6 under plus2 0 relative to the historical discharge fig 9 the total discharge is projected to reduce by about half of the present day discharge given the 100 glacier area is lost for the uib summarizing the total discharge will increase throughout the year for all basins except for jhelum during april june overall median changes project that the total discharge from three watersheds will increase by 34 10 to 70 and 43 14 to 88 as compared to the present day conditions under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively interestingly despite a median decrease of 38 and 23 in the glacier melt contribution for a plausible glacier change scenario of 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier are loss for both kabul and jhelum basins median change suggests an increase in the total discharge by 5 and 11 under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively 5 summary and conclusions we assess changes in the distinct hydrological regimes of three critically important himalayan watersheds namely jhelum kabul and uib and their subsequent water availability against two discrete mean global warming targets of 1 5ºc and 2ºc increase relative to the pre industrial level as mentioned in the paris agreement 2015 for this 80 member ensemble of climate change scenarios specifically designed for achieving the paris agreement targets under the happi framework are forced to the calibrated ubc watershed model in order to analyze the effect of glacier area loss five scenarios were assumed which include 25 50 75 and 100 glacier area loss and intact glacier extent in view of the projected glacier area loss of the himalayan glaciers under 1 5 c by kraaijenbrink et al 2017 25 glacier area loss for the uib and 50 glacier area losses for both kabul and jhelum basins are assumed to be a plausible scenario ensemble spreads and median changes in the magnitude and timings of the water availability from three himalayan watersheds are presented for each assumed glacier change scenario the happi experiments project warming of up to 1 c and of above 1 5 c under plus1 5 and plus2 0 global warming scenarios respectively where such warming is relatively higher in minimum than maximum temperature during ondjf than other seasons and over high altitude himalayan watersheds than over lower plains the main snowpack accumulation and melt season of mamj under plus1 5 as well as the summer monsoon season of jas under both plus1 5 and plus2 0 scenarios are projected to be drier whereas precipitation will increase for the rest of seasons owing to substantial spread amid 80 member ensemble of the happi experiments regarding their projected climates subsequently simulated quantitative hydrological changes also feature marked uncertainty for all basins particularly for their nival and pluvial regimes however most of the ensemble members qualitatively agree on a sign of change median of simulated ensemble spread projects significant changes under highly ambitious warmer scenarios of plus1 5 and plus2 0 relative to the historical period changes in the timings of contrasting hydrological regimes collectively reflect on changes in the overall hydrology of the watersheds nival regime will experience distinct changes across the watersheds differences between plus1 5 and plus2 0 are notable from changes in the glacial regimes for all basins a median change with a high agreement amid almost all ensemble members projects that the annual water availability will decrease by 3 for the jhelum but increase by 60 and 38 for the kabul and uib respectively under plus1 5 scenario under plus2 0 median water availability will remain unchanged for the jhelum but will increase by 62 and 52 for the kabul and uib respectively overall water availability from all three himalayan watersheds is projected to increase by 34 10 to 70 under plus1 5 and by 43 14 to 88 under plus2 0 assuming no change in the glacier area given the glacier area is lost by 100 overall water availability will reduce by around 25 under both scenarios however under the assumed plausible glacier change scenario median change suggests an increase in the total discharge by 5 and 11 despite a median decrease of 38 and 23 in the glacier melt contribution under plus1 5 and plus2 0 respectively since increased water availability under warmer climates dominates by the higher glacier melt contribution it is vital to assess by when precisely the existing glacier will reach the tipping point after which the water availability will start decreasing in this regard transient simulation of the glacier mass conservation and area changes instead of assumed scenarios need to be incorporated in the present day watershed models since small changes in the westerly and monsoonal precipitation directly affect the nival and pluvial regimes of the himalayan basins the climate change induced responses of these precipitation regimes at their extreme margins over the study basin further needs to be assessed under a variety of climate change scenarios further assessing the overall future water availability based on several hydrological models can further improve our understanding of the model associated uncertainties and the robustness of the results despite the downstream water availability in pakistan is projected to rise under higher warming scenarios owing to enhanced melting of the himalayan glaciers burgeoning population can still designate the country as water stressed an increased water availability also emphasizes on increasing the presently depleting water storage capacity for the better management of irrigation and hydropower generation and for combating the hydrological disasters these results provide an overall picture of the surface water availability in pakistan under the aspirations of the paris agreement 2015 and can inform on policy decisions together with the country s first ever national water policy approved lately acknowledgements the work was funded by the deutsche
