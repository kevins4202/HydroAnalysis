17835,this study provides an insight into the prevalence of fluoro quinolones fqs and their specific quinolone qnrs resistance gene in the avon river catchment area receiving treated wastewater from 5 wastewater treatment plants wwtps serving 1 5 million people and accounting for 75 of inhabitants living in the catchment area in the south west of england ofloxacin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid and norfloxacin were found to be ubiquitous with daily loads reaching a few hundred g day in wastewater influent and tens of g day in receiving waters this was in contrast to other fqs analysed flumequine nadifloxacin lomefloxacin ulifloxacin prulifloxacin besifloxacin and moxifloxacin which were hardly quantified enantiomeric profiling revealed that ofloxacin was enriched with the s enantiomer likely deriving from its prescription as the more potent enantiomerically pure levofloxacin alongside racemic ofloxacin while ofloxacin s enantiomeric fraction ef remained constant high stereoselectivity was observed in the case of its metabolite ofloxacin n oxide the removal efficiency of quinolones during wastewater treatment at 5 wwtps utilising either trickling filters tf or activated sludge as was compound and wastewater treatment process dependent with as providing better efficiency than tf the qnrs resistance gene was ubiquitous in wastewater its removal was wwtp treatment process dependent with tf performing best and resulting in significant removal of the gene from 28 to 75 as underperformed with only 9 removal in the case of activated sludge and actual increase in the gene copy number within sequencing batch reactors sbrs interestingly the data suggests that higher removal of antibiotics could be linked with high prevalence of the gene sbr and wwtp e and vice versa low removal of antibiotic is correlated with lower prevalence of the gene in wastewater effluent tf wwtp b and d this is especially prominent in the case of ofloxacin and could indicate that as might be facilitating antimicrobial resistance amr prevalence to higher extent than tf wastewater based epidemiology wbe was also applied to monitor any potential misuse e g direct disposal of fqs in the catchment in most cases higher use of antibiotics with respect to official statistics i e ciprofloxacin ofloxacin was observed which suggests that fqs management practice require further attention graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoroquinolones amr resistance genes wastewater environment 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr is considered to be one of the most significant threats worldwide defined as the ability of a population of microorganisms to neutralise the effect of an antimicrobial drug amr is a natural process that has been greatly accelerated by misuse of available antimicrobials with limited innovation in drug discovery for new antibiotics current strategies are directed to monitor the usage of antibiotics a key factor that plays a fundamental role in amr is microbial exposure to antibiotics rizzo et al 2013 indeed such exposure at sub lethal concentrations could lead to selective advantages for certain resistant strains in particular those containing antibiotic resistant genes args and enhance the possibilities of their survival development and spread a number of resistance mechanisms are acknowledged such as mutation of existing dna dna exchange by vertical transmission or by horizontal gene transfer that can occur by i transformation ii transduction and iii exchange of conjugative plasmids between bacteria that are physically connected the latter mechanism is the most common in nature grohmann et al 2003 along with hospitals well known hotspots for the spread of amr are wastewater treatment plants wwtps rizzo et al 2013 this results from the exposure of microbial communities living in the reservoir of the wwtp to sub inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics contained in the sewage from households pharmaceutical plants and hospitals therefore the chances for a microorganism to gain such exposure and survive are likely to encourage horizontal gene transfer and the development of amr some studies have reported evidence that these environmental hotspots coincide with an increased level of antibiotic resistance genes args like in the case of waters receiving effluent from pharmaceutical plants others have found that biocides and metals are also fundamental amr drivers singer et al 2016 antibiotics are often chiral molecules and in such cases are frequently marketed as racemates as 1 1 ratio of enantiomers in each enantiomeric pair or as enantiomerically pure eutomers enantiomers of the same drug despite having the same physicochemical properties differ in the spatial arrangement of enantiomers which results in diverse interactions not only at the molecular level but also at the biological level where differences in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic responses could occur the fact that enantiomers stereoselectively react with biological systems that are chiral themselves e g enzymes is carefully monitored in pharmaceutical legislation and policy unfortunately the awareness that such differing interactions could occur in the environment is limited this is mainly due to lack of research and unavailability of analytical methods allowing for analysis at the enantiomeric level indeed during its environmental life cycle a chiral antibiotic could alter its stereoisomeric composition during wwtp processes and in the environment the impact of stereochemistry on the environmental fate and effects of several chiral contaminants is well demonstrated examples include illicit drugs beta blockers and antidepressants castrignanò et al 2017 evans et al 2017 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 it has been proven that stereoselective transformation together with enantiomer dependent ecotoxicity frequently occur in the environment rice et al 2018 moreover the formation of enantiomers not believed to exist in nature such as 1s 2r ephedrine was also reported during wastewater treatment kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 despite these findings there is a gap in the knowledge of the environmental fate of chiral antibiotics a pioneering study highlighted alterations in the enantiomeric composition of ofloxacin in receiving waters after the wastewater effluent discharge point enriched with s enantiomer with respect to the initial racemic composition in the upstream waters castrignanò et al 2018 hence such an effect could influence activity and toxicity of the chiral antibiotic in the environment as a result tackling issues of stereoisomerism of chiral antibiotics in the urban water cycle and in the surrounding environment is of utmost relevance as it could also affect the interactions with microbes living in the wwtp and receiving waters with possible effects on amr evolution and spread this paper aimed to i verify occurrence and stereoselective bio physicochemical transformation of fqs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters ii verify occurrence and fate of fluoroquinolone fq resistance qnrs gene during wastewater treatment and in receiving water iii estimate public exposure to fqs and qnrs using wastewater based epidemiology wbe quinolones were selected as the target compounds as they satisfy a number of criteria to first attempt the realisation of the above objectives i they are extensively used globally in the treatment of a wide range of illness including urinary tract respiratory and gastrointestinal infections ii previous studies have detected quinolones in urban wastewater with concentrations up to microgram per litre rizzo et al 2013 iii due to their wide use the quinolone resistance rate has increased since 1990s aldred et al 2014 iv the world health organization who has included them in the list of highest priority critically important antimicrobials for human medicine world health organization 2016 and v many quinolones exist as

loaded onto the digital pcr load blades and distributed in high density nanofluidic pcr chips that were loaded onto a geneamp pcr 9700 system the program was run using thermal cycling conditions temperature was first ramped to 95 c and held for 10 min it was then lowered to 60 c for 2 min before increasing to 98 c for 30 s this cycle between 60 c and 98 c was repeated 40 times to allow for efficient gene amplification the system was then lowered being to 60 c and held for 2 min before cooling to room temperature after cooling each chip was processed using the quantstudio 3d digital pcr system analysissuitetm software was used to quantify the targeted gene and to undertake statistical analysis of the results 2 4 calculations in order to obtain daily mass loads the concentrations of analytes expressed in ng l 1 tables s8 s12 were multiplied by the flow rate l day 1 and then normalised by the population size of the catchment area fqs and qnrs gene removal during wastewater treatment expressed as a percentage was calculated by considering hydraulic retention time and the difference between the influent load and the effluent load in relation to the influent load all data was treated statistically using excel results from digital pcr analysis were given as copies μl 1 table s13 in order to obtain daily copy loads qnrs copies expressed in copies day 1 were multiplied by the flow rate l day 1 and then normalised by the population size of the catchment area concentrations of the analytes in spm from influent wastewater during the monitoring week are gathered in tables s14 s18 3 results and discussion 3 1 fqs during wastewater treatment activated sludge vs trickling filters technology 3 1 1 occurrence of fqs in wastewater ofloxacin and its metabolites in the investigated catchment area the highest loads among chiral quinolones were found for ofloxacin in influent wastewater from wwtp e indeed the total average load was found at 53 14 g day 1 ten times higher than in other wwtps fig 2 to assess whether stereoselective enrichment or depletion of the enantiomeric composition of the drug occurred the enantiomeric fraction ef was used as a dimensionless indicator of i the equal amount of two enantiomers in the case of ef 0 5 or ii the predominance of one enantiomer with respect to the other in the case of ef 0 5 predominance of s ofloxacin or 0 5 predominance of r enantiomer fig 2 efofloxacin was found with an average value of 0 13 0 07 in influent samples from wwtp a 0 26 0 03 in wwtp e 0 28 0 05 in wwtp c 0 36 0 02 in wwtp d and 0 40 0 03 in wwtp b this signifies that a high proportion of ofloxacin was present as the s enantiomer likely deriving from the prescription of enantiomerically pure isomer levofloxacin that is more potent than r ofloxacin al omar and mohammed 2009 average effluent loads were found to be considerably lower than influent in the majority of the sites with expected high levels observed at 21 4 g day 1 for wwtp e no significant change in ef was observed across all wwtps efwwtp a e unvaried efwwtp b 0 32 0 03 efwwtp c 0 32 0 04 and efwwtp d 0 34 0 01 signifying that the wastewater treatment process had no impact in altering the enantiomeric composition the presence of ofloxacin metabolites had a more scattered profile in the studied wwtps figs 3 and 5 ofloxacin n oxide was present at an average load of 0 2 and 3 8 g day 1 in influent wastewater from wwtp a and e most likely due to human metabolism fig 4 this was confirmed by wbe estimated ofloxacin n oxide load 0 2 4 0 g day 1 based on measured daily loads of ofloxacin in wastewater table 2 in effluent ofloxacin n oxide was found at quantifiable average load of 0 9 g day 1 only in wwtp e fig 4 in wwtp b c and d ofloxacin n oxide was present in both matrices but still below the method limit of quantification mql whilst it was not detected in effluent samples from wwtp a the enantiomeric composition favoured the s enantiomer in influent wastewater at wwtp a ef 0 and wwtp e ef 0 22 it is important to highlight that efofloxacin n oxide from effluent wwtp e was 0 45 0 03 showing that the enantiomeric composition was likely altered during the wastewater treatment process s desmethyl ofloxacin was detected but was not quantifiable in all influent and effluent samples from wwtp a r desmethyl ofloxacin was at mql in a couple of influent and effluent samples fig 3 in wwtp b desmethyl ofloxacin was found at 0 33 g day 1 only in one influent sample with a slight predominance of the s enantiomer in wwtp c s desmethyl ofloxacin reached the average load of 0 7 g day 1 in influent and 0 4 g day 1 in effluent whilst r desmethyl ofloxacin was mql in wwtp d s desmethyl ofloxacin reached the average load of 0 1 g day 1 in influent and 0 05 g day 1 in effluent whilst r desmethyl ofloxacin was found at 0 03 g day 1 in influent and in the same amount from one day in effluent wastewater in wwtp e desmethyl ofloxacin was not detected in any analysed samples interestingly the analysis of the spm from all the sites indicated ofloxacin s partitioning to solids with higher levels recorded for the s enantiomer fig 5 ofloxacin s metabolites were not detected in spm due to their high polarity ciprofloxacin and its metabolites ciprofloxacin a non chiral fq was detected in all collected samples fig 2 its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin was also present in most analysed samples the average influent concentration of ciprofloxacin was 427 86 ng l 1 that corresponded to a load of 65 8 g day 1 there was a significant decrease in load from influent to effluent i e average effluent load was 22 3 g day 1 fig 2 wastewater influent derived spm average daily loads were much lower and spanned from 0 01 wwtp b to 0 3 wwtp d g day 1 fig 5 nalidixic acid the highest loads of nalidixic acid were recorded in wwtp e 4 9 1 3 g day 1 followed by wwtp c 0 8 0 0 g day 1 and then wwtp b a d with loads 0 09 0 07 and 0 01 g day 1 respectively the removal efficiency of nalidixic acid was site dependent and spanned between 38 and 82 due to varying removal of nalidixic acid from wastewater effluent loads varied from 1 8 0 5 g day 1 at wwtp d 2 4 0 5 g day 1 at wwtpc and 3 1 0 2 g day 1 at wwtp a and reached the highest levels at wwtp e 12 6 5 1 g day 1 fig 2 nalidixic acid was quantified in influent wastewater spm from wwtp a and e only and spanned from 0 001 to 0 1 g day 1 in wwtp a and e respectively fig 5 norfloxacin norfloxacin was quantified in wastewater influent at three sites only wwtp d b and e with average daily loads spanning from 0 6 0 4 g day 1 at wwtp d through 1 4 0 4 g day 1 at wwtp b to 98 4 60 g day 1 at wwtp e wwtp removal was in the range 19 wwtp e to 75 wwtp c which lead to daily loads in effluent denoting 0 4 0 1 g day 1 at wwtp d 0 9 0 3 g day 1 at wwtp b to 29 5 3 g day 1 at wwtp e fig 2 norfloxacin was quantified in influent wastewater spm from wwtp b only with daily loads at 0 11 0 05 g day 1 fig 5 flumequine flumequine was found in all sites interestingly with a different enantiomeric signature for each site in wwtp a and b the e1 enantiomer was at mql in influent liquid phase but quantifiable in effluent samples with a load average of 0 1 g day 1 for both sites e2 enantiomer was barely detected in both matrices in wwtp c e1 enantiomer was detected in influent and quantified more frequently than e2 with a load average of 0 3 g day 1 both enantiomers were at mql in all effluent samples in wwtp d e1 enantiomer was quantified in all influent and effluent wastewater samples with an average load of 0 03 g day 1 while e2 was mostly mql hence ef could not be calculated in wwtp e e1 enantiomer was quantified only in two influent samples and it was present at an average load of 1 1 g day 1 in effluent samples while e2 was not found in any of the two matrices tabs s10 14 interestingly flumequine was the most prevalent fqn in spm derived from influent wastewater this is likely due to its relatively high hydrophobicity table s2 flumequine was quantified at average daily loads of 7 g day 1 average ef across four wwtps denoted 0 8 indicating a significant enrichment of flumequine with e1 enantiomer likely due to stereoselective human metabolism as flumequine is marketed as a racemate fig 5 other fqs s s moxifloxacin and moxifloxacin n sulfate were detected only in wwtp d in a few samples from influent and effluent nadifloxacin was found at mql only in influent samples from wwtp b in wwtp c the first eluting enantiomer was detected more frequently than the second one in influent samples whilst it was more consistently detected in effluent samples an analogue profile was seen in wwtp e lomefloxacin was only found in wwtp c at quantifiable amounts in three effluent samples whilst it was not detected in influent samples tables s10 14 prulifloxacin ulifloxacin and r besifloxacin have not been detected in the catchment area investigated 3 1 2 fate of fqs during wastewater treatment the following wwtp treatment technologies are used in studied wwtps tf wwtp b c and d or as wwtp a and sbr wwtp e table 1 the sewer residence time along with features of the treatment process such as solid retention time and hydraulic retention time are also included in table 1 hydraulic retention time varied from 11 h wwtp e to 46 h wwtp a and solid retention time was from 4 h wwtp e to 19 h wwtp a these two parameters are widely regarded as being of primary importance for the fqs removal batt et al 2007 gao et al 2012 li et al 2013 fig 6 summarises the removal efficiency of target quinolones in this study the sorption on as is the main mechanism involved in the removal process of fqs from wastewater conkle et al 2010 golet et al 2003 jia et al 2012 followed by biodegradation whose roles in the prevalence and dissemination of amr are not yet fully understood van doorslaer et al 2014 sorption is more highly influenced and driven by electrostatic interactions rather than hydrophobic partitioning golet et al 2003 lindberg and olofsson 2006 tolls and technology 2001 due to the amphoterism of fqs such as ofloxacin norfloxacin and moxifloxacin partitioning is also ph dependent langlois et al 2005 takács novák et al 1992 van doorslaer et al 2014 kümmerer 2008 and influenced by the salinity of the water phase van doorslaer et al 2014 the results of this study indicate that the removal efficiency of fqs is compound and wastewater treatment process dependent fig 6 ciprofloxacin showed the highest removal efficiency during trickling filters treatment 38 73 in wwtps b d vs 15 64 in wwtps a and e while ofloxacin showed the highest removal during as treatment 22 62 in wwtps b d vs 57 75 in wwtps a and e nalidixic acid and norfloxacin showed better removal during as than tf treatment no clear stereoselectivity was observed in the case of chiral ofloxacin 3 1 3 occurrence of qnrs gene during wastewater treatment as highlighted by van doorslaer et al 2014 fqs can induce the amr phenomenon in microbial communities present in the environment as these drugs are excreted unchanged up to 70 with only a small proportion being metabolised three mechanisms for the development of resistance have been described in literature these are caused by mutations leading to i target site alterations and ii decreased drug accumulations due to a change in the membrane permeability and iii by horizontal gene transfer carrying qnr gene like in the case of plasmids that are mobile quinolone resistance elements ruiz 2003 jacoby 2005 the latter mechanism of resistance to fqs results from the binding between the qnr protein and the target topoisomerase that avoids the action of the antibiotic on the targeted enzyme redgrave et al 2014 examples of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes are from i the families of qnr genes qnrb qnrs etc ii a variant of an aminoglycoside acetyl transferase aac 6 ib cr and iii the efflux systems that can remove the drug through the usage of transporters i e oqxab and qepa redgrave et al 2014 in this study the targeted resistance gene was qnrs because of i its reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones as stated elsewhere rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 marti et al 2014 and ii its prevalence in environmental matrices as reported in previous studies castrignanò et al 2018 marti et al 2016 in this study in order to verify whether the level of resistance gene detected in the different areas of the catchment corresponds with estimated quinolone loads the qnrs gene extracted from the dna contained in the wastewater samples was quantified through the use of digital pcr table s13 fig 7 shows the concentration of the gene qnrs in influent and effluent wastewater collected at sites a e during one monitoring week the results confirm previous published findings indicating that resistant genes are present in wastewater marti et al 2016 overall a higher absolute copy number of qnrs gene was observed in this study with respect to findings in rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 interestingly the fate of the qnrs gene was different in different wwtps with tfs wwtp b c and d performing best and resulting in significant removal of the gene from 28 to 75 as and sbrs underperformed with only 9 removal of qnrs gene in the case of as and actual increase of the number of copies of the gene during sbr interestingly the data suggests that higher removal of antibiotic is linked with low removal of the gene sbr and wwtp e and vice versa low removal of antibiotic is correlated with lower prevalence of the gene in wastewater effluent tf wwtp b and d this is especially prominent in the case of ofloxacin and could indicate that as might be facilitating amr prevalence to higher extent than tf 3 2 the catchment perspective the potential contamination of receiving waters by antibiotics and args is highly influenced by a number of variables dependent on i the nature and the physico chemical properties of the compounds ii the environmental conditions such as the temperature and the effect of sunlight and iii the loads of pharmaceuticals and therefore their dilution due to rainfall discharge by wwtps and the technology of treatment used for their removal baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 in this study a clear trend of increasing antibiotic concentration levels and corresponding antibiotic loads was observed with an increase of treated communal wastewater discharge especially for samples collected downstream from wastewater discharge points fig 8 interestingly the qnrs gene was not quantifiable in receiving water samples with the method used there are several possible reasons including analytical constraints as well as dilution of wastewater effluent with receiving waters as discussed in section 3 1 qnrs gene concentration levels remained fairly constant in all wwtps quinolone concentrations varied across wwtps i e the highest total concentration levels were observed at wwtp e and the lowest in wwtp b fig 7 but no clear pattern was observed when comparing antibiotic and gene concentration levels however normalisation of data to account for water flows revealed a strong correlation between daily loads of antibiotics present in each wwtp and corresponding loads of resistance genes the highest loads of both fqs and arg were observed in wastewater influent from site e followed by c a b and d interestingly this coincides with the size of a population served by individual wwtps it is therefore evident that the higher the population the larger the load of both fqs and args the efficiency of wastewater treatment is another key variable influencing environmental fqs and arg loads our study has shown that tf although are not as effective in the removal of fqs they do remove args in contrast as process also in sbr configuration effectively removes fqs but also contributes to higher levels of args 3 3 wastewater based epidemiology wbe was applied to estimate usage of antibiotics across the catchment antibiotic usage data obtained via wastewater analysis were then analysed against prescription data to highlight any misuse of quinolones we have also applied this approach in a european study castrignanò et al 2020 where spatiotemporal changes in quinolone usage across different european cities were observed this study covers 75 of the population 1 5 million people residing in five urban areas cities a e served by the selected five major wwtps which allows for comprehensive understanding of the quinolones usage in the study area table 2 where possible metabolites were considered as biomarkers of antibiotic consumption ofloxacin indeed ofloxacin is mostly excreted unchanged in urine 90 but it also undergoes metabolism in humans to form ofloxacin n oxide and desmethyl ofloxacin therefore these two metabolites were selected alongside ofloxacin as biomarkers this is despite their low excretion rate i e 1 5 as ofloxacin n oxide and 3 6 as desmethyl ofloxacin ofloxacin is a chiral fq in which the s enantiomer is significantly more potent as an antibiotic in 2015 212 kg of ofloxacin and 120 kg of s ofloxacin were prescribed in england according to pca data http www nhsbsa nhs uk prescriptionservices 3494 aspx taking into account the urinary excretion the annual excreted amounts of r ofloxacin and s ofloxacin were calculated as 87 5 kg and 186 5 kg respectively in particular the latter calculation considered the excreted contribution from the racemate formulation i e 87 5 kg and the one from the pure s drug i e 99 kg hence the consumption estimates from pca data were 4 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 8 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin the estimates from wastewater analysis were fully in agreement with the nhs data only in city d served by wwtp d 5 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 8 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin estimates were lower in the case of city b wwtp b with 2 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin whilst they were much higher in city e wwtp e 18 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 51 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin in the cities served by wwtps a and c the estimates showed that s ofloxacin usage was much higher i e 42 and 24 mg day 1 1000 people 1 respectively than the r ofloxacin i e 6 and 10 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin the analysis of the data indicates that the ratio of the two enantiomers r s is 1 2 in most sites investigated which indicates similar prescription habits only one site city c wwtp c revealed the dominance of the s enantiomer which demonstrates that the enantiopure formulation levofloxacin was used and it was seven times higher when compared to other sites with regard to the metabolic pattern 2 and 4 kg were respectively excreted as r and s form of the metabolites the official national estimates were in agreement with estimates from ofloxacin n oxide as drug target residue dtr for the site served by wwtp b and slightly lower for wwtps c and d the estimates were higher for wwtp e i e 43 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 177 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin and wwtp a 91 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin the estimates from desmethyl ofloxacin used as dtr were above in four sites over five with exception for wwtp e in which there was no detection of the metabolite it could be concluded from the metabolic profiling data that levofloxacin was highly consumed with respect to national prescription data and that the estimation of ofloxacin usage with wbe benefits from the metabolite estimates when they are both used as ofloxacin dtrs ciprofloxacin as previously mentioned ciprofloxacin was found at the highest loads in wastewater the biomarkers used were ciprofloxacin itself and its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin in 2015 5782 kg of ciprofloxacin were prescribed in england according to pca http www nhsbsa nhs uk prescriptionservices 3494 aspx as a result of human metabolism ciprofloxacin is excreted as unchanged 40 50 and as desethylene ciprofloxacin 2 3 therefore 2602 kg of ciprofloxacin and 116 kg of desethylene ciprofloxacin were calculated as excreted quantities hence ciprofloxacin consumption was estimated at 115 mg day 1 1000 people 1 the estimates calculated from wastewater analysis were below this estimate only in city b served by wwtp b 77 mg day 1 1000 people 1 and were much higher in cities d and e 160 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in city e wwtp e 256 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in city d wwtp d using ciprofloxacin as dtr by using desethylene ciprofloxacin data were in agreement with consumption of ciprofloxacin table s19 therefore as estimates from wastewater data were higher than those from official prescription sources veterinary usage needed to be accounted for as another source of ciprofloxacin indeed enrofloxacin a veterinary synthetic fluoroquinolone is metabolised to ciprofloxacin and therefore it could considerably enhance ciprofloxacin levels in the environment ciprofloxacin in conjunction with desethylene ciprofloxacin were therefore considered suitable for biomarkers of ciprofloxacin use other fqs wbe highlighted spatial differences in i norfloxacin and ii moxifloxacin uses in the same catchment area norfloxacin is a fq that was selected as a biomarker for its usage 25 40 of its dose is excreted in urine and 5 10 as several metabolites within 24 48 h whilst 30 is excreted in faeces within 48 h 1 1 kg of norfloxacin were prescribed in england in 2015 and national consumption was estimated in the range of 0 1 mg day 1 1000 people 1 the estimates from wastewater analysis were much higher in cities b d and e and denoted 61 101 and 172 mg day 1 1000 people 1 respectively whilst in cities a c norfloxacin was not detected at all the biomarkers chosen for moxifloxacin were the parent compound s s moxifloxacin and its sulfate metabolite r r moxifloxacin is not prescribed and was monitored in order to ensure that no chiral inversion occurs in the environment therefore it was not used for wbe calculations from pca 39 6 kg were prescribed and the relative consumption was estimated at 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 by considering excretion of 20 and 25 as unchanged in urine and in faeces respectively and 35 as sulfate in faeces similar estimates from wastewater analysis were 16 and 17 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in two sites only corresponding to wwtps d and e respectively an overall agreement of estimates between official pca data and wastewater analysis was observed in the case of nalidixic acid consumption the parent compound was used as dtr this choice was also supported by the hypothesis that in wastewater faecal bacteria might hydrolyse the glucuronide conjugates highly formed during the metabolism and thus release the nalidixic acid its metabolism produces also glucuronides of 7 hydroxynalidixic acid 2 3 as unchanged but they were not taken into account in this study national official consumption estimates for nalidixic acid were 0 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in the majority of the sites similar estimates were calculated average load of 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 with exception for the site served by wwtp e average load of 14 mg day 1 1000 people 1 the prodrug prulifloxacin was not prescribed according to pca data and as confirmed by wastewater analysis neither prulifloxacin nor its active compound ulifloxacin were detected in the wastewater samples lomefloxacin was also not prescribed and data from wastewater analysis were overall in agreement in all the sites in wwtp b it was detected mql only in one day therefore estimates were not considered 4 conclusions this study focussed on understanding stereoselective spatiotemporal speciation of fqs and the corresponding quinolone qnrs resistance gene in a river catchment in sw england the conclusions are as follows 1 ofloxacin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid and norfloxacin were ubiquitous in the studied catchment with daily loads in the river reaching tens of g day 1 in receiving water and a few hundred g day 1 in wastewater influent other fqs studied flumequine nadifloxacin lomefloxacin ulifloxacin prulifloxacin besifloxacin and moxifloxacin were undetected 2 ofloxacin was present in the catchment as the s enantiomer likely deriving from the prescription of enantiomerically pure and much more potent levofloxacin alongside racemic ofloxacin while efofloxacin remained constant high stereoselectivity was observed for its metabolite ofloxacin n oxide 3 the removal efficiency of quinolones during wastewater treatment is compound and wastewater treatment process dependent ciprofloxacin showed the highest removal efficiency during tf treatment while ofloxacin showed the highest removal during as treatment no stereoselectivity in degradation was observed 4 the fluoroquinolone resistance gene qnrs was ubiquitous in wastewater its removal was wwtp treatment process dependent with tf performing best and resulting in significant removal of the gene from 28 to 75 activated sludge and sbrs underperformed with only 9 removal in the case of activated sludge and actual enrichment of the gene during sbr interestingly the data suggests that higher removal of antibiotic is linked with low removal higher prevalence of the gene sbr and wwtp e and vice versa low removal of antibiotic is correlated with lower prevalence of the gene in wastewater effluent tf wwtp b and d this is especially prominent in the case of ofloxacin and could indicate that as might be facilitating amr prevalence to higher extent than tf 5 wbe estimates showed higher use of s ofloxacin vs racemic ofloxacin in the studied area ciprofloxacin that was found with the highest load among quinolones was present in higher amounts with respect to official statistics wbe highlighted spatial differences in norfloxacin and moxifloxacin uses in the catchment area an overall agreement of estimates between official pca data and wastewater analysis was observed in the case of nalidixic

17835,this study provides an insight into the prevalence of fluoro quinolones fqs and their specific quinolone qnrs resistance gene in the avon river catchment area receiving treated wastewater from 5 wastewater treatment plants wwtps serving 1 5 million people and accounting for 75 of inhabitants living in the catchment area in the south west of england ofloxacin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid and norfloxacin were found to be ubiquitous with daily loads reaching a few hundred g day in wastewater influent and tens of g day in receiving waters this was in contrast to other fqs analysed flumequine nadifloxacin lomefloxacin ulifloxacin prulifloxacin besifloxacin and moxifloxacin which were hardly quantified enantiomeric profiling revealed that ofloxacin was enriched with the s enantiomer likely deriving from its prescription as the more potent enantiomerically pure levofloxacin alongside racemic ofloxacin while ofloxacin s enantiomeric fraction ef remained constant high stereoselectivity was observed in the case of its metabolite ofloxacin n oxide the removal efficiency of quinolones during wastewater treatment at 5 wwtps utilising either trickling filters tf or activated sludge as was compound and wastewater treatment process dependent with as providing better efficiency than tf the qnrs resistance gene was ubiquitous in wastewater its removal was wwtp treatment process dependent with tf performing best and resulting in significant removal of the gene from 28 to 75 as underperformed with only 9 removal in the case of activated sludge and actual increase in the gene copy number

antibiotic is correlated with lower prevalence of the gene in wastewater effluent tf wwtp b and d this is especially prominent in the case of ofloxacin and could indicate that as might be facilitating antimicrobial resistance amr prevalence to higher extent than tf wastewater based epidemiology wbe was also applied to monitor any potential misuse e g direct disposal of fqs in the catchment in most cases higher use of antibiotics with respect to official statistics i e ciprofloxacin ofloxacin was observed which suggests that fqs management practice require further attention graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoroquinolones amr resistance genes wastewater environment 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance amr is considered to be one of the most significant threats worldwide defined as the ability of a population of microorganisms to neutralise the effect of an antimicrobial drug amr is a natural process that has been greatly accelerated by misuse of available antimicrobials with limited innovation in drug discovery for new antibiotics current strategies are directed to monitor the usage of antibiotics a key factor that plays a fundamental role in amr is microbial exposure to antibiotics rizzo et al 2013 indeed such exposure at sub lethal concentrations could lead to selective advantages for certain resistant strains in particular those containing antibiotic resistant genes args and enhance the possibilities of their survival development and spread a number of resistance mechanisms are acknowledged such as mutation of existing dna dna exchange by vertical transmission or by horizontal gene transfer that can occur by i transformation ii transduction and iii exchange of conjugative plasmids between bacteria that are physically connected the latter mechanism is the most common in nature grohmann et al 2003 along with hospitals well known hotspots for the spread of amr are wastewater treatment plants wwtps rizzo et al 2013 this results from the exposure of microbial communities living in the reservoir of the wwtp to sub inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics contained in the sewage from households pharmaceutical plants and hospitals therefore the chances for a microorganism to gain such exposure and survive are likely to encourage horizontal gene transfer and the development of amr some studies have reported evidence that these environmental hotspots coincide with an increased level of antibiotic resistance genes args like in the case of waters receiving effluent from pharmaceutical plants others have found that biocides and metals are also fundamental amr drivers singer et al 2016 antibiotics are often chiral molecules and in such cases are frequently marketed as racemates as 1 1 ratio of enantiomers in each enantiomeric pair or as enantiomerically pure eutomers enantiomers of the same drug despite having the same physicochemical properties differ in the spatial arrangement of enantiomers which results in diverse interactions not only at the molecular level but also at the biological level where differences in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic responses could occur the fact that enantiomers stereoselectively react with biological systems that are chiral themselves e g enzymes is carefully monitored in pharmaceutical legislation and policy unfortunately the awareness that such differing interactions could occur in the environment is limited this is mainly due to lack of research and unavailability of analytical methods allowing for analysis at the enantiomeric level indeed during its environmental life cycle a chiral antibiotic could alter its stereoisomeric composition during wwtp processes and in the environment the impact of stereochemistry on the environmental fate and effects of several chiral contaminants is well demonstrated examples include illicit drugs beta blockers and antidepressants castrignanò et al 2017 evans et al 2017 kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 it has been proven that stereoselective transformation together with enantiomer dependent ecotoxicity frequently occur in the environment rice et al 2018 moreover the formation of enantiomers not believed to exist in nature such as 1s 2r ephedrine was also reported during wastewater treatment kasprzyk hordern and baker 2012 despite these findings there is a gap in the knowledge of the environmental fate of chiral antibiotics a pioneering study highlighted alterations in the enantiomeric composition of ofloxacin in receiving waters after the wastewater effluent discharge point enriched with s enantiomer with respect to the initial racemic composition in the upstream waters castrignanò et al 2018 hence such an effect could influence activity and toxicity of the chiral antibiotic in the environment as a result tackling issues of stereoisomerism of chiral antibiotics in the urban water cycle and in the surrounding environment is of utmost relevance as it could also affect the interactions with microbes living in the wwtp and receiving waters with possible effects on amr evolution and spread this paper aimed to i verify occurrence and stereoselective bio physicochemical transformation of fqs during wastewater treatment and in receiving waters ii verify occurrence and fate of fluoroquinolone fq resistance qnrs gene during wastewater treatment and in receiving water iii estimate public exposure to fqs and qnrs using wastewater based epidemiology wbe quinolones were selected as the target compounds as they satisfy a number of criteria to first attempt the realisation of the above objectives i they are extensively used globally in the treatment of a wide range of illness including urinary tract respiratory and gastrointestinal infections ii previous studies have detected quinolones in urban wastewater with concentrations up to microgram per litre rizzo et al 2013 iii due to their wide use the quinolone resistance rate has increased since 1990s aldred et al 2014 iv the world health organization who has included them in the list of highest priority critically important antimicrobials for human medicine world health organization 2016 and v many quinolones exist as

reported in castrignanò et al 2018 by using stereoisomerically pure standard solutions s ofloxacin also known as levofloxacin r r moxifloxacin s s moxifloxacin and s s moxifloxacin n sulfate the following deuterated and isotopic analogues of target analytes were used as isotopically labelled internal standards ciprofloxacin d8 ofloxacin d3 desmethyl ofloxacin d8 and flumequine 13c3 standard stock solutions were prepared at 1 mg ml 1 in methanol for all the analytes with exception of prulifloxacin ulifloxacin ofloxacin d3 and flumequine 13c3 that were dissolved in acetonitrile and lomefloxacin desethylene ciprofloxacin ciprofloxacin d8 and desmethyl ofloxacin d8 that were dissolved in water mixed working solutions containing all analytes were prepared from stock solutions by dilution with mobile phase they were used for the preparation of the aqueous standard calibration solutions and for spiking samples stock and working solutions of standards were stored at 20 c hplc grade methanol acetonitrile ammonium formate and formic acid 96 were purchased from sigma aldrich uk ultrapure water was obtained from a milliq system uk all glassware was deactivated in order to prevent the adsorption of polar compounds to the hydroxyl sites on the glass surface the deactivation process consisted of rinsing cycles with 5 dimethyldichlorosilane in toluene once with toluene

s14 s18 3 results and discussion 3 1 fqs during wastewater treatment activated sludge vs trickling filters technology 3 1 1 occurrence of fqs in wastewater ofloxacin and its metabolites in the investigated catchment area the highest loads among chiral quinolones were found for ofloxacin in influent wastewater from wwtp e indeed the total average load was found at 53 14 g day 1 ten times higher than in other wwtps fig 2 to assess whether stereoselective enrichment or depletion of the enantiomeric composition of the drug occurred the enantiomeric fraction ef was used as a dimensionless indicator of i the equal amount of two enantiomers in the case of ef 0 5 or ii the predominance of one enantiomer with respect to the other in the case of ef 0 5 predominance of s ofloxacin or 0 5 predominance of r enantiomer fig 2 efofloxacin was found with an average value of 0 13 0 07 in influent samples from wwtp a 0 26 0 03 in wwtp e 0 28 0 05 in wwtp c 0 36 0 02 in wwtp d and 0 40 0 03 in wwtp b this signifies that a high proportion of ofloxacin was present as the s enantiomer likely deriving from the prescription of enantiomerically pure isomer levofloxacin that is more potent than r ofloxacin al omar and mohammed 2009 average effluent loads were found to be considerably lower than influent in the majority of the sites with expected high levels observed at 21 4 g day 1 for wwtp e no significant change in ef was observed across all wwtps efwwtp a e unvaried efwwtp b 0 32 0 03 efwwtp c 0 32 0 04 and efwwtp d 0 34 0 01 signifying that the wastewater treatment process had no impact in altering the enantiomeric composition the presence of ofloxacin metabolites had a more scattered profile in the studied wwtps figs 3 and 5 ofloxacin n oxide was present at an average load of 0 2 and 3 8 g day 1 in influent wastewater from wwtp a and e most likely due to human metabolism fig 4 this was confirmed by wbe estimated ofloxacin n oxide load 0 2 4 0 g day 1 based on measured daily loads of ofloxacin in wastewater table 2 in effluent ofloxacin n oxide was found at quantifiable average load of 0 9 g day 1 only in wwtp e fig 4 in wwtp b c and d ofloxacin n oxide was present in both matrices but still below the method limit of quantification mql whilst it was not detected in effluent samples from wwtp a the enantiomeric composition favoured the s enantiomer in influent wastewater at wwtp a ef 0 and wwtp e ef 0 22 it is important to highlight that efofloxacin n oxide from effluent wwtp e was 0 45 0 03 showing that the enantiomeric composition was likely altered during the wastewater treatment process s desmethyl ofloxacin was detected but was not quantifiable in all influent and effluent samples from wwtp a r desmethyl ofloxacin was at mql in a couple of influent and effluent samples fig 3 in wwtp b desmethyl ofloxacin was found at 0 33 g day 1 only in one influent sample with a slight predominance of the s enantiomer in wwtp c s desmethyl ofloxacin reached the average load of 0 7 g day 1 in influent and 0 4 g day 1 in effluent whilst r desmethyl ofloxacin was mql in wwtp d s desmethyl ofloxacin reached the average load of 0 1 g day 1 in influent and 0 05 g day 1 in effluent whilst r desmethyl ofloxacin was found at 0 03 g day 1 in influent and in the same amount from one day in effluent wastewater in wwtp e desmethyl ofloxacin was not detected in any analysed samples interestingly the analysis of the spm from all the sites indicated ofloxacin s partitioning to solids with higher levels recorded for the s enantiomer fig 5 ofloxacin s metabolites were not detected in spm due to their high polarity ciprofloxacin and its metabolites ciprofloxacin a non chiral fq was detected in all collected samples fig 2 its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin was also present in most analysed samples the average influent concentration of ciprofloxacin was 427 86 ng l 1 that corresponded to a load of 65 8 g day 1 there was a significant decrease in load from influent to effluent i e average effluent load was 22 3 g day 1 fig 2 wastewater influent derived spm average daily loads were much lower and spanned from 0 01 wwtp b to 0 3 wwtp d g day 1 fig 5 nalidixic acid the highest loads of nalidixic acid were recorded in wwtp e 4 9 1 3 g day 1 followed by wwtp c 0 8 0 0 g day 1 and then wwtp b a d with loads 0 09 0 07 and 0 01 g day 1 respectively the removal efficiency of nalidixic acid was site dependent and spanned between 38 and 82 due to varying removal of nalidixic acid from wastewater effluent loads varied from 1 8 0 5 g day 1 at wwtp d 2 4 0 5 g day 1 at wwtpc and 3 1 0 2 g day 1 at wwtp a and reached the highest levels at wwtp e 12 6 5 1 g day 1 fig 2 nalidixic acid was quantified in influent wastewater spm from wwtp a and e only and spanned from 0 001 to 0 1 g day 1 in wwtp a and e respectively fig 5 norfloxacin norfloxacin was quantified in wastewater influent at three sites only wwtp d b and e with average daily loads spanning from 0 6 0 4 g day 1 at wwtp d through 1 4 0 4 g day 1 at wwtp b to 98 4 60 g day 1 at wwtp e wwtp removal was in the range 19 wwtp e to 75 wwtp c which lead to daily loads in effluent denoting 0 4 0 1 g day 1 at wwtp d 0 9 0 3 g day 1 at wwtp b to 29 5 3 g day 1 at wwtp e fig 2 norfloxacin was quantified in influent wastewater spm from wwtp b only with daily loads at 0 11 0 05 g day 1 fig 5 flumequine flumequine was found in all sites interestingly with a different enantiomeric signature for each site in wwtp a and b the e1 enantiomer was at mql in influent liquid phase but quantifiable in effluent samples with a load average of 0 1 g day 1 for both sites e2 enantiomer was barely detected in both matrices in wwtp c e1 enantiomer was detected in influent and quantified more frequently than e2 with a load average of 0 3 g day 1 both enantiomers were at mql in all effluent samples in wwtp d e1 enantiomer was quantified in all influent and effluent wastewater samples with an average load of 0 03 g day 1 while e2 was mostly mql hence ef could not be calculated in wwtp e e1 enantiomer was quantified only in two influent samples and it was present at an average load of 1 1 g day 1 in effluent samples while e2 was not found in any of the two matrices tabs s10 14 interestingly flumequine was the most prevalent fqn in spm derived from influent wastewater this is likely due to its relatively high hydrophobicity table s2 flumequine was quantified at average daily loads of 7 g day 1 average ef across four wwtps denoted 0 8 indicating a significant enrichment of flumequine with e1 enantiomer likely due to stereoselective human metabolism as flumequine is marketed as a racemate fig 5 other fqs s s moxifloxacin and moxifloxacin n sulfate were detected only in wwtp d in a few samples from influent and effluent nadifloxacin was found at mql only in influent samples from wwtp b in wwtp c the first eluting enantiomer was detected more frequently than the second one in influent samples whilst it was more consistently detected in effluent samples an analogue profile was seen in wwtp e lomefloxacin was only found in wwtp c at quantifiable amounts in three effluent samples whilst it was not detected in influent samples tables s10 14 prulifloxacin ulifloxacin and r besifloxacin have not been detected in the catchment area investigated 3 1 2 fate of fqs during wastewater treatment the following wwtp treatment technologies are used in studied wwtps tf wwtp b c and d or as wwtp a and sbr wwtp e table 1 the sewer residence time along with features of the treatment process such as solid retention time and hydraulic retention time are also included in table 1 hydraulic retention time varied from 11 h wwtp e to 46 h wwtp a and solid retention time was from 4 h wwtp e to 19 h wwtp a these two parameters are widely regarded as being of primary importance for the fqs removal batt et al 2007 gao et al 2012 li et al 2013 fig 6 summarises the removal efficiency of target quinolones in this study the sorption on as is the main mechanism involved in the removal process of fqs from wastewater conkle et al 2010 golet et al 2003 jia et al 2012 followed by biodegradation whose roles in the prevalence and dissemination of amr are not yet fully understood van doorslaer et al 2014 sorption is more highly influenced and driven by electrostatic interactions rather than hydrophobic partitioning golet et al 2003 lindberg and olofsson 2006 tolls and technology 2001 due to the amphoterism of fqs such as ofloxacin norfloxacin and moxifloxacin partitioning is also ph dependent langlois et al 2005 takács novák et al 1992 van doorslaer et al 2014 kümmerer 2008 and influenced by the salinity of the water phase van doorslaer et al 2014 the results of this study indicate that the removal efficiency of fqs is compound and wastewater treatment process dependent fig 6 ciprofloxacin showed the highest removal efficiency during trickling filters treatment 38 73 in wwtps b d vs 15 64 in wwtps a and e while ofloxacin showed the highest removal during as treatment 22 62 in wwtps b d vs 57 75 in wwtps a and e nalidixic acid and norfloxacin showed better removal during as than tf treatment no clear stereoselectivity was observed in the case of chiral ofloxacin 3 1 3 occurrence of qnrs gene during wastewater treatment as highlighted by van doorslaer et al 2014 fqs can induce the amr phenomenon in microbial communities present in the environment as these drugs are excreted unchanged up to 70 with only a small proportion being metabolised three mechanisms for the development of resistance have been described in literature these are caused by mutations leading to i target site alterations and ii decreased drug accumulations due to a change in the membrane permeability and iii by horizontal gene transfer carrying qnr gene like in the case of plasmids that are mobile quinolone resistance elements ruiz 2003 jacoby 2005 the latter mechanism of resistance to fqs results from the binding between the qnr protein and the target topoisomerase that avoids the action of the antibiotic on the targeted enzyme redgrave et al 2014 examples of plasmid mediated quinolone resistance genes are from i the families of qnr genes qnrb qnrs etc ii a variant of an aminoglycoside acetyl transferase aac 6 ib cr and iii the efflux systems that can remove the drug through the usage of transporters i e oqxab and qepa redgrave et al 2014 in this study the targeted resistance gene was qnrs because of i its reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones as stated elsewhere rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 marti et al 2014 and ii its prevalence in environmental matrices as reported in previous studies castrignanò et al 2018 marti et al 2016 in this study in order to verify whether the level of resistance gene detected in the different areas of the catchment corresponds with estimated quinolone loads the qnrs gene extracted from the dna contained in the wastewater samples was quantified through the use of digital pcr table s13 fig 7 shows the concentration of the gene qnrs in influent and effluent wastewater collected at sites a e during one monitoring week the results confirm previous published findings indicating that resistant genes are present in wastewater marti et al 2016 overall a higher absolute copy number of qnrs gene was observed in this study with respect to findings in rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 interestingly the fate of the qnrs gene was different in different wwtps with tfs wwtp b c and d performing best and resulting in significant removal of the gene from 28 to 75 as and sbrs underperformed with only 9 removal of qnrs gene in the case of as and actual increase of the number of copies of the gene during sbr interestingly the data suggests that higher removal of antibiotic is linked with low removal of the gene sbr and wwtp e and vice versa low removal of antibiotic is correlated with lower prevalence of the gene in wastewater effluent tf wwtp b and d this is especially prominent in the case of ofloxacin and could indicate that as might be facilitating amr prevalence to higher extent than tf 3 2 the catchment perspective the potential contamination of receiving waters by antibiotics and args is highly influenced by a number of variables dependent on i the nature and the physico chemical properties of the compounds ii the environmental conditions such as the temperature and the effect of sunlight and iii the loads of pharmaceuticals and therefore their dilution due to rainfall discharge by wwtps and the technology of treatment used for their removal baker and kasprzyk hordern 2013 in this study a clear trend of increasing antibiotic concentration levels and corresponding antibiotic loads was observed with an increase of treated communal wastewater discharge especially for samples collected downstream from wastewater discharge points fig 8 interestingly the qnrs gene was not quantifiable in receiving water samples with the method used there are several possible reasons including analytical constraints as well as dilution of wastewater effluent with receiving waters as discussed in section 3 1 qnrs gene concentration levels remained fairly constant in all wwtps quinolone concentrations varied across wwtps i e the highest total concentration levels were observed at wwtp e and the lowest in wwtp b fig 7 but no clear pattern was observed when comparing antibiotic and gene concentration levels however normalisation of data to account for water flows revealed a strong correlation between daily loads of antibiotics present in each wwtp and corresponding loads of resistance genes the highest loads of both fqs and arg were observed in wastewater influent from site e followed by c a b and d interestingly this coincides with the size of a population served by individual wwtps it is therefore evident that the higher the population the larger the load of both fqs and args the efficiency of wastewater treatment is another key variable influencing environmental fqs and arg loads our study has shown that tf although are not as effective in the removal of fqs they do remove args in contrast as process also in sbr configuration effectively removes fqs but also contributes to higher levels of args 3 3 wastewater based epidemiology wbe was applied to estimate usage of antibiotics across the catchment antibiotic usage data obtained via wastewater analysis were then analysed against prescription data to highlight any misuse of quinolones we have also applied this approach in a european study castrignanò et al 2020 where spatiotemporal changes in quinolone usage across different european cities were observed this study covers 75 of the population 1 5 million people residing in five urban areas cities a e served by the selected five major wwtps which allows for comprehensive understanding of the quinolones usage in the study area table 2 where possible metabolites were considered as biomarkers of antibiotic consumption ofloxacin indeed ofloxacin is mostly excreted unchanged in urine 90 but it also undergoes metabolism in humans to form ofloxacin n oxide and desmethyl ofloxacin therefore these two metabolites were selected alongside ofloxacin as biomarkers this is despite their low excretion rate i e 1 5 as ofloxacin n oxide and 3 6 as desmethyl ofloxacin ofloxacin is a chiral fq in which the s enantiomer is significantly more potent as an antibiotic in 2015 212 kg of ofloxacin and 120 kg of s ofloxacin were prescribed in england according to pca data http www nhsbsa nhs uk prescriptionservices 3494 aspx taking into account the urinary excretion the annual excreted amounts of r ofloxacin and s ofloxacin were calculated as 87 5 kg and 186 5 kg respectively in particular the latter calculation considered the excreted contribution from the racemate formulation i e 87 5 kg and the one from the pure s drug i e 99 kg hence the consumption estimates from pca data were 4 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 8 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin the estimates from wastewater analysis were fully in agreement with the nhs data only in city d served by wwtp d 5 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 8 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin estimates were lower in the case of city b wwtp b with 2 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin whilst they were much higher in city e wwtp e 18 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 51 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin in the cities served by wwtps a and c the estimates showed that s ofloxacin usage was much higher i e 42 and 24 mg day 1 1000 people 1 respectively than the r ofloxacin i e 6 and 10 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin the analysis of the data indicates that the ratio of the two enantiomers r s is 1 2 in most sites investigated which indicates similar prescription habits only one site city c wwtp c revealed the dominance of the s enantiomer which demonstrates that the enantiopure formulation levofloxacin was used and it was seven times higher when compared to other sites with regard to the metabolic pattern 2 and 4 kg were respectively excreted as r and s form of the metabolites the official national estimates were in agreement with estimates from ofloxacin n oxide as drug target residue dtr for the site served by wwtp b and slightly lower for wwtps c and d the estimates were higher for wwtp e i e 43 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as r ofloxacin and 177 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin and wwtp a 91 mg day 1 1000 people 1 as s ofloxacin the estimates from desmethyl ofloxacin used as dtr were above in four sites over five with exception for wwtp e in which there was no detection of the metabolite it could be concluded from the metabolic profiling data that levofloxacin was highly consumed with respect to national prescription data and that the estimation of ofloxacin usage with wbe benefits from the metabolite estimates when they are both used as ofloxacin dtrs ciprofloxacin as previously mentioned ciprofloxacin was found at the highest loads in wastewater the biomarkers used were ciprofloxacin itself and its metabolite desethylene ciprofloxacin in 2015 5782 kg of ciprofloxacin were prescribed in england according to pca http www nhsbsa nhs uk prescriptionservices 3494 aspx as a result of human metabolism ciprofloxacin is excreted as unchanged 40 50 and as desethylene ciprofloxacin 2 3 therefore 2602 kg of ciprofloxacin and 116 kg of desethylene ciprofloxacin were calculated as excreted quantities hence ciprofloxacin consumption was estimated at 115 mg day 1 1000 people 1 the estimates calculated from wastewater analysis were below this estimate only in city b served by wwtp b 77 mg day 1 1000 people 1 and were much higher in cities d and e 160 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in city e wwtp e 256 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in city d wwtp d using ciprofloxacin as dtr by using desethylene ciprofloxacin data were in agreement with consumption of ciprofloxacin table s19 therefore as estimates from wastewater data were higher than those from official prescription sources veterinary usage needed to be accounted for as another source of ciprofloxacin indeed enrofloxacin a veterinary synthetic fluoroquinolone is metabolised to ciprofloxacin and therefore it could considerably enhance ciprofloxacin levels in the environment ciprofloxacin in conjunction with desethylene ciprofloxacin were therefore considered suitable for biomarkers of ciprofloxacin use other fqs wbe highlighted spatial differences in i norfloxacin and ii moxifloxacin uses in the same catchment area norfloxacin is a fq that was selected as a biomarker for its usage 25 40 of its dose is excreted in urine and 5 10 as several metabolites within 24 48 h whilst 30 is excreted in faeces within 48 h 1 1 kg of norfloxacin were prescribed in england in 2015 and national consumption was estimated in the range of 0 1 mg day 1 1000 people 1 the estimates from wastewater analysis were much higher in cities b d and e and denoted 61 101 and 172 mg day 1 1000 people 1 respectively whilst in cities a c norfloxacin was not detected at all the biomarkers chosen for moxifloxacin were the parent compound s s moxifloxacin and its sulfate metabolite r r moxifloxacin is not prescribed and was monitored in order to ensure that no chiral inversion occurs in the environment therefore it was not used for wbe calculations from pca 39 6 kg were prescribed and the relative consumption was estimated at 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 by considering excretion of 20 and 25 as unchanged in urine and in faeces respectively and 35 as sulfate in faeces similar estimates from wastewater analysis were 16 and 17 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in two sites only corresponding to wwtps d and e respectively an overall agreement of estimates between official pca data and wastewater analysis was observed in the case of nalidixic acid consumption the parent compound was used as dtr this choice was also supported by the hypothesis that in wastewater faecal bacteria might hydrolyse the glucuronide conjugates highly formed during the metabolism and thus release the nalidixic acid its metabolism produces also glucuronides of 7 hydroxynalidixic acid 2 3 as unchanged but they were not taken into account in this study national official consumption estimates for nalidixic acid were 0 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 in the majority of the sites similar estimates were calculated average load of 3 mg day 1 1000 people 1 with exception for the site served by wwtp e average load of 14 mg day 1 1000 people 1 the prodrug prulifloxacin was not prescribed according to pca data and as confirmed by wastewater analysis neither prulifloxacin nor its active compound ulifloxacin were detected in the wastewater samples lomefloxacin was also not prescribed and data from wastewater analysis were overall in agreement in all the sites in wwtp b it was detected mql only in one day therefore estimates were not considered 4 conclusions this study focussed on understanding stereoselective spatiotemporal speciation of fqs and the corresponding quinolone qnrs resistance gene in a river catchment in sw england the conclusions are as follows 1 ofloxacin ciprofloxacin nalidixic acid and norfloxacin were ubiquitous in the studied catchment with daily loads in the river reaching tens of g day 1 in receiving water and a few hundred g day 1 in wastewater influent other fqs studied flumequine nadifloxacin lomefloxacin ulifloxacin prulifloxacin besifloxacin and moxifloxacin were undetected 2 ofloxacin was present in the catchment as the s enantiomer likely deriving from the prescription of enantiomerically pure and much more potent levofloxacin alongside racemic ofloxacin while efofloxacin remained constant high stereoselectivity was observed for its metabolite ofloxacin n oxide 3 the removal efficiency of quinolones during wastewater treatment is compound and wastewater treatment process dependent ciprofloxacin showed the highest removal efficiency during tf treatment while ofloxacin showed the highest removal during as treatment no stereoselectivity in degradation was observed 4 the fluoroquinolone resistance gene qnrs was ubiquitous in wastewater its removal was wwtp treatment process dependent with tf performing best and resulting in significant removal of the gene from 28 to 75 activated sludge and sbrs underperformed with only 9 removal in the case of activated sludge and actual enrichment of the gene during sbr interestingly the data suggests that higher removal of antibiotic is linked with low removal higher prevalence of the gene sbr and wwtp e and vice versa low removal of antibiotic is correlated with lower prevalence of the gene in wastewater effluent tf wwtp b and d this is especially prominent in the case of ofloxacin and could indicate that as might be facilitating amr prevalence to higher extent than tf 5 wbe estimates showed higher use of s ofloxacin vs racemic ofloxacin in the studied area ciprofloxacin that was found with the highest load among quinolones was present in higher amounts with respect to official statistics wbe highlighted spatial differences in norfloxacin and moxifloxacin uses in the catchment area an overall agreement of estimates between official pca data and wastewater analysis was observed in the case of nalidixic

17836,the effect of bromide and iodide on the transformation of humic acid ha and algal organic matter aom and the formation of disinfection by products dbps during uv chlorination were investigated experimental results indicated that the halides effectively inhibited mineralization with multiple changes in organic molecule transformation due to differences in formation and speciation of reactive halogen species and free halogen as a consequence bromide and iodide also played important roles in dbp formation the dbp yields in ha containing water during uv chlorination decreased in the order of iodide loaded freshwater bromide loaded whereas dbp formation in aom containing water decreased remarkably with halides added freshwater bromide loaded iodide loaded at high uv fluence moreover pearson correlation analysis exhibited weaker correlation between dbps and water parameters in aom containing water while dbps in ha containing water exhibited better correlation with water parameters for both simulated waters the theoretical toxicity was calculated and peaked in bromide containing water whereas the calculated toxicity in iodide containing water was comparable or slightly higher than that in freshwater therefore uv chlorine treatment may achieve good quality water with reduced dbp associated toxicity in freshwater or iodide containing water iodide only but careful consideration is needed when purifying source waters containing bromide bromide only especially for aom bromide containing water graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromide iodide uv chlorine

dichloroacetic acid dbaa dibromoacetic acid miaa iodoacetic acid 1 introduction humic acid ha is a major component of dissolved organic matter dom existing in aqueous environment the presence of ha in water can cause aesthetic problems such as undesirable taste odor and color most importantly ha is recognized as one of the major precursors of toxic disinfection by products dbps during traditional chlorination including carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and haloketones hks and emerging nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and trichloronitromethane tcnm another important dbp precursor is algal organic matter aom which can be released from algae and is characterized by protein carbohydrate lipids nucleic acids and other dissolved organic substances henderson et al 2008 therefore the transformation and degradation of ha and aom during water treatment processes is worth of considerable concern traditional processes including coagulation flocculation and filtration have been applied to remove ha and aom from aqueous solutions before disinfection process but all the processes exhibited limited removal capacity and may result in spontaneous flocculation problems in distribution system chow et al 2009 recently ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted increasing attention in removing dissolved contaminants in drinking water guo et al 2017 2018 the combination of uv irradiation and chlorine is a promising aop applicable in the treatment of water and wastewater jin et al 2011 first uv irradiation and chlorine co exposure are commonly adopted in a number of water treatment scenarios and thus uv chlorine can easily be applied second the photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl directly yields hydroxyl radical oh and reactive chlorine species rcss fang et al 2014 in addition the uv chlorine process exhibits more efficient radical production than the uv hydrogen peroxide aop which has been the most widely implemented aop gao et al 2017 therefore the uv chlorine process has been extensively investigated for the control of contaminants in water however the substantial generation of radicals may increase the formation of dbps due to the incorporation of halogen radicals e g x x2 xy x y chlorine bromine or iodine into dom along with the well known halogenation of dom by chlorine in natural waters bromide and iodide are present at concentrations ranging up to μm dong et al 2019 liu et al 2019b richardson et al 2008 reported that the concentrations of bromide and iodide ranged from 24 to 1120 μg l and 0 4 104 2 μg l respectively in source waters recent publications on the application of uv chlorination reported that halides e g bromide and iodide play multiple roles in pharmaceuticals and personal care product degradation and may impact the yields and risks associated with dbp formation cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2016 zhang and parker 2018 when halides exist in aqueous systems free halogen and reactive halogen species rhss such as halogen radicals can be rapidly formed during uv chlorination zhang and parker 2018 zhao et al 2009 on the one hand free halogen and rhss participate in contaminant degradation which affects substrate transformation rate and mechanisms in uv chlorine processes pan et al 2017 yang et al 2016 on the other hand free

substantially higher cytotoxicity genotoxicity developmental toxicity and growth inhibition than their chlorinated analogues gong and zhang 2015 yang and zhang 2013 moreover oxidant photolysis during uv chlorination is an important source of rhss and the chlorine photolysis is highly wavelength dependent compared to low pressure uv lamps lpuv ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds at longer wavelength can enhance the photolysis of ocl and thus the yields of free radicals at alkaline ph values yin et al 2018 which may affect the transformation of dom and the formation of dbps although a few studies have investigated dbp formation at single initial bromide or iodide concentration during uv chlorination there is still limited information regarding to the degradation of ha and aom in the presence of bromide and iodide respectively and the formation of dbps from ha and aom during uv chlorination under different uv sources due to the distinct nature of ha and aom it is unclear how bromide or iodide will impact the degradation of ha and aom and the formation of dbps during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively a comprehension study of how bromide or iodide competes for the oxidants and dbp precursors to generate halogenated dbps still lacks therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of ha and aom degradation during uv chlorination and 2 to examine the impact of bromide and iodide on the formation and speciation of dbps during uv chlorination using lpuv and uv led this study can contribute to improved understanding of the effects of halides on uv chlorination in aqueous environments for better control of disinfection process to supply safe drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

available chlorine 4 00 4 99 kbr ki and kh2po4 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich missouri usa all other chemicals were of at least analytical grade and obtained from aladdin industrial corporation beijing china the ha stock solution was prepared by dissolving suwannee river humic acid standard iii cat no 3s101h international humic substances society into ultra pure water and filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes anpel co led shanghai china axenic cultures of m aeruginosa fachb 315 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences were incubated at 25 c using bg11 media under a 12 h diurnal cycle every day the algae solution was harvested after growing into the stationary phase and the m aeruginosa cells were obtained by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the separated algae cells were washed using ultra pure water and centrifuged three times and then re suspended with ultra pure water for three cycles of freeze thawing followed by filtrated through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes the filtrate was referred as intracellular organic matter iom solution which was used as the representative of aom due to its more organic n content and less ammonia interference than extracellular organic matter eom li et al 2012 four fluorescent components c1 c4 fig s1 were successfully decomposed from ha and aom by using parallel factor analysis parafac modeling http www models life ku dk 2 2 experimental procedures batch uv chlorine experiments were conducted using semi collimated beam apparatus consisting of a 11w philips low pressure mercury lamp emitting at 254 nm or uv leds emitting at 275 nm above an open top reactor stirred by using a magnetic stir bar details of the schematic diagram were presented in our previous study gao et al 2019b prior to irradiation the water samples were dosed with bromide or iodide ions at levels of 0 and 10 μm small volumes of a freshly prepared chlorine stock solution were dosed into the samples to achieve 200 μm initial concentration and then the samples were immediately irradiated for 440 880 2 200 3520 and 5280 s to achieve the desired uv fluence of 100 200 500 800 and 1200 mj cm2 after uv chlorination samples were withdrawn and measured for residual free chlorine concentrations according to the dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 to illustrate the different behaviors of chlorine decay which can directly affect dom transformation and dbp formation notably free bromine and iodine formed during uv chlorination can also react with dpd and result in the interference of residual free chlorine measurement therefore residual oxidant ro instead of residual free chlorine was reported in this study the remaining water samples were quenched using stoichiometric amounts of na2s2o3 or ascorbic acid for dbps analyses and then analyzed as soon as possible error bars in all the figures presented the relative standard deviation of two duplicates 2 3 analytical methods free chlorine

between driving factors and variables pearson correlation analysis pca was carried out using spss statistics software version 22 0 the dbp formation and water parameters i e uv254 doc ro and fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 at the base of concentration level were subjected to pca the p value of below 0 05 indicated a significant correlation 2 4 calculation of dbp associated toxicity the contribution of a dbp compound to its dbp associated toxicity considers its concentration and toxic potency assuming the toxicity of individual dbp compound is additive the contribution of each detected dbp to the total dbp associated toxicity can be calculated by dividing the measured molar concentration of each dbp by its corresponding lc50 value the concentration resulting in 50 reduction in the growth of chinese hamster ovary cells after 72 h exposure chuang et al 2019 gao et al 2019b liu et al 2018 the lc50 values of the detected dbps in this study are summarized in table

constants k obs of ha uv254 doc ro and fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 humic like in the absence and presence of bromide at ph 8 0 during uv chlorination are displayed in fig 1 a the k obs values were calculated according to eq 1 1 ln x x 0 k o b s uv fluence where x and x 0 represent the concentrations of water parameters i e uv254 doc ro and fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 at different reaction times and the beginning respectively k obs is the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constant cm2 mj with the addition of 10 μm bromide the k obs of ha degradation increased with respect to uv254 9 8 and 2 5 and ro 22 5 and 13 1 while those with respect to doc decreased by 55 3 and 49 3 during lpuv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes respectively indicating that the effect of bromide is non negligible during uv chlorine treatment when bromide is present in the uv chlorine process bromide could react with chlorine and other reactive species to form bromate fang et al 2017 so as to accelerate ro loss free bromine is much more reactive toward phenol and phenolic compounds than free chlorine which can explain the enhanced uv254 removal of ha in fig 1a heeb et al 2014 another explanation for this enhancement is that rbss have higher reactivity toward electron rich moieties such as aromatic compounds than rcss do zhang and parker 2018 however it should be noted that the addition of bromide suppressed doc removal which may be attributed to the conversion of nonselective highly reactive radicals oh rcss such as cl to more selective radicals rbss that react more slowly with some substrates according to the radical reduction potential oh rcss rbss zhang and parker 2018 three fluorescent components c1 c3 as presented in fig s1 were identified in ha containing water component 1 c1 displayed a peak at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 310 nm 436 nm indicating the presence of microbial humic like fluorophores c2 denoted as terrestrial humic like components exhibited a single peak at 345 nm 458 nm ex em c3 also assigned as humic like component presented two peaks at longer emission wavelengths than the other two components ex em 300 nm 512 nm 380 nm 512 nm from fig 1a the removal rate of c2 was improved by 14 9 and 21 3 while those of c1 and c3 were declined by 9 6 15 6 and 0 6 24 9 during lpuv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes respectively in the presence of bromide this is likely due to the fact that c2 denotes highly aromatic compounds and preferentially reacts with rbss zhang and parker 2018 whereas c1 and c3 react preferentially with oh and rcss gao et al 2020 the decrease of chlorinated oxidants could result in reducing the removal rates of c1 and c3 in addition the application of lpuv and uv led exhibited similar trends in the water parameters of ha degradation after bromide added during uv chlorination fig 1b compares the k obs of aom by uv chlorination in the presence and absence of bromide the k obs of aom reduced for uv254 12 8 and 13 1 doc 50 9 and 33 9 and ro 38 2 and 32 6 in the presence of bromide during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively which might be due to the decrease in the generated reactive species from free halogen photolysis that could react with aom rapidly through oxidation substitution and addition fang et al 2010 the trends of water parameters in the aom bromide system are prominently various from those in the ha bromide system in aom containing freshwater br 0 i 0 0 μm the reductions of all water parameters of aom except ro were much lower than those of ha this could be explained by the relatively less unsaturated and more hydrophobic fractions of aom compared to ha gao et al 2020 which are more resistant to oxidation by radicals but the k obs of ro increased slightly in aom containing water which is due to the fact that aom contains nitrogen rich materials and is reactive with oxidants zhang et al 2016 with respect to fluorescent components aom can also be identified as three fluorescent components c1 c2 and c4 among which c1 and c2 were the same as those in ha in terms of fluorescence parameters c4 displays a peak at ex em of 285 nm 304 nm which is assigned to protein like substances as shown in fig 1b the removal rates of c4 reduced apparently in the presence of bromide 39 0 by lpuv chlorination and 47 8 by uv led chlorination respectively which was probably ascribed to the reduction of oh and rcss levels caused by bromide quenching cheng et al 2018 however the removal rates of c1 and c2 increased by 64 5 87 7 and 25 0 21 1 during lpuv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes respectively in the presence of bromide suggesting that humic like substances in aom were highly reactive with rbss notably the presence of bromide reduced the k obs of c1 in ha containing water but significantly increased that in aom containing water because the c1 fluorophore in aom contains electron rich products formed by microbial transformation of humic substances gao et al 2020 the c1 fluorophore might be more susceptible to rbss 3 1 2 effect of iodide on dom degradation iodide was also reported to play an important role in the oxidation treatment of dom allard et al 2013 xia et al 2018 from fig 1a not much differences were observed for the k obs of uv254 of ha in the presence and absence of iodide however the k obs of doc of ha reduced by 77 0 and 65 3 in the presence of iodide compared to that in the absence of iodide during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively this is consistent with the k obs of fluorophores which also reduced in the presence of iodide during uv chlorination iodide has a low reduction potential of 1 33 v which is more readily oxidized than chloride e 2 41 v and bromide e 1 62 v huie et al 1991 therefore during uv chlorination the presence of iodide could competitively react with oh and rcss to generate a series of inorganic iodine species including reactive iodine species riss e g i hoi i2 and iodate guan et al 2017 thereby greatly inhibiting the oxidation of other reductants e g humic substances and leading to the inhibitory effects on the removal of doc and fluorescent components on the other hand the generated riss with low reduction potentials e 1 1 1 4 v are selective oxidants and react with substrates slower than oh rcss and rbss zhang and parker 2018 which could further suppress the degradation of ha furthermore the k obs of ro increased by 46 3 and 33 3 during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively which may be attributable to the immediate oxidation of iodide to iodate with chlorine addition reaction rate 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 ding and zhang 2009 so as to the enhanced consumption of oxidants overall due to the competition of high reactive radicals i e oh and rcss and the formation of low reactivity riss and iodate iodide has a significant inhibitory effect on the degradation efficiency of ha by uv chlorine aops the effect of iodide on the aom degradation rate is also evident as displayed in fig 1b the k obs values of uv254 degradation in the aom iodide system were 38 9 43 2 lower than those in aom containing freshwater during uv chlorination whereas those in the ha iodide system remained almost the same as those in the absence of iodide the degradation rates of doc were suppressed by adding iodide during uv chlorine treatment 72 2 for lpuv and 51 3 for uv led respectively which is consistent with that observed in ha containing water however the k obs values of residual oxidant were greatly enhanced in the aom iodide system 252 8 for lpuv and 149 3 for uv led respectively during uv chlorine treatment this phenomenon may be ascribed to the nitrogen rich materials such as proteins amino acids and aliphatic amines in aom which are very reactive toward halogen oxidants reaction rate 104 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2008 as for fluorescent components the k obs values of c2 and c4 increased by 43 4 and 27 8 respectively in the presence of iodide during lpuv chlorination whereas those during uv led chlorination decreased by 10 4 and 49 0 respectively generally the uv chlorine process features a higher radical yield e g oh and rcss at 275 nm than 254 nm under alkaline conditions yin et al 2018 when iodide is present in the uv chlorine system riss would be generated by consuming oh and rcss compared to lpuv chlorine system uv led chlorine system can generate more radicals for further oxidation of riss to stable iodate zhang and parker 2018 we speculate that c2 and c4 are more amenable to riss which are more abundant in the lpuv chlorine system resulting in the increased removal of c2 and c4 in the presence of iodide 3 2 the roles of halides in dbp formation during uv chlorination 3 2 1 effect of bromide on the formation of dbps under the tested conditions in this study both bromide and iodide are important factors that can affect the degradation efficiency of ha and aom during ha and aom degradation the detected dbps were divided into 4 groups thms hans hks and haas among which thms and haas are the regulated dbps and the other unregulated dbps exhibit comparable genotoxicity even carcinogenicity and concentrations in drinking water bond et al 2015 the percentage contribution of each dbp class was displayed in figs 2 and 3 for freshwater compared to direct chlorination of ha and aom large increases in the total concentrations of dbps were observed during uv chlorination figs 2a and 3a this is because the reactive species such as rcss generated in a uv chlorine system have high reactivity toward dom possessing unsaturated c c bonds and thus more dbps can be formed through cl substitution and cl addition reactions gao et al 2019b in ha containing freshwater the total concentration of dbps increased from 0 8 to 2 1 μm with uv fluence increasing from 100 to 1200 mj cm2 fig 2a however in the ha bromide system the formation of dbps during uv chlorination reduced by 5 4 10 2 and 44 6 46 1 after 100 and 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence compared to ha containing freshwater respectively fig 2a as shown in fig 2b thms and haas were the predominant species which contributed to 34 7 41 8 and 57 2 85 8 of total dbp concentrations in ha containing freshwater during uv chlorination respectively the formation of haas significantly reduced during uv chlorination of ha bromide containing water thereby decreasing the total concentrations of dbps compared to those in ha containing freshwater this result is in accordance with the study of hua et al 2006 that molar yields of haas decreased as bromide concentration increased the phenomenon may be attributed to the conversion of highly reactive free chlorine and rcss to free bromine and rbss which might be not susceptible to haa precursors to gain a deeper understanding of the formed dbps the formation of each dbp species was illustrated in fig 2c f as shown in fig 2c dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa formation decreased dramatically 65 in the presence of bromide especially at high uv fluence 74 but bromoacetic acid mbaa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa formation increased compared to ha containing freshwater during uv chlorination in addition the yields of haas decreased in the order of dbaa dcaa tcaa mbaa indicating that the presence of bromide was prone to produce dbaa during uv chlorination of ha as for thms fig 2d compared to ha containing freshwater thm formation in the ha bromide system increased 35 6 38 2 at 100 mj cm2 uv fluence but slightly decreased 2 7 5 2 at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence the reduced thms at higher uv fluence 1200 mj cm2 is likely due to the further conversion of bromide to bromate reducing available halogen oxidants and the destruction of thm precursors and the formed thms fang et al 2017 also the presence of bromide shifted chlorinated speciation to more brominated thms with trichloromethane tcm reduced by 82 6 84 7 and the formation of dichlorobromomethane dcbm chlorodibromomethane cdbm and tribromomethane tbm during uv chlorination fig 2e displays the formation of hans in ha containing water in the presence or absence of bromide during uv chlorination the yields of hans reduced sharply 70 3 79 5 at low uv fluence and moderately 31 5 44 7 at high uv fluence in the presence of bromide mainly because of the decrease of dichloroacetonitrile dcan on the other hand the presence of bromide did not affect the total formation of hks fig 2f but the formation of trichloropropanone tcp decreased because chlorine consumption by bromide inhibited the chlorination of dichloropropanone dcp to tcp fig s2 ha presents the yields of dbps in terms of carbonaceous c and nitrogenous n dbps and c dbps accounted for 97 of the total dbps both c and n dbps increased in the presence of bromide during chlorination but both of them decreased during uv chlorination these results imply that the c n containing precursors in ha might be recalcitrant for rbss oxidation the formation of dbps including thms haas and hans and the percentage contributions of each dbp class during uv chlorination of aom in the presence or absence of bromide were also evaluated and the results are displayed in fig 3a b compared to the ha bromide system aom exhibited lower reactivity for c dbp i e thms and haas yields but similar reactivity for n dbp i e hans yields fig s2 leading to less detected dbps from aom than ha in the treated samples however similar to ha the presence of bromide could diminish the formation of dbps in aom containing water decreased by 42 5 and 15 3 23 6 at uv fluence of 100 and 1200 mj cm2 respectively during uv chlorination especially the considerably reduced formation of haas fig 3a comparing fig 3c with fig 2c when bromide was present during uv chlorination one interesting finding was that mbaa was the most formed haa species in aom but the lowest level in ha whereas dbaa was the lowest formed haa species in aom but the highest level in ha previous studies indicated that hydrophilic fractions carboxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl groups were important precursors for dihaloacetic acid dhaa li et al 2011 while polysaccharides as the predominant metabolic substance of aom were responsible for the generation of monohaloacetic acid mhaa huang et al 2009 leading to higher mbaa formation in aom samples carboxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl intermediates are dominant during uv chlorination of ha li et al 2011 resulting in higher dbaa yields in ha samples this distinction clearly demonstrated that aom favored the production of low brominated haa species than ha during uv chlorination in the presence of bromide from fig 3d at low uv fluence bromochloro thms and tbm increased obviously in the aom bromide system while the yield of tcm remained constant however at high uv fluence tcm formation decreased sharply while bromochloro thm and tbm formation increased significantly in the presence of bromide with respect to hans fig 3e displays that the presence of bromide increased the yields of hans remarkably which showed opposite trend compared to that of ha fig 2e suggesting that bromine incorporation seemed to be more sensitive with aom to produce hans this may be related with the different properties of n dbp precursors in aom and ha zhou et al 2015 therefore considerable attention should be paid to the increased n dbp formation during treatment of aom bromide containing water moreover the lower proportion of br dbps 42 3 46 7 formed in aom containing water than that in ha containing water 47 1 66 6 fig s3 suggests that the presence of bromide caused steric effect on the halogenation reactions of aom li et al 2016 3 2 2 effect of iodide on the formation of dbps since the reactions and rates of substrates transformation varied greatly in the presence of bromide and iodide fig 1 their contributions to the formation of dbps were also different under oxidation processes as illustrated in fig 2a for ha iodide containing water the concentrations of dbps were higher than those in ha containing freshwater mainly due to the increased formation of haas accounting for 65 of the total dbps fig 2b from fig 2c the yields of dcaa tcaa and iodoacetic acid miaa increased considerably compared to those in ha containing freshwater this is because iodide was oxidized to iodine riss and iodate during uv chlorination which could further incorporate into ha to form i dbps immediately zhang and parker 2018 however the intermediate i dbps are unstable because c i bond is weaker than c cl bond luo 2007 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore these intermediate i dbps could be substituted by hclo clo and rcss to form more chlorinated analogues zhu and zhang 2016 leading to the enhanced formation of haas regarding to hks fig 2f presented that the formation of dcp and tcp also increased in the presence of iodide during uv chlorination however the concentration of thms slightly decreased in ha iodide containing water during uv chlorination fig 2d this may be explained by the quenching effect on oxidants by iodide to form iodate wang et al 2017 resulting in the decreases in halogenation by riss fig s3 at low uv fluence the formation of tcm shifted to mixed iodochloro dbps i e dichloroiodomethane dcim and chlorodiiodomethane cdim in the presence of iodide whereas only reduced amount of tcm was observed at high uv fluence probably owing to the degradation of thms at the higher uv fluence especially for iodochloro ones wang et al 2017 furthermore the presence of iodide did not exhibit great influence on the generation of dcan during uv chlorination fig 2e which was the major component of n dbps therefore the formation of n dbps was not influenced fig s2 it should be noted that the ratios of i dbps to total dbp concentrations were generally 18 fig s3 which implied that although the presence of iodide drove the formation of haas the halogenation of ha by riss was a minor contribution to the overall halogenation reactions additionally compared to ha bromide containing water the ha iodide system formed more dbps fig 2 therefore careful attention should be paid to the application of uv chlorine aop to treat ha iodide containing water in terms of dbp yields dbp formation from aom iodide containing water was really different compared with that in ha iodide containing water as shown in fig 3a the formation of dbps in the aom iodide system declined by 52 3 55 3 and 79 3 79 9 at 100 and 1200 mj cm2 respectively compared to aom containing freshwater this is mainly due to the decreases in haa formation which was the dominant contributor to the total dbp concentration fig 3b as can be seen from fig 3c only miaa was detected from aom iodide containing water during uv chlorination which is different from the results in the ha iodide system fig 2c generally halogen reacts with organic matter through oxidation and halogen substitution pathways liu and croué 2016 although hocl has a higher redox potential than hoi does liu et al 2019a iodine is a better halogen incorporation agent to form i haas e g miaa because of the fact that iodine atom is more favorable for the electrophilic substitution to stabilize carbocation resulting from its higher electron density than chlorine atom and the lower bond energy than c cl also aom contains up to 90 of polysaccharides which are ascribed to the production of haa species with low halogen atoms like miaa further large chlorine loss in the aom iodide system fig 1b ro implied limited available chlorine to the formation of chlorinated haas like dcaa and tcaa however as for thms only tcm was observed during uv chlorination of aom iodide containing water fig 3d this probably because the oxidation of riss by oh rcss and free chlorine outcompetes the reaction between riss and aom to form i thms liu et al 2018 in terms of hks it should be noted that both dcp and tcp were observed in the aom iodide system while no hks were detected in aom containing freshwater fig 3f this phenomenon might be attributed to the available chemical sites for the chlorinated reactions induced by riss in addition the yields of hans were not significantly influenced in the presence of iodide during uv chlorination fig 3e therefore n dbp formation displayed negligible variation after the addition of iodide fig s2 aom however c dbp formation in aom iodide containing water was much less than that achieved from aom containing freshwater this may be ascribed to the consumption of oxidants by iodide producing the stable species such as iodate which decreased halogen incorporation to form less c dbps fig s2 aom overall aom iodide containing water produced the least total dbp concentrations compared with those in aom containing freshwater and aom bromide containing water 3 3 relationship between various dbps and water parameters various techniques have been employed to interpret complex data matrices fu et al 2017 jia et al 2017 in this study to explore potential relations between water parameters and dbp formation we systematically analyzed the correlation between water parameters i e uv254 doc ro c1 c2 c3 and c4 of dom and dbp concentrations using pca for our analyses we only focused on the relationships that were significant tables s2 s7 show the pearson correlation coefficients r and fig 4 summarizes the number of significant pearson s correlation p 0 05 between dbps and water parameters the pca using dbps with different structure types exhibited that halides affected the correlation between dbps and water parameters fig 4 and tables s2 s7 for ha containing freshwater the number of correlations increased in the following order uv led lpuv dc fig 4a suggesting that 275 nm uv led chlorine treatment providing more rcss for halogenation reactions contained more correlation information among dbps and water parameters at the level of 10 μm bromide addition the formed dbps exhibited relatively higher correlations with water parameters especially the strong correlations between thms and water parameters tables s2 s4 indicating that these water parameters of ha may be used as surrogate parameters to monitor the formation of dbps like thms hks and haas at the level of 10 μm iodide addition the number of correlations decreased slightly compared with those in the ha bromide system but still comparable to that in ha containing freshwater fig 4a nevertheless we observed relatively lower correlations in aom containing water than that in ha containing water during chlorination alone and uv chlorination especially for the system in the presence of bromide fig 4b implying a relatively lower resolution of the chosen water parameters for predicting the dbp formation in similar aom containing water overall these results suggested that dbps from ha containing water better correlated with water parameters in the absence and presence of halides during uv chlorination especially for the ha bromide system and the water indexes i e uv254 doc ro c1 c2 and c3 of ha containing water might be used as surrogate parameters to monitor the formation of dbps 3 4 evaluation of dbp associated toxicity when these concentrations of dbps were weighted by toxic potency metrics lc50 values the dbp associated toxicity and the percentage contributions of each dbp class to the total dbp associated toxicity exhibited different characteristics as shown in fig 5 a the highest calculated toxicity was observed in the ha bromide system during lpuv chlorination at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence though the highest dbp yield was observed in the ha iodide system during lpuv chlorination at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence fig 2a ha the increased toxicity was driven by the increases in br haa formation as they had considerably high toxicity table s1 and were the dominant contributors to the calculated toxicity 81 fig 5b even though i haas were reported to be highly toxic wagner and plewa 2017 the ha iodide system exhibited very low levels of total dbp associated toxicity resulting from the very low concentrations of i haas accounting for 3 of total haas at high uv fluence similar to ha aom bromide containing water produced higher calculated toxicity by 2 45 fold compared to that of aom containing freshwater and aom iodide containing water fig 5a aom mainly because the speciation of dbps shifted toward the more brominated species and the yields of hans were enhanced which were the major contributors to the calculated dbp associated toxicity figs 5b and s4 aom comparing ha and aom it should be noted that the aom bromide system exhibited higher total calculated toxicity than the ha bromide system although the latter one generated much more dbps this can be explained by the higher formation of hans which was the dominant contributor to the dbp associated toxicity due to its very low lc50 values figs 2 and 3 and table s1 in aom containing water than that in ha containing water therefore more attention should be paid to the formation of hans especially for the disinfection of aom containing water using uv chlorine processes moreover the toxicological importance of inorganic dbps such as bromate has been identified by some researchers han and zhang 2018 wu et al 2019 there is still a need for further toxicity investigation of these inorganic dbps under uv chlorine treatment when the cumulative dbp associated toxicity was present in terms of c and n dbps fig s5a c dbps were observed to be the key component of the cumulative calculated toxicity due to the high yields of c dbps fig s2 however the percentage contribution of n dbps to the calculated toxicity was not negligible fig s5b although it formed at the levels of 0 025 μm this was put down to the fact that nitrogen containing dbps were more toxic than their chemical analogues plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2007 it should be acknowledged that the abatement of dbp mediated toxicity is more important than the reduction of dbp concentration as shown in the results above although uv chlorine treatment could reduce the formation of dbps from water with bromide only fig 2a it generated the lowest quality water with respect to the cumulative calculated toxicity in contrast freshwater or iodide containing water iodide only showed relatively low dbp associated toxicity despite the higher dbp levels due to the low proportion of high toxic dbps therefore special attention should be paid to the uv chlorine treatment of bromide containing water bromide only especially for aom bromide containing water additionally our results suggested that 275 nm uv led chlorine process was capable of achieving a water quality comparable to or better than dc and 254 nm lpuv chlorine process with respect to dbps and dbp associated toxicity 4 conclusions this study reveals that bromide and iodide can significantly impact ha and aom transformation and the formation of dbps during uv chlorination due to the conversion of rhss and free halogen during uv chlorination the quenching effect on radicals by bromide and iodide influenced the degradation efficiency of dom through the rhs mediated reactions and thereby affected the interactions between free halogen rhss and dom so as to change the levels and the speciation of dbps in ha and aom containing waters dbps formed in ha containing water at high uv fluence decreased in the order of iodide loaded freshwater bromide loaded however those in aom containing water decreased in the order of freshwater bromide loaded iodide loaded strong correlations between dbp yields and water parameters i e uv254 doc ro and fluorescent components in ha containing water in the presence or absence of bromide and iodide suggest that the indexes of ha can be reliable indicators for dbp formation during uv chlorination but this is not applicable for aom containing water additionally the highest dbp associated toxicity was observed during uv chlorination of bromide containing water bromide loaded iodide loaded freshwater for both ha and aom thus uv chlorine treatment can generate good quality water from freshwater and iodide containing water iodide only while uv chlorination of bromide containing water bromide only especially for aom bromide containing water requires special attention considering the short transmittance of uv in water uv chlorine processes target new and existing small scale water treatment plants the results presented

17836,the effect of bromide and iodide on the transformation of humic acid ha and algal organic matter aom and the formation of disinfection by products dbps during uv chlorination were investigated experimental results indicated that the halides effectively inhibited mineralization with multiple changes in organic molecule transformation due to differences in formation and speciation of reactive halogen species and free halogen as a consequence bromide and iodide also played important roles in dbp formation the dbp yields in ha containing water during uv chlorination decreased in the order of iodide loaded freshwater bromide loaded whereas dbp formation in aom containing water decreased remarkably with halides added freshwater bromide loaded iodide loaded at high uv fluence moreover pearson correlation analysis exhibited weaker correlation between dbps and water parameters in aom containing water while dbps in ha containing water exhibited better correlation with water parameters for both simulated waters the theoretical toxicity was calculated and peaked in bromide containing water whereas the calculated toxicity in iodide containing water was comparable or slightly higher than that in freshwater therefore uv chlorine treatment may achieve good quality water with reduced dbp associated toxicity in freshwater or iodide containing water iodide only but careful consideration is needed when purifying source waters containing bromide bromide only especially for aom bromide containing water graphical abstract image 1 keywords bromide iodide uv chlorine

dichloroacetic acid dbaa dibromoacetic acid miaa iodoacetic acid 1 introduction humic acid ha is a major component of dissolved organic matter dom existing in aqueous environment the presence of ha in water can cause aesthetic problems such as undesirable taste odor and color most importantly ha is recognized as one of the major precursors of toxic disinfection by products dbps during traditional chlorination including carbonaceous dbps c dbps such as trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas and haloketones hks and emerging nitrogenous dbps n dbps such as haloacetonitriles hans and trichloronitromethane tcnm another important dbp precursor is algal organic matter aom which can be released from algae and is characterized by protein carbohydrate lipids nucleic acids and other dissolved organic substances henderson et al 2008 therefore the transformation and degradation of ha and aom during water treatment processes is worth of considerable concern traditional processes including coagulation flocculation and filtration have been applied to remove ha and aom from aqueous solutions before disinfection process but all the processes exhibited limited removal capacity and may result in spontaneous flocculation problems in distribution system chow et al 2009 recently ultraviolet uv based advanced oxidation processes aops have attracted increasing attention in removing dissolved contaminants in drinking water guo et al 2017 2018 the combination of uv irradiation and chlorine is a promising aop applicable in the treatment of water and wastewater jin et al 2011 first uv irradiation and chlorine co exposure are commonly adopted in a number of water treatment scenarios and thus uv chlorine can easily be applied second the photolysis of free chlorine hocl ocl directly yields hydroxyl radical oh and reactive chlorine species rcss fang et al 2014 in addition the uv chlorine process exhibits more efficient radical production than the uv hydrogen peroxide aop which has been the most widely implemented aop gao et al 2017 therefore the uv chlorine process has been extensively investigated for the control of contaminants in water however the substantial generation of radicals may increase the formation of dbps due to the incorporation of halogen radicals e g x x2 xy x y chlorine bromine or iodine into dom along with the well known halogenation of dom by chlorine in natural waters bromide and iodide are present at concentrations ranging up to μm dong et al 2019 liu et al 2019b richardson et al 2008 reported that the concentrations of bromide and iodide ranged from 24 to 1120 μg l and 0 4 104 2 μg l respectively in source waters recent publications on the application of uv chlorination reported that halides e g bromide and iodide play multiple roles in pharmaceuticals and personal care product degradation and may impact the yields and risks associated with dbp formation cheng et al 2018 wang et al 2016 zhang and parker 2018 when halides exist in aqueous systems free halogen and reactive halogen species rhss such as halogen radicals can be rapidly formed during uv chlorination zhang and parker 2018 zhao et al 2009 on the one hand free halogen and rhss participate in contaminant degradation which affects substrate transformation rate and mechanisms in uv chlorine processes pan et al 2017 yang et al 2016 on the other hand free halogen and rhss react selectively with substrates e g ha and aom to produce brominated or iodinated dbps br dbps or i dbps via substitution and or addition criquet et al 2015 which present substantially higher cytotoxicity genotoxicity developmental toxicity and growth inhibition than their chlorinated analogues gong and zhang 2015 yang and zhang 2013 moreover oxidant photolysis during uv chlorination is an important source of rhss and the chlorine photolysis is highly wavelength dependent compared to low pressure uv lamps lpuv ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds at longer wavelength can enhance the photolysis of ocl and thus the yields of free radicals at alkaline ph values yin et al 2018 which may affect the transformation of dom and the formation of dbps although a few studies have investigated dbp formation at single initial bromide or iodide concentration during uv chlorination there is still limited information regarding to the degradation of ha and aom in the presence of bromide and iodide respectively and the formation of dbps from ha and aom during uv chlorination under different uv sources due to the distinct nature of ha and aom it is unclear how bromide or iodide will impact the degradation of ha and aom and the formation of dbps during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively a comprehension study of how bromide or iodide competes for the oxidants and dbp precursors to generate halogenated dbps still lacks therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of ha and aom degradation during uv chlorination and 2 to examine the impact of bromide and iodide on the formation and speciation of dbps during uv chlorination using lpuv and uv led this study can contribute to improved understanding of the effects of halides on uv chlorination in aqueous environments for better control of disinfection process to supply safe drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

available chlorine 4 00 4 99 kbr ki and kh2po4 99 were purchased from sigma aldrich missouri usa all other chemicals were of at least analytical grade and obtained from aladdin industrial corporation beijing china the ha stock solution was prepared by dissolving suwannee river humic acid standard iii cat no 3s101h international humic substances society into ultra pure water and filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes anpel co led shanghai china axenic cultures of m aeruginosa fachb 315 purchased from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences were incubated at 25 c using bg11 media under a 12 h diurnal cycle every day the algae solution was harvested after growing into the stationary phase and the m aeruginosa cells were obtained by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 10 min the separated algae cells were washed using ultra pure water and centrifuged three times and then re suspended with ultra pure water for three cycles of freeze thawing followed by filtrated through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membranes the filtrate was referred as intracellular organic matter iom solution which was used as the representative of aom due to its more organic n content and less ammonia interference than extracellular organic matter eom li et al 2012 four fluorescent components c1 c4 fig s1 were successfully decomposed from ha and aom by using parallel factor analysis parafac modeling http www models life ku dk 2 2 experimental procedures batch uv chlorine experiments were conducted using semi collimated beam apparatus consisting of a 11w philips low pressure mercury lamp emitting at 254 nm or uv leds emitting at 275 nm above an open top reactor stirred by using a magnetic stir bar details of the schematic diagram were presented in our previous study gao et al 2019b prior to irradiation the water samples were dosed with bromide or iodide ions at levels of 0 and 10 μm small volumes of a freshly prepared chlorine stock solution were dosed into the samples to achieve 200 μm initial concentration and then the samples were immediately irradiated for 440 880 2 200 3520 and 5280 s to achieve the desired uv fluence of 100 200 500 800 and 1200 mj cm2 after uv chlorination samples were withdrawn and measured for residual free chlorine concentrations according to the dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 to illustrate the different behaviors of chlorine decay which can directly affect dom transformation and dbp formation notably free bromine and iodine formed during uv chlorination can also react with dpd and result in the interference of residual free chlorine measurement therefore residual oxidant ro instead of residual free chlorine was reported in this study the remaining water samples were quenched using stoichiometric amounts of na2s2o3 or ascorbic acid for dbps analyses and then analyzed as soon as possible error bars in all the figures presented the relative standard deviation of two duplicates 2 3 analytical methods free chlorine was analyzed using a unico sq 4802 spectrophotometer shanghai china according to the dpd method apha 1998 dissolved organic carbon doc and the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 were measured by using toc vcsh analyzer shimadzu japan and unico sq 4802 spectrophotometer respectively fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems of samples were analyzed using a shimadzu rf 6000 fluorescence spectrophotometer kyoto japan analytical details for all dbps were provided previously gao et al 2019a 2019b xia et al 2018 briefly thms hans and hks were quantified by using a shimadzu gas chromatography gc 2010 coupled with an electron capture detector ecd kyoto japan according to the modified us epa method 551 1 munch and hautman 1995 haas including chlorinated brominated and iodinated haas were derivatized using acidic methanol and then measured by using the gc ecd according to the modified us epa method 552 3 hodgeson et al 1995 to investigate the possible relations between driving factors and variables pearson correlation analysis pca was carried out using spss statistics software version 22 0 the dbp formation and water parameters i e uv254 doc ro and fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 at the base of concentration level were subjected to pca the p value of below 0 05 indicated a significant correlation 2 4 calculation of dbp associated toxicity the contribution of a dbp compound to its dbp associated toxicity considers its concentration and toxic potency assuming the toxicity of individual dbp compound is additive the contribution of each detected dbp to the total dbp associated toxicity can be calculated by dividing the measured molar concentration of each dbp by its corresponding lc50 value the concentration resulting in 50 reduction in the growth of chinese hamster ovary cells after 72 h exposure chuang et al 2019 gao et al 2019b liu et al 2018 the lc50 values of the detected dbps in this study are summarized in table s1 in supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 dom oxidation kinetics during uv chlorination 3 1 1 effect of bromide on dom degradation the observed pseudo first order reduction rate constants k obs of ha uv254 doc ro and fluorescent components c1 c2 and c3 humic like in the absence and presence of bromide at ph 8 0 during uv chlorination are displayed in fig 1 a the k obs values were calculated according to eq 1 1 ln x x 0 k o b s uv fluence where x and x 0 represent the concentrations of water parameters i e uv254 doc ro and fluorescence components c1 c2 c3 and c4 at different reaction times and the beginning respectively k obs is the observed pseudo first order degradation rate constant cm2 mj with the addition of 10 μm bromide the k obs of ha degradation increased with respect to uv254 9 8 and 2 5 and ro 22 5 and 13 1 while those with respect to doc decreased by 55 3 and 49 3 during lpuv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes respectively indicating that the effect of bromide is non negligible during uv chlorine treatment when bromide is present in the uv chlorine process bromide could react with chlorine and other reactive species to form bromate fang et al 2017 so as to accelerate ro loss free bromine is much more reactive toward phenol and phenolic compounds than free chlorine which can explain the enhanced uv254 removal of ha in fig 1a heeb et al 2014 another explanation for this enhancement is that rbss have higher reactivity toward electron rich moieties such as aromatic compounds than rcss do zhang and parker 2018 however it should be noted that the addition of bromide suppressed doc removal which may be attributed to the conversion of nonselective highly reactive radicals oh rcss such as cl to more selective radicals rbss that react more slowly with some substrates according to the radical reduction potential oh rcss rbss zhang and parker 2018 three fluorescent components c1 c3 as presented in fig s1 were identified in ha containing water component 1 c1 displayed a peak at the excitation emission wavelengths ex em of 310 nm 436 nm indicating the presence of microbial humic like fluorophores c2 denoted as terrestrial humic like components exhibited a single peak at 345 nm 458 nm ex em c3 also assigned as humic like component presented two peaks at longer emission wavelengths than the other two components ex em 300 nm 512 nm 380 nm 512 nm from fig 1a the removal rate of c2 was improved by 14 9 and 21 3 while those of c1 and c3 were declined by 9 6 15 6 and 0 6 24 9 during lpuv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes respectively in the presence of bromide this is likely due to the fact that c2 denotes highly aromatic compounds and preferentially reacts with rbss zhang and parker 2018 whereas c1 and c3 react preferentially with oh and rcss gao et al 2020 the decrease of chlorinated oxidants could result in reducing the removal rates of c1 and c3 in addition the application of lpuv and uv led exhibited similar trends in the water parameters of ha degradation after bromide added during uv chlorination fig 1b compares the k obs of aom by uv chlorination in the presence and absence of bromide the k obs of aom reduced for uv254 12 8 and 13 1 doc 50 9 and 33 9 and ro 38 2 and 32 6 in the presence of bromide during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively which might be due to the decrease in the generated reactive species from free halogen photolysis that could react with aom rapidly through oxidation substitution and addition fang et al 2010 the trends of water parameters in the aom bromide system are prominently various from those in the ha bromide system in aom containing freshwater br 0 i 0 0 μm the reductions of all water parameters of aom except ro were much lower than those of ha this could be explained by the relatively less unsaturated and more hydrophobic fractions of aom compared to ha gao et al 2020 which are more resistant to oxidation by radicals but the k obs of ro increased slightly in aom containing water which is due to the fact that aom contains nitrogen rich materials and is reactive with oxidants zhang et al 2016 with respect to fluorescent components aom can also be identified as three fluorescent components c1 c2 and c4 among which c1 and c2 were the same as those in ha in terms of fluorescence parameters c4 displays a peak at ex em of 285 nm 304 nm which is assigned to protein like substances as shown in fig 1b the removal rates of c4 reduced apparently in the presence of bromide 39 0 by lpuv chlorination and 47 8 by uv led chlorination respectively which was probably ascribed to the reduction of oh and rcss levels caused by bromide quenching cheng et al 2018 however the removal rates of c1 and c2 increased by 64 5 87 7 and 25 0 21 1 during lpuv chlorine and uv led chlorine processes respectively in the presence of bromide suggesting that humic like substances in aom were highly reactive with rbss notably the presence of bromide reduced the k obs of c1 in ha containing water but significantly increased that in aom containing water because the c1 fluorophore in aom contains electron rich products formed by microbial transformation of humic substances gao et al 2020 the c1 fluorophore might be more susceptible to rbss 3 1 2 effect of iodide on dom degradation iodide was also reported to play an important role in the oxidation treatment of dom allard et al 2013 xia et al 2018 from fig 1a not much differences were observed for the k obs of uv254 of ha in the presence and absence of iodide however the k obs of doc of ha reduced by 77 0 and 65 3 in the presence of iodide compared to that in the absence of iodide during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively this is consistent with the k obs of fluorophores which also reduced in the presence of iodide during uv chlorination iodide has a low reduction potential of 1 33 v which is more readily oxidized than chloride e 2 41 v and bromide e 1 62 v huie et al 1991 therefore during uv chlorination the presence of iodide could competitively react with oh and rcss to generate a series of inorganic iodine species including reactive iodine species riss e g i hoi i2 and iodate guan et al 2017 thereby greatly inhibiting the oxidation of other reductants e g humic substances and leading to the inhibitory effects on the removal of doc and fluorescent components on the other hand the generated riss with low reduction potentials e 1 1 1 4 v are selective oxidants and react with substrates slower than oh rcss and rbss zhang and parker 2018 which could further suppress the degradation of ha furthermore the k obs of ro increased by 46 3 and 33 3 during lpuv chlorination and uv led chlorination respectively which may be attributable to the immediate oxidation of iodide to iodate with chlorine addition reaction rate 4 3 108 m 1 s 1 ding and zhang 2009 so as to the enhanced consumption of oxidants overall due to the competition of high reactive radicals i e oh and rcss and the formation of low reactivity riss and iodate iodide has a significant inhibitory effect on the degradation efficiency of ha by uv chlorine aops the effect of iodide on the aom degradation rate is also evident as displayed in fig 1b the k obs values of uv254 degradation in the aom iodide system were 38 9 43 2 lower than those in aom containing freshwater during uv chlorination whereas those in the ha iodide system remained almost the same as those in the absence of iodide the degradation rates of doc were suppressed by adding iodide during uv chlorine treatment 72 2 for lpuv and 51 3 for uv led respectively which is consistent with that observed in ha containing water however the k obs values of residual oxidant were greatly enhanced in the aom iodide system 252 8 for lpuv and 149 3 for uv led respectively during uv chlorine treatment this phenomenon may be ascribed to the nitrogen rich materials such as proteins amino acids and aliphatic amines in aom which are very reactive toward halogen oxidants reaction rate 104 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2010 henderson et al 2008 as for fluorescent components the k obs values of c2 and c4 increased by 43 4 and 27 8 respectively in the presence of iodide during lpuv chlorination whereas those during uv led chlorination decreased by 10 4 and 49 0 respectively generally the uv chlorine process features a higher radical yield e g oh and rcss at 275 nm than 254 nm under alkaline conditions yin et al 2018 when iodide is present in the uv chlorine system riss would be generated by consuming oh and rcss compared to lpuv chlorine system uv led chlorine system can generate more radicals for further oxidation of riss to stable iodate zhang and parker 2018 we speculate that c2 and c4 are more amenable to riss which are more abundant in the lpuv chlorine system resulting in the increased removal of c2 and c4 in the presence of iodide 3 2 the roles of halides in dbp formation during uv chlorination 3 2 1 effect of bromide on the formation of dbps under the tested conditions in this study both bromide and iodide are important factors that can affect the degradation efficiency of ha and aom during ha and aom degradation the detected dbps were divided into 4 groups thms hans hks and haas among which thms and haas are the regulated dbps and the other unregulated dbps exhibit comparable genotoxicity even carcinogenicity and concentrations in drinking water bond et al 2015 the percentage contribution of each dbp class was displayed in figs 2 and 3 for freshwater compared to direct chlorination of ha and aom large increases in the total concentrations of dbps were observed during uv chlorination figs 2a and 3a this is because the reactive species such as rcss generated in a uv chlorine system have high reactivity toward dom possessing unsaturated c c bonds and thus more dbps can be formed through cl substitution and cl addition reactions gao et al 2019b in ha containing freshwater the total concentration of dbps increased from 0 8 to 2 1 μm with uv fluence increasing from 100 to 1200 mj cm2 fig 2a however in the ha bromide system the formation of dbps during uv chlorination reduced by 5 4 10 2 and 44 6 46 1 after 100 and 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence compared to ha containing freshwater respectively fig 2a as shown in fig 2b thms and haas were the predominant species which contributed to 34 7 41 8 and 57 2 85 8 of total dbp concentrations in ha containing freshwater during uv chlorination respectively the formation of haas significantly reduced during uv chlorination of ha bromide containing water thereby decreasing the total concentrations of dbps compared to those in ha containing freshwater this result is in accordance with the study of hua et al 2006 that molar yields of haas decreased as bromide concentration increased the phenomenon may be attributed to the conversion of highly reactive free chlorine and rcss to free bromine and rbss which might be not susceptible to haa precursors to gain a deeper understanding of the formed dbps the formation of each dbp species was illustrated in fig 2c f as shown in fig 2c dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa formation decreased dramatically 65 in the presence of bromide especially at high uv fluence 74 but bromoacetic acid mbaa and dibromoacetic acid dbaa formation increased compared to ha containing freshwater during uv chlorination in addition the yields of haas decreased in the order of dbaa dcaa tcaa mbaa indicating that the presence of bromide was prone to produce dbaa during uv chlorination of ha as for thms fig 2d compared to ha containing freshwater thm formation in the ha bromide system increased 35 6 38 2 at 100 mj cm2 uv fluence but slightly decreased 2 7 5 2 at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence the reduced thms at higher uv fluence 1200 mj cm2 is likely due to the further conversion of bromide to bromate reducing available halogen oxidants and the destruction of thm precursors and the formed thms fang et al 2017 also the presence of bromide shifted chlorinated speciation to more brominated thms with trichloromethane tcm reduced by 82 6 84 7 and the formation of dichlorobromomethane dcbm chlorodibromomethane cdbm and tribromomethane tbm during uv chlorination fig 2e displays the formation of hans in ha containing water in the presence or absence of bromide during uv chlorination the yields of hans reduced sharply 70 3 79 5 at low uv fluence and moderately 31 5 44 7 at high uv fluence in the presence of bromide mainly because of the decrease of dichloroacetonitrile dcan on the other hand the presence of bromide did not affect the total formation of hks fig 2f but the formation of trichloropropanone tcp decreased because chlorine consumption by bromide inhibited the chlorination of dichloropropanone dcp to tcp fig s2 ha presents the yields of dbps in terms of carbonaceous c and nitrogenous n dbps and c dbps accounted for 97 of the total dbps both c and n dbps increased in the presence of bromide during chlorination but both of them decreased during uv chlorination these results imply that the c n containing precursors in ha might be recalcitrant for rbss oxidation the formation of dbps including thms haas and hans and the percentage contributions of each dbp class during uv chlorination of aom in the presence or absence of bromide were also evaluated and the results are displayed in fig 3a b compared to the ha bromide system aom exhibited lower reactivity for c dbp i e thms and haas yields but similar reactivity for n dbp i e hans yields fig s2 leading to less detected dbps from aom than ha in the treated samples however similar to ha the presence of bromide could diminish the formation of dbps in aom containing water decreased by 42 5 and 15 3 23 6 at uv fluence of 100 and 1200 mj cm2 respectively during uv chlorination especially the considerably reduced formation of haas fig 3a comparing fig 3c with fig 2c when bromide was present during uv chlorination one interesting finding was that mbaa was the most formed haa species in aom but the lowest level in ha whereas dbaa was the lowest formed haa species in aom but the highest level in ha previous studies indicated that hydrophilic fractions carboxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl groups were important precursors for dihaloacetic acid dhaa li et al 2011 while polysaccharides as the predominant metabolic substance of aom were responsible for the generation of monohaloacetic acid mhaa huang et al 2009 leading to higher mbaa formation in aom samples carboxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl intermediates are dominant during uv chlorination of ha li et al 2011 resulting in higher dbaa yields in ha samples this distinction clearly demonstrated that aom favored the production of low brominated haa species than ha during uv chlorination in the presence of bromide from fig 3d at low uv fluence bromochloro thms and tbm increased obviously in the aom bromide system while the yield of tcm remained constant however at high uv fluence tcm formation decreased sharply while bromochloro thm and tbm formation increased significantly in the presence of bromide with respect to hans fig 3e displays that the presence of bromide increased the yields of hans remarkably which showed opposite trend compared to that of ha fig 2e suggesting that bromine incorporation seemed to be more sensitive with aom to produce hans this may be related with the different properties of n dbp precursors in aom and ha zhou et al 2015 therefore considerable attention should be paid to the increased n dbp formation during treatment of aom bromide containing water moreover the lower proportion of br dbps 42 3 46 7 formed in aom containing water than that in ha containing water 47 1 66 6 fig s3 suggests that the presence of bromide caused steric effect on the halogenation reactions of aom li et al 2016 3 2 2 effect of iodide on the formation of dbps since the reactions and rates of substrates transformation varied greatly in the presence of bromide and iodide fig 1 their contributions to the formation of dbps were also different under oxidation processes as illustrated in fig 2a for ha iodide containing water the concentrations of dbps were higher than those in ha containing freshwater mainly due to the increased formation of haas accounting for 65 of the total dbps fig 2b from fig 2c the yields of dcaa tcaa and iodoacetic acid miaa increased considerably compared to those in ha containing freshwater this is because iodide was oxidized to iodine riss and iodate during uv chlorination which could further incorporate into ha to form i dbps immediately zhang and parker 2018 however the intermediate i dbps are unstable because c i bond is weaker than c cl bond luo 2007 zhu and zhang 2016 therefore these intermediate i dbps could be substituted by hclo clo and rcss to form more chlorinated analogues zhu and zhang 2016 leading to the enhanced formation of haas regarding to hks fig 2f presented that the formation of dcp and tcp also increased in the presence of iodide during uv chlorination however the concentration of thms slightly decreased in ha iodide containing water during uv chlorination fig 2d this may be explained by the quenching effect on oxidants by iodide to form iodate wang et al 2017 resulting in the decreases in halogenation by riss fig s3 at low uv fluence the formation of tcm shifted to mixed iodochloro dbps i e dichloroiodomethane dcim and chlorodiiodomethane cdim in the presence of iodide whereas only reduced amount of tcm was observed at high uv fluence probably owing to the degradation of thms at the higher uv fluence especially for iodochloro ones wang et al 2017 furthermore the presence of iodide did not exhibit great influence on the generation of dcan during uv chlorination fig 2e which was the major component of n dbps therefore the formation of n dbps was not influenced fig s2 it should be noted that the ratios of i dbps to total dbp concentrations were generally 18 fig s3 which implied that although the presence of iodide drove the formation of haas the halogenation of ha by riss was a minor contribution to the overall halogenation reactions additionally compared to ha bromide containing water the ha iodide system formed more dbps fig 2 therefore careful attention should be paid to the application of uv chlorine aop to treat ha iodide containing water in terms of dbp yields dbp formation from aom iodide containing water was really different compared with that in ha iodide containing water as shown in fig 3a the formation of dbps in the aom iodide system declined by 52 3 55 3 and 79 3 79 9 at 100 and 1200 mj cm2 respectively compared to aom containing freshwater this is mainly due to the decreases in haa formation which was the dominant contributor to the total dbp concentration fig 3b as can be seen from fig 3c only miaa was detected from aom iodide containing water during uv chlorination which is different from the results in the ha iodide system fig 2c generally halogen reacts with organic matter through oxidation and halogen substitution pathways liu and croué 2016 although hocl has a higher redox potential than hoi does liu et al 2019a iodine is a better halogen incorporation agent to form i haas e g miaa because of the fact that iodine atom is more favorable for the electrophilic substitution to stabilize carbocation resulting from its higher electron density than chlorine atom and the lower bond energy than c cl also aom contains up to 90 of polysaccharides which are ascribed to the production of haa species with low halogen atoms like miaa further large chlorine loss in the aom iodide system fig 1b ro implied limited available chlorine to the formation of chlorinated haas like dcaa and tcaa however as for thms only tcm was observed during uv chlorination of aom iodide containing water fig 3d this probably because the oxidation of riss by oh rcss and free chlorine outcompetes the reaction between riss and aom to form i thms liu et al 2018 in terms of hks it should be noted that both dcp and tcp were observed in the aom iodide system while no hks were detected in aom containing freshwater fig 3f this phenomenon might be attributed to the available chemical sites for the chlorinated reactions induced by riss in addition the yields of hans were not significantly influenced in the presence of iodide during uv chlorination fig 3e therefore n dbp formation displayed negligible variation after the addition of iodide fig s2 aom however c dbp formation in aom iodide containing water was much less than that achieved from aom containing freshwater this may be ascribed to the consumption of oxidants by iodide producing the stable species such as iodate which decreased halogen incorporation to form less c dbps fig s2 aom overall aom iodide containing water produced the least total dbp concentrations compared with those in aom containing freshwater and aom bromide containing water 3 3 relationship between various dbps and water parameters various techniques have been employed to interpret complex data matrices fu et al 2017 jia et al 2017 in this study to explore potential relations between water parameters and dbp formation we systematically analyzed the correlation between water parameters i e uv254 doc ro c1 c2 c3 and c4 of dom and dbp concentrations using pca for our analyses we only focused on the relationships that were significant tables s2 s7 show the pearson correlation coefficients r and fig 4 summarizes the number of significant pearson s correlation p 0 05 between dbps and water parameters the pca using dbps with different structure types exhibited that halides affected the correlation between dbps and water parameters fig 4 and tables s2 s7 for ha containing freshwater the number of correlations increased in the following order uv led lpuv dc fig 4a suggesting that 275 nm uv led chlorine treatment providing more rcss for halogenation reactions contained more correlation information among dbps and water parameters at the level of 10 μm bromide addition the formed dbps exhibited relatively higher correlations with water parameters especially the strong correlations between thms and water parameters tables s2 s4 indicating that these water parameters of ha may be used as surrogate parameters to monitor the formation of dbps like thms hks and haas at the level of 10 μm iodide addition the number of correlations decreased slightly compared with those in the ha bromide system but still comparable to that in ha containing freshwater fig 4a nevertheless we observed relatively lower correlations in aom containing water than that in ha containing water during chlorination alone and uv chlorination especially for the system in the presence of bromide fig 4b implying a relatively lower resolution of the chosen water parameters for predicting the dbp formation in similar aom containing water overall these results suggested that dbps from ha containing water better correlated with water parameters in the absence and presence of halides during uv chlorination especially for the ha bromide system and the water indexes i e uv254 doc ro c1 c2 and c3 of ha containing water might be used as surrogate parameters to monitor the formation of dbps 3 4 evaluation of dbp associated toxicity when these concentrations of dbps were weighted by toxic potency metrics lc50 values the dbp associated toxicity and the percentage contributions of each dbp class to the total dbp associated toxicity exhibited different characteristics as shown in fig 5 a the highest calculated toxicity was observed in the ha bromide system during lpuv chlorination at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence though the highest dbp yield was observed in the ha iodide system during lpuv chlorination at 1200 mj cm2 uv fluence fig 2a ha the increased toxicity was driven by the increases in br haa formation as they had considerably high toxicity table s1 and were the dominant contributors to the calculated toxicity 81 fig 5b even though i haas were reported to be highly toxic wagner and plewa 2017 the ha iodide system exhibited very low levels of total dbp associated toxicity resulting from the very low concentrations of i haas accounting for 3 of total haas at high uv fluence similar to ha aom bromide containing water produced higher calculated toxicity by 2 45 fold compared to that of aom containing freshwater and aom iodide containing water fig 5a aom mainly because the speciation of dbps shifted toward the more brominated species and the yields of hans were enhanced which were the major contributors to the calculated dbp associated toxicity figs 5b and s4 aom comparing ha and aom it should be noted that the aom bromide system exhibited higher total calculated toxicity than the ha bromide system although the latter one generated much more dbps this can be explained by the higher formation of hans which was the dominant contributor to the dbp associated toxicity due to its very low lc50 values figs 2 and 3 and table s1 in aom containing water than that in ha containing water therefore more attention should be paid to the formation of hans especially for the disinfection of aom containing water using uv chlorine processes moreover the toxicological importance of inorganic dbps such as bromate has been identified by some researchers han and zhang 2018 wu et al 2019 there is still a need for further toxicity investigation of these inorganic dbps under uv chlorine treatment when the cumulative dbp associated toxicity was present in terms of c and n dbps fig s5a c dbps were observed to be the key component of the cumulative calculated toxicity due to the high yields of c dbps fig s2 however the percentage contribution of n dbps to the calculated toxicity was not negligible fig s5b although it formed at the levels of 0 025 μm this was put down to the fact that nitrogen containing dbps were more toxic than their chemical analogues plewa et al 2008 richardson et al 2007 it should be acknowledged that the abatement of dbp mediated toxicity is more important than the reduction of dbp concentration as shown in the results above although uv chlorine treatment could reduce the formation of dbps from water with bromide only fig 2a it generated the lowest quality water with respect to the cumulative calculated toxicity in contrast freshwater or iodide containing water iodide only showed relatively low dbp associated toxicity despite the higher dbp levels due to the low proportion of high toxic dbps therefore special attention should be paid to the uv chlorine treatment of bromide containing water bromide only especially for aom bromide containing water additionally our results suggested that 275 nm uv led chlorine process was capable of achieving a water quality comparable to or better than dc and 254 nm lpuv chlorine process with respect to dbps and dbp associated toxicity 4 conclusions this study reveals that bromide and iodide can significantly impact ha and aom transformation and the formation of dbps during uv chlorination due to the conversion of rhss and free halogen during uv chlorination the quenching effect on radicals by bromide and iodide influenced the degradation efficiency of dom through the rhs mediated reactions and thereby affected the interactions between free halogen rhss and dom so as to change the levels and the speciation of dbps in ha and aom containing waters dbps formed in ha containing water at high uv fluence decreased in the order of iodide loaded freshwater bromide loaded however those in aom containing water decreased in the order of freshwater bromide loaded iodide loaded strong correlations between dbp yields and water parameters i e uv254 doc ro and fluorescent components in ha containing water in the presence or absence of bromide and iodide suggest that the indexes of ha can be reliable indicators for dbp formation during uv chlorination but this is not applicable for aom containing water additionally the highest dbp associated toxicity was observed during uv chlorination of bromide containing water bromide loaded iodide loaded freshwater for both ha and aom thus uv chlorine treatment can generate good quality water from freshwater and iodide containing water iodide only while uv chlorination of bromide containing water bromide only especially for aom bromide containing water requires special attention considering the short transmittance of uv in water uv chlorine processes target new and existing small scale water treatment plants the results presented herein provide guidance for operating uv chlorine systems purifying source waters containing bromide and iodide however field experiments are required to validate the practical application of the

17837,forward osmosis fo has great potential for low energy consumption wastewater reuse provided there is no requirement for draw solutes ds regeneration reverse solute flux rsf can lead to ds build up in the feed solution this remains a key challenge because it can cause significant water flux reduction and lead to additional water quality problems herein an osmotic photobioreactor ospbr system was developed to employ fast growing microalgae to consume the rsf nutrients diammonium phosphate dap was used as a fertilizer ds and algal biomass was a byproduct the addition of microalgae into the ospbr proved to maintain water flux while reducing the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p and chemical oxygen demand cod in the ospbr feed solution by 44 4 85 6 and 77 5 respectively due to the forward cation flux and precipitation intermittent supplements of k mg2 ca2 and so4 2 salts further stimulated algal growth and culture densities by 58 7 with an optimal hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 33 d the ospbr overcame nh4 n overloading and stabilized key nutrients nh4 n at 2 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p 0 6 mg l 1 and cod 30 mg l 1 a moderate nitrogen reduction stress resulted in a high carbohydrate content 51 3 0 1 among microalgal cells a solids retention time srt of 17 82 d was found to increase high density microalgae by 3 fold with a high yield of both lipids 9 07 g m 3 d 1 and carbohydrates 16 66 g m 3 d 1 this study encourages further exploration of the ospbr technology for simultaneous recovery of high quality water and production of algal biomass for value added products graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae forward osmosis reverse solute flux salinity buildup wastewater reuse 1 introduction using wastewater effluent for agricultural irrigation has been practiced for many years however the increased attention to human health and presence of emerging contaminants in wastewater that cannot be effectively removed by conventional treatment also creates a need for advanced treatment it was estimated 47 of emerging contaminants remained in the effluent after conventional wastewater treatment mohapatra et al 2016 a toxicological assessment revealed that carbamazepine diclofenac gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole pharmaceuticals erythromycin ciprofloxacin antibiotics nickel heavy metal in the wastewater effluent all have substantial risk for soil and human health muñoz et al 2009 among the advanced treatment technologies forward osmosis fo has been studied intensively as a membrane separation process for wastewater treatment desalination and resource recovery ang et al 2019 ansari et al 2017 lutchmiah et al 2014b subramani and jacangelo 2015 fo can be energy advantageous if regeneration of draw solution is not required for example estimated at 0 02 kwh m 3 for wastewater reuse zou and he 2016 with diffusion governed transfer of water fo has the benefits of lower fouling propensity and better durability in complex solutions like wastewater lutchmiah et al 2014a many fo studies have focused on the permeate i e final draw solution which is the high quality water extracted from saline water or wastewater achilli et al 2009 luo et al 2017 other studies have focused on the feed reducing water content and concentrating the desired compounds e g algae or sludge dewatering microalgae dewatering by fo is of particular interest because the separation of microalgal biomass is a key challenge for algal bioproducts industry buckwalter et al 2013 researchers have explored various draw solutions for microalgae dewatering including seawater nacl mgcl2 and human urine nawi et al 2020 volpin et al 2019 zou et al 2011 for example the nacl draw solution achieved 81 volume reduction for a 1 g l 1 microalgae suspension in 70 h by using a 12 5 cm2 aquaporin based polyethersulfone fo membrane and a water flux of 2 4 lmh munshi et al 2018 the membrane fouling effect became more significant when a critical flux of 9 3 15 5 l m 2 h 1 was used to dewater chlorella sorokiniana zou et al 2013 a thin film composite tfc membrane was found to have higher water permeability and better physical cleaning recovery from soluble algal product saps fouling than a cellulose triacetate membrane cta li et al 2018 microalgal growth consumes co2 and nutrients and thus algae have been investigated for wastewater treatment judd et al 2015 liu et al 2017 an osmotic photobioreactor ospbr integrates fo with algal wastewater treatment which focuses on both the feed algal growth and contaminant removal and the permeate water recovery the ospbr system has been demonstrated to treat tertiary wastewater praveen and loh 2016 and was capable of removing 95 of nh4 n and 89 of po4 3 p because of the excellent fo membrane rejection the ospbr out performed a microfiltration based membrane photobioreactor showing improved biomass retention and effluent quality praveen et al 2016 proper physical parameters such as a higher n p ratio and a longer illumination cycle could be beneficial for nutrients removal and biomass productivity in ospbrs praveen and loh 2019 microalgae were also cultivated in the draw solution side to remove ammonium that migrated from the feeding wastewater into the draw solution however algal concentration remained low due to the dilution effect for example an ospbr maintained an algal concentration of at 606 29 mg l 1 in its draw solution rood et al 2019 thus an effective approach is to grow microalgae in the feed solution that can concentrate biomass during fo operation for example from 11 mg l 1 to 5 g l 1 algal biomass concentration in an ospbr that generates a permeate without microalgae contamination praveen and loh 2016 in the ospbr studies reported nacl was used as the ds but the feasibility of applying other ds in an ospbr remains unknown fertilizer drawn fo fdfo is a process that eliminates the energy intensive ds regeneration by fertigation johnson et al 2018 phuntsho et al 2011 suwaileh et al 2020 it may be compatible with microalgae growth but has not yet been examined in ospbrs as an fo centered membrane bioreactor ospbrs also face challenges of membrane fouling and reverse solution flux rsf the former has been extensively studied for fo system and potential control strategies have been developed she et al 2016 the latter has received much less attention rsf occurs where draw solutes ds are transferred from a draw solution into a feed solution due to a concentration gradient and the imperfect selectivity of the fo membrane it can result in the buildup of undesired compounds in the feed solution decreased osmotic pressure difference and accelerated formation of cake enhanced osmotic pressure boo et al 2012 lay et al 2011 xiao et al 2011 in the microalgae dewatering application 29 water flux drop was observed due to significant rsf and biofilm attachment munshi et al 2018 when cacl2 was used as a ds the reverse fluxed ca2 accelerated the formation of cake layer from saps on the surface of tfc membrane and deteriorated the system performance li et al 2018 rsf can also degenerate microbial activity and thus reduce biological treatment efficiency alturki et al 2012 nawaz et al 2013 in an fdfo the reverse fluxed nutrients could induce severe membrane scaling and cause significant water flux drop due to the formation of hydroxyapatite and magnesium phosphate phuntsho et al 2014 in addition this could give rise to undesirable microorganisms phuntsho et al 2016 in an ospbr rsf would contribute to gradual salinity build up e g as high as 34 ms cm 1 resulting in the elevated energy and solutes input slow algae growth and algae aggregation and settlement praveen et al 2016 praveen and loh 2019 rsf can be mitigated by membrane fabrication and modification physical separation by membrane or electric field chemical chelation or precipitation or biological degradation zou et al 2018 the reverse fluxed ds may also be recovered for possible reuse ferby et al 2020 considering the need for nutrients by algal growth and that the same nutrients can act as ds we propose to use microalgae to consume the reverse fluxed nutrient ds indicating nh4 po4 3 throughout this paper in an ospbr with this setup rsf may be a beneficial process for algal growth that could enhance water and resource recovery from wastewater treatment it is noted that algal biomass is a byproduct of the proposed system which is different from typical fo microalgae systems that focus on algal production and dewatering kumar et al 2020 ryu et al 2020 the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the benefits of using microalgae to alleviate the buildup of reverse fluxed ds 2 understand the effect of ions transport and depletion on microalgal growth and 3 investigate the key operation parameters including hydraulic retention time hrt and biomass harvesting frequency solids retention time or srt 2 methods 2 1 osmotic photobioreactor system ospbr the ospbr system used in this study consisted of two components a 1 l photobioreactor pbr and a hollow fiber fo module fo module in fig s1 the pbr contained two fast growing microalgae cultures chlorella vulgaris utex 395 and scenedesmus sp htb1 with an initial dry weight ratio of 2 1 the mixture of the two microalgae strains has been found to enhance the nh4 n and po4 3 p uptake rates paches et al 2020 both strains were obtained from the institute of marine and environmental technology university of maryland usa the microalgae were cultivated in bg11 medium under continuous aeration and 16 h on 8 h off led light illumination of 15 μe m 2 s 1 at 20 c then the culture was concentrated by centrifugation 3 min at 3000 g room temperature and resuspended to around 0 4 g dry biomass l 1 in a pre growth medium table s1 the pbr was illuminated by 100 μe m 2 s 1 fluorescent light under a day night cycle of 16 h on 8 h off at 20 c and continuously mixed by a magnetic stirring plate at 160 rpm the aquaporin inside hffo2 fo element aquaporin a s lyngby denmark was used as the fo unit it was made of a thin film composite tfc hollow fiber module with a total surface area of 2 3 m2 the compact surface area ensured a relatively low permeate flux to alleviated membrane fouling the pbr and the fo were hydraulically connected in a fed batch mode to concentrate wastewater in the fo and then transfer it to the pbr for algal growth and nutrient removal the schematic is shown in fig 1 in the first cycle a mixture composed of 1200 ml of a mimicked tertiary wastewater formulation given below and 200 ml algal solution was fed to the feed side of the fo the volume was reduced to 200 ml 100 water recovery after the fo process the 200 ml concentrate with elevated nutrient levels was transferred to the pbr for algal growth in following cycles the same mixture was fed to the fo the mimicked tertiary wastewater contained in deionized water 50 mg l 1 glucose 150 mg l 1 nacl 45 mg l 1 nh4cl 30 mg l 1 nahco3 21 4 mg l 1 k2hpo4 10 6 mg l 1 kh2po4 6 mg l 1 cacl2 and 4 5 mg l 1 mgso4 the fo unit was operated with the lumen side active layer facing the feed solution i e fo mode and it used a 0 15 0 2 m diammonium phosphate dap draw solution membrane bioreactors circulating microalgae through the lumen side of the hollow fibers without obvious biomass clogging have been described previously carvalho and malcata 2001 vu and loh 2016 dap is of great interest as a fertilizer ds because of its nearly neutral ph 8 that is friendly to fo membrane and low specific rsf of 2 5 mmol l 1 phuntsho et al 2011 a baseline test with di water as the feed was also conducted to evaluate the baseline rsf the use of low concentration draw solution was due to the large membrane surface area that was sufficient to produce the desired amount of water at a low water flux in each batch test both draw solution and feed solution were recirculated under 220 ml min 1 after each fo process 200 ml 0 2 0 4 m nacl was applied as draw solution to osmotically backwash the fo module for 40 min to ensure a stable membrane performance 2 2 experimental procedure the performance of the ospbr was assessed by comparing it with a control fdfo system lacking microalgae culture the control system was covered with aluminum foil to inhibit microalgae growth the initial hrt was 1 67 d it was then increased to 3 33 d both systems were aerated at 50 ml min 1 for 16 h every day previous ospbr studies cultivated algae with complete retention over 162 days praveen and loh 2016 which could cause low microalgae vitality here microalgal biomass was harvested using microfiltration 0 22 μm on a daily basis to achieve biomass srt of 15 days unless otherwise noted to ensure microalgal activity to examine the effect of essential elements depletion from forward solute flux and precipitation on microalgal growth we compared ospbr performance with and without supplementation those two ospbrs were operated under the same condition as that in the feasibility study except that additional 0 15 g l 1 per pbr volume nahco3 was provided every 72 h to ensure sufficient inorganic carbon source when the pbr ph 11 was exceeded 2 min bubbling of 20 co2 n2 gas was performed the ospbr with chemical supplementation contained more mgso4 0 075 g l 1 in the initial synthetic medium and was provided with additional supplements every 96 h the chemical supplementation contained per pbr volume 9 7 mg l 1 mgso4 8 9 mg l 1 cacl2 10 7 mg l 1 k2hpo4 5 3 mg l 1 kh2po4 and 0 3 ml l 1 trace metal solutions as described previously stanier et al 1971 the performance of the ospbr was investigated further for the influence of hrt and srt key operational factors the hrt values of pbrs were set to 1 67 d 3 33 d and 6 67 d srt 15 d to study the impacts on solute concentration balance algal growth and water production during ospbr operation srt values of 9 41 d 17 82 d and 25 26 d hrt 3 33 d were used to find the optimal frequency for harvesting microalgae biomass 2 3 measurements and analysis the solution ph and conductivity were measured using a benchtop ph meter oakton instruments vernon hills il usa and a conductivity meter mettler toledo columbus oh usa respectively the dissolved oxygen do was measured using a mw600 portable do meter milwaukee instruments milwaukee wi usa the concentrations of cod and nh4 n were measured using a dr 890 colorimeter hach company loveland co usa the concentrations of selected cations and anions were measured by an ion chromatography dionex lc20 ion chromatograph sunnyvale ca u s a equipped with an ed40 electrochemical detector a digital pressure gauge was connected between peristaltic pump and fo element inlet to monitor the inlet pressure water flux was determined by the measurement of feed solution weight change which was recorded by an electronic balance scort pro ohous columbia md usa the calculation of water flux j w l m 2 h 1 or lmh and j s g m 2 h 1 or gmh was described previously wang et al 2019 the concentration of microalgal biomass was measured as od680 and dry weight od680 was analyzed by a visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 20 waltham ma u s a and converted to dried biomass using a standard curve fig s2 the micro filtered microalgae were air dried at 35 c for 24 h to quantify the dried biomass concentration the lipids content of the dried microalgae pellet was extracted and quantified according to a previously published protocol song et al 2013 the analysis of total carbohydrate was performed using dinitrosalicylic acid reagent method miao and wu 2004 and glucose was used to calibrate the standard curve fig s3 the protein quantification method was modified from the sonication procedure lopez et al 2010 to lowry s method bovine serum albumin calibration curve fig s4 in detail the modification included 1 g l 1 of copper ii sulfate pentahydrate in reagent b1 2 g l 1 of potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate in reagent b2 0 6 ml of reagent b1 and 0 6 ml of reagent b2 in 20 ml of reagent a and 0 15 ml folin reagent addition before the final vortex all chemicals used were purchased from thermo fisher scientific waltham ma u s a and sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the sonication broke the microalgae cell wall using a branson 450 digital sonifier branson ultrasonics danbury ct u s a with pulsed ultrasonic tip under 30 power and 20 khz for 5 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 general ospbr performance the baseline test showed the hffo2 unit had very low backward dap transfer specific rsf being around 0 03 mmol l 1 especially for po4 3 ions only 0 45 of nh4 n and 0 03 of po4 3 p table s2 in the dap ds were diffused to the feed side to support algal growth during the operation thus the use of dap ds will not cause any significant loss of key nutrients in the fertilizer however the lost nutrients to the feed side could affect the quality of the feed solution due to nutrient accumulation if no suitable mitigation is applied more details in the following the ospbr performance was examined through comparison with a control fdfo system that lacked algal growth theoretical accumulation of nutrients assuming in the absence of any uptake was estimated according to rsf from the baseline experiment and the initial nutrient concentration in the mimicked wastewater the expected total nh4 n includes both the expected nh4 n from feed and the contribution from rsf induced nh4 n the difference between the expected values on average 76 2 of the nh4 n in the feed solution was from the feeding secondary effluent and 23 8 was from rsf induced movement table s3 as shown in fig 2 a the accumulation of the rsf induced nh4 n increased with the operation time the nh4 n concentration in the ospbr was always lower than that in the control indicating that the presence of microalgae helped to control nh4 n through algal uptake during the first 100 h the nh4 n concentration was maintained at 12 3 2 5 mg l 1 in the ospbr much lower than the nh4 n concentration of 49 0 mg l 1 in the control however the nh4 n concentration in the ospbr increased dramatically after 110 h while that in the control continued to increase as well likely due to continued loading of nh4 n via rsf from the draw solution and input from the feed solution that exceeded the uptake capacity of the microalgae culture extending the hrt from 1 67 days to 3 33 days at 190 h stopped the increasing trend in both the ospbr and the control but the ospbr still maintained a much lower nh4 n concentration of 55 0 mg l 1 compared to 99 0 mg l 1 in the control it is interesting to note that the nh4 n concentration in the control was lower than the expected total nh4 n concentration suggesting the presence of other processes that potentially removed nh4 n several factors could contribute to this loss the dead volume inside the fo hollow fiber chamber was estimated to contribute 19 2 32 1 of total nh4 n loss for both the ospbr and control bacterial uptake of nitrogen could occur supported by cod reduction more details later but no nitrate nitrite was detected indicating the absence of nitrification in both systems it is also possible for an ammonium forming precipitate to occur with phosphate and minerals in a slightly alkaline solution fig s5 this is discussed further in the following section regarding phosphate loss the little difference between the expected total po4 3 p and the expected po4 3 p from the feed suggested that the reverse fluxed po4 3 p was minimal fig 2b as a result both the ospbr and the control would mostly deal with po4 3 p in the feed solution 93 1 from the feed as shown in table s3 and thus there was not an effect due to overload like that of nh4 n consequently the extended hrt did not affect system performance significantly in the ospbr the po4 3 p concentration decreased slowly to 4 1 1 0 mg l 1 while in the control it rose 6 fold higher to 28 4 0 7 mg l 1 like the nh4 n concentration the po4 3 p concentration in the control was also lower than the expected value 44 5 mg l 1 at 380 h this was likely due to microbial uptake and the formation of phosphate precipitates the final concentrated feed solution had an alkaline ph of 8 15 which could favor the precipitation involving phosphate calcium and or magnesium such as calcium hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh as described previously phuntsho et al 2014 both systems had a high initial cod concentration at 250 0 mg l 1 due to residual glucose in the pre growth medium table s1 the organic substrate in the ospbr was consumed quickly to reach a cod concentration 15 0 mg l 1 after 44 h likely because of mixotrophic metabolism of microalgae and bacteria perez garcia et al 2011 the control also experienced an obvious decrease in its cod concentration possibly by the growth of heterotrophic microbes both systems had greatly reduced the cod concentration to 22 3 6 3 mg l 1 ospbr and 98 9 5 9 mg l 1 control these were statistically lower two tailed t test p 0 05 than the expected final cod accumulation of 555 mg l 1 fig 2c the od680 results suggested a fast growth of microalgae in the first 100 h fig 2d which also resulted in fast cod consumption fig 2c during the same time period then a sharp drop occurred when nh4 n uptake inhibition started at hour 110 fig 2a the trace element supplement 1 ml l 1 pbr volume stanier et al 1971 at hour 165 and 280 recovered the microalgae growth but the nh4 n uptake rate was still low the stabilized microalgae concentration reached 0 82 g l 1 with the concentration having been increased by 2 36 fold this was similar to the concentration factor reported in some studies of fo dewatering microalgae buckwalter et al 2013 volpin et al 2019 microalgae aggregation that reduces light exposure is common in an ospbr praveen and loh 2019 but this was not observed in the present study possibly due to the low salinity in the ospbr the conductivity was 34 5 lower than that of control this was likely due to greater nutrient removal by microalgae that alleviated salinity buildup this lower conductivity was expected to result in a larger osmotic pressure difference in the ospbr for a higher water flux however the osbpr and the control showed similarly averaged water flux 0 63 0 07 lmh for the ospbr 0 60 0 08 lmh for the control p 0 05 fig s6 this result was likely related to biofouling of fo membrane module by algal cells that impeded water permeation in the ospbr because of the enclosed hollow fiber module some algal cells could have been trapped in the dead volume and lumen chamber inlet resulting in a significant decrease of algal concentration fig s7 and making the remaining algal biomass subject to collection from washouts backwash was effective to remove the accumulated biomass and restore the inlet pressure in the hollow fiber module fig s8 the problem of biomass clogging could be addressed in the future with submerged hollow fiber fo membranes 3 2 ions depletion and supplement effect the decreased algal growth in the presence of n and p fig 2d indicated that algal growth in the ospbr was limited by other elements the conductivity of the initial and final feed solutions had a concentration factor of 2 19 3 63 fold fig s9 much lower than the water volume reduction ratio 7 fold after each operation cycle this suggested that ions were lost during fo treatment likely via forward ion flux and or precipitation the analysis of other major ions including na k and ca2 showed that their concentrations descended continuously throughout the operation period in both systems fig 3 a na was the dominant cation and its concentration decreased from 215 6 mg l 1 to 49 1 1 6 mg l 1 in both systems k was another major monovalent cation and its concentration also decreased from 31 0 mg l 1 to 12 1 0 5 mg l 1 ospbr or 16 5 0 5 mg l 1 control according to the mass balance in eq 1 the membrane rejection for na and k was only 7 1 and 10 3 respectively 1 r 1 c d f v d f c f i v f i in eq 1 c f i c d f is the ion concentration in the initial feed and final draw solution respectively v f i v d f is the volume of initial feed and final draw solution respectively the large amount of forward na and k flux possibly resulted from the rsf of nh4 ions where charge imbalance drove cations with a small hydrated diameter to move along with forward water flux i e cation exchange occurred arena et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 this led to a noticeable amount of na 2 34 in the permeate a diluted fertilizer solution it is expected an fo membrane would have good rejection of ca2 and mg2 due to large diameters of hydrated ions achilli et al 2010 but the ca2 concentration decreased from 8 9 mg l 1 to a non detectable level after 210 h and the mg2 was reduced from 1 8 mg l 1 to below 0 5 mg l 1 in both systems this again implied that mg2 and ca2 precipitation might have occurred the fertilizer composition was still dominated by nh4 n and po4 3 p both of which made up more than 95 w w fig 3b other ions in the diluted fertilizer solution included cl 1 37 k 0 65 and both ca2 and mg2 were less than 0 004 the total volume of water extracted reached 227 l kg dap 1 higher than 168 l kg 1 in a previous study treating brackish groundwater phuntsho et al 2013 we have demonstrated that the addition of essential elements could help to recover microalgal growth and this was further studied with periodical supplementation every 96 h to increase ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations these are essential elements support cell membrane structure enzyme activities and photosynthetic constituents in algal cells esakkimuthu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 but they were at very low or non detectable levels in the ospbr with supplementation the ospbr maintained ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations at 3 2 0 8 mg l 1 6 5 0 8 mg l 1 and 32 2 7 0 mg l 1 respectively fig s10 the ospbr with supplementation exhibited a lower nh4 n accumulation rate of 3 0 mg n l 1 d 1 compared to 4 7 mg n l 1 d 1 without supplementation fig 4 a after 440 h operation the nh4 n concentration in the ospbr with supplementation was 59 5 mg l 1 27 lower than that without because of the low po4 3 p level fig 2b phosphate was also included in the supplement to stimulate microalgae growth with the additional phosphate the ospbr had a relatively higher po4 3 p concentration of 5 7 1 3 mg l 1 than the one without 2 1 1 1 mg l 1 however both were able to keep po4 3 p concentrations level lower than the initial concentration of 11 6 1 0 mg l 1 this implied that the ospbr might have a potential for higher po4 3 p loading regardless of supplementation the cod concentration remained below 30 mg l 1 fig s11 the effect of essential elements supplement was demonstrated further by examining algal growth the difference in algal growth became more obvious after 150 h fig 4b due to essential element deficiency the microalgae growth rate in the ospbr without supplementation failed to compensate the biosolids discharge srt of 15 days and the final microalgae density dropped to od680 of 1 43 while the ospbr with supplementation increased in microalgal density by 58 7 with an od680 of 2 27 a higher ph 9 50 10 45 in the ospbr with supplementation than that of the ospbr without ph 7 69 8 87 also indicated a better photosynthetic activity axelsson 1988 which could promote the consumption of hco3 by the microalgae and the increase in culture ph thus the essential elements supplement proved beneficial and was adopted for the subsequent studies 3 3 optimal hydraulic capacity because of the concentration effect of the feed solution and high rsf of nh4 n the nh4 n built up in the ospbr fig 4a eventually leading to system failure this was addressed by extending the hrt to 3 33 or 6 67 d which was within the typical range of hrt for algal treatment of wastewater tang et al 2012 a longer hrt decreased nutrient concentrations as shown in fig 5 a the extended hrt to 3 33 or 6 67 d decreased the final nh4 n concentration to 2 5 or 2 0 mg l 1 while the continuous overloading of nh4 n at hrt 1 67 d resulted in an accumulation to 59 0 mg l 1 after 440 h like nh4 n the po4 3 p also showed a significant decrease in concentration to below 0 4 mg l 1 with the extended hrts in contrast to 9 1 1 7 mg l 1 at hrt 1 67 d fig 5b the extension of hrt did not affect the cod concentration significantly fig s12 because of sufficient cod removal capacity even at a low hrt of 1 67 d however it was observed that in the late phase of operation the long hrt of 6 67 d had a higher cod concentration p 0 05 indicating environmental stress details to follow for the microalgal culture and excreted saps that likely contributed to cod release also varying hrt did not significantly affect water flux 0 73 lmh p 0 05 fig s13 extending the hrt resulted in more biomass production in the ospbr although the values of od680 fluctuated at 2 18 0 07 2 40 0 06 and 2 33 0 08 for 1 67 d 3 33 d and 6 66 d respectively fig s14 the absolute amount of biomass harvested from the pbr increased from 0 09 0 003 g 1 67 d to 0 23 0 01 g 3 33 d and then to 0 56 0 02 g 6 67 d l 1 of treated wastewater the harvested biomass included microalgae and non algal biomass such as heterotrophic microbes od680 values were used to estimate the microalgae biomass at 0 085 0 003 g 1 67 d 0 188 0 004 g 3 33 d and 0 364 0 012 g 6 67 d l 1 of treated wastewater it was found that the portion of microalgae in the harvested biomass decreased from 91 5 1 67 d to 64 9 6 67 d fig 6 a this was possibly due to the endogenous decay of microalgae cells under low nutrient loading with a higher hrt this could have released intracellular carbon supporting heterotrophic bacterial growth as has been observed luo et al 2018 we further analyzed three extracts from microalgae lipids carbohydrates and protein fig 6b variation of hrt did not affect lipids content all around 14 but carbohydrates and protein differed among the three tested hrts an hrt of 3 33 d resulted in the most carbohydrates 51 3 0 1 storage in microalgal cells followed by 6 67 d 41 1 1 7 and 1 67 d 27 3 1 3 it was reported that suitable environmental stresses could be used to accumulate lipids and carbohydrates in microalgae cells chen et al 2017 the microalgae at hrt 3 33 d or 6 67 d were under more stress from heterotrophic competitors and limited nitrogen source the microalgae at hrt 1 67 d had a significantly higher protein content of 48 2 2 4 than other two groups probably due to the higher nh4 n level which may have stimulated protein synthesis microscopy imaging revealed that microalgal cells at hrt 1 67 d were visually larger in size than that of 3 33 d this was accompanied by a higher organic loading rate at hrt 1 67 d and is consistent with other observations chioccioli et al 2014 it was also observed that the microalgae culture at hrt 6 67 d was more dominated by scenedesmus which has been reported to have higher tolerance under harsh conditions such as living in 10 12 co2 air gases liu et al 2013 or nitrogen starvation conditions paches et al 2020 an hrt 3 33 d was used in the following study because of the high carbohydrate accumulation and a balance between treatment capacity and nutrient removal performance 3 4 optimal biomass harvesting frequency the frequency for harvesting microalgal biomass determines the srt and can affect both microalgae growth and treatment performance three srts of 9 41 d 17 82 d and 25 26 d were studied and are in the typical range for membrane photobioreactors honda et al 2012 as shown in fig 7 a the srt 9 41 d had relatively higher nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations than those at 17 82 d and 25 26 d before 280 h however this effect disappeared after a longer period of operation all three srts led to quick consumption and exhaustion of nh4 n in 24 48 h after each feed 96 h interval the po4 3 p concentration was also reduced gradually to 0 6 0 03 mg l 1 after 480 h fig 7a there was some residual no3 n from the bg11 medium and we noticed that no3 n was only reduced when nh4 n was consumed completely fig s15 suggesting that nh4 n was the preferred nitrogen source for the microalgae in this study by extending the srt it was expected microalgae would accumulate to higher biomass density in the pbr the steady state od680 increased from 1 71 0 05 9 41 d to 2 48 0 09 17 82 d and then to 3 07 0 17 25 26 d corresponding to a concentration factor of 2 03 2 93 and 3 63 fold respectively fig 7b there was no significant difference between the three srts in terms of the proportion of microalgae in the absolute dried biomass all at 80 85 the specific harvested microalgae reached 0 21 0 01 0 16 0 01 0 14 0 01 g l 1 of treated wastewater with a harvesting rate of 64 23 49 26 and 43 17 mg l 1 reactor volume d 1 for 9 41 d 17 82 d and 25 26 d respectively the dense microalgae suspension at srt 17 82 d and 25 26 d stimulated microalgal cells to generate more saps in the late phase of operation resulting in increases of cod to 53 7 and 65 3 mg l 1 for 17 82 d and 25 26 d much higher than 24 3 mg l 1 for 9 41 d fig 7b such accumulation of saps at a high srt could further inhibit the activity of microalgae zhuang et al 2016 and this might explain the lower harvesting rate at a longer srt the lipids carbohydrates and protein contents of microalgae at different srt also varied fig 7c and were mainly related to the different biomass densities srt 25 26 d had the highest carbohydrates content 41 7 2 8 p 0 05 and both srt 25 26 d 17 82 d stored more lipids than srt 9 41 d p 0 05 a stronger competition for nutrients under a higher cell densities at both srts may have driven microalgal cells to accumulate more energy storage compounds as has been observed chi et al 2016 there was no significant difference in terms of protein as the nutrient loading rates were similar when hrt was fixed at 3 33 d if lipids and carbohydrates were the desirable products an intermediate srt of 17 82 d would be a good option with yields of 9 07 g m 3 d 1 and 16 66 g m 3 d 1 respectively although srt 9 41 d had the highest microalgae harvesting rate the biomass suspension was less condensed than that at srt 17 82 d and this might increase the dewatering expenses for all srts ph remained around 11 fig s16 and the averaged water flux fig s17 showed no statistical difference p 0 05 4 conclusions this study demonstrated a fertilizer drawn ospbr system to extract water from a mimicked tertiary wastewater and employed microalgae to maintain a low nutrient accumulation level specific conclusions are as follows 1 compared with the control that lacked microalgae in the feed wastewater the ospbr effectively alleviated nh4 n accumulation 55 0 mg l 1 vs 99 0 mg l 1 in the control and continuously removed both po4 3 p 4 1 mg l 1 vs 28 4 mg l 1 in the control and cod 22 3 mg l 1 vs 98 9 mg l 1 in the control from the feed solution water flux was not significantly affected by the presence of microalgae 2 decline of conductivity and major cations concentration was due to forward ion exchange reduced na and k and chemical precipitation reduced mg2 and ca2 the growth of microalgae was negatively impacted by ion depletion periodic essential elements supplementation resulted in 58 7 higher microalgal density than the system without supplementation more than 95 of solutes in the final diammonium phosphate solution were nh4 n and po4 3 p 3 at an hrt 3 33 d the microalgae could overcome the nh4 n overloading and stabilize concentrations of nh4 n 2 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p 0 6 mg l 1 and cod 30 mg l 1 a longer hrt resulted in a higher specific amount of microalgae harvested but higher heterogeneity of the total biomass was observed the harvested biomass had the highest carbohydrate content 51 3 0 1 at hrt 3 33 d and the highest protein content 48 2 2 4 at hrt 1 67 d to balance between treatment performance capacity and microalgal biomass production hrt 3 33 d showed to be preferred 4 the srt had limited effects on nutrients removal an extended srt led to a higher concentration of microalgal biomass but a lower harvesting rate at srt 25 26 d a high biomass density with a concentration factor of 3 63 fold likely stimulated the excretion of soluble microalgal products and increased cod to 65 3 mg l 1 a long srt favored accumulation of lipids and carbohydrates in microalgal cells an intermediate srt of 17 82 d was suggested for lipid and carbohydrate yields of 9 07 g m 3 d 1 and 16 66 g m 3 d 1 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17837,forward osmosis fo has great potential for low energy consumption wastewater reuse provided there is no requirement for draw solutes ds regeneration reverse solute flux rsf can lead to ds build up in the feed solution this remains a key challenge because it can cause significant water flux reduction and lead to additional water quality problems herein an osmotic photobioreactor ospbr system was developed to employ fast growing microalgae to consume the rsf nutrients diammonium phosphate dap was used as a fertilizer ds and algal biomass was a byproduct the addition of microalgae into the ospbr proved to maintain water flux while reducing the concentrations of nh4 n po4 3 p and chemical oxygen demand cod in the ospbr feed solution by 44 4 85 6 and 77 5 respectively due to the forward cation flux and precipitation intermittent supplements of k mg2 ca2 and so4 2 salts further stimulated algal growth and culture densities by 58 7 with an optimal hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 33 d the ospbr overcame nh4 n overloading and stabilized key nutrients nh4 n at 2 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p 0 6 mg l 1 and cod 30 mg l 1 a moderate nitrogen reduction stress resulted in a high carbohydrate content 51 3 0 1 among microalgal cells a solids retention time srt of 17 82 d was found to increase high density microalgae by 3 fold with a high yield of both lipids 9 07 g m 3 d 1 and carbohydrates 16 66 g m 3 d 1 this study encourages further exploration of the ospbr technology for simultaneous recovery of high quality water and production of algal biomass for value added products graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae forward osmosis reverse solute flux salinity buildup wastewater reuse 1 introduction using wastewater effluent for agricultural irrigation has been practiced for many years however the increased attention to human health and presence of emerging contaminants in wastewater that cannot be effectively removed by conventional treatment also creates a need for advanced treatment it was estimated 47 of emerging contaminants remained in the effluent after conventional wastewater treatment mohapatra et al 2016 a toxicological assessment revealed that carbamazepine diclofenac gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole pharmaceuticals erythromycin ciprofloxacin antibiotics nickel heavy metal in the wastewater effluent all have substantial risk for soil and human health muñoz et al 2009 among the advanced treatment technologies forward osmosis fo has been studied intensively as a membrane separation process for wastewater treatment desalination and resource recovery ang et al 2019 ansari et al 2017 lutchmiah et al 2014b subramani and jacangelo 2015 fo can be energy advantageous if regeneration of draw solution is not required for example estimated at 0 02 kwh m 3 for wastewater reuse zou and he 2016 with diffusion governed transfer of water fo has the benefits of lower fouling propensity and better durability in complex solutions like wastewater lutchmiah et al 2014a many fo studies have focused on the permeate i e final draw solution which is the high quality water extracted from saline water or wastewater achilli et al 2009 luo et al 2017 other studies have focused on the feed reducing water content and concentrating the desired compounds e g algae or sludge dewatering microalgae dewatering by fo is of particular interest because the separation of microalgal biomass is a key challenge for algal bioproducts industry buckwalter et al 2013 researchers have explored various draw solutions for microalgae dewatering including seawater nacl mgcl2 and human urine nawi et al 2020 volpin et al 2019 zou et al 2011 for example the nacl draw solution achieved 81 volume reduction for a 1 g l 1 microalgae suspension in 70 h by using a 12 5 cm2 aquaporin based polyethersulfone fo membrane and a water flux of 2 4 lmh munshi et al 2018 the membrane fouling effect became more significant when a critical flux of 9 3 15 5 l m 2 h 1 was used to dewater chlorella sorokiniana zou et al 2013 a thin film composite tfc membrane was found to have higher water permeability and better physical cleaning recovery from soluble algal product saps fouling than a cellulose triacetate membrane cta li et al 2018 microalgal growth consumes co2 and nutrients and thus algae have been investigated for wastewater treatment judd et al 2015 liu et al 2017 an osmotic photobioreactor ospbr integrates fo with algal wastewater treatment which focuses on both the feed algal growth and contaminant removal and the permeate water recovery the ospbr system has been demonstrated to treat tertiary wastewater praveen and loh 2016 and was capable of removing 95 of nh4 n and 89 of po4 3 p because of the excellent fo membrane rejection the ospbr out performed a microfiltration based membrane photobioreactor showing improved biomass retention and effluent quality praveen et al 2016 proper physical parameters such as a higher n p ratio and a longer illumination cycle could be beneficial for nutrients removal and biomass productivity in ospbrs praveen and loh 2019 microalgae were also cultivated in the draw solution side to remove ammonium that migrated from the feeding wastewater into the draw solution however algal concentration remained low due to the dilution effect for example an ospbr maintained an algal concentration of at 606 29 mg l 1 in its draw solution rood et al 2019 thus an effective approach is to grow microalgae in the feed solution that can concentrate biomass during fo operation for example from 11 mg l 1 to 5 g l 1 algal biomass concentration in an ospbr that generates a permeate without microalgae contamination praveen and loh 2016 in the ospbr studies reported nacl was used as the ds but the feasibility of applying other ds in an ospbr remains unknown fertilizer drawn fo fdfo is a process that eliminates the energy intensive ds regeneration by fertigation johnson et al 2018 phuntsho et al 2011 suwaileh et al 2020 it may be compatible with microalgae growth but has not yet been examined in ospbrs as an fo centered membrane bioreactor ospbrs also face challenges of membrane fouling and reverse solution flux rsf the former has been extensively studied for fo system and potential control strategies have been developed she et al 2016 the latter has received much less attention rsf occurs where draw solutes ds are transferred from a draw solution into a feed solution due to a concentration gradient and the imperfect selectivity of the fo membrane it can result in the buildup of undesired compounds in the feed solution decreased osmotic pressure difference and accelerated formation of cake enhanced osmotic pressure boo et al 2012 lay et al 2011 xiao et al 2011 in the microalgae dewatering application 29 water flux drop was observed due to significant rsf and biofilm attachment munshi et al 2018 when cacl2 was used as a ds the reverse fluxed ca2 accelerated the formation of cake layer from saps on the surface of tfc membrane and deteriorated the system performance li et al 2018 rsf can also degenerate microbial activity and thus reduce biological treatment efficiency alturki et al 2012 nawaz et al 2013 in an fdfo the reverse fluxed nutrients could induce severe membrane scaling and cause significant water flux drop due to the formation of hydroxyapatite and magnesium phosphate phuntsho et al 2014 in addition this could give rise to undesirable microorganisms phuntsho et al 2016 in an ospbr rsf would contribute to gradual salinity build up e g as high as 34 ms cm 1 resulting in the elevated energy and solutes input slow algae growth and algae aggregation and settlement praveen et al 2016 praveen and loh 2019 rsf can be mitigated by membrane fabrication and modification physical separation by membrane or electric field chemical chelation or precipitation or biological degradation zou et al 2018 the reverse fluxed ds may also be recovered for possible reuse ferby et al 2020 considering the need for nutrients by algal growth and that the same nutrients can act as ds we propose to use microalgae to consume the reverse fluxed nutrient ds indicating nh4 po4 3 throughout this paper in an ospbr with this setup rsf may be a beneficial process for algal growth that could enhance water and resource recovery from wastewater treatment it is noted that algal biomass is a byproduct of the proposed system which is different from typical fo microalgae systems that focus on algal production and dewatering kumar et al 2020 ryu et al 2020 the specific objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate the benefits of using microalgae to alleviate the buildup of reverse fluxed ds 2 understand the effect of ions transport and depletion on microalgal growth and 3 investigate the key operation parameters including hydraulic retention time hrt and biomass harvesting frequency solids retention time or srt 2 methods 2 1 osmotic photobioreactor system ospbr the ospbr system used in this study consisted of two components a 1 l photobioreactor pbr and a hollow fiber fo module fo module in fig s1 the pbr contained two fast growing microalgae cultures chlorella vulgaris utex 395 and scenedesmus sp htb1 with an initial dry weight ratio of 2 1 the mixture of the two microalgae strains has been found to enhance the nh4 n and po4 3 p uptake rates paches et al 2020 both strains were obtained from the institute of marine and environmental technology university of maryland usa the microalgae were cultivated in bg11 medium under continuous aeration and 16 h on 8 h off led light illumination of 15 μe m 2 s 1 at 20 c then the culture was concentrated by centrifugation 3 min at 3000 g room temperature and resuspended to around 0 4 g dry biomass l 1 in a pre growth medium table s1 the pbr was illuminated by 100 μe m 2 s 1 fluorescent light under a day night cycle of 16 h on 8 h off at 20 c and continuously mixed by a magnetic stirring plate at 160 rpm the aquaporin inside hffo2 fo element aquaporin a s lyngby denmark was used as the fo unit it was made of a thin film composite tfc hollow fiber module with a total surface area of 2 3 m2 the compact surface area ensured a relatively low permeate flux to alleviated membrane fouling the pbr and the fo were hydraulically connected in a fed batch mode to concentrate wastewater in the fo and then transfer it to the pbr for algal growth and nutrient removal the schematic is shown in fig 1 in the first cycle a mixture composed of 1200 ml of a mimicked tertiary wastewater formulation given below and 200 ml algal solution was fed to the feed side of the fo the volume was reduced to 200 ml 100 water recovery after the fo process the 200 ml concentrate with elevated nutrient levels was transferred to the pbr for algal growth in following cycles the same mixture was fed to the fo the mimicked tertiary wastewater contained in deionized water 50 mg l 1 glucose 150 mg l 1 nacl 45 mg l 1 nh4cl 30 mg l 1 nahco3 21 4 mg l 1 k2hpo4 10 6 mg l 1 kh2po4 6 mg l 1 cacl2 and 4 5 mg l 1 mgso4 the fo unit was operated with the lumen side active layer facing the feed solution i e fo mode and it used a 0 15 0 2 m diammonium phosphate dap draw solution membrane bioreactors circulating microalgae through the lumen side of the hollow fibers without obvious biomass clogging have been described previously carvalho and malcata 2001 vu and loh 2016 dap is of great interest as a fertilizer ds because of its nearly neutral ph 8 that is friendly to fo membrane and low specific rsf of 2 5 mmol l 1 phuntsho et al 2011 a baseline test with di water as the feed was also conducted to evaluate the baseline rsf the use of low concentration draw solution was due to the large membrane surface area that was sufficient to produce the desired amount of water at a low water flux in each batch test both draw solution and feed solution were recirculated under 220 ml min 1 after each fo process 200 ml 0 2 0 4 m nacl was applied as draw solution to osmotically backwash the fo module for 40 min to ensure a stable membrane performance 2 2 experimental procedure the performance of the ospbr was assessed by comparing it with a control fdfo system lacking microalgae culture the control system was covered with aluminum foil to inhibit microalgae growth the initial hrt was 1 67 d it was then increased to 3 33 d both systems were aerated at 50 ml min 1 for 16 h every day previous ospbr studies cultivated algae with complete retention over 162 days praveen and loh 2016 which could cause low microalgae vitality here microalgal biomass was harvested using microfiltration 0 22 μm on a daily basis to achieve biomass srt of 15 days unless otherwise noted to ensure microalgal activity to examine the effect of essential elements depletion from forward solute flux and precipitation on microalgal growth we compared ospbr performance with and without supplementation those two ospbrs were operated under the same condition as that in the feasibility study except that additional 0 15 g l 1 per pbr volume nahco3 was provided every 72 h to ensure sufficient inorganic carbon source when the pbr ph 11 was exceeded 2 min bubbling of 20 co2 n2 gas was performed the ospbr with chemical supplementation contained more mgso4 0 075 g l 1 in the initial synthetic medium and was provided with additional supplements every 96 h the chemical supplementation contained per pbr volume 9 7 mg l 1 mgso4 8 9 mg l 1 cacl2 10 7 mg l 1 k2hpo4 5 3 mg l 1 kh2po4 and 0 3 ml l 1 trace metal solutions as described previously stanier et al 1971 the performance of the ospbr was investigated further for the influence of hrt and srt key operational factors the hrt values of pbrs were set to 1 67 d 3 33 d and 6 67 d srt 15 d to study the impacts on solute concentration balance algal growth and water production during ospbr operation srt values of 9 41 d 17 82 d and 25 26 d hrt 3 33 d were used to find the optimal frequency for harvesting microalgae biomass 2 3 measurements and analysis the solution ph and conductivity were measured using a benchtop ph meter oakton instruments vernon hills il usa and a conductivity meter mettler toledo columbus oh usa respectively the dissolved oxygen do was measured using a mw600 portable do meter milwaukee instruments milwaukee wi usa the concentrations of cod and nh4 n were measured using a dr 890 colorimeter hach company loveland co usa the concentrations of selected cations and anions were measured by an ion chromatography dionex lc20 ion chromatograph sunnyvale ca u s a equipped with an ed40 electrochemical detector a digital pressure gauge was connected between peristaltic pump and fo element inlet to monitor the inlet pressure water flux was determined by the measurement of feed solution weight change which was recorded by an electronic balance scort pro ohous columbia md usa the calculation of water flux j w l m 2 h 1 or lmh and j s g m 2 h 1 or gmh was described previously wang et al 2019 the concentration of microalgal biomass was measured as od680 and dry weight od680 was analyzed by a visible spectrophotometer thermo scientific genesys 20 waltham ma u s a and converted to dried biomass using a standard curve fig s2 the micro filtered microalgae were air dried at 35 c for 24 h to quantify the dried biomass concentration the lipids content of the dried microalgae pellet was extracted and quantified according to a previously published protocol song et al 2013 the analysis of total carbohydrate was performed using dinitrosalicylic acid reagent method miao and wu 2004 and glucose was used to calibrate the standard curve fig s3 the protein quantification method was modified from the sonication procedure lopez et al 2010 to lowry s method bovine serum albumin calibration curve fig s4 in detail the modification included 1 g l 1 of copper ii sulfate pentahydrate in reagent b1 2 g l 1 of potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate in reagent b2 0 6 ml of reagent b1 and 0 6 ml of reagent b2 in 20 ml of reagent a and 0 15 ml folin reagent addition before the final vortex all chemicals used were purchased from thermo fisher scientific waltham ma u s a and sigma aldrich st louis mo usa the sonication broke the microalgae cell wall using a branson 450 digital sonifier branson ultrasonics danbury ct u s a with pulsed ultrasonic tip under 30 power and 20 khz for 5 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 general ospbr performance the baseline test showed the hffo2 unit had very low backward dap transfer specific rsf being around 0 03 mmol l 1 especially for po4 3 ions only 0 45 of nh4 n and 0 03 of po4 3 p table s2 in the dap ds were diffused to the feed side to support algal growth during the operation thus the use of dap ds will not cause any significant loss of key nutrients in the fertilizer however the lost nutrients to the feed side could affect the quality of the feed solution due to nutrient accumulation if no suitable mitigation is applied more details in the following the ospbr performance was examined through comparison with a control fdfo system that lacked algal growth theoretical accumulation of nutrients assuming in the absence of any uptake was estimated according to rsf from the baseline experiment and the initial nutrient concentration in the mimicked wastewater the expected total nh4 n includes both the expected nh4 n from feed and the contribution from rsf induced nh4 n the difference between the expected values on average 76 2 of the nh4 n in the feed solution was from the feeding secondary effluent and 23 8 was from rsf induced movement table s3 as shown in fig 2 a the accumulation of the rsf induced nh4 n increased with the operation time the nh4 n concentration in the ospbr was always lower than that in the control indicating that the presence of microalgae helped to control nh4 n through algal uptake during the first 100 h the nh4 n concentration was maintained at 12 3 2 5 mg l 1 in the ospbr much lower than the nh4 n concentration of 49 0 mg l 1 in the control however the nh4 n concentration in the ospbr increased dramatically after 110 h while that in the control continued to increase as well likely due to continued loading of nh4 n via rsf from the draw solution and input from the feed solution that exceeded the uptake capacity of the microalgae culture extending the hrt from 1 67 days to 3 33 days at 190 h stopped the increasing trend in both the ospbr and the control but the ospbr still maintained a much lower nh4 n concentration of 55 0 mg l 1 compared to 99 0 mg l 1 in the control it is interesting to note that the nh4 n concentration in the control was lower than the expected total nh4 n concentration suggesting the presence of other processes that potentially removed nh4 n several factors could contribute to this loss the dead volume inside the fo hollow fiber chamber was estimated to contribute 19 2 32 1 of total nh4 n loss for both the ospbr and control bacterial uptake of nitrogen could occur supported by cod reduction more details later but no nitrate nitrite was detected indicating the absence of nitrification in both systems it is also possible for an ammonium forming precipitate to occur with phosphate and minerals in a slightly alkaline solution fig s5 this is discussed further in the following section regarding phosphate loss the little difference between the expected total po4 3 p and the expected po4 3 p from the feed suggested that the reverse fluxed po4 3 p was minimal fig 2b as a result both the ospbr and the control would mostly deal with po4 3 p in the feed solution 93 1 from the feed as shown in table s3 and thus there was not an effect due to overload like that of nh4 n consequently the extended hrt did not affect system performance significantly in the ospbr the po4 3 p concentration decreased slowly to 4 1 1 0 mg l 1 while in the control it rose 6 fold higher to 28 4 0 7 mg l 1 like the nh4 n concentration the po4 3 p concentration in the control was also lower than the expected value 44 5 mg l 1 at 380 h this was likely due to microbial uptake and the formation of phosphate precipitates the final concentrated feed solution had an alkaline ph of 8 15 which could favor the precipitation involving phosphate calcium and or magnesium such as calcium hydroxyapatite ca5 po4 3 oh as described previously phuntsho et al 2014 both systems had a high initial cod concentration at 250 0 mg l 1 due to residual glucose in the pre growth medium table s1 the organic substrate in the ospbr was consumed quickly to reach a cod concentration 15 0 mg l 1 after 44 h likely because of mixotrophic metabolism of microalgae and bacteria perez garcia et al 2011 the control also experienced an obvious decrease in its cod concentration possibly by the growth of heterotrophic microbes both systems had greatly reduced the cod concentration to 22 3 6 3 mg l 1 ospbr and 98 9 5 9 mg l 1 control these were statistically lower two tailed t test p 0 05 than the expected final cod accumulation of 555 mg l 1 fig 2c the od680 results suggested a fast growth of microalgae in the first 100 h fig 2d which also resulted in fast cod consumption fig 2c during the same time period then a sharp drop occurred when nh4 n uptake inhibition started at hour 110 fig 2a the trace element supplement 1 ml l 1 pbr volume stanier et al 1971 at hour 165 and 280 recovered the microalgae growth but the nh4 n uptake rate was still low the stabilized microalgae concentration reached 0 82 g l 1 with the concentration having been increased by 2 36 fold this was similar to the concentration factor reported in some studies of fo dewatering microalgae buckwalter et al 2013 volpin et al 2019 microalgae aggregation that reduces light exposure is common in an ospbr praveen and loh 2019 but this was not observed in the present study possibly due to the low salinity in the ospbr the conductivity was 34 5 lower than that of control this was likely due to greater nutrient removal by microalgae that alleviated salinity buildup this lower conductivity was expected to result in a larger osmotic pressure difference in the ospbr for a higher water flux however the osbpr and the control showed similarly averaged water flux 0 63 0 07 lmh for the ospbr 0 60 0 08 lmh for the control p 0 05 fig s6 this result was likely related to biofouling of fo membrane module by algal cells that impeded water permeation in the ospbr because of the enclosed hollow fiber module some algal cells could have been trapped in the dead volume and lumen chamber inlet resulting in a significant decrease of algal concentration fig s7 and making the remaining algal biomass subject to collection from washouts backwash was effective to remove the accumulated biomass and restore the inlet pressure in the hollow fiber module fig s8 the problem of biomass clogging could be addressed in the future with submerged hollow fiber fo membranes 3 2 ions depletion and supplement effect the decreased algal growth in the presence of n and p fig 2d indicated that algal growth in the ospbr was limited by other elements the conductivity of the initial and final feed solutions had a concentration factor of 2 19 3 63 fold fig s9 much lower than the water volume reduction ratio 7 fold after each operation cycle this suggested that ions were lost during fo treatment likely via forward ion flux and or precipitation the analysis of other major ions including na k and ca2 showed that their concentrations descended continuously throughout the operation period in both systems fig 3 a na was the dominant cation and its concentration decreased from 215 6 mg l 1 to 49 1 1 6 mg l 1 in both systems k was another major monovalent cation and its concentration also decreased from 31 0 mg l 1 to 12 1 0 5 mg l 1 ospbr or 16 5 0 5 mg l 1 control according to the mass balance in eq 1 the membrane rejection for na and k was only 7 1 and 10 3 respectively 1 r 1 c d f v d f c f i v f i in eq 1 c f i c d f is the ion concentration in the initial feed and final draw solution respectively v f i v d f is the volume of initial feed and final draw solution respectively the large amount of forward na and k flux possibly resulted from the rsf of nh4 ions where charge imbalance drove cations with a small hydrated diameter to move along with forward water flux i e cation exchange occurred arena et al 2014 qiu et al 2020 this led to a noticeable amount of na 2 34 in the permeate a diluted fertilizer solution it is expected an fo membrane would have good rejection of ca2 and mg2 due to large diameters of hydrated ions achilli et al 2010 but the ca2 concentration decreased from 8 9 mg l 1 to a non detectable level after 210 h and the mg2 was reduced from 1 8 mg l 1 to below 0 5 mg l 1 in both systems this again implied that mg2 and ca2 precipitation might have occurred the fertilizer composition was still dominated by nh4 n and po4 3 p both of which made up more than 95 w w fig 3b other ions in the diluted fertilizer solution included cl 1 37 k 0 65 and both ca2 and mg2 were less than 0 004 the total volume of water extracted reached 227 l kg dap 1 higher than 168 l kg 1 in a previous study treating brackish groundwater phuntsho et al 2013 we have demonstrated that the addition of essential elements could help to recover microalgal growth and this was further studied with periodical supplementation every 96 h to increase ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations these are essential elements support cell membrane structure enzyme activities and photosynthetic constituents in algal cells esakkimuthu et al 2016 lv et al 2017 but they were at very low or non detectable levels in the ospbr with supplementation the ospbr maintained ca2 mg2 and so4 2 concentrations at 3 2 0 8 mg l 1 6 5 0 8 mg l 1 and 32 2 7 0 mg l 1 respectively fig s10 the ospbr with supplementation exhibited a lower nh4 n accumulation rate of 3 0 mg n l 1 d 1 compared to 4 7 mg n l 1 d 1 without supplementation fig 4 a after 440 h operation the nh4 n concentration in the ospbr with supplementation was 59 5 mg l 1 27 lower than that without because of the low po4 3 p level fig 2b phosphate was also included in the supplement to stimulate microalgae growth with the additional phosphate the ospbr had a relatively higher po4 3 p concentration of 5 7 1 3 mg l 1 than the one without 2 1 1 1 mg l 1 however both were able to keep po4 3 p concentrations level lower than the initial concentration of 11 6 1 0 mg l 1 this implied that the ospbr might have a potential for higher po4 3 p loading regardless of supplementation the cod concentration remained below 30 mg l 1 fig s11 the effect of essential elements supplement was demonstrated further by examining algal growth the difference in algal growth became more obvious after 150 h fig 4b due to essential element deficiency the microalgae growth rate in the ospbr without supplementation failed to compensate the biosolids discharge srt of 15 days and the final microalgae density dropped to od680 of 1 43 while the ospbr with supplementation increased in microalgal density by 58 7 with an od680 of 2 27 a higher ph 9 50 10 45 in the ospbr with supplementation than that of the ospbr without ph 7 69 8 87 also indicated a better photosynthetic activity axelsson 1988 which could promote the consumption of hco3 by the microalgae and the increase in culture ph thus the essential elements supplement proved beneficial and was adopted for the subsequent studies 3 3 optimal hydraulic capacity because of the concentration effect of the feed solution and high rsf of nh4 n the nh4 n built up in the ospbr fig 4a eventually leading to system failure this was addressed by extending the hrt to 3 33 or 6 67 d which was within the typical range of hrt for algal treatment of wastewater tang et al 2012 a longer hrt decreased nutrient concentrations as shown in fig 5 a the extended hrt to 3 33 or 6 67 d decreased the final nh4 n concentration to 2 5 or 2 0 mg l 1 while the continuous overloading of nh4 n at hrt 1 67 d resulted in an accumulation to 59 0 mg l 1 after 440 h like nh4 n the po4 3 p also showed a significant decrease in concentration to below 0 4 mg l 1 with the extended hrts in contrast to 9 1 1 7 mg l 1 at hrt 1 67 d fig 5b the extension of hrt did not affect the cod concentration significantly fig s12 because of sufficient cod removal capacity even at a low hrt of 1 67 d however it was observed that in the late phase of operation the long hrt of 6 67 d had a higher cod concentration p 0 05 indicating environmental stress details to follow for the microalgal culture and excreted saps that likely contributed to cod release also varying hrt did not significantly affect water flux 0 73 lmh p 0 05 fig s13 extending the hrt resulted in more biomass production in the ospbr although the values of od680 fluctuated at 2 18 0 07 2 40 0 06 and 2 33 0 08 for 1 67 d 3 33 d and 6 66 d respectively fig s14 the absolute amount of biomass harvested from the pbr increased from 0 09 0 003 g 1 67 d to 0 23 0 01 g 3 33 d and then to 0 56 0 02 g 6 67 d l 1 of treated wastewater the harvested biomass included microalgae and non algal biomass such as heterotrophic microbes od680 values were used to estimate the microalgae biomass at 0 085 0 003 g 1 67 d 0 188 0 004 g 3 33 d and 0 364 0 012 g 6 67 d l 1 of treated wastewater it was found that the portion of microalgae in the harvested biomass decreased from 91 5 1 67 d to 64 9 6 67 d fig 6 a this was possibly due to the endogenous decay of microalgae cells under low nutrient loading with a higher hrt this could have released intracellular carbon supporting heterotrophic bacterial growth as has been observed luo et al 2018 we further analyzed three extracts from microalgae lipids carbohydrates and protein fig 6b variation of hrt did not affect lipids content all around 14 but carbohydrates and protein differed among the three tested hrts an hrt of 3 33 d resulted in the most carbohydrates 51 3 0 1 storage in microalgal cells followed by 6 67 d 41 1 1 7 and 1 67 d 27 3 1 3 it was reported that suitable environmental stresses could be used to accumulate lipids and carbohydrates in microalgae cells chen et al 2017 the microalgae at hrt 3 33 d or 6 67 d were under more stress from heterotrophic competitors and limited nitrogen source the microalgae at hrt 1 67 d had a significantly higher protein content of 48 2 2 4 than other two groups probably due to the higher nh4 n level which may have stimulated protein synthesis microscopy imaging revealed that microalgal cells at hrt 1 67 d were visually larger in size than that of 3 33 d this was accompanied by a higher organic loading rate at hrt 1 67 d and is consistent with other observations chioccioli et al 2014 it was also observed that the microalgae culture at hrt 6 67 d was more dominated by scenedesmus which has been reported to have higher tolerance under harsh conditions such as living in 10 12 co2 air gases liu et al 2013 or nitrogen starvation conditions paches et al 2020 an hrt 3 33 d was used in the following study because of the high carbohydrate accumulation and a balance between treatment capacity and nutrient removal performance 3 4 optimal biomass harvesting frequency the frequency for harvesting microalgal biomass determines the srt and can affect both microalgae growth and treatment performance three srts of 9 41 d 17 82 d and 25 26 d were studied and are in the typical range for membrane photobioreactors honda et al 2012 as shown in fig 7 a the srt 9 41 d had relatively higher nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations than those at 17 82 d and 25 26 d before 280 h however this effect disappeared after a longer period of operation all three srts led to quick consumption and exhaustion of nh4 n in 24 48 h after each feed 96 h interval the po4 3 p concentration was also reduced gradually to 0 6 0 03 mg l 1 after 480 h fig 7a there was some residual no3 n from the bg11 medium and we noticed that no3 n was only reduced when nh4 n was consumed completely fig s15 suggesting that nh4 n was the preferred nitrogen source for the microalgae in this study by extending the srt it was expected microalgae would accumulate to higher biomass density in the pbr the steady state od680 increased from 1 71 0 05 9 41 d to 2 48 0 09 17 82 d and then to 3 07 0 17 25 26 d corresponding to a concentration factor of 2 03 2 93 and 3 63 fold respectively fig 7b there was no significant difference between the three srts in terms of the proportion of microalgae in the absolute dried biomass all at 80 85 the specific harvested microalgae reached 0 21 0 01 0 16 0 01 0 14 0 01 g l 1 of treated wastewater with a harvesting rate of 64 23 49 26 and 43 17 mg l 1 reactor volume d 1 for 9 41 d 17 82 d and 25 26 d respectively the dense microalgae suspension at srt 17 82 d and 25 26 d stimulated microalgal cells to generate more saps in the late phase of operation resulting in increases of cod to 53 7 and 65 3 mg l 1 for 17 82 d and 25 26 d much higher than 24 3 mg l 1 for 9 41 d fig 7b such accumulation of saps at a high srt could further inhibit the activity of microalgae zhuang et al 2016 and this might explain the lower harvesting rate at a longer srt the lipids carbohydrates and protein contents of microalgae at different srt also varied fig 7c and were mainly related to the different biomass densities srt 25 26 d had the highest carbohydrates content 41 7 2 8 p 0 05 and both srt 25 26 d 17 82 d stored more lipids than srt 9 41 d p 0 05 a stronger competition for nutrients under a higher cell densities at both srts may have driven microalgal cells to accumulate more energy storage compounds as has been observed chi et al 2016 there was no significant difference in terms of protein as the nutrient loading rates were similar when hrt was fixed at 3 33 d if lipids and carbohydrates were the desirable products an intermediate srt of 17 82 d would be a good option with yields of 9 07 g m 3 d 1 and 16 66 g m 3 d 1 respectively although srt 9 41 d had the highest microalgae harvesting rate the biomass suspension was less condensed than that at srt 17 82 d and this might increase the dewatering expenses for all srts ph remained around 11 fig s16 and the averaged water flux fig s17 showed no statistical difference p 0 05 4 conclusions this study demonstrated a fertilizer drawn ospbr system to extract water from a mimicked tertiary wastewater and employed microalgae to maintain a low nutrient accumulation level specific conclusions are as follows 1 compared with the control that lacked microalgae in the feed wastewater the ospbr effectively alleviated nh4 n accumulation 55 0 mg l 1 vs 99 0 mg l 1 in the control and continuously removed both po4 3 p 4 1 mg l 1 vs 28 4 mg l 1 in the control and cod 22 3 mg l 1 vs 98 9 mg l 1 in the control from the feed solution water flux was not significantly affected by the presence of microalgae 2 decline of conductivity and major cations concentration was due to forward ion exchange reduced na and k and chemical precipitation reduced mg2 and ca2 the growth of microalgae was negatively impacted by ion depletion periodic essential elements supplementation resulted in 58 7 higher microalgal density than the system without supplementation more than 95 of solutes in the final diammonium phosphate solution were nh4 n and po4 3 p 3 at an hrt 3 33 d the microalgae could overcome the nh4 n overloading and stabilize concentrations of nh4 n 2 0 mg l 1 po4 3 p 0 6 mg l 1 and cod 30 mg l 1 a longer hrt resulted in a higher specific amount of microalgae harvested but higher heterogeneity of the total biomass was observed the harvested biomass had the highest carbohydrate content 51 3 0 1 at hrt 3 33 d and the highest protein content 48 2 2 4 at hrt 1 67 d to balance between treatment performance capacity and microalgal biomass production hrt 3 33 d showed to be preferred 4 the srt had limited effects on nutrients removal an extended srt led to a higher concentration of microalgal biomass but a lower harvesting rate at srt 25 26 d a high biomass density with a concentration factor of 3 63 fold likely stimulated the excretion of soluble microalgal products and increased cod to 65 3 mg l 1 a long srt favored accumulation of lipids and carbohydrates in microalgal cells an intermediate srt of 17 82 d was suggested for lipid and carbohydrate yields of 9 07 g m 3 d 1 and 16 66 g m 3 d 1 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare

17838,understanding source elements of the ocean plastic crisis is key to effective pollution reduction management and policy the ubiquity of microplastic mp fibres in the oceans is considered to derive primarily from clothing fibres released in grey water microplastic fibres degraded from widely flushed personal care textile products wet wipes and sanitary towels have not been clearly identified in aquatic systems to date unregulated personal hygiene and sanitary product labelling fails to identify textile materials this study demonstrated that white mp fibres in sediments adjacent to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp are comparable with white fibres from sewage related waste and commercially available consumer sanitary products commercially available non flushable wipes are manufactured from either polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp or a combination of pet and cellulose fifty percent of brands labelled flushable that were tested were comprised of a mixture of pet and cellulose and the remainder of cellulose alone sanitary towels are made from pp pe or a combination of high density polyethylene hdpe and pp the accumulation of large quantities of washed up sewage related macro debris including wet wipes and sanitary towels intermingled with seaweed biomass adjacent to the wwtp was associated with a combined sewer overflow microplastic fibres extracted from this waste were similar to those extracted from intertidal sediments in close proximity to the wwtp over a ten month period in comparison fibres extracted from locations spatially removed from the wwtp were primarily comprised of abs pp and polystyrene the results confirm that wet wipes and sanitary towels flushed down toilets are an underestimated source of white mp fibres in the environment given the global distribution and projected growth of the non woven textile industry there is a need for increased public awareness of mp pollution in the marine environment from the inappropriate disposal of sanitary products down the toilet instead of diversion to alternative land based waste management graphical abstract image 1 keywords microplastic sewage non woven textiles

marine environments is key to developing effective pollution reduction policies domestic washing machines can release thousands of synthetic fibres per wash cycle napper and thompson 2016 and although some of this material is retained in the sludge during the wastewater treatment process a certain portion bypasses the treatment process carr et al 2016 this has been estimated to be as much as 160 000 000 mp particles per day as a result of the release of grey water into coastal water bodies horton et al 2017 leslie et al 2017 magni et al 2019 murphy et al 2016 this predominant reporting of

contributes to fragmentation ghorbani et al 2013 microplastics released in wastewater treatment plants wwtps are subject to sheer stress forces of turbulence pumping and mechanical mixing which increases fragmentation of mps enfrin et al 2020a microplastics may also impact on wwtp performance through the fouling of filtration membranes enfrin et al 2020b in addition mps may act as toxicological vectors adsorbing concentrations of contaminants commonly found in wwtps such as pharmaceuticals beckingham and ghosh 2017 seidensticker et al 2017 li et al 2018 through these mechanisms a wide range of mp particles are released from wwtps including nanoplastics which may be ingested via skin diffusion during embryogenesis of fish cells resulting in mortality of marine organisms

2016 in comparison with clothes fibres that are generally coloured or multi coloured fibres from sanitary products are white in colour to date the role of mp fibres in the marine environment emanating from these products as a significant component of wwtp effluent appears to remain unconsidered and unconstrained in most mp studies to date white fibres are likely underestimated because of the commonly used filtration procedure to capture mp particles as filters are commonly white making visual identification of microscopic white fibres against a white background difficult blumenröder et al

non woven synthetic fibre products and their ubiquity in wastewater the primary objective of this study was to assess the role of sewage related debris flushable non flushable and sanitary towels as a source of white mp fibres in the marine environment urban and rural the material composition of a variety of white fibres obtained from intertidal sediments and a recurring washed up deposit of true to form sanitary waste likely associated with a combined sewage overflow on a beach in close proximity to a wwtp were characterised the results were compared with a variety of consumer sanitary products in order to investigate their role as a source of white mp fibres in the marine environment 2 methodology 2 1 sample sites the study area covers three locations along the mid western irish seaboard on europe s north western atlantic facing margin fig 1 weak tidal currents predominate across the near coastal continental shelf along which the irish coastal current flows northward fernand et al 2006 the strong oceanic influence induces a temperate maritime climate with average annual precipitation values in excess of 1000 mm characterized by frequent moderate winter storms the region is marked by a strong overland and groundwater fluvial system and relatively high energy sand to coarse sediment blanketed coastlines exceptions occur at the heads of the many coastal embayments where finer grained sediment may accumulate in intertidal wedges dominated by sandy silt sized fractions galway bay a 50 km long by 34 km wide west facing embayment is partially enclosed and protected from strong shelf currents and large oceanic swells by the aran islands topographic barrier oceanic flows enter the bay via the south sound and circulate anti clockwise before exiting the bay through the north sound fig 1 a major source of freshwater input occurs at the northeast corner of the bay where the river corrib catchment size 3136 08 km2 enters at the port of galway city the corrib freshwater plume moves west along the cast of the tidal gyre except when strong south west winds may drive the plume to the shallower inner bay to the east nolan 1997 the main wwtp for galway city is located at mutton island fig 1 and fig s1 mutton island the primary sample site figs s1a and b 53 15 45 37 n 09 03 17 74 w is located just south of galway city within the headwater reaches of galway bay the sample site is located on an intertidal flat tidal range 4 5 m at the mainland end of a non breached access causeway 0 8 km from mutton island wwtp to the lee of prevailing winds and downstream of the corrib river outflow 0 6 km the area is dominated by extensive relatively fine grained sediment veneer generally 1 m overlying eroded undulating pleistocene glacigenic sediments this is a regionally important wastewater infrastructure with a population equivalent of 170 000 local population 80 000 annual overseas visitors in 2016 1 67 million one annual summer week long festival alone accounts for an additional influx of 145 000 visitors two other estuaries were chosen as control sites for this work bell harbour 16 km to the south south west and within galway bay and bellacragher 100 km to the north bell harbour co clare fig s1c 53 07 20 51 n 09 04 23 08 w is a sheltered tidal estuary tidal range 4 5 m on the south coast of galway bay inland and surrounding the site the karst limestone plateau of the burren area has a sparse rural population the local catchment feeding into the estuary covers 56 km2 with freshwater emerging into the centre of the estuary via a submarine outlet mccormack et al 2017 the sample site is located 5 km from the wastewater outlet at ballyvaughan and 9 km from the outlet at kinvara bellacragher fig s1d 53 57 56 75 n 09 49 40 55 w is located at the head of an enclosed tidal estuary range 3 5 m 100 km north of galway bay adjacent to ballycroy national park this control site represents a sparse rural population in surrounding areas far from urban influence where wastewater treatment in the region is exclusively by one off or small group septic tanks without connection to a sewage treatment network no direct riverine freshwater drainage adjacent to the sample site embayment is evident 2 2 microplastic sediment sampling polymethyl methacrylate perspex core tubes internal diameter 6 5 cm were used to extract 15 cm replicate intertidal sediment core samples from each site on four sampling occasions during the spring low tides of september 2017 december 2017 march 2018 and june 2018 prior to field sampling core tubes and tools were thoroughly rinsed under high pressure tap water further rinsed with distilled water and stored in clean paper bags immediately prior to sampling core tubes and tools were further rinsed with distilled water coring locations were spaced 2 3 m apart along the midline of the intertidal zone by selective random sampling crawford and quinn 2017 core tubes were manually forced into the sediments and then dug out during extraction to ensure minimal disturbance of the sample tubes were immediately capped and sealed at both ends and labelled samples were stored upright in darkness at room temperature prior to processing 2 3 particle size analysis psa the top 2 5 cm of sediment was removed from replicate samples using a clean stainless steel spoon placed in individual petri trays and immediately covered sediment wet weight was recorded and then following drying for 48 h at 70 c and for a further 24 h at 20 c the dry weight was recorded dry sieving of sediment samples was undertaken in a sieve stack of 2 mm 1 mm 500 μm and 250 μm sealed with parafilm above a 1 l glass beaker the sieve stack was shaken manually for 60 s each sediment size fraction was then placed in a labelled petri dish weighed and covered the 500 to 250 μm fractions were then placed in an additional sieve stack comprising 125 μm 100 μm 63 μm and 45 μm sieves and shaken for 60 s each sediment sample fraction was again weighed and covered as above 2 4 microplastic extraction the identification and extraction of mp particles and fibres from the upper 2 5 cm of the core was undertaken by visual examination on the 2 mm to 500 μm sediment fractions using an olympus s251 tokyo japan binocular microscope at up to 40 x magnification plastic detritus within sieve fractions 500 μm were identified but not included in this study due to the difficulty of accurate visual identification and handling hidalgo ruz et al 2012 petri dishes were placed above a black background to enhance visual differentiation of white particles microplastics were visually identified by a set of selection criteria no organic or cellular structures evident except where conjoined to probable mps fibres are consistent in diameter with no tapering or branching consistency of particle colour and texture fibres remain malleable in response to manipulation coloured potential mp fibres and particles were extracted manually using fine tweezers and adhered to double sided tape on glass slides white translucent fibres were transferred into an eppendorf tapered centrifuge tube to maintain visual clarity clusters frequently contained multitudes of individual fibres but were recorded as one mp find as quality control on validity all potential mps were checked once again by visual examination when biofouling hindered spectral analysis of the mp 2 ml of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was added to the samples inside an eppendorf and left overnight samples were washed with milli q water and left to dry prior to analysis 2 5 sampling of sewage related debris post sediment sampling autumn 2019 a large quantity of sewage related debris was washed up on the shoreline at the mouth of the river corrib in close proximity to the sediment sampling site at mutton island fig s1a this re occurring accumulation consisted of a range of largely intact wipes and sanitary towels and other personal care products mixed and entangled in seaweed biomass fig 2 a h samples of this material were collected for fibre extraction and polymer identification on two different occasions 2 6 commercially available sanitary consumer products commonly available flushable and non flushable wet wipes and sanitary towels n 17 both own brand and other brands were purchased from the most common national and international retailers on the high street in ireland for comparative purposes a plastic polymer material component was not listed on any product packaging and the wipes were marketed under an array of descriptions including 99 water purified water and biodegradable samples of the sanitary products were air dried and a quadrat of 2 2 cm was removed for microscopic and spectroscopic characterization and analysis 2 7 quality control all laboratory surfaces and equipment were thoroughly cleaned with ethanol laboratory trays and petri dishes were new from pre sealed bags and were carefully checked under a microscope before use for potential contaminants during particle size analysis psa sieving 2 200 ml jars of water were placed in the laboratory working area each day to capture airborne contaminants which were then filtered through whatman 0 45 μm hydrophilic nylon membrane filters during the mp extraction phase petri dishes were placed either side of the microscope each day to capture airborne contaminants filters and petri dishes were examined by binocular microscope for contaminants whenever possible clothing made of cotton material was used throughout the study but in either case base material and colour were registered for control purposes sediment loss due to airborne scatter during the psa process was 1 potential airborne contaminants captured during the sieving phase n 76 and total airborne contamination during the mp extraction phase n 7 were very low contaminants were considered negligible and well within the error of the quantification tables s1 s3 2 8 raman spectroscopy random samples of white fibrous field samples n 100 were analyzed for polymer identification by raman spectroscopy 28 7 n 86 of total mutton island white translucent fibres 31 8 n 7 from bell harbour white fibres and 30 4 n 7 from bellacragher white fibres commercially available sanitary textile products n 17 were analyzed analysis was undertaken by a raman spectrometer horiba labram ii horiba jobin yvon france equipped with a 600 groove mm 1 diffraction grating a confocal optical system a peltier cooled ccd detector and an olympus bx41 microscope kostrytsia et al 2018 the instrument was calibrated by zero order correction on a known band of 1 520 cm etched on a crystalline silicon wafer jonker et al 2015 analysis was mostly conducted with a 532 nm laser one highly reflective sample was identified using a 785 nm laser the measurements were performed with acquisition times of 4 30 s over a spectral range of 100 3500 cm 1 for identification purposes the obtained spectra for each sample were compared to a spectral reference library knowitall bio rad and an in house extension of the library with additional spectra from environmental mp collected from the intertidal zone and two clothing garments manufactured from polyester pes table 1 replicate spectra were recorded for each sample 2 9 scanning electron microscopy sem field samples and commercial textile samples were gold coated emitech sc500 quorum technologies ltd west sussex united kingdom and subjected to scanning electron microscopy sem in backscatter mode using a hitachi model s 2600n hitachinaka japan the analyses were performed at an acceleration voltage of 15 kv an emission current range ie of 68 106 μa and a working distance range of 6 8 11 mm morrison et al 2009 the images were acquired under variable pressure mode at 50 pa 3 results 3 1 wet wipe and sanitary towel polymer identification the most common polymer used in the manufacture of commercially available wet wipes was identified as non woven pet fibres table 1 five consumer wipe products were identified as pet and cellulose and two were identified as containing only pet however the main component of one wipe brand was identified as polypropylene pp table 1 out of the eleven commercially available wipe products four brands were labelled as flushable table 1 and two of these flushable wipes were observed as manufactured from a mix of pet and cellulose fig 3 the remaining seven wipes were marked as non flushable three comprised a mix of pet and cellulose one cellulose alone two pet alone and one pp alone table 1 six female hygiene products sanitary pads towels were primarily composed of non woven pp or hdpe pp fibres while one of these contained hdpe fibres at the outer edge of the pad one other brand of sanitary towel was identified as a polyethylene pe film table 1 sanitary towels and wet wipes collected as macro debris from the intertidal zone adjacent to mutton island wwtp were also identified as non woven pp and pet mp fibres respectively 3 2 mp occurrence in intertidal sediment samples intertidal surficial sediments at the mutton island mid tide line comprise a moderately sorted fine sand to silt becoming well sorted in december 2017 bell harbour sediments are very well sorted indicative of silt and clay gravel outliers evident in the summer season were largely absent in december 2017 and march 2018 bellacragher is predominately a poorly sorted course medium to fine sand becoming moderately sorted in december 2017 microplastics were recorded in all the sediment samples a total of 433 mps were recorded tables s1 s3 of which 78 occurred at mutton island 15 2 at bell harbour and 6 7 at bellacragher total mp accumulation kg 1 dry weight dw at mutton island remained reasonably

observed table 2 bell harbour displayed a similar mp loading over the first two sampling occasions with a decrease in june 2018 in contrast the highest mp loadings at bellacragher occurred in june

sediments sewage derived waste and commercially available sanitary products comparative images at 35x magnification of white translucent field samples and product fibres appear to show similar characteristics of texture shape and colour figs 4 and 5 white microfibres extracted from the sediment cores at the sampling site adjacent to mutton island wwtp identified as pet appear to share a very similar morphology to commercially available wipes manufactured from pet fig 4a e fig 4 highlights the similarity in microfibres from commercial baby wipes and microfibres collected from the same location at mutton island from sediment cores and washed up sewage derived waste both identified as pet fig 4e polyethylene terephthalate white microfibre field samples at a magnification of x5000 under the sem appear to display robust characteristics in response to marine environmental conditions appearing resistant to degradation and fragmentation fig 4d polypropylene microfibers in the sediments near the wwtp appear identical to pp fibres from a commercially available sanitary pad fig 5a d sem images of samples of mp fibres from the sewage derived waste at this location appear to display brittle characteristics like cracking and fragmenting in response to seawater exposure fig 5d the pp fibres from the sediments are also very similar to another commercially available female hygiene product fig 5f g 4 discussion the sample sites chosen for investigation in this study provide a representation of modern urban and rural european coastal environments it is well established that wwtp effluent contributes to the mp loading of nearby shoreline sediments browne et al 2011 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 microplastic abundancy and frequency at bellacragher was consistently low with no obvious point sources relatively high densities of abs fibres in june 2018 were likely an anomaly which resulted from the presence of abs piping and fittings in the vicinity of the sampling site acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is widely used in the manufacture of piping fittings due to its strength and resistance to abrasion and the fibres at bellacragher may be long form fragments of white plastic panelling which was cut for pontoon construction locally the presence of abs in this study is no surprise as it has been reported to be present in wwtps beach and lake sediments worldwide due to anthropogenic activities and dispersion to the marine environment through the sewage and freshwater systems hamid et al 2018 kang et al 2018 kazour et al 2019 bell harbour on the southern margins of galway bay which exceeded the loading at bellacragher was still deemed to have a relatively low mp loading compared with the main sampling site at mutton island the mutton island sampling site is in an urban setting adjacent to a wwtp and is in close proximity to the outflow of the corrib river which adds a freshwater derived flux to the sample area the variability in mp loading over the 10 month period of this study was likely due to local hydrodynamics deposition from currents and sediment turnover in response to seasonal climatic variability as well as proximate human activity the nearby intertidal zone is prone to the accumulation of high volumes of washed up sewage derived debris on a frequent basis excessive mp loading in december 2017 was likely induced by heavy precipitation episodes during a south westerly storm front elevated debris loading on this occasion may result from combined sewer overflows where excessive input of drainage water exceeds wwtp effluent capacity and is released untreated in the overflow combined sewer overflows from overloading have been reported from many other cities globally ellis 2006 gasperi et al 2008 kazour et al 2019 rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 scoullos et al 2020 weyrauch et al 2010 these overflows in turn can give rise to washed up sewage derived waste and debris on the surrounding coast krelling and turra 2019 mcs 2019 rangel buitrago et al 2020 it is estimated that the quantities of wet wipes washing up on the coastline in the uk increased by 94 since 2017 and 400 during the last decade mcs 2019 pantoja munoz et al 2018 the guardian 2015 blumenröder et al 2017 report high mp loadings in intertidal sediments 6500 mps per kg 1 dw adjacent to a wwtp in scotland stromness orkney islands the sampling regime as described in the orkney islands was comparable to the field sampling methodology in the current study i e intertidal sediments collected from relatively sheltered depositional coastal embayments 6083 mps per kg 1 dw are reported for mutton island which serves a population some 40 times that of stromness this may be a function of the experimental design as the current study extracted mps from the 2 mm 1 mm and 500 μm sieved fractions and therefore mps identified in our study are likely an underestimation as the greatest numbers of mps occur in finer grained sediments corcoran et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017 given the preponderance of white mp fibres in marine sediments adjacent to the mutton island wwtp it is reasonable to assume some of the fibres were derived from clothing items released from grey water discharges kang et al 2018 talvitie et al 2015 yang et al 2019 although many clothing items are manufactured from pet polyester no white mp fibres derived from polymers also associated with clothing materials such as acrylic fabrics and poly cotton blends were detected in the current study napper and thompson 2016 while it is considered that most modern wwtps effectively retain 95 99 of mp particles and that wastewater effluents account for the release of the remainder gies et al 2018 habib et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017 sewer overflows and the subsequent shoreline deposition of sanitary waste have not previously been thoroughly investigated as a source of white mp fibres in the marine environment the white mp fibre loading of sediments at mutton island was almost four times that of bell harbour and eighteen times that observed at bellacragher the samples of sanitary related macro debris wipes and sanitary towels collected from the intertidal zone near the wwtp following a heavy rainfall event were mostly comprised of pet with only a quarter of the samples analyzed presenting as a mix of pet and cellulose and over 80 of the wipes in the shoreline waste were identified as non flushable due to their polymer composition following the international water services flushability group and non woven textile industry guidelines inda edana 2018 iwsfg 2018 the flushable wipes market has increased significantly in value and is currently estimated to have reached 2 7 billion atasağun and bhat 2019 with the entire global personal care wipes market valued at 15 8 billion in 2018 grand view research 2019 consequently this rapid growth globally has resulted in an increase in the quantity of wipes found on the uk coastline a 400 increase in the last decade mcs 2016 mcs 2019 this is a phenomenon likely occurring globally in concurrence with combined sewage overflows sanitary towels contributed significantly to the washed up sewage related debris in the present study along with wipes and both may fragment into white mp fibres which potentially pose a hazard to marine organisms the analyses of commercially available flushable and non flushable wipes revealed that over 90 contained either cellulose a combination of pet and cellulose or pet alone in their matrix which was also reported in other studies investigating fibre composition of wipes durkan and karadagli 2019 pantoja munoz et al 2018 khan et al 2019 microscopic and spectroscopic analysis of flushable and non flushable wipes in this study revealed a similar structure construction and fibre composition it was microscopically possible to identify and separately analyse cellulose and mp fibres figs 3a and 5c cellulose fibres presented a more rough and ribbon like appearance than pet pe and pp which presented a more uniform and three dimensional shape although this is not always the case dyachenko et al 2017 lares et al 2018 norén 2007 the presence of white mp fibres in the wipes reinforces their strength and renders them more durable than wipes manufactured from cellulose alone mesugc 2019 in order for a wipe to be considered flushable there is a requirement that the product is manufactured from natural polymers plant based source i e cellulose cotton which degrade during the wastewater treatment process without affecting the system or downstream environment iwsfg 2018 wipes both flushable and non flushable comprising a mixture of cellulose and pet or those made from petrochemical derivative polymers i e pet pp hdpe alone are less susceptible to degradation but subject to fragmentation through defects residual stress and sheer stress forces of mechanical mixing in a wwtp enfrin et al 2020a ghorbani et al 2013 wet wipes and other macro debris cause operational problems in sewer system through the formation of long length fibres that lead to the formation of ropes fig 2c f these structures block the normal sewage pathway causing adverse effects to microbial communities and biological processes in the wastewater system atasağun and bhat 2019 durukan and karadagli 2019 scolz and sigmund 2012 manual manipulation of the wipes in the current study also highlighted that wipes manufactured from cellulose alone were more easily torn fragmented and disintegrated when submerged and agitated in water following the guidelines of the international water services flushability group iwsfg pas1 2018 by contrast wipes made of pet or pet cellulose combinations were more difficult to tear apart and less susceptible to disintegration when submerged and agitated in water rendering them unsuitable to be flushed down toilets inda edana 2018 iwsfg pas2 2018 khan et al 2019 cellulose degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is well documented demain et al 2005 leschine 1995 mcdonald et al 2012 smith 1994 song et al 2013 unlike pes and pet fibres which are not subject to bacterial breakdown in the environment and in wwtps zambrano et al 2020 although flushable wipes comprising cellulose fibres alone degrade in the wastewater system the current study has shown that more than 50 of wipes labelled as flushable contain pet and hence are non degradable and produce mp fibres that are available to aquatic organisms when released to the marine environment out of the 11 commercially available wipes analyzed 36 were distinctly labelled as flushable and included secondary instructions for disposal the remaining 64 of these products non flushable were clearly marketed as non flushable but disposal instructions were lacking while all non flushable wipe packages displayed the do not flush logo none adhered to industry guidelines for presentation on the packaging placement colour and size according to these guidelines there is a requirement to position the do not flush symbol on the front panel beside where individual wipes are removed from the package prior to use as opposed to the rear or obscured by packaging seals or folds in addition the logo should contrast with the background with a diameter of 4 6 the size of the packaging panel inda edana 2018 all the non flushable brands tested in this study failed to meet this criterion and only one flushable brand adhered to the correct labelling guidelines the presence of pet and pet cellulose wipes among sewage related waste washed up on the beach are indicative of the inappropriate disposal of non flushable wipes this would suggest that some consumers are unlikely to follow packaging disposal instructions and flush these products indiscriminately on the other hand the inappropriate disposal of flushable wipes may be more a function of incorrect labelling resulting in a lack of awareness by consumers two billion single use menstrual products are flushed down the toilet each year and tampons pads and applicators generate 200 000 tonnes of waste per annum in the uk alone wen 2020 furthermore manufacturers of female hygiene products fail to adequately reveal the precise composition of sanitary towels which are 90 plastic as part of the labelling wen 2020 although the market for reusable and biodegradable female products is growing disposable towels are still the most common product used due to convenience and costings their presence in wwtps and beaches should be of concern not only for protection of wastewater systems but also for environmental and public health hazards 5 conclusion the marine sediments adjacent to a wwtp have been shown to be consistently strewn with white mp fibres that were comparable with the white fibres from sewage related waste and commercially available consumer sanitary products wet wipes and sanitary towels nearly every mp fibre identified had a profile spectra shape and size similar to the white fibres present in the commercial wipes and sanitary towels analyzed although the wwtp process removes almost all mps and fibres the release of sewage related waste containing wipes and sanitary towels through combined sewage overflows impacts public health and the environment this demonstrates the downstream consequence of the misleading marketing of non woven textile products which in fibrous form may have been underestimated in studies to date the results of this study show that wet wipes and sanitary towels are a source of unaccounted white mp fibres in the marine environment not all flushable wipes are biodegradable and sanitary towels contain mp fibres there is a need for increased public awareness of mp pollution in

17838,understanding source elements of the ocean plastic crisis is key to effective pollution reduction management and policy the ubiquity of microplastic mp fibres in the oceans is considered to derive primarily from clothing fibres released in grey water microplastic fibres degraded from widely flushed personal care textile products wet wipes and sanitary towels have not been clearly identified in aquatic systems to date unregulated personal hygiene and sanitary product labelling fails to identify textile materials this study demonstrated that white mp fibres in sediments adjacent to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp are comparable with white fibres from sewage related waste and commercially available consumer sanitary products commercially available non flushable wipes are manufactured from either polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp or a combination of pet and cellulose fifty percent of brands labelled flushable that were tested were comprised of a mixture of pet and cellulose and the remainder of cellulose alone sanitary towels are made from pp pe or a combination of high density polyethylene hdpe and pp the accumulation of large quantities of washed up sewage related macro debris including wet wipes and sanitary towels intermingled with seaweed biomass adjacent to the wwtp was associated with a combined sewer overflow microplastic fibres extracted from this waste were similar to those extracted from intertidal sediments in close proximity to the wwtp over a ten month period in comparison fibres extracted from locations spatially removed from the wwtp were primarily comprised of abs pp and polystyrene the results confirm that wet wipes and sanitary towels flushed down toilets are an underestimated source of white mp fibres in the environment given the global distribution and projected growth of the non woven textile industry there is a need for increased public awareness of mp pollution in the marine environment from the

2016 in comparison with clothes fibres that are generally coloured or multi coloured fibres from sanitary products are white in colour to date the role of mp fibres in the marine environment emanating from these products as a significant component of wwtp effluent appears to remain unconsidered and unconstrained in most mp studies to date white fibres are likely underestimated because of the

source of white mp fibres in the marine environment urban and rural the material composition of a variety of white fibres obtained from intertidal sediments and a recurring washed up deposit of true to form sanitary waste likely associated with a combined sewage overflow on a beach in close proximity to a wwtp were characterised the results were compared with a variety of consumer sanitary products in order to investigate their role as a source of white mp fibres in the marine environment 2 methodology 2 1 sample sites the study area covers three locations along the mid western irish seaboard on europe s north western atlantic facing margin fig 1 weak tidal currents predominate across the near coastal continental shelf along which the irish coastal current flows northward fernand et al 2006 the strong oceanic influence induces a temperate maritime climate with average annual precipitation values in excess of 1000 mm characterized by frequent moderate winter storms the region is marked by a strong overland and groundwater fluvial system and relatively high energy sand to coarse sediment blanketed coastlines exceptions occur at the heads of the many coastal embayments where finer grained sediment may accumulate in intertidal wedges dominated by sandy silt sized fractions galway bay a 50 km long by 34 km wide west facing embayment is partially enclosed and protected from strong shelf currents and large oceanic swells by the aran islands topographic barrier oceanic flows enter the bay via the south sound and circulate anti clockwise before exiting the bay through the north sound fig 1 a major source of freshwater input occurs at the northeast corner of the bay where the river corrib catchment size 3136 08 km2 enters at the port of galway city the corrib freshwater plume moves west along the cast of the tidal gyre except when strong south west winds may drive the plume to the shallower inner bay to the east nolan 1997 the main wwtp for galway city is located at mutton island fig 1 and fig s1 mutton island the primary sample site figs s1a and b 53 15 45 37 n 09 03 17 74 w is located just south of galway city within the headwater reaches of galway bay the sample site is located on an intertidal flat tidal range 4 5 m at the mainland end of a non breached access causeway 0 8 km from mutton island wwtp to the lee of prevailing winds and downstream of the corrib river outflow 0 6 km the area is dominated by extensive relatively fine grained sediment veneer generally 1 m overlying eroded undulating pleistocene glacigenic sediments this is a regionally important wastewater infrastructure with a population equivalent of 170 000 local population 80 000 annual overseas visitors in 2016 1 67 million one annual summer week long festival alone accounts for an additional influx of 145 000 visitors two other estuaries were chosen as control sites for this work bell harbour 16 km to the south south west and within galway bay and bellacragher 100 km to the north bell harbour co clare fig s1c 53 07 20 51 n 09 04 23 08 w is a sheltered tidal estuary tidal range 4 5 m on the south coast of galway bay inland and surrounding the site the karst limestone plateau of the burren area has a sparse rural population the local catchment feeding into the estuary covers 56 km2 with freshwater emerging into the centre of the estuary via a submarine outlet mccormack et al 2017 the sample site is located 5 km from the wastewater outlet at ballyvaughan and 9 km from the outlet at kinvara bellacragher fig s1d 53 57 56 75 n 09 49 40 55 w is located at the head of an enclosed tidal estuary range 3 5 m 100 km north of galway bay adjacent to ballycroy national park this control site represents a sparse rural population in surrounding areas far from urban influence where wastewater treatment in the region is exclusively by one off or small group septic tanks without connection to a sewage treatment network no direct riverine freshwater drainage adjacent to the sample site embayment is evident 2 2 microplastic sediment sampling polymethyl methacrylate perspex core tubes internal diameter 6 5 cm were used to extract 15 cm replicate intertidal sediment core samples from each site on four sampling occasions during the spring low tides of september 2017 december 2017 march 2018 and june 2018 prior to field sampling core tubes and tools were thoroughly rinsed under high pressure tap water further rinsed with distilled water and stored in clean paper bags immediately prior to sampling core tubes and tools were further rinsed with distilled water coring locations were spaced 2 3 m apart along the midline of the intertidal zone by selective random sampling crawford and quinn 2017 core tubes were manually forced into the sediments and then dug out during extraction to ensure minimal disturbance of the sample tubes were immediately capped and sealed at both ends and labelled samples were stored upright in darkness at room temperature prior to processing 2 3 particle size analysis psa the top 2 5 cm of sediment was removed from replicate samples using a clean stainless steel spoon placed in individual petri trays and immediately covered sediment wet weight was recorded and then following drying for 48 h at 70 c and for a further 24 h at 20 c the dry weight was recorded dry sieving of sediment samples was undertaken in a sieve stack of 2 mm 1 mm 500 μm and 250 μm sealed with parafilm above a 1 l glass beaker the sieve stack was shaken manually for 60 s each sediment size fraction was then placed in a labelled petri dish weighed and covered the 500 to 250 μm fractions were then placed in an additional sieve stack comprising 125 μm 100 μm 63 μm and 45 μm sieves and shaken for 60 s each sediment sample fraction was again weighed and covered as above 2 4 microplastic extraction the identification and extraction of mp particles and fibres from the upper 2 5 cm of the core was undertaken by visual examination on the 2 mm to 500 μm sediment fractions using an olympus s251 tokyo japan binocular microscope at up to 40 x magnification plastic detritus within sieve fractions 500 μm were identified but not included in this study due to the difficulty of accurate visual identification and handling hidalgo ruz et al 2012 petri dishes were placed above a black background to enhance visual differentiation of white particles microplastics were visually identified by a set of selection criteria no organic or cellular structures evident except where conjoined to probable mps fibres are consistent in diameter with no tapering or branching consistency of particle colour and texture fibres remain malleable in response to manipulation coloured potential mp fibres and particles were extracted manually using fine tweezers and adhered to double sided tape on glass slides white translucent fibres were transferred into an eppendorf tapered centrifuge tube to maintain visual clarity clusters frequently contained multitudes of individual fibres but were recorded as one mp find as quality control on validity all potential mps were checked once again by visual examination when biofouling hindered spectral analysis of the mp 2 ml of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 was added to the samples inside an eppendorf and left overnight samples were washed with milli q water and left to dry prior to analysis 2 5 sampling of sewage related debris post sediment sampling autumn 2019 a large quantity of sewage related debris was washed up on the shoreline at the mouth of the river corrib in close proximity to the sediment sampling site at mutton island fig s1a this re occurring accumulation consisted of a range of largely intact wipes and sanitary towels and other personal care products mixed and entangled in seaweed biomass fig 2 a h samples of this material were collected for fibre extraction and polymer identification on two different occasions 2 6 commercially available sanitary consumer products commonly available flushable and non flushable wet wipes and sanitary towels n 17 both own brand and other brands were purchased from the most common national and international retailers on the high street in ireland for comparative purposes a plastic polymer material component was not listed on any product packaging and the wipes were marketed under an array of descriptions including 99 water purified water and biodegradable samples of the sanitary products were air dried and a quadrat of 2 2 cm was removed for microscopic and spectroscopic characterization and analysis 2 7 quality control all laboratory surfaces and equipment were thoroughly cleaned with ethanol laboratory trays and petri dishes were new from pre sealed bags and were carefully checked under a microscope before use for potential contaminants during particle size analysis psa sieving 2 200 ml jars of water were placed in the laboratory working area each day to capture airborne contaminants which were then filtered through whatman 0 45 μm hydrophilic nylon membrane filters during the mp extraction phase petri dishes were placed either side of the microscope each day to capture airborne contaminants filters and petri dishes were examined by binocular microscope for contaminants whenever possible clothing made of cotton material was used throughout the study but in either case base material and colour were registered for control purposes sediment loss due to airborne scatter during the psa process was 1 potential airborne contaminants captured during the sieving phase n 76 and total airborne contamination during the mp extraction phase n 7 were very low contaminants were considered negligible and well within the error of the quantification tables s1 s3 2 8 raman spectroscopy random samples of white fibrous field samples n 100 were analyzed for polymer identification by raman spectroscopy 28 7 n 86 of total mutton island white translucent fibres 31 8 n 7 from bell harbour white fibres and 30 4 n 7 from bellacragher white fibres commercially available sanitary textile products n 17 were analyzed analysis was undertaken by a raman spectrometer horiba labram ii horiba jobin yvon france equipped with a 600 groove mm 1 diffraction grating a confocal optical system a peltier cooled ccd detector and an olympus bx41 microscope kostrytsia et al 2018 the instrument was calibrated by zero order correction on a known band of 1 520 cm etched on a crystalline silicon wafer jonker et al 2015 analysis was mostly conducted with a 532 nm laser one highly reflective sample was identified using a 785 nm laser the measurements were performed with acquisition times of 4 30 s over a spectral range of 100 3500 cm 1 for identification purposes the obtained spectra for each sample were compared to a spectral reference library knowitall bio rad and an in house extension of the library with additional spectra from environmental mp collected from the intertidal zone and two clothing garments manufactured from polyester pes table 1 replicate spectra were recorded for each sample 2 9 scanning electron microscopy sem field samples and commercial textile samples were gold

analyses were performed at an acceleration voltage of 15 kv an emission current range ie of 68 106 μa and a working distance range of 6 8 11 mm morrison et al 2009 the images were acquired under variable pressure mode at 50 pa 3 results 3 1 wet wipe and sanitary towel polymer identification the most common polymer used in the manufacture of commercially available wet wipes was identified as non woven pet fibres table 1 five consumer wipe products were identified as pet and cellulose and two were identified as containing only pet however the main component of one wipe brand was identified as polypropylene pp table 1 out of the eleven commercially available wipe products four brands were labelled as flushable table 1 and two of these flushable wipes were observed as manufactured from a mix of pet and cellulose fig 3 the remaining seven wipes were marked as non flushable three comprised a mix of pet and cellulose one cellulose alone two pet alone and one pp alone table 1 six female hygiene products sanitary pads towels were primarily composed of non woven pp or hdpe pp fibres while one of these contained hdpe fibres at the outer edge of the pad one other brand of sanitary towel was identified as a polyethylene pe film table 1 sanitary towels and wet wipes collected as macro debris from the intertidal zone adjacent to mutton island wwtp were also identified as non woven pp

sediments sewage derived waste and commercially available sanitary products comparative images at 35x magnification of white translucent field samples and product fibres appear to show similar characteristics of texture shape and colour figs 4 and 5 white microfibres extracted from the sediment cores at the sampling site adjacent to mutton island wwtp identified as pet appear to share a very similar morphology to commercially available wipes manufactured from pet fig 4a e fig 4 highlights the similarity in microfibres from commercial baby wipes and microfibres collected from the same location at mutton island from sediment cores and washed up sewage derived waste both identified as pet fig 4e polyethylene terephthalate white microfibre field samples at a magnification of x5000 under the sem appear to display robust characteristics in response to marine environmental conditions appearing resistant to degradation and fragmentation fig 4d polypropylene microfibers in the sediments near the wwtp appear identical to pp fibres from a commercially available sanitary pad fig 5a d sem images of samples of mp fibres from the sewage derived waste at this location appear to display brittle characteristics like cracking and fragmenting in response to seawater exposure fig 5d the pp fibres from the sediments are also very similar to another commercially available female hygiene product fig 5f g 4 discussion the sample sites chosen for investigation in this study provide a representation of modern urban and rural european coastal environments it is well established that wwtp effluent contributes to the mp loading of nearby shoreline sediments browne et al 2011 estahbanati and fahrenfeld 2016 talvitie et al 2015 ziajahromi et al 2017 microplastic abundancy and frequency at bellacragher was consistently low with no obvious point sources relatively high densities of abs fibres in june 2018 were likely an anomaly which resulted from the presence of abs piping and fittings in the vicinity of the sampling site acrylonitrile butadiene styrene is widely used in the manufacture of piping fittings due to its strength and resistance to abrasion and the fibres at bellacragher may be long form fragments of white plastic panelling which was cut for pontoon construction locally the presence of abs in this study is no surprise as it has been reported to be present in wwtps beach and lake sediments worldwide due to anthropogenic activities and dispersion to the marine environment through the sewage and freshwater systems hamid et al 2018 kang et al 2018 kazour et al 2019 bell harbour on the southern margins of galway bay which exceeded the loading at bellacragher was still deemed to have a relatively low mp loading compared with the main sampling site at mutton island the mutton island sampling site is in an urban setting adjacent to a wwtp and is in close proximity to the outflow of the corrib river which adds a freshwater derived flux to the sample area the variability in mp loading over the 10 month period of this study was likely due to local hydrodynamics deposition from currents and sediment turnover in response to seasonal climatic variability as well as proximate human activity the nearby intertidal zone is prone to the accumulation of high volumes of washed up sewage derived debris on a frequent basis excessive mp loading in december 2017 was likely induced by heavy precipitation episodes during a south westerly storm front elevated debris loading on this occasion may result from combined sewer overflows where excessive input of drainage water exceeds wwtp effluent capacity and is released untreated in the overflow combined sewer overflows from overloading have been reported from many other cities globally ellis 2006 gasperi et al 2008 kazour et al 2019 rathnayake and faisal anwar 2019 scoullos et al 2020 weyrauch et al 2010 these overflows in turn can give rise to washed up sewage derived waste and debris on the surrounding coast krelling and turra 2019 mcs 2019 rangel buitrago et al 2020 it is estimated that the quantities of wet wipes washing up on the coastline in the uk increased by 94 since 2017 and 400 during the last decade mcs 2019 pantoja munoz et al 2018 the guardian 2015 blumenröder et al 2017 report high mp loadings in intertidal sediments 6500 mps per kg 1 dw adjacent to a wwtp in scotland stromness orkney islands the sampling regime as described in the orkney islands was comparable to the field sampling methodology in the current study i e intertidal sediments collected from relatively sheltered depositional coastal embayments 6083 mps per kg 1 dw are reported for mutton island which serves a population some 40 times that of stromness this may be a function of the experimental design as the current study extracted mps from the 2 mm 1 mm and 500 μm sieved fractions and therefore mps identified in our study are likely an underestimation as the greatest numbers of mps occur in finer grained sediments corcoran et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017 given the preponderance of white mp fibres in marine sediments adjacent to the mutton island wwtp it is reasonable to assume some of the fibres were derived from clothing items released from grey water discharges kang et al 2018 talvitie et al 2015 yang et al 2019 although many clothing items are manufactured from pet polyester no white mp fibres derived from polymers also associated with clothing materials such as acrylic fabrics and poly cotton blends were detected in the current study napper and thompson 2016 while it is considered that most modern wwtps effectively retain 95 99 of mp particles and that wastewater effluents account for the release of the remainder gies et al 2018 habib et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017 sewer overflows and the subsequent shoreline deposition of sanitary waste have not previously been thoroughly investigated as a source of white mp fibres in the marine environment the white mp fibre loading of sediments at mutton island was almost four times that of bell harbour and eighteen times that observed at bellacragher the samples of sanitary related macro debris wipes and sanitary towels collected from the intertidal zone near the wwtp following a heavy rainfall event were mostly comprised of pet with only a quarter of the samples analyzed presenting as a mix of pet and cellulose and over 80 of the wipes in the shoreline waste were identified as non flushable due to their polymer composition following the international water services flushability group and non woven textile industry guidelines inda edana 2018 iwsfg 2018 the flushable wipes market has increased significantly in value and is currently estimated to have reached 2 7 billion atasağun and bhat 2019 with the entire global personal care wipes market valued at 15 8 billion in 2018 grand view research 2019 consequently this rapid growth globally has resulted in an increase in the quantity of wipes found on the uk coastline a 400 increase in the last decade mcs 2016 mcs 2019 this is a phenomenon likely occurring globally in concurrence with combined sewage overflows sanitary towels contributed significantly to the washed up sewage related debris in the present study along with wipes and both may fragment into white mp fibres which potentially pose a hazard to marine organisms the analyses of commercially available flushable and non flushable wipes revealed that over 90 contained either cellulose a combination of pet and cellulose or pet alone in their matrix which was also reported in other studies investigating fibre composition of wipes durkan and karadagli 2019 pantoja munoz et al 2018 khan et al 2019 microscopic and spectroscopic analysis of flushable and non flushable wipes in this study revealed a similar structure construction and fibre composition it was microscopically possible to identify and separately analyse cellulose and mp fibres figs 3a and 5c cellulose fibres presented a more rough and ribbon like appearance than pet pe and pp which presented a more uniform and three dimensional shape although this is not always the case dyachenko et al 2017 lares et al 2018 norén 2007 the presence of white mp fibres in the wipes reinforces their strength and renders them more durable than wipes manufactured from cellulose alone mesugc 2019 in order for a wipe to be considered flushable there is a requirement that the product is manufactured from natural polymers plant based source i e cellulose cotton which degrade during the wastewater treatment process without affecting the system or downstream environment iwsfg 2018 wipes both flushable and non flushable comprising a mixture of cellulose and pet or those made from petrochemical derivative polymers i e pet pp hdpe alone are less susceptible to degradation but subject to fragmentation through defects residual stress and sheer stress forces of mechanical mixing in a wwtp enfrin et al 2020a ghorbani et al 2013 wet wipes and other macro debris cause operational problems in sewer system through the formation of long length fibres that lead to the formation of ropes fig 2c f these structures block the normal sewage pathway causing adverse effects to microbial communities and biological processes in the wastewater system atasağun and bhat 2019 durukan and karadagli 2019 scolz and sigmund 2012 manual manipulation of the wipes in the current study also highlighted that wipes manufactured from cellulose alone were more easily torn fragmented and disintegrated when submerged and agitated in water following the guidelines of the international water services flushability group iwsfg pas1 2018 by contrast wipes made of pet or pet cellulose combinations were more difficult to tear apart and less susceptible to disintegration when submerged and agitated in water rendering them unsuitable to be flushed down toilets inda edana 2018 iwsfg pas2 2018 khan et al 2019 cellulose degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is well documented demain et al 2005 leschine 1995 mcdonald et al 2012 smith 1994 song et al 2013 unlike pes and pet fibres which are not subject to bacterial breakdown in the environment and in wwtps zambrano et al 2020 although flushable wipes comprising cellulose fibres alone degrade in the wastewater system the current study has shown that more than 50 of wipes labelled as flushable contain pet and hence are non degradable and produce mp fibres that are available to aquatic organisms when released to the marine environment out of the 11 commercially available wipes analyzed 36 were distinctly labelled as flushable and included secondary instructions for disposal the remaining 64 of these products non flushable were clearly marketed as non flushable but disposal instructions were lacking while all non flushable wipe packages displayed the do not flush logo none adhered to industry guidelines for presentation on the packaging placement colour and size according to these guidelines there is a requirement to position the do not flush symbol on the front panel beside where individual wipes are removed from the package prior to use as opposed to the rear or obscured by packaging seals or folds in addition the logo should contrast with the background with a diameter of 4 6 the size of the packaging panel inda edana 2018 all the non flushable brands tested in this study failed to meet this criterion and only one flushable brand adhered to the correct labelling guidelines the presence of pet and pet cellulose wipes among sewage related waste washed up on the beach are indicative of the inappropriate disposal of non flushable wipes this would suggest that some consumers are unlikely to follow packaging disposal instructions and flush these products indiscriminately on the other hand the inappropriate disposal of flushable wipes may be more a function of incorrect labelling resulting in a lack of awareness by consumers two billion single use menstrual products are flushed down the toilet each year and tampons pads and applicators generate 200 000 tonnes of waste per annum in the uk alone wen 2020 furthermore manufacturers of female hygiene products fail to adequately reveal the precise composition of sanitary towels which are 90 plastic as part of the labelling wen 2020 although the market for reusable and biodegradable female products is growing disposable towels are still the most common product used due to convenience and costings their presence in wwtps and beaches should be of concern not only for protection of wastewater systems but also for environmental and public health hazards 5 conclusion the marine sediments adjacent to a wwtp have been shown to be consistently strewn with white mp fibres that were comparable with the white fibres from sewage related waste and commercially available consumer sanitary products wet wipes and sanitary towels nearly every mp fibre identified had a profile spectra shape and size similar to the white fibres present in the commercial wipes and sanitary towels analyzed although the wwtp process removes almost all mps and fibres the release of sewage related waste containing wipes and sanitary towels through combined sewage overflows impacts public health and the environment this demonstrates the downstream consequence of the misleading marketing of non woven textile products which in fibrous form may have been underestimated in studies to date the results of this study show that wet wipes and sanitary towels are a source of unaccounted white mp fibres in the marine environment not all flushable wipes are biodegradable and sanitary towels contain mp fibres there is a need for increased public awareness of mp pollution in the marine environment from the inapt disposal of sanitary products down the toilet instead of diversion to alternative land based waste management declaration of competing interest the authors

ll59 5ab uk school of ocean sciences bangor university menai bridge anglesey ll59 5ab uk waterborne enteric viruses are an emerging cause of disease outbreaks and represent a major threat to global public health enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay surveillance and source apportionment of enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management however individual monitoring of the 100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is unfeasible instead viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater contamination viral decay and transport in water an ideal indicator for tracking wastewater contamination should be i easy to detect and quantify ii source specific iii resistant to wastewater treatment processes and iv persistent in the aquatic environment with similar behaviour to viral pathogens here we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer reviewed publications to critically evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution including common enteric viruses mastadenoviruses polyomaviruses and aichi viruses the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and gut associated bacteriophages type ii iii frna phages and phages infecting human bacteroides species including crassphage our analysis suggests that overall human mastadenoviruses have the greatest potential to indicate contamination by domestic wastewater due to their easy detection culturability and high prevalence in wastewater and in the polluted environment aichi virus crassphage and pmmov are also widely detected in wastewater and in the environment and may be used as molecular markers for human derived contamination we conclude that viral indicators are suitable for the long term monitoring of viral contamination in freshwater and marine environments and that these should be implemented within monitoring programmes to provide a holistic assessment of microbiological water quality and wastewater based epidemiology improve current risk management strategies and protect global human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords gastroenteric viruses environmental sampling viral indicators sewage contamination risk assessment 1 introduction 1 1 waterborne enteric viruses waterborne diarrheal diseases account for approximately 4 billion cases annually resulting in 2 million deaths most of which occur in children under five who 2010 a significant proportion of these illnesses are caused by enteric viral infections ramani and kang 2009 enteric viruses are transmitted via the faecal oral route and the most important route of transmission is direct contact with infected individuals katayama and vinje 2017 nonetheless most enteric viruses are persistent in environments affected by domestic wastewater discharge and are often associated with waterborne outbreaks gibson 2014 kauppinen et al 2018 sekwadi et al 2018 wastewater often receives treatment prior to release into the environment although traditional wastewater treatment methods can be relatively ineffective at removing enteric viruses kitajima et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 sidhu et al 2017b in developing countries many areas lack adequate sanitary infrastructure and wastewater treatment facilities and hence faecal matter contaminates the environment and drinking water sources bain et al 2014 furthermore large volumes of untreated wastewater may also be discharged via combined sewer overflows csos during heavy rainfall events and via dry water overflows for example during snowmelt tidal infiltration or system failures and blockages ahmed et al 2020 these events enable the direct entry of enteric pathogens into the environment fong et al 2010 where people in direct or indirect contact with contaminated waters may be at risk of acquiring viral infections sinclair et al 2009 enteric viruses are readily transported in environmental waters and can adsorb to solid matter present in the water column or accumulate in sediment hassard et al 2016 subsequently they may also be taken up by filter feeding aquatic animals such as bivalve shellfish that are harvested for human consumption landry et al 1983 lowther et al 2012 furthermore wastewater is often used for irrigation in countries experiencing freshwater shortage and hence enteric viruses may directly contaminate fruit and salad vegetables and result in foodborne outbreaks bosch et al 2016 chatziprodromidou et al 2018 jasim et al 2016 enteric viruses usually cause gastroenteritis lasting for 2 5 days in some cases the infection results in respiratory neural or epidermal symptoms or remains asymptomatic table 1 the viruses most often associated with gastroenteritis are members of the picornaviridae caliciviridae reoviridae and adenoviridae families table 1 for example noroviruses family caliciviridae are responsible for a high proportion of gastroenteritis infections globally with 685 million cases and approximately 200 000 deaths cdc 2016 katayama and vinje 2017 resulting in a total direct cost of us 4 2 billion to the healthcare system and us 60 3 billion in associated societal costs per year bartsch et al 2016 rotaviruses family reoviridae and group f mastadenoviruses advs family adenoviridae are the main causative agents of gastroenteritis amongst infants and young children desselberger and gray 2009 jiang 2006 noroviruses hepatitis a virus family picornaviridae and advs are the most common viral pathogens associated with waterborne and water associated foodborne outbreaks and infection may result in serious illness e g acute hepatitis bellou et al 2013 harris et al 2006 jiang 2006 parshionikar et al 2003 sinclair et al 2009 rotaviruses enteroviruses sapoviruses astroviruses aichi virus aiv and hepatitis e virus are also often shown to be associated with wastewater contamination for example in maharashtra state india in 2017 a rotavirus b outbreak with a 22 8 attack rate i e new cases number of people was sourced from contaminated wells used for drinking water joshi et al 2019 in addition several viral gastroenteritis outbreaks linked to sewage contaminated drinking water containing adv noro sapo astro rota and enteroviruses have been reported kauppinen et al 2019 maunula et al 2009 rasanen et al 2010 the largest viral waterborne outbreak affecting approximately 80 000 people in kanpur india was associated with hepatitis e virus naik et al 1992 the surveillance of enteric viral illnesses can be challenging as many of the enteric viral outbreaks are unreported as the symptoms are often subclinical cortez et al 2017 koff 1992 li et al 2017 matson et al 1993 sakai et al 2001 zaoutis and klein 1998 over the last decade both newly discovered viruses and known viruses that had previously not been associated with wastewater have been found in environmental waters table 1 human polyomaviruses pyvs and papillomaviruses were first discovered in the 1970s and 1950s respectively however they have only recently been found in the faeces and urine of infected individuals knowles 2006 rachmadi et al 2016 some pyvs including bkpyv wupyv kipyv mcpyv and jcpyv have been detected at high concentrations up to 108 genome copies gc l in wastewater river and seawater and sediment in swimming pools and in tap water di bonito et al 2017 dias et al 2018a b farkas et al 2018a fratini et al 2014 hamza and hamza 2018 rachmadi et al 2016 as these viruses are commonly asymptomatic in healthy individuals the route of transmission is not yet clear however waterborne infections are likely fratini et al 2014 bocaviruses family parvoviridae causing respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis were first described in 2005 allander et al 2005 they have since been found in untreated and treated wastewater at concentrations of 103 105 genome copies gc l hamza et al 2017 iaconelli et al 2016 myrmel et al 2015 however their prevalence in environmental water has not been explored the torque teno virus family anelloviridae which causes gastroenteritis has also been found in wastewater and in polluted river waters similar to bocaviruses torque teno virus concentrations are considerably lower up to 106 gc l than the concentrations of other more common enteric viruses 104 109 gc l hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2008 human picobirnaviruses family picobirnaviridae have also been detected in wastewater concentration range 103 106 gc l and in contaminated rivers with variable prevalence adriaenssens et al 2018 hamza et al 2011 symonds et al 2009 in addition recent comparative genomics analysis has suggested that picobirnaviruses are bacteriophages likely associated with mammalian gut bacteria krishnamurthy and wang 2018 genomes or partial genomes of circoviruses family circoviridae and cardioviruses family picornaviridae along

enteric viruses are known to be common water pollutants melnick 1984 and with novel and emerging strains the number is increasing due to the diversity of human pathogenic viruses in the environment surrogates and indicators are often used to investigate the fate and transport of pathogenic strains in the environment an indicator may be suitable for a broad assessment of wastewater and drinking water treatment efficiency and for studying pathogen abundance persistence adsorption and transport in the aquatic environment furthermore quantitative monitoring of viral indicators can provide useful data for microbial source tracking transport modelling and risk assessment traditionally faecal indicator bacteria fib including coliform bacteria escherichia coli enterococcus and streptococcus spp have been used to determine levels of faecal contamination in water however it has been shown that bacteria are significantly less resistant to wastewater treatment and less persistent in the environment than enteric viruses fong et al 2005 kim et al 2009 lin and ganesh 2013 prez et al 2015 sidhu et al 2017a staley et al 2012 consequently fib are poor indicators of viral infection risk and this suggests that current water quality monitoring programmes based solely on fib are inadequate ideally a good viral indicator for wastewater contamination assessment should have similar inactivation and retention to the target pathogens and should be present in wastewater and in wastewater contaminated environments throughout the year that would enable continuous monitoring and inform on the level of contamination and the probability of pathogen presence furthermore an indicator with constant levels in wastewater may serve as a proxy for population size when wastewater based epidemiology is used to estimate the proportion of infected people during a viral outbreak or pandemic e g covid 19 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 additionally it should be source specific to distinguish between animal and human derived pollution scott et al 2002 some enteric viruses associated with wastewater as listed in table 1 have potential to be used as indicators however not all of those viruses fulfil these requirements influenza viruses coronaviruses circoviruses and papillomaviruses have been detected at high concentrations in wastewater but not in polluted environments which may be due to their rapid decay in water furthermore some enteric viruses e g astrovirus rotavirus torque teno virus and hepatitis e virus table 1 may be zoonotic hence their presence in the environment may be a result of e g agricultural activities instead of human waste hepatitis a and e viruses are abundant in less economically developed countries however they are only responsible for sporadic outbreaks in more developed regions bosch et al 2016 further enteroviruses noroviruses and sapoviruses show clear seasonality with peaks either in the summer enteroviruses or during the winter noroviruses and sapoviruses in temperate climates hence these viruses are not found in wastewater and in the contaminated environment at all times of the year farkas et al 2018a nino khetsuriani et al 2006 pons salort et al 2018 prevost et al 2015 human advs pyvs and aivs are frequently found in wastewater and in polluted environments without any distinct seasonality hence their utility as effective faecal indicators have been suggested kitajima and gerba 2015 rachmadi et al 2016 rames et al 2016 bacteriophages infecting bacteria associated with the human gut are also common in wastewater somatic coliphages phages infecting e coli and f specific rna bacteriophages frnap phages infecting bacteria through the f pili are commonly used to assess wastewater contamination however as not all strains exclusively associate with human bacteria they should be used with caution bacteriophages infecting bacteroides spp also have the potential to indicate wastewater contamination amongst these phages are a newly discovered group of viruses called crass like phages the type genome crassphage sensu stricto metagenome assembled genome belongs to the normal gut virome having co evolved with humans dutilh et al 2014 edwards et al 2019 since the discovery of the first crassphage genome more crass like sequences have been found and one phage has been isolated however their genomic diversity is large and the crassphage sensu stricto and the isolated crass like phage do not belong to the same genus shkoporov et al 2018 as the taxonomy of crass like phages remains to be established we refer to crassphage as a group of viruses with nucleotide similarity to the crassphage sensu stricto described by dutilh et al 2014 and quantified by stachler et al 2017 interestingly a plant virus the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov family virgaviridae has also been shown to be associated with human wastewater and found in polluted surface and groundwater and in drinking water symonds et al 2018 the primary source of pmmov in human excreta is through consumption of peppers capsicum spp and food products containing peppers that are contaminated with the virus zhang et al 2005 pmmov is suggested to be a useful indicator for wastewater contamination kitajima et al 2018b symonds et al 2018 however its shape and size 17 300 nm rod shaped capsid differs from other pathogenic viruses with icosahedral capsids and hence its fate and behaviour in the environment may be different in this review we evaluated the practicality of a set of human waste associated viruses as indicators for wastewater contamination of the aquatic environment table 2 we have extracted data from 127 individual studies to assess the usefulness of viral indicators by addressing specific aspects the data collected on viral concentrations in wastewater and environmental receiving waters are presented in tables s1 6 while the corresponding wastewater treatment log removal rates for each virus are presented in table s7 together we used this information to assess the ranges of virus abundance and distribution in global aquatic systems we included human wastewater associated viruses which are often present in wastewater at high concentration without seasonality we considered enteric viruses human advs pyvs and aivs pmmov and human gut bacteria associated bacteriophages including frnap infecting e coli specifically genogroups ii and iii and bacteriophages of human gut commensal bacteroides spp including crassphage for evaluation we used the following criteria 1 ease of detection and quantification 2 human waste association 3 presence in wastewater at high concentrations 4 resistance to wastewater treatment 5 persistence in the aquatic environment 6 global distribution and temporal stability 2 data collection we collected viral concentration data published in peer reviewed journal articles since 2005 tables s1 7 fig 1 articles were identified via google scholar in september 2018 october 2019 using the following keywords wastewater adenovirus wastewater polyomavirus wastewater aichi virus crassphage wastewater pepper mild mottle virus wastewater and f specific rna or f or frna or male specific and phage and genogroup and wastewater bacteroides bacteriophage the google scholar search included these terms or part of them in the whole text hence enabling the identification of studies on the aquatic environment where wastewater contamination was assessed using the target viruses the studies were screened based on the title and abstract and initially 243 papers were selected the assessment of enteric viruses pmmov and crassphage concentrations usually involved the concentration of large volumes of water 1 10 l and the efficiency of those procedures may therefore affect the outcomes hence studies where viral concentrations were not determined or sample process recovery efficiency and or quantitative pcr qpcr performance was not addressed were excluded from the study studies where sample process recovery was 10 were also excluded after the quality screen 127 peer reviewed research papers were included in the review table 2 viral concentration data were classified by water type untreated and treated wastewater surface freshwater groundwater and seawater and the detection rates i e positive samples all samples x 100 mean median concentrations and or minimum maximum concentrations were extracted fig 2 tables s1 s6 in most studies only the mean median and or minimum maximum concentrations were reported hence further meta analysis was not performed virus removal rates reported during wastewater treatment processes were also retrieved fig 3 table s7 additionally the primers and probes used for the qpcr detection and quantification of viruses have also been summarised table s8 3 evaluation of viral indicators 3 1 criterion 1 ease of detection and quantification for the accurate detection of low viral titres environmental samples are often concentrated prior to virus detection ultracentrifugation ultrafiltration adsorption elution and flocculation are often used for the concentration of water samples and their effectiveness and limitations have been reviewed previously barardi et al 2012 bofill mas and rusiñol 2020 cashdollar and wymer 2013 haramoto et al 2018 ikner et al 2012 the efficiency of viral recovery depends on the type of concentration method used the sample type and the virus type hence viruses that can be easily and reproducibly recovered using simple concentration methods should be used as indicator viruses many approaches are available for the detection and quantification of viruses in environmental samples including pcr and isothermal amplification of target genes microfluidics metagenomics biosensors microarrays and culturing based techniques as reviewed recently bonadonna et al 2019 farkas et al 2020 hamza and bibby 2019 many of the emerging approaches show great potential to detect low concentrations of viruses in difficult matrices dhar and lee 2018 farkas et al 2020 gyawali et al 2019b however to date they have not been implemented in the monitoring of viral contamination in the aquatic environment in most studies enteric viruses and proposed indicators were detected and quantified using real time quantitative pcr qpcr based approaches girones et al 2010 haramoto et al 2018 which are rapid easy and cheap methods enabling strain level detection for instance targeting different regions of the hexon capsid protein gene all human advs or only enteric advs adv genogroup f can be quantified tables s1 and s8 qpcr can be easily multiplexed enabling the simultaneous detection of 2 5 viral targets ahmed et al 2019a farkas et al 2017b jiang et al 2014 lee et al 2016 montazeri et al 2015 hence it is widely used for the analysis of the level and spread of viral contamination in the aquatic environment staggemeier et al 2017 more recently digital pcr approaches enabling absolute quantification without relying on standards have also been used for the estimation of viral counts in wastewater and in environmental waters ishii et al 2014 jumat et al 2017 kishida et al 2014 sedji et al 2018 these methods are also efficient sensitive and often provide more accurate results that qpcr ishii et al 2014 kishida et al 2014 the primers and probes repeatedly used in environmental studies for the detection and quantification of the potential indicator viruses with qpcr reverse transcription rt qpcr and dpcr are listed in table s8 in general hydrolysis probe based assays were predominantly used for viral detection the specificity and sensitivity of the primer and probe sets had been assessed empirically or in silico using a set of target and non target sequences and dilution series and shown to be adequate for the quantification of the target sequences barrios et al 2018 chehadeh and nampoory 2013 dumonceaux et al 2008 goh et al 2009 gröndahl et al 1999 heim et al 2003 hernroth et al 2002 jothikumar et al 2005 kitajima et al 2013 ko et al 2005 mcquaig et al 2009 ogorzaly and gantzer 2006 pal et al 2006 pang et al 2012 prevost et al 2015 rusiñol et al 2015 stachler et al 2017 van maarseveen et al 2010 wolf et al 2010 2008 xagoraraki et al 2007 the high detection rates fig 2 table 2 also suggest that the primer and probe sets were suitable for the sensitive detection of the target viruses nonetheless the specificity of the sets should be revised frequently in order to assure that novel strains are detected pcr based approaches however have some disadvantages qpcr and especially rt qpcr are often inhibited by organic substances e g polyphenolic compounds found in environmental samples ahmed et al 2015 farkas et al 2017a girones et al 2010 matheson et al 2014 therefore the use of dna viruses as indicators e g adv pyv crassphage for wastewater derived viral contamination may be more feasible than the use of rna viruses aiv pmmov frnap due to the more robust molecular detection of dna targets farkas et al 2017a hata et al 2011 a major disadvantage of all pcr based viral detection approaches is that they do not give any indication on the infectivity of the target and hence often overestimate viral concentration and human health risks knight et al 2013 detecting segments of indicator genes is helpful for the evaluation of the magnitude of faecal contamination and source tracking nonetheless an ideal indicator should be capable of being cultured in vitro to enable the direct assessment of viral infectivity and decay in wastewater and in the aquatic environment in the studies subject to this review enteric viruses crassphage and pmmov were predominantly detected and quantified using qpcr based assays however in a few studies plaque assay or integrated cell culture qpcr icc qpcr were used for adv detection table s1 the combination of cell culture and qpcr detection of viral replication enabled the detection of infectious viruses which grew slowly and or failed to produce cytopathic effects using this approach the time required for infectivity analysis has been reduced from one week to two days enabling rapid detection overall qpcr dpcr gave 1 5 log10 higher adv concentrations than plaque assay and icc qpcr due to the presence of damaged virus particles and free viral dna derived from degraded viruses in the environmental samples fongaro et al 2015 2013 hamza et al 2011 hewitt et al 2011 rigotto et al 2010 rodríguez et al 2013 sassoubre et al 2012 sedji et al 2018 the higher concentrations detected using icc qpcr compared to the traditional culturing assays suggest that using qpcr based quantification of cultured viruses is more sensitive and hence more reliable in environmental settings fongaro et al 2013 sedji et al 2018 pyvs and aiv are also culturable however the propagation process is time consuming 2 4 and 4 6 weeks respectively and often inconclusive reuter et al 2011 seehafer et al 1978 hence these approaches have not been adapted to environmental studies icc qpcr based approaches may be suitable for assessing the infectivity of these viruses in the environment however to date no icc qpcr assays have been developed for these targets the disadvantage of any culturing based assay for enteric virus detection is the need for specific equipment e g co2 incubator environment bsl2 or bsl3 and staff for the maintenance of specific cell lines which may not be available in routine monitoring laboratories frnap are easy to culture and readily form plaques on a lawn of the host bacterium which is usually the wg49 strain of salmonella typhimurium or escherichia coli hs pfamp r usepa 2001 higher volumes up to 100 ml of samples or concentrates are typically used for culture based assays than for qpcr a few microliters of nucleic acid extract and so culturing can be more sensitive than direct qpcr however this method will produce plaques of a range of different strains that cannot be differentiated based on morphology therefore to identify and quantify specific frnap genogroups it is necessary to use genogroup specific molecular detection methods such methods include rt pcr analysis of plaques haramoto et al 2015 2012 and 1 day icc rtqpcr hartard et al 2017 most probable number assays hata et al 2016 or in situ plaque membrane hybridisation techniques flannery et al 2013 many bacteroides associated phages are also culturable using appropriate hosts including bacteroides strains gb 124 ryc 2056 ga17 and araba 84 with double layer agar method to quantify the number of plaque forming units pfu however the assay is more challenging than the plaque assay for frnap as culturing bacteroides spp require anaerobic conditions which may not be available in most laboratories the recent isolation and in vitro maintenance of phage φcrass001 infecting bacteroides sp indicates that plaque assays for this type of phage may be used in future environmental studies shkoporov et al 2018 it is important to mention though that the crassphage qpcr assay table s7 does not detect φcrass001 as this phage is reported to belong to a different genus in order to estimate viral decay where no in vitro infectivity assay is routinely available e g hepatitis e virus noro and sapovirus capsid integrity assays can be performed based on the assumption that an intact virus particle is infectious capsid integrity can be assessed by the elimination of free viral nucleic acids using enzymatic treatment such as dnase rnase fongaro et al 2013 and intercalating dye pre treatment prevost et al 2016 or by capturing only the intact virus particles using immunomagnetic separation ims haramoto et al 2010 pcr based enumeration following integrity assays show lower viral concentrations than direct qpcr as the free viral nucleic acids are eliminated however as the intact virus particles may be damaged and hence non infectious these approaches may still overestimate viral counts fongaro et al 2013 walker et al 2019 nonetheless integrity assays are valuable tools for estimating the number of viral particles in environmental samples and their use may improve viral risk assessment 3 2 criterion 2 human waste association viruses such as adv pyv and aiv strains tables s1 s3 which specifically infect humans are logical choices for indicators for human faecal contamination using these viruses and their corresponding animal associated strains the source of contamination e g human vs wildlife livestock etc can be assessed for example staggemeier et al 2015 used sybr green qpcr for the detection and quantification of advs in water and sediment samples by distinguishing human bovine porcine canine and avian adv genome sequences based on their melting temperature human and porcine advs bovine pyv and porcine circovirus have also been used to assess the level of agriculture related and human sewage associated contamination in recreational groundwater and drinking water fongaro et al 2015 garcia et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2014 in the studies evaluated in this review the adv qpcr assays targeted all human adv groups a g the most common groups a f or specific groups c and f table s1 all of these groups are human specific demonstrating that waterborne infections of adv f predominantly type 41 are the most prevalent in wastewater and in the aquatic environment bofill mas et al 2010 chigor and okoh 2012 fong et al 2010 fumian et al 2013 haramoto et al 2007 hewitt et al 2011 iaconelli et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2018 lun et al 2019 myrmel et al 2015 ogorzaly et al 2015 shih et al 2017 the most common pyvs associated with wastewater are the jc and bk strains table s2 however mc pyv is also found in wastewater and in wastewater contaminated water di bonito et al 2014 rusiñol et al 2015 all known human aiv group a and b have been found in human wastewater table s3 these viruses are highly human specific and have not been found to associate with animal diseases the jc and bk strain have not been found in animal waste mcquaig et al 2009 whereas to date animal waste samples have not been tested for human aiv pmmov has been found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater raw and treated and in wastewater polluted environments and shown to correlate well with other human markers bacteriodes hf183 pyv kitajima et al 2018b symonds et al 2018 2016 implying it associates with human waste nonetheless the primary source of the virus are bell and chilli peppers with the suggestion that it should not be used as a faecal indicator nearby to commercial pepper plant production areas qpcr assays targeting pmmov show high sensitivity however the viruses were also detected in avian bovine and dog faeces at low concentrations gyawali et al 2019a hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 suggesting that animals may also access pepper as a food source furthermore it has been suggested that pmmov is more abundant in faeces and in wastewater where more pepper products are consumed symonds et al 2018 therefore the prevalence of pmmov should be further investigated coliphages are commonly used as indicators for faecal viral contamination in water mcminn et al 2017 frnap genogroups ii and iii frnap ii and frnap iii have been shown to be associated with human sources while genogroups i and iv frnap i and frnap iv are generally associated with non human sources lee et al 2011 stewart pullaro et al 2006 for this reason several studies have used methods described in section 3 1 to distinguish between frnap genogroups to determine faecal sources however while there does appear to be a general association between genogroups and faecal sources the bacterial host e coli expressing f pili is not source specific and there is often overlap between source types for each genogroup cole et al 2003 harwood et al 2013 bacteriophages infecting bacteroides common human gut bacteria have also shown potential as indicators for faecal contamination in the environment the most commonly used strains which are phages that infect bacteroides bg 124 bacbg124p ryc 2056 bacryc 2056p ga 17 bacga17p and araba 84 bacaraba84p were shown to be human specific however one study detected bacryc 2056p in wastewater samples derived from abattoirs suggesting animal association wicki et al 2015 qpcr based assays targeting crassphage have shown good human specificity while some cross reactivity has been shown with dog gull poultry pig and cattle faeces ahmed et al 2018a garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 the levels of crassphage found in these non human sources were several orders of magnitude lower than that of human sources the highest crassphage concentrations in animal sources were found by garcía aljaro et al 2017 which may be attributed to pooled samples and or the use of a different qpcr assay garcía aljaro et al 2017 also found that by normalising crassphage levels against a general faecal indicator e coli it was still possible to distinguish between human and non human sources nevertheless the cross reactions of the qpcr with animal excreta should be further investigated to assess human specificity 3 3 criterion 3 presence in wastewater at high concentrations advs pyv aiv human gut associated bacteriophages and pmmov are all frequently found in raw sewage and untreated wastewater at high concentrations fig 2 tables s1 6 the highest concentrations among the potential indicators were noted for crassphage with concentrations of 1010 1012 gc l in raw sewage detected in samples taken in japan crassphage concentrations were lower in wastewater samples taken in the us florida 109 1010 gc l ahmed et al 2018a and in the uk wales 105 108 gc l farkas et al 2019 crassphage is not currently well characterised and while the current primer and probe set do not align to any recently discovered relatives of crassphage it is possible that the qpcr based detection assay is not specific to a single strain advs were detected at 1011 gc l concentration in wastewater influent in pisa italy in 2009 2010 carducci and verani 2013 in other studies using the same primer and probe set hernroth et al 2002 the concentration of adv was lower between 103 and 109 gc l with the highest concentrations measured in other wastewater treatment plants in italy la rosa et al 2010 followed by peak concentrations of 108 gc l in rome italy muscillo et al 2008 barcelona spain bofill mas et al 2006 and in minas gerais and rio de janeiro brazil assis et al 2017 similar peak concentrations 108 gc l were observed when adv groups a g were targeted in germany hamza et al 2009a and in queensland australia sidhu et al 2017b the highest concentrations of advf 108 1010 gc l were observed in the us michigan simmons et al 2011 and in giza egypt elmahdy et al 2019 further verifying that this group of adv is highly prevalent pmmov are also present in wastewater at high concentrations up to 1010 gc l the highest pmmov concentrations were reported in florida and other states in the us rosario et al 2009 followed by germany 107 108 gc l hamza et al 2011 new zealand 107 gc l gyawali et al 2019a vietnam and the us arizona 106 107 gc l kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 slightly lower frnap concentrations were noted in wastewater with the frnap ii appears to be more prevalent 107 109 gc l than frnap iii 104 107 gc l fig 2 however more studies are needed to further investigate frnap ii iii concentrations in wastewater among pyvs jcv had the highest concentrations 107 108 gc l in wastewater collected in brazil and chile fumian et al 2010 levican et al 2019 however it was less prevalent 103 106 gc l in the us arizona spain and in the uk wales bofill mas et al 2006 farkas et al 2018a kitajima et al 2014 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 bkv and mcv are probably less abundant in wastewater than jcv with concentration ranges of 103 107 gc l and 104 105 gc l however limited surveillance has been done on these viruses in wastewater aiv has only been sought in untreated wastewater in the usa arizona vietnam and nepal haramoto and kitajima 2017 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 with concentrations between 104 and 106 gc l and shown to be less prevalent than the other indicators the detection rate and concentration of adv pyv aiv frnap ii crassphage and pmmov usually exceeded the concentration of noroviruses sapovirus enterovirus astrovirus rotavirus and hepatitis e virus farkas et al 2019 2018a farkas et al 2018 flannery et al 2013 fumian et al 2013 grøndahl rosado et al 2014a hata et al 2014 kitajima et al 2014 2013 masclaux et al 2013 prevost et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 simmons et al 2011 however in some cases norovirus and rotavirus showed higher concentrations than adv and pyv kaas et al 2018 prado et al 2019 the peak concentrations of cultured phages infecting bacteroides in untreated wastewater was 106 pfu l however this number cannot be directly compared with the concentration of other indicators due to the different methods used for detection the viral infectivity rate i e gc infective units of virus may be as high as 1000 1 as determined for adv hewitt et al 2011 however the actual infectivity rates for bacteroides associated phages is yet to be determined all potential indicator viruses showed high 90 detection rates in untreated wastewater except bacryc 2056p which was found only in 82 and 38 of the analysed samples advs and pyvs were frequently detected in wastewater from large and small wastewater treatment plants in the americas europe asia and australia fig 1 table 2 tables s1 and s2 prevalence and concentration information for aiv was only reported for untreated wastewater samples from large wastewater treatment plants in the usa arizona and vietnam kitajima et al 2018a 2014 2013 kuroda et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 the pmmov titre was assessed in wastewater samples derived from the usa germany new zealand and vietnam hamza et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2016 frnap ii prevalence in wastewater was only assessed in japan and ireland flannery et al 2013 haramoto et al 2015 2012 lee et al 2018 while frnap iii prevalence in wastewater was only assessed in japan haramoto et al 2015 2012 lee et al 2018 setiyawan et al 2014 2013 in wastewater the concentrations of phages associated with bacteroides bg 124 were assessed in the usa brazil the uk england and switzerland e dias et al 2018a mcminn et al 2014 prado et al 2018 purnell et al 2015 stefanakis et al 2019 wicki et al 2015 bacryc 2056p were investigated in colombia the uk spain france cyprus sweden switzerland and thailand costán longares et al 2008 gomila et al 2008 payan et al 2005 venegas et al 2015 wangkahad et al 2017 wicki et al 2015 2011 bacga17p were found in colombia and several european countries casanovas massana et al 2015 costán longares et al 2008 gomila et al 2008 mayer et al 2016 payan et al 2005 venegas et al 2015 wicki et al 2015 and bacaraba84p was identified in switzerland wicki et al 2015 2011 crassphage concentrations were only determined in wastewater in the uk wales australia and the usa florida ahmed et al 2019a 2018b farkas et al 2018a due to the limited number of studies table 2 further testing is necessary to evaluate the prevalence and distribution of aiv frnap ii frnap iii culturable phages infecting bacteroides crassphage and pmmov in untreated wastewater to assess their usefulness as indicators of wastewater pollution current data suggest that all assessed viral indicators are present in untreated wastewater at high concentration and hence they are potentially good indicators for wastewater contamination 3 4 criterion 4 resistance to wastewater treatment enteric viruses have been shown to be extremely resistant to traditional wastewater treatment procedures fig 3 table s7 as the removal efficiency varies amongst sites and the type of treatment process comparative studies have been performed to study the resistance of enteric viruses and potential indicators during wastewater treatment in this study 24 studies comparing the virus removal efficiency of different wastewater treatment processes were evaluated fig 3 fifteen of these studies exclusively used qpcr and rt qpcr for the quantitative analysis of viral concentrations as discussed in section 3 1 these molecular techniques give no indication on the infectivity state of the viruses and hence may overestimate infective viral titres in untreated and treated wastewater and other environmental samples this was demonstrated by flannery et al 2013 whose data showed that while infectious frnap ii in uv treated effluent was approximately 2 3 log10 less than influent only a 0 54 log10 reduction was found when using rt qpcr alone most of this reduction in frnap ii infectivity occurred during the secondary treatment stage 1 69 log10 reduction but the type of secondary treatment used in that study was not specified in a study by lee et al 2018 an activated sludge process a form of secondary treatment resulted in 2 1 and 3 1 log10 reductions of infectious frnap ii and frnap iii respectively rt qpcr analysis of the same samples showed log10 reductions of 1 6 and 2 5 for frnap ii and frnap iii respectively the differences between infectious virus and genome removal were not significant these studies therefore reached conflicting conclusions with the former showing that infectivity studies are vital and the latter showing that they are unnecessary it is possible that the activated sludge process used by lee et al 2018 resulted in physical removal of viruses while the process used by flannery et al 2013 inactivated the viruses without physically removing them from the treated water this highlights the importance of including the specific mechanisms used within a sewage treatment process when reporting such data as it is not clear whether the secondary treatment processes in the two studies shared any mechanistic similarities low removal rates have been reported for bacgb124p and bacga17p during wastewater treatment in most studies the removal of these phages was 2 log10 regardless of the treatment method used dias et al 2018a b mayer et al 2016 prado et al 2018 stefanakis et al 2019 except for one study showing 5 6 log10 removal of bacgb124p when disk filtration and chlorination was used as tertiary treatment prado et al 2018 data obtained from a wide range of qpcr based viral quantification studies have shown limited removal of adv pyv aiv crassphage and pmmov during wastewater treatment activated sludge treatment and biofiltration without further treatment resulted in 0 6 1 9 and 0 3 3 0 log10 removal of adv and pyv respectively fig 3 table s7 tertiary treatment processes resulted in an additional 1 3 5 log10 removal of adv and pyv with membrane bioreactors coupled with additional chlorination filtration and uv treatment being the most efficient method for viral removal qiu et al 2018 rusiñol et al 2015 simmons et al 2011 furthermore advs have been shown to be more resistant to uv treatment than poliovirus rotavirus caliciviruses and hepatitis a virus hijnen et al 2006 however laboratory scale studies suggest that advs are more susceptible to chlorine treatment than enteroviruses and caliciviruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 thurston enriquez et al 2005 2003 interestingly significant differences were found for the removal of pyv strains mcv was found to be the most resistant to treatment followed by jcv and bkv rusiñol et al 2015 fewer studies evaluated the removal of aiv crassphage and pmmov than the removal of advs pyvs and phages overall aiv showed 1 3 log10 reduction during secondary and 1 2 log reduction during tertiary wastewater treatment kitajima et al 2018a 2014 2013 schmitz et al 2016 the removal of crassphage was also in the range of 1 0 1 2 log10 during secondary wastewater treatment farkas et al 2019 however crassphage removal has not been assessed during tertiary treatment yet the current data suggests that pmmov is stable during secondary treatment and chlorination which results in 2 log reduction symonds et al 2018 larger pmmov removal 4 log was only observed using electrocoagulation and bardenpho aerobic anaerobic multi reactor technologies schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2015 further research is needed to evaluate the reduction of pmmov during uv treatment and other wastewater treatment procedures to evaluate its usefulness as an indicator the major advantage of crassphage and pmmov is that their concentrations are usually high in wastewater and hence the efficiency of their removal can be easily monitored nonetheless their infectivity and decay have not been investigated due to the current lack of in vitro culturing based methods in studies where the removal of indicator viruses was compared with the removal of common pathogenic enteric viruses indicator viruses showed similar or less removal than the pathogens carducci and verani 2013 farkas et al 2018a kitajima et al 2014 prado et al 2019 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 furthermore a meta analysis on the efficiency of secondary wastewater processes showed that activated sludge treatment resulted in 0 20 2 18 log10 reduction of rotavirus and norovirus gi and gii whereas biofiltration resulted in higher removal 1 52 4 30 log10 of norovirus gii and enteroviruses sano et al 2016 these removal rates are higher than the removal rates determined for the indicators reviewed here suggesting that the indicators can represent the removal of the most resistant viruses however three studies showed higher removal rates of bkv and jcv than norovirus sapovirus enterovirus and rotavirus farkas et al 2018a fumian et al 2013 schmitz et al 2016 suggesting that pyvs are less resistant than the pathogenic viruses and hence should be used with caution as an indicator current data shows that adv aiv frnapii iii crassphage and pmmov may be suitable for the assessment of wastewater treatment processes as different viruses have varying reactions to wastewater treatment processes the use of multiple indicators is recommended for indicators other than bacteriophages reviewed here the exclusive use of molecular detection and quantitation is a major limitation in understanding enteric virus removal hence combinations of infectivity studies and molecular assays should be performed for viruses that can be cultured in vitro in order to assess viral survival during wastewater treatment 3 5 criterion 5 persistence in the aquatic environment many of the studies that have been conducted to estimate viral persistence in natural waters have relied solely on qpcr based quantification while the reliance on qpcr data alone may lead to overestimations of infectious viral persistence its use is nonetheless important especially when considering unculturable enteric viruses when measuring persistence of viral indicators in the aquatic environment researchers should therefore be clear whether they are studying the persistence of a viral signal for example nucleic acids detected by qpcr or the infectivity of viruses for example by culture 3 5 1 indicators in surface freshwater most research has focused on the occurrence and survival of indicator viruses in surface water when quantified in surface freshwater bodies lakes rivers streams etc by qpcr these viral indicators e g aiv adv jcv pmmov are typically detected at up to 4 log10 higher concentrations than common enteric pathogenic viruses e g norovirus enterovirus and rotavirus hata et al 2014 jurzik et al 2010 rusiñol et al 2015 sassi et al 2018 all indicator concentrations in river water correlated with the distance of sampling point from the source of contamination wastewater treatment plant with significantly higher concentrations occurring near the wastewater treatment plant than further downstream or upstream ebdon et al 2007 farkas et al 2018a prevost et al 2015 rusiñol et al 2015 sassi et al 2018 sibanda and okoh 2012 tandukar et al 2018 venegas et al 2015 wangkahad et al 2017 comparative studies showed that pmmov occurred at higher concentration than adv aiv and pyv in surface water bodies in the usa arizona 103 106 gc l and colorado 104 105 gc l germany 104 105 gc l and vietnam 104 106 gc l betancourt et al 2014 hamza et al 2011 kuroda et al 2015 sassi et al 2018 the concentration of adv and aiv up to 104 gc l were similar in river water collected in the usa colorado and japan betancourt et al 2014 hata et al 2014 sassi et al 2018 whereas adv was more prevalent than pyv in river water samples collected in spain 76 vs 48 detection rates the uk wales 88 vs 65 japan 61 vs 11 and germany 79 vs 59 albinana gimenez et al 2009 farkas et al 2018a haramoto et al 2010 jurzik et al 2010 rusiñol et al 2015 however detection rates and concentrations of adv and jcv were similar in highly polluted rivers close to the wastewater discharge points near barcelona spain 100 103 104 gc l and rio de janeiro brazil 100 102 105 gc l calgua et al 2013 taken together our analysis shows that these indicator viruses are present in wastewater polluted surface freshwater at high concentrations which enables the accurate detection of the viruses and the comparative analysis of the rate of pollution crank et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 culturable bacteriophages were also present in surface freshwater fig 2 table 2 frnap ii were detected most frequently with concentrations up to 106 pfu l followed by frnap iii and phages infecting bacteroides up to 105 pfu l frnap ii concentrations correlated with adv concentrations in river water in france ogorzaly et al 2009 and with adv norovirus astrovirus and rotavirus in tropical freshwater samples in singapore vergara et al 2015 to date no comparative studies have been done to compare enteric viruses and phages infecting bacteroides spp in surface freshwater more research is essential on the prevalence of culturable human gut associated phages to assess their usefulness as indicators 3 5 2 indicators in seawater as for freshwater environments similar viral indicator trends have been observed in coastal waters where wastewater contamination is present pmmov was present at higher concentrations 102 105 gc l than pyv 102 gc l in coastal water at miami florida symonds et al 2016 and crassphage was also present at higher concentrations 103 105 gc l than adv 102 104 gc l and jcv 102 103 gc l in seawater collected at conwy wales farkas et al 2018a adv also had higher concentrations than pyv in seawater collected at rio de janeiro and santa caterina brazil 102 105 gc l vs 101 103 gc l florianopolis brazil 103 107 gc l vs 10 gc l north wales 102 104 gc l vs 102 103 gc l and catalonia spain 101 105 gc l vs 100 102 gc l dias et al 2018a b farkas et al 2018 moresco et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2015 crassphage pmmov and adv and pyv are usually present up to 4 log10 higher concentrations in seawater than hepatitis a virus norovirus and sapovirus dias et al 2018a b farkas et al 2018 fongaro et al 2015 moresco et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2015 symonds et al 2018 however one study found that the concentration of indicators and norovirus gii rotavirus and sapovirus were similar approx 104 gc l in seawater collected at the tahiti coast kaas et al 2018 bacgb124p bacryc 2056p and bacga17p were also found in seawater at concentrations up to 104 pfu l olalemi et al 2016 however these concentrations were not compared with enteric viruses to date frnap ii iii concentrations have not been measured in seawater samples based on the data reviewed here pmmov crassphage and adv are suitable markers for wastewater contamination in seawater 3 5 3 indicators in groundwater very few studies have evaluated the concentration of enteric viruses and viral indicators in groundwater adv jcv aiv pmmov bacgb124p and bacaraba84p were detected in polluted groundwater in the usa arizona and colorado and vietnam at very low concentrations albinana gimenez et al 2009 betancourt et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 hence the concentrations cannot be compared fig 2 table 2 future studies may include the efficient concentration of high volumes 100 l of groundwater to accurately determine viral concentrations and the associated risks 3 5 4 persistence of indicators in water understanding how long pathogenic and indicator viruses survive in the environment is crucial for accurate risk assessment and management the mechanisms and factors influencing viral decay such as virus type temperature microbial activity ph water type conductivity uv sunlight radiation and the presence of solid organic matter have been assessed jin and flury 2002 rzeżutka and cook 2004 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 many studies have shown that enteric viruses are more stable in the aquatic environment than traditional indicators such as coliform bacteria and coliphages el senousy et al 2014 fattal et al 1983 keswick et al 1982 muscillo et al 2008 ogorzaly et al 2010 wait and sobsey 2001 frnap are easily cultured and their persistence in surface waters has been studied in both surface freshwaters and seawater hata et al 2016 muniesa et al 2009 ravva and sarreal 2016 yang and griffiths 2013 in general frnap i has been found to be the most persistent followed by frnap ii frnap iii and then frnap iv using simulated sunlight flannery et al 2013 studied the effect of solar radiation on the persistence of frnap ii and norovirus in seawater the reductions in rt qpcr detectable viruses was similar for norovirus and frnap ii under both summer and winter sunlight conditions however it took between 81 and 88 longer for a 90 reduction in rt qpcr detectable frnap ii than for infectious frnap ii this highlights again the need to consider infectivity when studying viral persistence in the environment brion et al 2002 also studied the survival of different frnap genogroups in surface water environmental isolates of frnap ii had the highest variability in survival between isolates while frnap iii had the lowest variability in survival between isolates they concluded that frnap iii is suited to determining whether there had been recent contamination to a water body by human faeces in contrast frnap ii was more suited to indicating contamination by distant or sporadic human source contamination due to its easy molecular detection and relatively straightforward in vitro culturing the survival of adv has also been well studied advs have shown 1 2 log10 reduction in infectivity in raw and sterilised groundwater and surface water over 120 180 days ogorzaly et al 2010 rigotto et al 2011 in seawater the decrease of viral infectivity was more rapid than in groundwater with 1 2 1 4 log10 adv reductions in 28 days enriquez et al 1995 and sunlight significantly enhancing degradation at a rate of at least 2 log10 reduction per day liang et al 2017 advs were more stable in groundwater and surface water than poliovirus rotavirus and hepatitis a virus el senousy et al 2014 enriquez et al 1995 ogorzaly et al 2010 showed that adv persists for longer in ground water than both ms2 frnap i and ga phages frnap ii this difference in survival and persistence was greatly increased with an increase in temperature from 4 c to 20 c these studies highlight the stability of adv compared to other viruses however these studies were conducted in laboratory experiments and the viral stability may differ in field conditions pyv has also been shown to be as resistant to sunlight in seawater as adv ahmed et al 2019b liang et al 2017 however the monitoring experiments detailed in section 3 5 2 suggest that pyv degrades in water more rapidly than adv in contrast crassphage proved to be as persistent as adv and pyv in coastal bathing water ahmed et al 2019b the temporal decay of aiv pmmov and culturable bacteriophages infecting bacteroides is not yet known and should be investigated and compared with adv decay to determine their usefulness as indicators the comparison of the mechanisms of decay of pmmov and the other viral indicators would be especially interesting due to the differences in the structure of the virions tubular vs icosahedral 3 6 criterion 6 global distribution and temporal stability all potential indicator viruses reviewed here have been detected in environmental waters wastewater or stool samples of individuals in asia europe australia africa and the americas highlighting the global distribution of these viruses cinek et al 2018 fratini et al 2014 friedman et al 2009 guido et al 2016 jofre et al 2014 kitajima and gerba 2015 rames et al 2016 schaper et al 2002 symonds et al 2018 in the reviewed studies the indicator viruses were detected and quantified in 31 countries including 10 us states with the majority of studies conducted in the us brazil western europe japan and australia fig 1 table 2 while the available data suggest that these viruses are distributed globally very limited information on enteric and indicator virus quantities is available from developing countries e g india northern asia and most african countries table 2 to date none of these viruses have been studied in water from antarctica where they could point towards contamination of pristine areas by research scientists or long distance dispersal during long term monitoring surveys in the katsura river to the west of kyoto japan frnap ii was shown to have very limited seasonality with similar levels in the winter and summer months hata et al 2016 however in a tributary of the uji river to the south of kyoto frnap ii was detected only during winter frnap iii was also found to be more prevalent during winter at both sites a trend also observed in effluent from johkasou effluent by setiyawan et al 2013 culturable phages infecting bacteroides showed no seasonal changes in their concentration in river water in the uk ebdon et al 2007 and in wastewater collected in seven us states mcminn et al 2014 and in brazil prado et al 2018 in the studies reviewed crassphage adv and pyv showed no seasonal changes in concentrations in untreated and treated wastewater river and seawater samples carducci and verani 2013 farkas et al 2018a farkas et al 2018 fumian et al 2013 iaconelli et al 2017 masclaux et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 aiv and pmmov also showed stable titres in treated and untreated wastewater over a year iaconelli et al 2016 kitajima et al 2014 myrmel et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 however peak concentrations for aiv were noted in wastewater in japan during winter and spring kitajima et al 2013 pmmov showed no seasonality in river water either haramoto et al 2013 rosario et al 2009 higher adv concentrations were observed in treated wastewater collected in wales during summer than in winter and spring which was most likely due to dry weather and a transient increase in population due to tourism in the summer months farkas et al 2018 furthermore higher adv concentrations were detected in untreated wastewater in norway during january march compared to the concentrations observed during april december myrmel et al 2015 the prevalence of adv was also higher during autumn winter than during the spring summer in wastewater collected in egypt elmahdy et al 2019 similarly advs were detected at low concentrations during the summer and autumn months in river water samples collected in japan and in germany respectively hamza et al 2009b kishida et al 2012 probably due to dry weather conditions overall these findings suggest that the indicators are detectable and quantifiable throughout the year which enables the continuous evaluation of wastewater contamination the current data imply that precipitation has more effect on viral loads than temporal changes in the number of infections nonetheless this should be further investigated by comparing epidemiological data viral loads in wastewater and precipitation over several years in terms of fine scale temporal variability the effect of rainfall on virus concentrations in surface water is variable on one hand a decrease in virus concentrations in surface water has been reported due to dilution of the water body grøndahl rosado et al 2014b in contrast a number of studies have shown association between precipitation and elevated enteric viral concentrations in water ebdon et al 2007 wicki et al 2015 in regions with combined sewers much of this increase in contamination is likely due to the additional wastewater input via csos and storm water drainage csos discharge largely untreated screened partially settled or untreated wastewater into the environment this almost certainly results in higher numbers of enteric viruses being discharged into receiving waters than would otherwise be the case from fully treated sewage effluents fong et al 2010 hata et al 2014 furthermore relatively few csos have spill duration monitoring and almost none have microbiological or chemical monitoring requirements therefore in most cases the input of contamination can only be monitored via the surveillance of wastewater derived contaminants in water bodies 4 conclusions and future research the viruses reviewed here have all been shown to have potential to indicate wastewater derived pollution in the aquatic environment table 3 due to their wide distribution they may be implemented in water quality risk assessments worldwide the major advantage of enteric viral indicators adv pyv aiv is that they are human specific hence their use as indicators enables us to track human derived contamination exclusively in addition crassphages and other phages which infect commensal bacteria associated with human gut and pmmov which is a plant virus found in the human gut due to the consumption of infected plant derived food are also associated primarily with domestic wastewater contamination a major advantage of phages and pmmov is that they are not infectious to humans and hence their detection and culturing in the laboratory pose no risk of infection to the operators frnap ii and frnap iii have also been shown to be useful in determining human sources of viral contamination due to their prevalence in human waste however due to the non specific nature of their natural e coli hosts it is not certain what the reason is for the specific prevalence in human waste relative to frnap i and frnap iv as such it is unclear how well these can be applied globally and indeed how stable that relationship is the viruses reviewed here can be easily detected by qpcr based methods however no such assay has been developed yet for culturable phages infecting bacteroides spp when using molecular methods dna viruses adv pyv and crassphage may be easier and more affordable to monitor than rna viruses aiv pmmov frnap the infectivity of frnap can be easily studied using a simple and rapid plaque assay furthermore the infectivity state of adv can also be monitored using icc qpcr infectivity assays are also available for pyv aiv and crassphage however the usefulness of those assays in environmental setting have not been critically evaluated furthermore there are emerging technologies such as isothermal amplification biosensors and microfluidics approaches which may be useful for the routine monitoring of viruses in the environment farkas et al 2020 in some cases these may offer the potential for near real time reporting of viral concentrations in water however their applicability still needs to be critically evaluated from a scientific practical and economic perspective this is particularly the case for in situ devices where biofouling cross reactivity and sensor drift represent major problems when translating technologies developed in the laboratory to the field lin and li 2020 here the review of global studies suggests that advs aiv frnap ii frnap iii crassphage and pmmov are detected more frequently and at high concentrations in wastewater and within polluted water bodies than the other indicators reviewed pyvs are also present in wastewater at high concentrations however they are less prevalent in the environment than adv albinana gimenez et al 2009 bortagaray et al 2019 dias et al 2018a b haramoto et al 2010 moresco et al 2012 suggesting rapid degradation similarly while frnap ii and frnap iii are initially found at high concentrations in wastewater it is likely that they degrade more rapidly in the environment than adv the concentration of bacgb124p bacga17p and bacaraba84p was also high in wastewater and have been found in wastewater polluted environments however only a limited number of studies have been conducted to date on viral decay prompting the need for more research in this area based on their ease of detection high concentrations in wastewater and environmental persistence our review suggests that advs are the most useful viral indicators of wastewater contamination however aiv crassphage and pmmov also show potential more research is essential to evaluate the usefulness of these viruses and indicators future research should therefore focus on i careful monitoring of the association of crassphage and pmmov with non human contamination ii monitoring the concentration and persistence of aiv crassphage and pmmov in the aquatic environment especially in groundwater and in seawater the effect of extreme weather events on viral concentrations should also be investigated iii development of a simple and rapid standard operating procedure for concentrating and detecting viruses from water to facilitate the accurate detection of selected indicator virus es iv the development of multiplex qpcr assays to simultaneously detect a panel of the best markers potentially tailored to differences in geographical diversity particularly for pmmov v critical evaluation and application of new and emerging rapid approaches for viral surveillance vi survival and maintenance of infectivity monitoring of aiv crassphage and pmmov in wastewater and in the water environment for that the usefulness of infectivity assays for these viruses should be developed and evaluated vii undertake comprehensive field campaigns in areas where data is not available e g africa asia oceania to validate the use of viral indicators as an effective way to monitor wastewater pollution viii use these viral indicators to validate current mathematical models which predict viral dispersal and which are used for risk assessment purposes ix better establish the relationship between viral indicators and wastewater pollution to enable the development of legislative standards for viral contamination of waterbodies a greater understanding of the fate and behaviour of these viruses will allow them to be routinely implemented for water quality monitoring and for viral risk assessment with a standardised protocol for the detection and quantification of proposed indicators viral contamination can be efficiently addressed by regulators and hence the number of waterborne and foodborne viral diseases can be reduced ultimately enhancing global human

ll59 5ab uk school of ocean sciences bangor university menai bridge anglesey ll59 5ab uk waterborne enteric viruses are an emerging cause of disease outbreaks and represent a major threat to global public health enteric viruses may originate from human wastewater and can undergo rapid transport through aquatic environments with minimal decay surveillance and source apportionment of enteric viruses in environmental waters is therefore essential for accurate risk management however individual monitoring of the 100 enteric viral strains that have been identified as aquatic contaminants is unfeasible instead viral indicators are often used for quantitative assessments of wastewater contamination viral decay and transport in water an ideal indicator for tracking wastewater contamination should be i easy to detect and quantify ii source specific iii resistant to wastewater treatment processes and iv persistent in the aquatic environment with similar behaviour to viral pathogens here we conducted a comprehensive review of 127 peer reviewed publications to critically evaluate the effectiveness of several viral indicators of wastewater pollution including common enteric viruses mastadenoviruses polyomaviruses and aichi viruses the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and gut associated bacteriophages type ii iii frna phages and phages infecting human bacteroides species including crassphage our analysis suggests that overall human mastadenoviruses have the greatest potential to indicate contamination by domestic wastewater due to their easy detection culturability and high prevalence in wastewater and in the polluted environment aichi virus crassphage and pmmov are also widely detected in wastewater and in the environment and may be used as molecular markers for human derived contamination we conclude that viral indicators are suitable for the long term monitoring of viral contamination in freshwater and marine environments and that these should be implemented within monitoring programmes to provide a holistic assessment of microbiological water quality and wastewater based epidemiology improve current risk management strategies and protect global human health graphical abstract image 1 keywords gastroenteric viruses environmental sampling viral indicators sewage contamination risk assessment 1 introduction 1 1 waterborne enteric viruses waterborne diarrheal diseases account for approximately 4 billion cases annually resulting in 2 million deaths most of which occur in children under five who 2010 a significant proportion of these illnesses are caused by enteric viral infections ramani and kang 2009 enteric viruses are transmitted via the faecal oral route and the most important route of transmission is direct contact with infected individuals katayama and vinje 2017 nonetheless most enteric viruses are persistent in environments affected by domestic wastewater discharge and are often associated with waterborne outbreaks gibson 2014 kauppinen et al 2018 sekwadi et al 2018 wastewater often receives treatment prior to release into the environment although traditional wastewater treatment methods can be relatively ineffective at removing enteric viruses kitajima et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 sidhu et al 2017b in developing countries many areas lack adequate sanitary infrastructure and wastewater treatment facilities and hence faecal matter contaminates the environment and drinking water sources bain et al 2014 furthermore large volumes of untreated wastewater may also be discharged via combined sewer overflows csos during heavy rainfall events and via dry water overflows for example during snowmelt tidal infiltration or system failures and blockages ahmed et al 2020 these events enable the direct entry of enteric pathogens into the environment fong et al 2010 where people in direct or indirect contact with contaminated waters may be at risk of acquiring viral infections sinclair et al 2009 enteric viruses are readily transported in environmental waters and can adsorb to solid matter present in the water column or accumulate in sediment hassard et al 2016 subsequently they may also be taken up by filter feeding aquatic animals such as bivalve shellfish that are harvested for human consumption landry et al 1983 lowther et al 2012 furthermore wastewater is often used for irrigation in countries experiencing freshwater shortage and hence enteric viruses may directly contaminate fruit and salad vegetables and result in foodborne outbreaks bosch et al 2016 chatziprodromidou et al 2018 jasim et al 2016 enteric viruses usually cause gastroenteritis lasting for 2 5 days in some cases the infection results in respiratory neural or epidermal symptoms or remains asymptomatic table 1 the viruses most often associated with gastroenteritis are members of the picornaviridae caliciviridae reoviridae and adenoviridae families table 1 for example noroviruses family caliciviridae are responsible for a high proportion of gastroenteritis infections globally with 685 million cases and approximately 200 000 deaths cdc 2016 katayama and vinje 2017 resulting in a total direct cost of us 4 2 billion to the healthcare system and us 60 3 billion in associated societal costs per year bartsch et al 2016 rotaviruses family reoviridae and group f mastadenoviruses advs family adenoviridae are the main causative agents of gastroenteritis amongst infants and young children desselberger and gray 2009 jiang 2006 noroviruses hepatitis a virus family picornaviridae and advs are the most common viral pathogens associated with waterborne and water associated foodborne outbreaks and infection may result in serious illness e g acute hepatitis bellou et al 2013 harris et al 2006 jiang 2006 parshionikar et al 2003 sinclair et al 2009 rotaviruses enteroviruses sapoviruses astroviruses aichi virus aiv and hepatitis e virus are also often shown to be associated with wastewater contamination for example in maharashtra state india in 2017 a rotavirus b outbreak with a 22 8 attack rate i e new cases number of people was sourced from contaminated wells used for drinking water joshi et al 2019 in addition several viral gastroenteritis outbreaks linked to sewage contaminated drinking water containing adv noro sapo astro rota and enteroviruses have been reported kauppinen et al 2019 maunula et al 2009 rasanen et al 2010 the largest viral waterborne outbreak affecting approximately 80 000 people in kanpur india was associated with hepatitis e virus naik et al 1992 the surveillance of enteric viral illnesses can be challenging as many of the enteric viral outbreaks are unreported as the symptoms are often subclinical cortez et al 2017 koff 1992 li et al 2017 matson et al 1993 sakai et al 2001 zaoutis and klein 1998 over the last decade both newly discovered viruses and known viruses that had previously not been associated with wastewater have been found in environmental waters table 1 human polyomaviruses pyvs and papillomaviruses were first discovered in the 1970s and 1950s respectively however they have only recently been found in the faeces and urine of infected individuals knowles 2006 rachmadi et al 2016 some pyvs including bkpyv wupyv kipyv mcpyv and jcpyv have been detected at high concentrations up to 108 genome copies gc l in wastewater river and seawater and sediment in swimming pools and in tap water di bonito et al 2017 dias et al 2018a b farkas et al 2018a fratini et al 2014 hamza and hamza 2018 rachmadi et al 2016 as these viruses are commonly asymptomatic in healthy individuals the route of transmission is not yet clear however waterborne infections are likely fratini et al 2014 bocaviruses family parvoviridae causing respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis were first described in 2005 allander et al 2005 they have since been found in untreated and treated wastewater at concentrations of 103 105 genome copies gc l hamza et al 2017 iaconelli et al 2016 myrmel et al 2015 however their prevalence in environmental water has not been explored the torque teno virus family anelloviridae which causes gastroenteritis has also been found in wastewater and in polluted river waters similar to bocaviruses torque teno virus concentrations are considerably lower up to 106 gc l than the concentrations of other more common enteric viruses 104 109 gc l hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2008 human picobirnaviruses family picobirnaviridae have also been detected in wastewater concentration range 103 106 gc l and in contaminated rivers with variable prevalence adriaenssens et al 2018 hamza et al 2011 symonds et al 2009 in addition recent comparative genomics analysis has suggested that picobirnaviruses are bacteriophages likely associated with mammalian gut bacteria krishnamurthy and wang 2018 genomes or partial genomes of circoviruses family circoviridae and cardioviruses family picornaviridae along with enveloped viruses coronaviruses influenza virus have also been found in wastewater bibby and peccia 2013 blinkova et al 2009 ng et al 2012 enveloped viruses degrade in water rapidly gundy et al 2009 lebarbenchon et al 2011 hence human infections from waterborne corona and influenza viruses e g sars cov 2 are unlikely 1 2 viral indicators for wastewater contamination over 100 types of human enteric viruses are known to be common water pollutants melnick 1984 and with novel and emerging strains the number is increasing due to the diversity of human pathogenic viruses in the environment surrogates and indicators are often used to investigate the fate and transport of pathogenic strains in the environment an indicator may be suitable for a broad assessment of wastewater and drinking water treatment efficiency and for studying pathogen abundance persistence adsorption and transport in the aquatic environment furthermore quantitative monitoring of viral indicators can provide useful data for microbial source tracking transport modelling and risk assessment traditionally faecal indicator bacteria fib including coliform bacteria escherichia coli enterococcus and streptococcus spp have been used to determine levels of faecal contamination in water however it has been shown that bacteria are significantly less resistant to wastewater treatment and less persistent in the environment than enteric viruses fong et al 2005 kim et al 2009 lin and ganesh 2013 prez et al 2015 sidhu et al 2017a staley et al 2012 consequently fib are poor indicators of viral infection risk and this suggests that current water quality monitoring programmes based solely on fib are inadequate ideally a good viral indicator for wastewater contamination assessment should have similar inactivation and retention to the target pathogens and should be present in wastewater and in wastewater contaminated environments throughout the year that would enable continuous monitoring and inform on the level of contamination and the probability of pathogen presence furthermore an indicator with constant levels in wastewater may serve as a proxy for population size when wastewater based epidemiology is used to estimate the proportion of infected people during a viral outbreak or pandemic e g covid 19 xagoraraki and o brien 2020 additionally it should be source specific to distinguish between animal and human derived pollution scott et al 2002 some enteric viruses associated with wastewater as listed in table 1 have potential to be used as indicators however not all of those viruses fulfil these requirements influenza viruses coronaviruses circoviruses and papillomaviruses have been detected at high concentrations in wastewater but not in polluted environments which may be due to their rapid decay in water furthermore some enteric viruses e g astrovirus rotavirus torque teno virus and hepatitis e virus table 1 may be zoonotic hence their presence in the environment may be a result of e g agricultural activities instead of human waste hepatitis a and e viruses are abundant in less economically developed countries however they are only responsible for sporadic outbreaks in more developed regions bosch et al 2016 further enteroviruses noroviruses and sapoviruses show clear seasonality with peaks either in the summer enteroviruses or during the winter noroviruses and sapoviruses in temperate climates hence these viruses are not found in wastewater and in the contaminated environment at all times of the year farkas et al 2018a nino khetsuriani et al 2006 pons salort et al 2018 prevost et al 2015 human advs pyvs and aivs are frequently found in wastewater and in polluted environments without any distinct seasonality hence their utility as effective faecal indicators have been suggested kitajima and gerba 2015 rachmadi et al 2016 rames et al 2016 bacteriophages infecting bacteria associated with the human gut are also common in wastewater somatic coliphages phages infecting e coli and f specific rna bacteriophages frnap phages infecting bacteria through the f pili are commonly used to assess wastewater contamination however as not all strains exclusively associate with human bacteria they should be used with caution bacteriophages infecting bacteroides spp also have the potential to indicate wastewater contamination amongst these phages are a newly discovered group of viruses called crass like phages the type genome crassphage sensu stricto metagenome assembled genome belongs to the normal gut virome having co evolved with humans dutilh et al 2014 edwards et al 2019 since the discovery of the first crassphage genome more crass like sequences have been found and one phage has been isolated however their genomic diversity is large and the crassphage sensu stricto and the isolated crass like phage do not belong to the same genus shkoporov et al 2018 as the taxonomy of crass like phages remains to be established we refer to crassphage as a group of viruses with nucleotide similarity to the crassphage sensu stricto described by dutilh et al 2014 and quantified by stachler et al 2017 interestingly a plant virus the pepper mild mottle virus pmmov family virgaviridae has also been shown to be associated with human wastewater and found in polluted surface and groundwater and in drinking water symonds et al 2018 the primary source of pmmov in human excreta is through consumption of peppers capsicum spp and food products containing peppers that are contaminated with the virus zhang et al 2005 pmmov is suggested to be a useful indicator for wastewater contamination kitajima et al 2018b symonds et al 2018 however its shape and size 17 300 nm rod shaped capsid differs from other pathogenic viruses with icosahedral capsids and hence its fate and behaviour in the environment may be different in this review we evaluated the practicality of a set of human waste associated viruses as indicators for wastewater contamination of the aquatic environment table 2 we have extracted data from 127 individual studies to assess the usefulness of viral indicators by addressing specific aspects the data collected on viral concentrations in wastewater and environmental receiving waters are presented in tables s1 6 while the corresponding wastewater treatment log removal rates for each virus are presented in table s7 together we used this information to assess the ranges of virus abundance and distribution in global aquatic systems we included human wastewater associated viruses which are often present in wastewater at high concentration without seasonality we considered enteric viruses human advs pyvs and aivs pmmov and human gut bacteria associated bacteriophages including frnap infecting e coli specifically genogroups ii and iii and bacteriophages of human gut commensal bacteroides spp including crassphage for evaluation we used the following criteria 1 ease of detection and quantification 2 human waste association 3 presence in wastewater at high concentrations 4 resistance to wastewater treatment 5 persistence in the aquatic environment 6 global distribution and temporal stability 2 data collection we collected viral concentration data published in peer reviewed journal articles since 2005 tables s1 7 fig 1 articles were identified via google scholar in september 2018 october 2019 using the following keywords wastewater adenovirus wastewater polyomavirus wastewater aichi virus crassphage wastewater pepper mild mottle virus wastewater and f specific rna or f or frna or male specific and phage and genogroup and wastewater bacteroides bacteriophage the google scholar search included these terms or part of them in the whole text hence enabling the identification of studies on the aquatic environment where wastewater contamination was assessed using the target viruses the studies were screened based on the title and abstract and initially 243 papers were selected the assessment of enteric viruses pmmov and crassphage concentrations usually involved the concentration of large volumes of water 1 10 l and the efficiency of those procedures may therefore affect the outcomes hence studies where viral concentrations were not determined or sample process recovery efficiency and or quantitative pcr qpcr performance was not addressed were excluded from the study studies where sample process recovery was 10 were also excluded after the quality screen 127 peer reviewed research papers were included in the review table 2 viral concentration data were classified by water type untreated and treated wastewater surface freshwater groundwater and seawater and the detection rates i e positive samples all samples x 100 mean median concentrations and or minimum maximum concentrations were extracted fig 2 tables s1 s6 in most studies only the mean median and or minimum maximum concentrations were reported hence further meta analysis was not performed virus removal rates reported during wastewater treatment processes were also retrieved fig 3 table s7 additionally the primers and probes used for the qpcr detection and quantification of viruses have also been summarised table s8 3 evaluation of viral indicators 3 1 criterion 1 ease of detection and quantification for the accurate detection of low viral titres environmental samples are often concentrated prior to virus detection ultracentrifugation ultrafiltration adsorption elution and flocculation are often used for the concentration of water samples and their effectiveness and limitations have been reviewed previously barardi et al 2012 bofill mas and rusiñol 2020 cashdollar and wymer 2013 haramoto et al 2018 ikner et al 2012 the efficiency of viral recovery depends on the type of concentration method used the sample type and the virus type hence viruses that can be easily and reproducibly recovered using simple concentration methods should be used as indicator viruses many approaches are available for the detection and quantification of viruses in environmental samples including pcr and isothermal amplification of target genes microfluidics metagenomics biosensors microarrays and culturing based techniques as reviewed recently bonadonna et al 2019 farkas et al 2020 hamza and bibby 2019 many of the emerging approaches show great potential to detect low concentrations of viruses in difficult matrices dhar and lee 2018 farkas et al 2020 gyawali et al 2019b however to date they have not been implemented in the monitoring of viral contamination in the aquatic environment in most studies enteric viruses and proposed indicators were detected and quantified using real time quantitative pcr qpcr based approaches girones et al 2010 haramoto et al 2018 which are rapid easy and cheap methods enabling strain level detection for instance targeting different regions of the hexon capsid protein gene all human advs or only enteric advs adv genogroup f can be quantified tables s1 and s8 qpcr can be easily multiplexed enabling the simultaneous detection of 2 5 viral targets ahmed et al 2019a farkas et al 2017b jiang et al 2014 lee et al 2016 montazeri et al 2015 hence it is widely used for the analysis of the level and spread of viral contamination in the aquatic environment staggemeier et al 2017 more recently digital pcr approaches enabling absolute quantification without relying on standards have also been used for the estimation of viral counts in wastewater and in environmental waters ishii et al 2014 jumat et al 2017 kishida et al 2014 sedji et al 2018 these methods are also efficient sensitive and often provide more accurate results that qpcr ishii et al 2014 kishida et al 2014 the primers and probes repeatedly used in environmental studies for the detection and quantification of the potential indicator viruses with qpcr reverse transcription rt qpcr and dpcr are listed in table s8 in general hydrolysis probe based assays were predominantly used for viral detection the specificity and sensitivity of the primer and probe sets had been assessed empirically or in silico using a set of target and non target sequences and dilution series and shown to be adequate for the quantification of the target sequences barrios et al 2018 chehadeh and nampoory 2013 dumonceaux et al 2008 goh et al 2009 gröndahl et al 1999 heim et al 2003 hernroth et al 2002 jothikumar et al 2005 kitajima et al 2013 ko et al 2005 mcquaig et al 2009 ogorzaly and gantzer 2006 pal et al 2006 pang et al 2012 prevost et al 2015 rusiñol et al 2015 stachler et al 2017 van maarseveen et al 2010 wolf et al 2010 2008 xagoraraki et al 2007 the high detection rates fig 2 table 2 also suggest that the primer and probe sets were suitable for the sensitive detection of the target viruses nonetheless the specificity of the sets should be revised frequently in order to assure that novel strains are detected pcr based approaches however have some disadvantages qpcr and especially rt qpcr are often inhibited by organic substances e g polyphenolic compounds found in environmental samples ahmed et al 2015 farkas et al 2017a girones et al 2010 matheson et al 2014 therefore the use of dna viruses as indicators e g adv pyv crassphage for wastewater derived viral contamination may be more feasible than the use of rna viruses aiv pmmov frnap due to the more robust molecular detection of dna targets farkas et al 2017a hata et al 2011 a major disadvantage of all pcr based viral detection approaches is that they do not give any indication on the infectivity of the target and hence often overestimate viral concentration and human health risks knight et al 2013 detecting segments of indicator genes is helpful for the evaluation of the magnitude of faecal contamination and source tracking nonetheless an ideal indicator should be capable of being cultured in vitro to enable the direct assessment of viral infectivity and decay in wastewater and in the aquatic environment in the studies subject to this review enteric viruses crassphage and pmmov were predominantly detected and quantified using qpcr based assays however in a few studies plaque assay or integrated cell culture qpcr icc qpcr were used for adv detection table s1 the combination of cell culture and qpcr detection of viral replication enabled the detection of infectious viruses which grew slowly and or failed to produce cytopathic effects using this approach the time required for infectivity analysis has been reduced from one week to two days enabling rapid detection overall qpcr dpcr gave 1 5 log10 higher adv concentrations than plaque assay and icc qpcr due to the presence of damaged virus particles and free viral dna derived from degraded viruses in the environmental samples fongaro et al 2015 2013 hamza et al 2011 hewitt et al 2011 rigotto et al 2010 rodríguez et al 2013 sassoubre et al 2012 sedji et al 2018 the higher concentrations detected using icc qpcr compared to the traditional culturing assays suggest that using qpcr based quantification of cultured viruses is more sensitive and hence more reliable in environmental settings fongaro et al 2013 sedji et al 2018 pyvs and aiv are also culturable however the propagation process is time consuming 2 4 and 4 6 weeks respectively and often inconclusive reuter et al 2011 seehafer et al 1978 hence these approaches have not been adapted to environmental studies icc qpcr based approaches may be suitable for assessing the infectivity of these viruses in the environment however to date no icc qpcr assays have been developed for these targets the disadvantage of any culturing based assay for enteric virus detection is the need for specific equipment e g co2 incubator environment bsl2 or bsl3 and staff for the maintenance of specific cell lines which may not be available in routine monitoring laboratories frnap are easy to culture and readily form plaques on a lawn of the host bacterium which is usually the wg49 strain of salmonella typhimurium or escherichia coli hs pfamp r usepa 2001 higher volumes up to 100 ml of samples or concentrates are typically used for culture based assays than for qpcr a few microliters of nucleic acid extract and so culturing can be more sensitive than direct qpcr however this method will produce plaques of a range of different strains that cannot be differentiated based on morphology therefore to identify and quantify specific frnap genogroups it is necessary to use genogroup specific molecular detection methods such methods include rt pcr analysis of plaques haramoto et al 2015 2012 and 1 day icc rtqpcr hartard et al 2017 most probable number assays hata et al 2016 or in situ plaque membrane hybridisation techniques flannery et al 2013 many bacteroides associated phages are also culturable using appropriate hosts including bacteroides strains gb 124 ryc 2056 ga17 and araba 84 with double layer agar method to quantify the number of plaque forming units pfu however the assay is more challenging than the plaque assay for frnap as culturing bacteroides spp require anaerobic conditions which may not be available in most laboratories the recent isolation and in vitro maintenance of phage φcrass001 infecting bacteroides sp indicates that plaque assays for this type of phage may be used in future environmental studies shkoporov et al 2018 it is important to mention though that the crassphage qpcr assay table s7 does not detect φcrass001 as this phage is reported to belong to a different genus in order to estimate viral decay where no in vitro infectivity assay is routinely available e g hepatitis e virus noro and sapovirus capsid integrity assays can be performed based on the assumption that an intact virus particle is infectious capsid integrity can be assessed by the elimination of free viral nucleic acids using enzymatic treatment such as dnase rnase fongaro et al 2013 and intercalating dye pre treatment prevost et al 2016 or by capturing only the intact virus particles using immunomagnetic separation ims haramoto et al 2010 pcr based enumeration following integrity assays show lower viral concentrations than direct qpcr as the free viral nucleic acids are eliminated however as the intact virus particles may be damaged and hence non infectious these approaches may still overestimate viral counts fongaro et al 2013 walker et al 2019 nonetheless integrity assays are valuable tools for estimating the number of viral particles in environmental samples and their use may improve viral risk assessment 3 2 criterion 2 human waste association viruses such as adv pyv and aiv strains tables s1 s3 which specifically infect humans are logical choices for indicators for human faecal contamination using these viruses and their corresponding animal associated strains the source of contamination e g human vs wildlife livestock etc can be assessed for example staggemeier et al 2015 used sybr green qpcr for the detection and quantification of advs in water and sediment samples by distinguishing human bovine porcine canine and avian adv genome sequences based on their melting temperature human and porcine advs bovine pyv and porcine circovirus have also been used to assess the level of agriculture related and human sewage associated contamination in recreational groundwater and drinking water fongaro et al 2015 garcia et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2014 in the studies evaluated in this review the adv qpcr assays targeted all human adv groups a g the most common groups a f or specific groups c and f table s1 all of these groups are human specific demonstrating that waterborne infections of adv f predominantly type 41 are the most prevalent in wastewater and in the aquatic environment bofill mas et al 2010 chigor and okoh 2012 fong et al 2010 fumian et al 2013 haramoto et al 2007 hewitt et al 2011 iaconelli et al 2017 ibrahim et al 2018 lun et al 2019 myrmel et al 2015 ogorzaly et al 2015 shih et al 2017 the most common pyvs associated with wastewater are the jc and bk strains table s2 however mc pyv is also found in wastewater and in wastewater contaminated water di bonito et al 2014 rusiñol et al 2015 all known human aiv group a and b have been found in human wastewater table s3 these viruses are highly human specific and have not been found to associate with animal diseases the jc and bk strain have not been found in animal waste mcquaig et al 2009 whereas to date animal waste samples have not been tested for human aiv pmmov has been found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater raw and treated and in wastewater polluted environments and shown to correlate well with other human markers bacteriodes hf183 pyv kitajima et al 2018b symonds et al 2018 2016 implying it associates with human waste nonetheless the primary source of the virus are bell and chilli peppers with the suggestion that it should not be used as a faecal indicator nearby to commercial pepper plant production areas qpcr assays targeting pmmov show high sensitivity however the viruses were also detected in avian bovine and dog faeces at low concentrations gyawali et al 2019a hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009 suggesting that animals may also access pepper as a food source furthermore it has been suggested that pmmov is more abundant in faeces and in wastewater where more pepper products are consumed symonds et al 2018 therefore the prevalence of pmmov should be further investigated coliphages are commonly used as indicators for faecal viral contamination in water mcminn et al 2017 frnap genogroups ii and iii frnap ii and frnap iii have been shown to be associated with human sources while genogroups i and iv frnap i and frnap iv are generally associated with non human sources lee et al 2011 stewart pullaro et al 2006 for this reason several studies have used methods described in section 3 1 to distinguish between frnap genogroups to determine faecal sources however while there does appear to be a general association between genogroups and faecal sources the bacterial host e coli expressing f pili is not source specific and there is often overlap between source types for each genogroup cole et al 2003 harwood et al 2013 bacteriophages infecting bacteroides common human gut bacteria have also shown potential as indicators for faecal contamination in the environment the most commonly used strains which are phages that infect bacteroides bg 124 bacbg124p ryc 2056 bacryc 2056p ga 17 bacga17p and araba 84 bacaraba84p were shown to be human specific however one study detected bacryc 2056p in wastewater samples derived from abattoirs suggesting animal association wicki et al 2015 qpcr based assays targeting crassphage have shown good human specificity while some cross reactivity has been shown with dog gull poultry pig and cattle faeces ahmed et al 2018a garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 the levels of crassphage found in these non human sources were several orders of magnitude lower than that of human sources the highest crassphage concentrations in animal sources were found by garcía aljaro et al 2017 which may be attributed to pooled samples and or the use of a different qpcr assay garcía aljaro et al 2017 also found that by normalising crassphage levels against a general faecal indicator e coli it was still possible to distinguish between human and non human sources nevertheless the cross reactions of the qpcr with animal excreta should be further investigated to assess human specificity 3 3 criterion 3 presence in wastewater at high concentrations advs pyv aiv human gut associated bacteriophages and pmmov are all frequently found in raw sewage and untreated wastewater at high concentrations fig 2 tables s1 6 the highest concentrations among the potential indicators were noted for crassphage with concentrations of 1010 1012 gc l in raw sewage detected in samples taken in japan crassphage concentrations were lower in wastewater samples taken in the us florida 109 1010 gc l ahmed et al 2018a and in the uk wales 105 108 gc l farkas et al 2019 crassphage is not currently well characterised and while the current primer and probe set do not align to any recently discovered relatives of crassphage it is possible that the qpcr based detection assay is not specific to a single strain advs were detected at 1011 gc l concentration in wastewater influent in pisa italy in 2009 2010 carducci and verani 2013 in other studies using the same primer and probe set hernroth et al 2002 the concentration of adv was lower between 103 and 109 gc l with the highest concentrations measured in other wastewater treatment plants in italy la rosa et al 2010 followed by peak concentrations of 108 gc l in rome italy muscillo et al 2008 barcelona spain bofill mas et al 2006 and in minas gerais and rio de janeiro brazil assis et al 2017 similar peak concentrations 108 gc l were observed when adv groups a g were targeted in germany hamza et al 2009a and in queensland australia sidhu et al 2017b the highest concentrations of advf 108 1010 gc l were observed in the us michigan simmons et al 2011 and in giza egypt elmahdy et al 2019 further verifying that this group of adv is highly prevalent pmmov are also present in wastewater at high concentrations up to 1010 gc l the highest pmmov concentrations were reported in florida and other states in the us rosario et al 2009 followed by germany 107 108 gc l hamza et al 2011 new zealand 107 gc l gyawali et al 2019a vietnam and the us arizona 106 107 gc l kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 slightly lower frnap concentrations were noted in wastewater with the frnap ii appears to be more prevalent 107 109 gc l than frnap iii 104 107 gc l fig 2 however more studies are needed to further investigate frnap ii iii concentrations in wastewater among pyvs jcv had the highest concentrations 107 108 gc l in wastewater collected in brazil and chile fumian et al 2010 levican et al 2019 however it was less prevalent 103 106 gc l in the us arizona spain and in the uk wales bofill mas et al 2006 farkas et al 2018a kitajima et al 2014 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 bkv and mcv are probably less abundant in wastewater than jcv with concentration ranges of 103 107 gc l and 104 105 gc l however limited surveillance has been done on these viruses in wastewater aiv has only been sought in untreated wastewater in the usa arizona vietnam and nepal haramoto and kitajima 2017 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 with concentrations between 104 and 106 gc l and shown to be less prevalent than the other indicators the detection rate and concentration of adv pyv aiv frnap ii crassphage and pmmov usually exceeded the concentration of noroviruses sapovirus enterovirus astrovirus rotavirus and hepatitis e virus farkas et al 2019 2018a farkas et al 2018 flannery et al 2013 fumian et al 2013 grøndahl rosado et al 2014a hata et al 2014 kitajima et al 2014 2013 masclaux et al 2013 prevost et al 2015 qiu et al 2015 simmons et al 2011 however in some cases norovirus and rotavirus showed higher concentrations than adv and pyv kaas et al 2018 prado et al 2019 the peak concentrations of cultured phages infecting bacteroides in untreated wastewater was 106 pfu l however this number cannot be directly compared with the concentration of other indicators due to the different methods used for detection the viral infectivity rate i e gc infective units of virus may be as high as 1000 1 as determined for adv hewitt et al 2011 however the actual infectivity rates for bacteroides associated phages is yet to be determined all potential indicator viruses showed high 90 detection rates in untreated wastewater except bacryc 2056p which was found only in 82 and 38 of the analysed samples advs and pyvs were frequently detected in wastewater from large and small wastewater treatment plants in the americas europe asia and australia fig 1 table 2 tables s1 and s2 prevalence and concentration information for aiv was only reported for untreated wastewater samples from large wastewater treatment plants in the usa arizona and vietnam kitajima et al 2018a 2014 2013 kuroda et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 the pmmov titre was assessed in wastewater samples derived from the usa germany new zealand and vietnam hamza et al 2011 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009 schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2016 frnap ii prevalence in wastewater was only assessed in japan and ireland flannery et al 2013 haramoto et al 2015 2012 lee et al 2018 while frnap iii prevalence in wastewater was only assessed in japan haramoto et al 2015 2012 lee et al 2018 setiyawan et al 2014 2013 in wastewater the concentrations of phages associated with bacteroides bg 124 were assessed in the usa brazil the uk england and switzerland e dias et al 2018a mcminn et al 2014 prado et al 2018 purnell et al 2015 stefanakis et al 2019 wicki et al 2015 bacryc 2056p were investigated in colombia the uk spain france cyprus sweden switzerland and thailand costán longares et al 2008 gomila et al 2008 payan et al 2005 venegas et al 2015 wangkahad et al 2017 wicki et al 2015 2011 bacga17p were found in colombia and several european countries casanovas massana et al 2015 costán longares et al 2008 gomila et al 2008 mayer et al 2016 payan et al 2005 venegas et al 2015 wicki et al 2015 and bacaraba84p was identified in switzerland wicki et al 2015 2011 crassphage concentrations were only determined in wastewater in the uk wales australia and the usa florida ahmed et al 2019a 2018b farkas et al 2018a due to the limited number of studies table 2 further testing is necessary to evaluate the prevalence and distribution of aiv frnap ii frnap iii culturable phages infecting bacteroides crassphage and pmmov in untreated wastewater to assess their usefulness as indicators of wastewater pollution current data suggest that all assessed viral indicators are present in untreated wastewater at high concentration and hence they are potentially good indicators for wastewater contamination 3 4 criterion 4 resistance to wastewater treatment enteric viruses have been shown to be extremely resistant to traditional wastewater treatment procedures fig 3 table s7 as the removal efficiency varies amongst sites and the type of treatment process comparative studies have been performed to study the resistance of enteric viruses and potential indicators during wastewater treatment in this study 24 studies comparing the virus removal efficiency of different wastewater treatment processes were evaluated fig 3 fifteen of these studies exclusively used qpcr and rt qpcr for the quantitative analysis of viral concentrations as discussed in section 3 1 these molecular techniques give no indication on the infectivity state of the viruses and hence may overestimate infective viral titres in untreated and treated wastewater and other environmental samples this was demonstrated by flannery et al 2013 whose data showed that while infectious frnap ii in uv treated effluent was approximately 2 3 log10 less than influent only a 0 54 log10 reduction was found when using rt qpcr alone most of this reduction in frnap ii infectivity occurred during the secondary treatment stage 1 69 log10 reduction but the type of secondary treatment used in that study was not specified in a study by lee et al 2018 an activated sludge process a form of secondary treatment resulted in 2 1 and 3 1 log10 reductions of infectious frnap ii and frnap iii respectively rt qpcr analysis of the same samples showed log10 reductions of 1 6 and 2 5 for frnap ii and frnap iii respectively the differences between infectious virus and genome removal were not significant these studies therefore reached conflicting conclusions with the former showing that infectivity studies are vital and the latter showing that they are unnecessary it is possible that the activated sludge process used by lee et al 2018 resulted in physical removal of viruses while the process used by flannery et al 2013 inactivated the viruses without physically removing them from the treated water this highlights the importance of including the specific mechanisms used within a sewage treatment process when reporting such data as it is not clear whether the secondary treatment processes in the two studies shared any mechanistic similarities low removal rates have been reported for bacgb124p and bacga17p during wastewater treatment in most studies the removal of these phages was 2 log10 regardless of the treatment method used dias et al 2018a b mayer et al 2016 prado et al 2018 stefanakis et al 2019 except for one study showing 5 6 log10 removal of bacgb124p when disk filtration and chlorination was used as tertiary treatment prado et al 2018 data obtained from a wide range of qpcr based viral quantification studies have shown limited removal of adv pyv aiv crassphage and pmmov during wastewater treatment activated sludge treatment and biofiltration without further treatment resulted in 0 6 1 9 and 0 3 3 0 log10 removal of adv and pyv respectively fig 3 table s7 tertiary treatment processes resulted in an additional 1 3 5 log10 removal of adv and pyv with membrane bioreactors coupled with additional chlorination filtration and uv treatment being the most efficient method for viral removal qiu et al 2018 rusiñol et al 2015 simmons et al 2011 furthermore advs have been shown to be more resistant to uv treatment than poliovirus rotavirus caliciviruses and hepatitis a virus hijnen et al 2006 however laboratory scale studies suggest that advs are more susceptible to chlorine treatment than enteroviruses and caliciviruses cromeans et al 2010 kahler et al 2010 thurston enriquez et al 2005 2003 interestingly significant differences were found for the removal of pyv strains mcv was found to be the most resistant to treatment followed by jcv and bkv rusiñol et al 2015 fewer studies evaluated the removal of aiv crassphage and pmmov than the removal of advs pyvs and phages overall aiv showed 1 3 log10 reduction during secondary and 1 2 log reduction during tertiary wastewater treatment kitajima et al 2018a 2014 2013 schmitz et al 2016 the removal of crassphage was also in the range of 1 0 1 2 log10 during secondary wastewater treatment farkas et al 2019 however crassphage removal has not been assessed during tertiary treatment yet the current data suggests that pmmov is stable during secondary treatment and chlorination which results in 2 log reduction symonds et al 2018 larger pmmov removal 4 log was only observed using electrocoagulation and bardenpho aerobic anaerobic multi reactor technologies schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2015 further research is needed to evaluate the reduction of pmmov during uv treatment and other wastewater treatment procedures to evaluate its usefulness as an indicator the major advantage of crassphage and pmmov is that their concentrations are usually high in wastewater and hence the efficiency of their removal can be easily monitored nonetheless their infectivity and decay have not been investigated due to the current lack of in vitro culturing based methods in studies where the removal of indicator viruses was compared with the removal of common pathogenic enteric viruses indicator viruses showed similar or less removal than the pathogens carducci and verani 2013 farkas et al 2018a kitajima et al 2014 prado et al 2019 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 furthermore a meta analysis on the efficiency of secondary wastewater processes showed that activated sludge treatment resulted in 0 20 2 18 log10 reduction of rotavirus and norovirus gi and gii whereas biofiltration resulted in higher removal 1 52 4 30 log10 of norovirus gii and enteroviruses sano et al 2016 these removal rates are higher than the removal rates determined for the indicators reviewed here suggesting that the indicators can represent the removal of the most resistant viruses however three studies showed higher removal rates of bkv and jcv than norovirus sapovirus enterovirus and rotavirus farkas et al 2018a fumian et al 2013 schmitz et al 2016 suggesting that pyvs are less resistant than the pathogenic viruses and hence should be used with caution as an indicator current data shows that adv aiv frnapii iii crassphage and pmmov may be suitable for the assessment of wastewater treatment processes as different viruses have varying reactions to wastewater treatment processes the use of multiple indicators is recommended for indicators other than bacteriophages reviewed here the exclusive use of molecular detection and quantitation is a major limitation in understanding enteric virus removal hence combinations of infectivity studies and molecular assays should be performed for viruses that can be cultured in vitro in order to assess viral survival during wastewater treatment 3 5 criterion 5 persistence in the aquatic environment many of the studies that have been conducted to estimate viral persistence in natural waters have relied solely on qpcr based quantification while the reliance on qpcr data alone may lead to overestimations of infectious viral persistence its use is nonetheless important especially when considering unculturable enteric viruses when measuring persistence of viral indicators in the aquatic environment researchers should therefore be clear whether they are studying the persistence of a viral signal for example nucleic acids detected by qpcr or the infectivity of viruses for example by culture 3 5 1 indicators in surface freshwater most research has focused on the occurrence and survival of indicator viruses in surface water when quantified in surface freshwater bodies lakes rivers streams etc by qpcr these viral indicators e g aiv adv jcv pmmov are typically detected at up to 4 log10 higher concentrations than common enteric pathogenic viruses e g norovirus enterovirus and rotavirus hata et al 2014 jurzik et al 2010 rusiñol et al 2015 sassi et al 2018 all indicator concentrations in river water correlated with the distance of sampling point from the source of contamination wastewater treatment plant with significantly higher concentrations occurring near the wastewater treatment plant than further downstream or upstream ebdon et al 2007 farkas et al 2018a prevost et al 2015 rusiñol et al 2015 sassi et al 2018 sibanda and okoh 2012 tandukar et al 2018 venegas et al 2015 wangkahad et al 2017 comparative studies showed that pmmov occurred at higher concentration than adv aiv and pyv in surface water bodies in the usa arizona 103 106 gc l and colorado 104 105 gc l germany 104 105 gc l and vietnam 104 106 gc l betancourt et al 2014 hamza et al 2011 kuroda et al 2015 sassi et al 2018 the concentration of adv and aiv up to 104 gc l were similar in river water collected in the usa colorado and japan betancourt et al 2014 hata et al 2014 sassi et al 2018 whereas adv was more prevalent than pyv in river water samples collected in spain 76 vs 48 detection rates the uk wales 88 vs 65 japan 61 vs 11 and germany 79 vs 59 albinana gimenez et al 2009 farkas et al 2018a haramoto et al 2010 jurzik et al 2010 rusiñol et al 2015 however detection rates and concentrations of adv and jcv were similar in highly polluted rivers close to the wastewater discharge points near barcelona spain 100 103 104 gc l and rio de janeiro brazil 100 102 105 gc l calgua et al 2013 taken together our analysis shows that these indicator viruses are present in wastewater polluted surface freshwater at high concentrations which enables the accurate detection of the viruses and the comparative analysis of the rate of pollution crank et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 culturable bacteriophages were also present in surface freshwater fig 2 table 2 frnap ii were detected most frequently with concentrations up to 106 pfu l followed by frnap iii and phages infecting bacteroides up to 105 pfu l frnap ii concentrations correlated with adv concentrations in river water in france ogorzaly et al 2009 and with adv norovirus astrovirus and rotavirus in tropical freshwater samples in singapore vergara et al 2015 to date no comparative studies have been done to compare enteric viruses and phages infecting bacteroides spp in surface freshwater more research is essential on the prevalence of culturable human gut associated phages to assess their usefulness as indicators 3 5 2 indicators in seawater as for freshwater environments similar viral indicator trends have been observed in coastal waters where wastewater contamination is present pmmov was present at higher concentrations 102 105 gc l than pyv 102 gc l in coastal water at miami florida symonds et al 2016 and crassphage was also present at higher concentrations 103 105 gc l than adv 102 104 gc l and jcv 102 103 gc l in seawater collected at conwy wales farkas et al 2018a adv also had higher concentrations than pyv in seawater collected at rio de janeiro and santa caterina brazil 102 105 gc l vs 101 103 gc l florianopolis brazil 103 107 gc l vs 10 gc l north wales 102 104 gc l vs 102 103 gc l and catalonia spain 101 105 gc l vs 100 102 gc l dias et al 2018a b farkas et al 2018 moresco et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2015 crassphage pmmov and adv and pyv are usually present up to 4 log10 higher concentrations in seawater than hepatitis a virus norovirus and sapovirus dias et al 2018a b farkas et al 2018 fongaro et al 2015 moresco et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2015 symonds et al 2018 however one study found that the concentration of indicators and norovirus gii rotavirus and sapovirus were similar approx 104 gc l in seawater collected at the tahiti coast kaas et al 2018 bacgb124p bacryc 2056p and bacga17p were also found in seawater at concentrations up to 104 pfu l olalemi et al 2016 however these concentrations were not compared with enteric viruses to date frnap ii iii concentrations have not been measured in seawater samples based on the data reviewed here pmmov crassphage and adv are suitable markers for wastewater contamination in seawater 3 5 3 indicators in groundwater very few studies have evaluated the concentration of enteric viruses and viral indicators in groundwater adv jcv aiv pmmov bacgb124p and bacaraba84p were detected in polluted groundwater in the usa arizona and colorado and vietnam at very low concentrations albinana gimenez et al 2009 betancourt et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 hence the concentrations cannot be compared fig 2 table 2 future studies may include the efficient concentration of high volumes 100 l of groundwater to accurately determine viral concentrations and the associated risks 3 5 4 persistence of indicators in water understanding how long pathogenic and indicator viruses survive in the environment is crucial for accurate risk assessment and management the mechanisms and factors influencing viral decay such as virus type temperature microbial activity ph water type conductivity uv sunlight radiation and the presence of solid organic matter have been assessed jin and flury 2002 rzeżutka and cook 2004 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 many studies have shown that enteric viruses are more stable in the aquatic environment than traditional indicators such as coliform bacteria and coliphages el senousy et al 2014 fattal et al 1983 keswick et al 1982 muscillo et al 2008 ogorzaly et al 2010 wait and sobsey 2001 frnap are easily cultured and their persistence in surface waters has been studied in both surface freshwaters and seawater hata et al 2016 muniesa et al 2009 ravva and sarreal 2016 yang and griffiths 2013 in general frnap i has been found to be the most persistent followed by frnap ii frnap iii and then frnap iv using simulated sunlight flannery et al 2013 studied the effect of solar radiation on the persistence of frnap ii and norovirus in seawater the reductions in rt qpcr detectable viruses was similar for norovirus and frnap ii under both summer and winter sunlight conditions however it took between 81 and 88 longer for a 90 reduction in rt qpcr detectable frnap ii than for infectious frnap ii this highlights again the need to consider infectivity when studying viral persistence in the environment brion et al 2002 also studied the survival of different frnap genogroups in surface water environmental isolates of frnap ii had the highest variability in survival between isolates while frnap iii had the lowest variability in survival between isolates they concluded that frnap iii is suited to determining whether there had been recent contamination to a water body by human faeces in contrast frnap ii was more suited to indicating contamination by distant or sporadic human source contamination due to its easy molecular detection and relatively straightforward in vitro culturing the survival of adv has also been well studied advs have shown 1 2 log10 reduction in infectivity in raw and sterilised groundwater and surface water over 120 180 days ogorzaly et al 2010 rigotto et al 2011 in seawater the decrease of viral infectivity was more rapid than in groundwater with 1 2 1 4 log10 adv reductions in 28 days enriquez et al 1995 and sunlight significantly enhancing degradation at a rate of at least 2 log10 reduction per day liang et al 2017 advs were more stable in groundwater and surface water than poliovirus rotavirus and hepatitis a virus el senousy et al 2014 enriquez et al 1995 ogorzaly et al 2010 showed that adv persists for longer in ground water than both ms2 frnap i and ga phages frnap ii this difference in survival and persistence was greatly increased with an increase in temperature from 4 c to 20 c these studies highlight the stability of adv compared to other viruses however these studies were conducted in laboratory experiments and the viral stability may differ in field conditions pyv has also been shown to be as resistant to sunlight in seawater as adv ahmed et al 2019b liang et al 2017 however the monitoring experiments detailed in section 3 5 2 suggest that pyv degrades in water more rapidly than adv in contrast crassphage proved to be as persistent as adv and pyv in coastal bathing water ahmed et al 2019b the temporal decay of aiv pmmov and culturable bacteriophages infecting bacteroides is not yet known and should be investigated and compared with adv decay to determine their usefulness as indicators the comparison of the mechanisms of decay of pmmov and the other viral indicators would be especially interesting due to the differences in the structure of the virions tubular vs icosahedral 3 6 criterion 6 global distribution and temporal stability all potential indicator viruses reviewed here have been detected in environmental waters wastewater or stool samples of individuals in asia europe australia africa and the americas highlighting the global distribution of these viruses cinek et al 2018 fratini et al 2014 friedman et al 2009 guido et al 2016 jofre et al 2014 kitajima and gerba 2015 rames et al 2016 schaper et al 2002 symonds et al 2018 in the reviewed studies the indicator viruses were detected and quantified in 31 countries including 10 us states with the majority of studies conducted in the us brazil western europe japan and australia fig 1 table 2 while the available data suggest that these viruses are distributed globally very limited information on enteric and indicator virus quantities is available from developing countries e g india northern asia and most african countries table 2 to date none of these viruses have been studied in water from antarctica where they could point towards contamination of pristine areas by research scientists or long distance dispersal during long term monitoring surveys in the katsura river to the west of kyoto japan frnap ii was shown to have very limited seasonality with similar levels in the winter and summer months hata et al 2016 however in a tributary of the uji river to the south of kyoto frnap ii was detected only during winter frnap iii was also found to be more prevalent during winter at both sites a trend also observed in effluent from johkasou effluent by setiyawan et al 2013 culturable phages infecting bacteroides showed no seasonal changes in their concentration in river water in the uk ebdon et al 2007 and in wastewater collected in seven us states mcminn et al 2014 and in brazil prado et al 2018 in the studies reviewed crassphage adv and pyv showed no seasonal changes in concentrations in untreated and treated wastewater river and seawater samples carducci and verani 2013 farkas et al 2018a farkas et al 2018 fumian et al 2013 iaconelli et al 2017 masclaux et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 rusiñol et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 aiv and pmmov also showed stable titres in treated and untreated wastewater over a year iaconelli et al 2016 kitajima et al 2014 myrmel et al 2015 schmitz et al 2016 however peak concentrations for aiv were noted in wastewater in japan during winter and spring kitajima et al 2013 pmmov showed no seasonality in river water either haramoto et al 2013 rosario et al 2009 higher adv concentrations were observed in treated wastewater collected in wales during summer than in winter and spring which was most likely due to dry weather and a transient increase in population due to tourism in the summer months farkas et al 2018 furthermore higher adv concentrations were detected in untreated wastewater in norway during january march compared to the concentrations observed during april december myrmel et al 2015 the prevalence of adv was also higher during autumn winter than during the spring summer in wastewater collected in egypt elmahdy et al 2019 similarly advs were detected at low concentrations during the summer and autumn months in river water samples collected in japan and in germany respectively hamza et al 2009b kishida et al 2012 probably due to dry weather conditions overall these findings suggest that the indicators are detectable and quantifiable throughout the year which enables the continuous evaluation of wastewater contamination the current data imply that precipitation has more effect on viral loads than temporal changes in the number of infections nonetheless this should be further investigated by comparing epidemiological data viral loads in wastewater and precipitation over several years in terms of fine scale temporal variability the effect of rainfall on virus concentrations in surface water is variable on one hand a decrease in virus concentrations in surface water has been reported due to dilution of the water body grøndahl rosado et al 2014b in contrast a number of studies have shown association between precipitation and elevated enteric viral concentrations in water ebdon et al 2007 wicki et al 2015 in regions with combined sewers much of this increase in contamination is likely due to the additional wastewater input via csos and storm water drainage csos discharge largely untreated screened partially settled or untreated wastewater into the environment this almost certainly results in higher numbers of enteric viruses being discharged into receiving waters than would otherwise be the case from fully treated sewage effluents fong et al 2010 hata et al 2014 furthermore relatively few csos have spill duration monitoring and almost none have microbiological or chemical monitoring requirements therefore in most cases the input of contamination can only be monitored via the surveillance of wastewater derived contaminants in water bodies 4 conclusions and future research the viruses reviewed here have all been shown to have potential to indicate wastewater derived pollution in the aquatic environment table 3 due to their wide distribution they may be implemented in water quality risk assessments worldwide the major advantage of enteric viral indicators adv pyv aiv is that they are human specific hence their use as indicators enables us to track human derived contamination exclusively in addition crassphages and other phages which infect commensal bacteria associated with human gut and pmmov which is a plant virus found in the human gut due to the consumption of infected plant derived food are also associated primarily with domestic wastewater contamination a major advantage of phages and pmmov is that they are not infectious to humans and hence their detection and culturing in the laboratory pose no risk of infection to the operators frnap ii and frnap iii have also been shown to be useful in determining human sources of viral contamination due to their prevalence in human waste however due to the non specific nature of their natural e coli hosts it is not certain what the reason is for the specific prevalence in human waste relative to frnap i and frnap iv as such it is unclear how well these can be applied globally and indeed how stable that relationship is the viruses reviewed here can be easily detected by qpcr based methods however no such assay has been developed yet for culturable phages infecting bacteroides spp when using molecular methods dna viruses adv pyv and crassphage may be easier and more affordable to monitor than rna viruses aiv pmmov frnap the infectivity of frnap can be easily studied using a simple and rapid plaque assay furthermore the infectivity state of adv can also be monitored using icc qpcr infectivity assays are also available for pyv aiv and crassphage however the usefulness of those assays in environmental setting have not been critically evaluated furthermore there are emerging technologies such as isothermal amplification biosensors and microfluidics approaches which may be useful for the routine monitoring of viruses in the environment farkas et al 2020 in some cases these may offer the potential for near real time reporting of viral concentrations in water however their applicability still needs to be critically evaluated from a scientific practical and economic perspective this is particularly the case for in situ devices where biofouling cross reactivity and sensor drift represent major problems when translating technologies developed in the laboratory to the field lin and li 2020 here the review of global studies suggests that advs aiv frnap ii frnap iii crassphage and pmmov are detected more frequently and at high concentrations in wastewater and within polluted water bodies than the other indicators reviewed pyvs are also present in wastewater at high concentrations however they are less prevalent in the environment than adv albinana gimenez et al 2009 bortagaray et al 2019 dias et al 2018a b haramoto et al 2010 moresco et al 2012 suggesting rapid degradation similarly while frnap ii and frnap iii are initially found at high concentrations in wastewater it is likely that they degrade more rapidly in the environment than adv the concentration of bacgb124p bacga17p and bacaraba84p was also high in wastewater and have been found in wastewater polluted environments however only a limited number of studies have been conducted to date on viral decay prompting the need for more research in this area based on their ease of detection high concentrations in wastewater and environmental persistence our review suggests that advs are the most useful viral indicators of wastewater contamination however aiv crassphage and pmmov also show potential more research is essential to evaluate the usefulness of these viruses and indicators future research should therefore focus on i careful monitoring of the association of crassphage and pmmov with non human contamination ii monitoring the concentration and persistence of aiv crassphage and pmmov in the aquatic environment especially in groundwater and in seawater the effect of extreme weather events on viral concentrations should also be investigated iii development of a simple and rapid standard operating procedure for concentrating and detecting viruses from water to facilitate the accurate detection of selected indicator virus es iv the development of multiplex qpcr assays to simultaneously detect a panel of the best markers potentially tailored to differences in geographical diversity particularly for pmmov v critical evaluation and application of new and emerging rapid approaches for viral surveillance vi survival and maintenance of infectivity monitoring of aiv crassphage and pmmov in wastewater and in the water environment for that the usefulness of infectivity assays for these viruses should be developed and evaluated vii undertake comprehensive field campaigns in areas where data is not available e g africa asia oceania to validate the use of viral indicators as an effective way to monitor wastewater pollution viii use these viral indicators to validate current mathematical models which predict viral dispersal and which are used for risk assessment purposes ix better establish the relationship between viral indicators and wastewater pollution to enable the development of legislative standards for viral contamination of waterbodies a greater understanding of the fate and behaviour of these viruses will allow them to be routinely implemented for water quality monitoring and for viral risk assessment with a standardised protocol for the detection and quantification of proposed indicators viral contamination can be efficiently addressed by regulators and hence the number of waterborne and foodborne viral diseases can be reduced ultimately enhancing global human
