24895,the rate of somatic growth determines when individuals transition between life stages which along with survival and reproduction are principal factors governing the rate of population change for short lived species that inhabit seasonally dynamic environments accounting for fluctuations in somatic growth is necessary to make reliable inferences about population dynamics we describe a bayesian state space formulation of a von bertalanffy growth model that integrates a sinusoidal model to allow for seasonal fluctuations in growth while also accounting for individual heterogeneity and measurement error we use this model to describe post metamorphic growth of canyon treefrogs hyla arenicolor based on capture recapture data from 404 individuals over a two year period for simulated data where we assumed growth varies seasonally our model provides unbiased estimates of growth rate mean asymptotic length standard deviation of individual asymptotic lengths and date of maximum growth for field data from canyon treefrogs we found strong evidence of seasonal variation in growth with maximum growth during the summer monsoon season growth rate of females was 19 lower than males although on average females reached asymptotic lengths that were 15 greater than males ignoring systematic intra annual variation in growth can bias inferences about population dynamics particularly for fast growing species that reproduce more than once per year or inhabit environments with strong seasonal signals we present a straightforward approach for using repeated length measurements from individuals of unknown age to estimate growth while accounting for seasonality and individual heterogeneity which are sources of variation common in many vertebrate populations keywords bayesian hierarchical model capture recapture canyon treefrog hyla arenicolor somatic growth von bertalanffy 1 introduction life history traits including rates of survival reproduction and somatic growth govern dynamics of vertebrate populations therefore understanding how traits vary over time across space and among individuals is essential for predicting population rates of change caswell 2001 the rate at which individuals reach sexual maturity or transition between distinct life stages has important consequences for both individual fitness and population dynamics semlitsch et al 1988 stearns 1992 caswell 2001 for example individuals with higher rates of somatic growth may be more likely to survive to sexual maturity by reducing the duration of earlier life stages when mortality from predation is highest werner 1986 martin 2011 further for iteroparous species lifetime reproduction can be higher for individuals that reach sexual maturity earlier oli et al 2002 kim et al 2011 moore et al 2016 unlike many vertebrates growth of most amphibians is biphasic a consequence of abrupt changes in body structure at metamorphosis duellman and trueb 1986 growth of pre metamorphic or larval amphibians can vary markedly in response to a number of extrinsic factors including density of conspecifics semlitsch and caldwell 1982 presence of predators or competitors relyea 2004 temperature harkey and semlitsch 1988 and hydrologic conditions rowe and dunson 1995 numerous studies have focused on growth of individuals in early life stages because of its effect on age and size at metamorphosis which can affect post metamorphic survival reproductive output and locomotor performance semlitsch et al 1988 ficetola and de bernardi 2006 cabrera guzmán et al 2013 most growth of amphibians however occurs after metamorphosis werner 1986 post metamorphic growth affects a series of life history traits including the rate at which individuals transition from juvenile to adult life stages which can have strong effects on dynamics of some amphibian populations biek et al 2002 models of somatic growth based on size measurements from individuals of known age are relatively straightforward for many vertebrates however age can be difficult to estimate reliably many studies of post metamorphic amphibians have estimated age with skeletochronology methods e g tinsley and tocque 1995 liao and lu 2010 however this approach is invasive and may produce biased estimates when local variation in growth is ignored or when samples are few or lack proper calibration sullivan and fernandez 1999 eden et al 2007 sinsch 2015 alternatively models to characterize growth can be formulated from repeated measurements of body size from individuals of unknown age fabens 1965 although body size is measured commonly when amphibians are captured such as when using capture recapture methods to estimate survival relatively few studies have explored somatic growth of post metamorphic individuals hamer and mahony 2007 lee et al 2012 biddle et al 2017 these studies may be limited in part because traditional models do not accommodate seasonal fluctuations in growth evident in many temperate species turner 1960 sinsch et al 2007 further individual heterogeneity can bias estimates of growth parameters sainsbury 1980 wang 2004 we developed an approach for modeling growth based on repeated measures of body size that overcomes these limitations specifically we describe a bayesian hierarchical formulation of the von bertalanffy growth model that accounts for both seasonal fluctuations in growth and individual heterogeneity in growth parameters somers 1988 schofield et al 2013 we use a state space framework kéry and schaub 2012 to separate measurement error from variation in growth associated with season and differences among individuals we begin with a general description of the model and use simulations to assess bias and precision of model estimates we then apply the model to growth of the canyon treefrog hyla arenicolor a small bodied short lived frog that inhabits arid mountain canyons in the southwestern united states treefrogs in this region can reproduce twice per year with cohorts emerging from larval stages at the beginning and end of the summer monsoon season gehlbach 1965 growth is likely to vary seasonally and between cohorts in response to variation in ambient temperature and hydrologic conditions growth may also slow or cease during winter when treefrogs retreat into rock crevices hammerson 1999 to make broader inferences about the life history of canyon treefrogs in the region we complement our estimates of growth with data from visual encounter surveys to describe the phenology of recruitment events providing new insights into demography and population dynamics of this understudied species 2 materials and methods 2 1 growth model because it can be challenging to characterize attributes or states of individuals or populations of vertebrates perfectly state space models have been applied increasingly to data from field studies kéry and schaub 2012 this approach decomposes survey data e g counts of individuals measures of length or mass into variation attributable to the true state i e the process model and variation attributable to the sampling or measurement process i e the observation model we developed a model to estimate growth based on capture recapture data where the size e g body length snout vent length head length of uniquely marked individuals is measured each time an individual is captured importantly to estimate seasonal variation in growth individuals must be captured in more than one season per year i e the time elapsed between consecutive capture occasions must be 1 year we model the data yi tj which is the observed length of individual i i 1 n at the time of capture j j 1 ri as observations from a truncated normal distribution schofield et al 2013 1 y i t j n g i t j σ y 2 t 0 where gi tj is the expected length of individual i at time of capture j based on a seasonal form of the von bertalanffy growth model σ y 2 denotes variance in observations associated with measurement error and t 0 truncates the distribution ensuring that observed lengths are always positive to describe the expected length of individual i at time of capture j we use a form of the von bertalanffy growth model suitable for capture recapture data modified to allow for seasonal variation in growth fabens 1965 somers 1988 schofield et al 2013 specifically we modified a non seasonal von bertalanffy length at first capture lfc model described by schofield et al 2013 2 e y i t j g i t j λ i l i λ i 1 e k d i j where λi 0 is length at first capture for individual i l i 0 is the maximum or asymptotic length of individual i k 0 is the growth rate relative to maximum length and di j is the time elapsed in fractions of a year between capture j and first capture for individual i although commonly referred to as a growth rate the units for k are yr 1 rather than length yr given that k reflects the exponential rate of approach to asymptotic size schnute and fournier 1980 schofield et al 2013 refer to λi as a nuisance or hybrid parameter because it combines information about biological processes length and sampling processes first capture though not of primary interest we estimate this parameter rather than conditioning on observed length at first capture yi t 1 to reduce bias in estimates of l i and k wang 2004 like other forms of the von bertalanffy model parameterized for capture recapture data our model does not include parameters that relate length to absolute age e g mean length at birth l 0 theoretical age when mean length equals zero t 0 fabens 1965 cailliet et al 2006 estimates of age can be derived however if mean length at a given age is known or can be estimated from auxiliary data we added components to the lfc model that allow for seasonal oscillations in growth that might be associated with temperature or other environmental factors that vary sinusoidally 3 g i t j λ i l i λ i 1 e k d i j s i t 1 i d i j s i t 1 i where s i t 1 i c k 2 π s i n 2 π t 1 i t s k 0 is a growth rate 0 c 1 is the magnitude of seasonal oscillations in the growth rate t 1 i is the time of first capture for individual i in fractions of a year based on an arbitrary starting point e g 1 jan and ts is the time in fractions of a year at which the growth rate is maximized somers 1988 robins et al 2006 garcía berthou et al 2012 we provide a derivation of the model in appendix a we use a lowercase k to differentiate growth rate in our seasonal model from that in a non seasonal lfc model k but note that when the underlying environmental driver e g ambient temperature is equal to its mean k is equal to k appendix a the magnitude of seasonal variation in growth is determined by c with a value of 1 indicating seasonal cessation of growth when c 0 the model collapses to an lfc model eq 2 which assumes no seasonal variation in growth finally we note that with 0 c 1 the expected or true length of an individual cannot decrease over time appendix a however the structure of our model does allow for observed lengths to decrease from one capture to the next as the result of measurement error traditionally growth models have assumed that l and k are identical for all individuals in a population fabens 1965 estimates of growth parameters can be biased however when models do not account for heterogeneity in growth among individuals particularly in l wang 2004 zhang et al 2009 individual heterogeneity in growth parameters can be modeled as a function of measured covariates e g ectoparasite load or with an individual level random effect we adopt a hybrid approach that includes random effects that allow for individual heterogeneity in λ and l but assumes k is the same for all individuals specifically we consider individual asymptotic length li to be a random variable drawn from a truncated normal distribution 4 l i n l σ β 2 t 0 where l represents mean asymptotic length and σ β 2 represents variance in asymptotic length among individuals we model length at first capture λi with a normal distribution truncated between 0 and the asymptotic length of each individual 5 λ i n λ σ α 2 t 0 l i where λ represents mean length at first capture and σ α 2 represents variance in length at first capture among individuals 2 2 simulations we developed a series of simulations to evaluate the reliability of the seasonal model and to characterize bias in parameter estimates in the first set of simulations we created 100 datasets each comprising length measurements for 600 females across eight survey occasions in each of two consecutive years to ensure that all individuals were captured and measured 2 times in a given year we recaptured all individuals during the survey immediately after they were marked subsequently we assumed an annual survival rate of 0 50 and recapture rate of 0 70 we simulated length measurements assuming seasonal cessation of growth c 1 individual heterogeneity in l and λ and no individual heterogeneity in k for each of these simulated datasets we estimated growth parameters based on four models that reflected different seasonal patterns of growth and varying assumptions about individual heterogeneity 1 a seasonal model where we estimated c and estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ 2 a seasonal model where we fixed c 1 and estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ 3 a seasonal model where we fixed c 1 and estimated individual heterogeneity in λ but not l and 4 a non seasonal model where we estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ in addition we used simulations to assess the effects of recapture rate i e sample size and individual heterogeneity in growth rates on parameter estimates we also simulated length measurements assuming no intra annual variation in growth to assess whether the seasonal model would provide reliable estimates when growth did not vary seasonally additional details about the simulations are in appendix b 2 3 growth of canyon treefrogs 2 3 1 study area we studied canyon treefrogs in the madrean sky island region of southeastern arizona where isolated mountain ranges are separated by vast expanses of desert and semi desert grasslands specifically we surveyed treefrogs in mid elevation 850 1300 m reaches of four canyons in the rincon mountains east of tucson arizona in saguaro national park streams in these reaches are deeply incised characterized by shallow bedrock lined pools most pools are 2 m deep with surface areas 3 12 m2 limited soil bank development and limited aquatic vegetation wallace et al 2010 stream flow varies seasonally a product of a bimodal precipitation regime brown 1982 perennial pools are often connected by shallow riffles and runs between december and april in response to widespread winter rains between july and september localized and high intensity monsoon storms cause sporadic flash floods in late spring may jun and late fall oct nov stream channels between perennial pools typically remain dry grimm and fisher 1992 wallace et al 2010 2 3 2 field surveys we used capture recapture methods to survey treefrogs along four stream reaches that ranged in length from 500 m to 2900 m between april 2014 and june 2016 we captured canyon treefrogs on 11 survey occasions during each occasion we spent 4 10 days capturing treefrogs with consecutive surveys in each reach separated by 1 7 months we captured treefrogs in spring apr may and jun and fall late sep early oct late oct early nov when individuals congregated near perennial pools when we estimated there were 100 treefrogs in a reach we attempted to capture all individuals with snout vent length svl 35 mm when there were 100 treefrogs in a reach we captured as many individuals as possible from areas where treefrogs congregated and were easily accessible to surveyors we captured treefrogs by hand and released individuals after processing at the capture location for each treefrog captured we measured svl and classified sex of adults svl 40 mm based on throat colour wylie 1981 a small number of the adults 10 captured multiple times were classified as male and female on different surveys for analysis we used sex assigned at last capture because secondary sex characteristics i e dark colored throats in males are more likely to be evident when individuals are sexually mature we marked each individual uniquely by injecting a 1 2 mm x 2 7 mm alphanumeric tag in the left calf where skin is transparent we handled treefrogs with vinyl gloves and disinfected equipment between handling individuals to prevent spread of disease our protocol 13 450 was approved by the university of arizona s institutional animal care and use committee to evaluate the time required for post metamorphic treefrogs to reach reproductive age and 90 of asymptotic size we used visual encounter surveys to document when metamorphosis occurred we surveyed the same stream reaches for treefrogs once every 5 10 days between march and october 2014 2015 excluding periods of high stream flow when reaches were inaccessible and treefrogs were difficult to detect during each survey we recorded the number and location of individuals observed in each stage class metamorphs gosner stages 42 45 juveniles estimated svl 40 mm adults gosner 1960 we considered observations of metamorphs or newly emerged juveniles estimated svl 25 mm as evidence of recruitment 2 3 3 model structure to establish a model for inference we constructed a rich model that included seasonal fluctuations in growth allowed l λ and k to vary with sex and allowed for individual heterogeneity in l and λ for asymptotic length we estimated separate variance parameters for males and females 6 l i n β 0 β 1 f i σ β f i 1 2 t 0 where fi 1 for females and 0 for males σ β 1 2 represents variance in asymptotic length among males and σ β 2 2 represents variance in asymptotic length among females we assumed no variation in growth rates among individuals beyond that explained by sex 7 log k i γ 0 γ 1 f i modeling log transformed growth rates ensured positive values of ki gelman and hill 2007 we assumed equal variance in length at first capture among males and females 8 λ i n α 0 α 1 f i σ α 2 t 0 l i for individuals that were never captured with svl 40 mm and therefore never classified as male or female 7 of recaptured individuals we specified 9 f i b e r n ψ where ψ is the probability an individual was female 2 3 4 model implementation and inferences we specified normal distributions n 0 σ2 1000 for all regression parameters α0 α1 β0 β1 γ0 γ1 and half cauchy distributions with mean 0 and scale 5 for all standard deviation parameters σ y σα σβ 1 σβ 2 we specified uniform priors on the unit interval for c ts and ψ we fit models in jags executed from r using the package jagsui kellner 2015 r core team 2016 jags code is provided in appendix c for each model we ran three markov chains initiated at random values for 140 000 iterations we discarded the first 100 000 iterations as adaptation and burn in and retained 1 of every 20 iterations thereafter to summarize the posterior distribution we assessed convergence by inspecting trace plots and gelman rubin diagnostics gelman and rubin 1992 to assess goodness of fit we generated posterior predictive distributions for three summary discrepancy measures the mean maximum and standard deviation sd of length measurements across all individuals and captures chambert et al 2014 we compared histograms of samples from posterior predictive distributions with observed values and calculated posterior predictive p values for each measure with values near 0 5 indicating adequate model fit and values near 0 or 1 indicating poor model fit we assessed whether model estimates were sensitive to prior specification by increasing the scale parameter in half cauchy priors by a factor of four we predicted length of average treefrogs over time based on the seasonal model eq 3 or a model where we fixed c 1 if the posterior distribution of c included only values near the boundary value of 1 assuming 1 svl was 22 5 mm at metamorphosis wylie 1981 2 metamorphosis occurred on 1 july and 1 september based on our visual encounter surveys and 3 growth rates immediately after metamorphosis were similar to those of individuals with svl 35 mm for comparison we also predicted length of canyon treefrogs over time based on estimates from a non seasonal model eq 2 3 results 3 1 simulations for the range of values we explored estimates of growth rate k mean asymptotic length l standard deviation of individual asymptotic lengths σβ and date of maximum growth ts from a seasonal model that estimated c and estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ were largely unbiased fig 1 with percent relative bias prb ranging from 1 7 to 0 6 table b 1 measurement error σ y was overestimated slightly prb 3 5 4 4 when growth varied seasonally a model that assumed constant growth overestimated variance parameters prb 15 33 table b 1 moreover when individuals were born or metamorphosed if modeling post larval growth in amphibians when growth rates were at or near a seasonal maximum a non seasonal model overestimated the time required to reach sexual maturity by approximately 43 4 weeks fig 2 bias of parameter estimates in a seasonal model particularly k and σ y increased greatly if models failed to account for individual heterogeneity in asymptotic length table b 1 accounting for heterogeneity in k however did not appear to be necessary as estimates of k l ts and σβ were unbiased even when k varied by 5 among individuals table b 2 finally our model was robust to misspecification providing unbiased parameter estimates of k l and σβ prb 1 when there was no seasonal variation in growth rates table b 3 3 2 field surveys we marked 1852 treefrogs 404 22 of which we recaptured at least once for the 189 recaptured individuals that we classified as females we recaptured 85 once 13 twice and 3 three or more times mean 1 2 recaptures female range 1 7 for the 186 recaptured males we recaptured 76 once 19 twice and 5 three or more times mean 1 3 recaptures male range 1 5 we surveyed four stream reaches 223 times in total mean no surveys reach year 27 9 range 26 30 and observed a bimodal pattern in annual recruitment most post metamorphic individuals emerged just prior to the onset of summer monsoon rains metamorphs observed on 46 of surveys between 1 jun and 14 jul or early fall metamorphs observed on 98 of surveys between 24 aug and 17 oct 3 3 growth of canyon treefrogs there was strong evidence of seasonal variation in growth of canyon treefrogs based on estimates of c the magnitude of seasonal oscillations in growth and the correspondence between predicted and observed lengths of treefrogs in spring 2015 appendix d because estimates from a seasonal model indicated that treefrog growth ceased between late december and march 92 of samples from the posterior distribution of c were 0 90 we fixed c 1 in the model we used for inference females grew slower than males mean difference in growth rate 0 60 yr 1 and grew larger difference in mean asymptotic length 6 8 mm table 1 projections of post metamorphic growth indicated that treefrogs typically reached 90 of asymptotic length 4 10 months after metamorphosis fig 3 time to reach asymptotic length varied somewhat with sex and cohort fig 3 only 6 of females and 34 of males we captured had an svl within 1 mm of or greater than mean asymptotic length indicating low rates of post metamorphic survival all diagnostic measures for the final model we used for inference about growth of canyon treefrogs indicated adequate model fit including posterior predictive p values of 0 49 0 81 and 0 52 for mean maximum and sd discrepancy measures respectively appendix e model estimates were not sensitive to specification of priors for standard deviation parameters gelman rubin statistics for all parameters were 1 01 indicating convergence of markov chains and there was little evidence of autocorrelation within chains after thinning iterations by 20 4 discussion sophisticated models have been developed to characterize somatic growth and transition rates of fish and other aquatic organisms e g robins et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 dzul et al 2017 but models for terrestrial vertebrates are uncommon particularly for species that are not harvested often such as amphibians for many species information on growth is lacking because wild animals are difficult to age reliably in the field our model however provides a framework for estimating growth based on repeated measurements of body size from individuals of unknown age data collected commonly during studies that use capture recapture methods seasonal fluctuations or interruptions in growth of fish and other taxa are common garcía berthou et al 2012 multiple approaches have been developed to incorporate seasonality into models of somatic growth including sinusoidal models pitcher and macdonald 1973 somers 1988 polynomial regression brown 1988 gaussian process models sigourney et al 2012 and log linear models dzul et al 2017 we adopted a sinusoidal approach which is phenomenological and does not require specification of mechanisms that might govern seasonal fluctuations in growth if environmental conditions thought to be associated with growth were measured across seasons at the local scale a mechanistic model could be used to assess the relative influence of environmental factors on seasonal growth patterns e g sigourney et al 2012 dzul et al 2017 when these auxiliary data are unavailable however our model provides an approach to estimate growth while accounting for seasonal variation a likely circumstance for organisms that inhabit an array of dynamic environments accounting for seasonal fluctuations in growth can have strong effects on inferences particularly when growth related parameters are used to estimate the rate of population change or to predict population responses to future environmental changes for relatively short lived species that reproduce more than once per year for example time to sexual maturity might vary appreciably among cohorts that develop under different sets of environmental conditions a pattern we observed in canyon treefrogs accounting for seasonal fluctuations in growth may also be necessary to estimate rates of population change or turnover reliably for univoltine or semelparous species that inhabit environments with strong seasonal signals gotthard 2001 for these species seasonal models can provide unbiased estimates of growth rates during the active season whereas non seasonal models effectively average growth rates across active and non active periods we found that models that did not account for existing seasonal fluctuations in growth often overestimated or underestimated depending on when birth or metamorphosis occurs the time required to reach sexual maturity or a particular body size that is physiologically or ecologically important beyond the seasonal component our approach incorporates several features that improve upon conventional von bertalanffy models for growth unlike traditional approaches the hierarchical structure of our model accommodates multiple recaptures of individuals over time which can be especially important when the number of recaptured individuals is small second we modeled length at first capture and individual heterogeneity in asymptotic size features that reduce bias in estimates of growth parameters wang 2004 schofield et al 2013 third a state space formulation allows us to estimate growth while accounting explicitly for measurement error which is likely to be appreciable for post metamorphic amphibians hayek et al 2001 this feature was particularly appealing for canyon treefrogs which can lose 25 of their body mass throughout the day while basking snyder and hammerson 1993 our estimates of asymptotic length are similar to those based on repeated captures of 313 canyon treefrogs from a canyon approximately 90 km ne of our study area l 46 4 and 50 7 for males and females respectively wylie 1981 although our estimate of k is not directly comparable with estimates of growth in the earlier study results from both studies suggest that like other species in the hylidae family canyon treefrogs in southern arizona have rapid rates of post metamorphic growth reaching sizes consistent with sexual maturity approx 40 mm wylie 1981 in 1 year jameson 1956 hamer and mahony 2007 our estimates however contradict the suggestion that canyon treefrogs in colorado wait until their third year to breed hammerson 1999 this could be explained by differences in elevation or temperature factors often associated with geographic variation in post metamorphic growth and other demographic rates duellman and trueb 1986 liao and lu 2010 like most anurans canyon treefrogs are sexual size dimorphic with females reaching larger asymptotic sizes than males duellman and trueb 1986 although females in the population we studied had lower growth rates than males rates were sufficiently high to allow females to breed in the spring mar apr following their first winter regardless of whether they metamorphosed in early summer jun jul or fall sep oct of the previous year in contrast males that metamorphosed in fall likely did not breed until the following summer because growth rates slowed as individuals approach asymptotic size which for males was only 10 15 greater than the length at which they reach sexual maturity there may be strong selection for fast growth in female treefrogs given that low rates of survival limit the number of lifetime breeding opportunities and clutch size is associated positively with female body size wylie 1981 duellman and trueb 1986 fast growth and low survival of adult canyon treefrogs e zylstra unpublished suggest high rates of population turnover although this combination of life history traits may not be unusual for hylid frogs jameson 1956 hamer and mahony 2007 it contrasts with other amphibians in the sky island region including several toad species that can live 2 13 years after metamorphosis and forego breeding when environmental conditions are unfavorable tinsley and tocque 1995 sullivan and fernandez 1999 comparisons of life history traits among closely related or co occurring species and inferences about population dynamics like these for canyon treefrogs are made possible because of intensive capture recapture efforts maximizing the information gained from such surveys to estimate somatic growth in addition to survival is not only a good use of resources but also a way to provide novel insights about factors driving population change and to inform future management efforts for species of conservation concern data accessibility we intend to archive our data in the open science framework credit authorship

govern dynamics of vertebrate populations therefore understanding how traits vary over time across space and among individuals is essential for predicting population rates of change caswell 2001 the rate at which individuals reach sexual maturity or transition between distinct life stages has important consequences for both individual fitness and population dynamics semlitsch et al 1988 stearns

measures of length or mass into variation attributable to the true state i e the process model and variation attributable to the sampling or measurement process i e the observation model we developed a model to estimate growth based on capture recapture data where the size e g body length snout vent length head length of uniquely marked individuals is measured each time an individual is captured importantly to estimate seasonal variation in growth individuals must be captured in more than one season per year i e the time elapsed between consecutive capture occasions must be 1 year we model the data yi tj which is the observed length of individual i i 1 n at the time of capture j j 1 ri as observations from a truncated normal distribution schofield et al 2013 1 y i t j n g i t j σ y 2 t 0 where gi tj is the expected length of individual i at time of capture j based on a seasonal form of the von bertalanffy growth model σ y 2 denotes variance in observations associated with measurement error and t 0 truncates the distribution ensuring that observed lengths are always positive to describe the expected length of individual i at time of capture j we use a form of the von bertalanffy growth model suitable for capture recapture data modified to allow for seasonal variation in growth fabens 1965 somers 1988 schofield et al 2013 specifically we modified a non seasonal von bertalanffy length at first capture lfc model described by schofield et al 2013 2 e y i t j g i t j λ i l i λ i 1 e k d i j where λi 0 is length at first capture for individual i l i 0 is the maximum or asymptotic length of individual i k 0 is the growth rate relative to maximum length and di j is the time elapsed in fractions of a year between capture j and first capture for individual i although commonly referred to as a growth rate the units for k are yr 1 rather than length yr given that k reflects the exponential rate of approach to asymptotic size schnute and fournier 1980 schofield et al 2013 refer to λi as a nuisance or hybrid parameter because it combines information about biological processes length and sampling processes first capture though not of primary interest we estimate this parameter rather than conditioning on observed length at first capture yi t 1 to reduce bias in estimates of l i and k wang 2004 like other forms of the von bertalanffy model parameterized for capture recapture data our model does not include parameters that relate length to absolute age e g mean length at birth l 0 theoretical age when mean length equals zero t 0 fabens 1965 cailliet et al 2006 estimates of age can be derived however if mean length at a given age is known or can be estimated from auxiliary data we added components to the lfc model that allow for seasonal oscillations in growth that might be associated with temperature or other environmental factors that vary sinusoidally 3 g i t j λ i l i λ i 1 e k d i j s i t 1 i d i j s i t 1 i where s i t 1 i c k 2 π s i n 2 π t 1 i t s k 0 is a growth rate 0 c 1 is the magnitude of seasonal oscillations in the growth rate t 1 i is the time of first capture for individual i in fractions of a year based on an arbitrary starting point e g 1 jan and ts is the time in fractions of a year at which the growth rate is maximized somers 1988 robins et al 2006 garcía berthou et al 2012 we provide a derivation of the model in appendix a we use a lowercase k to differentiate growth rate in our seasonal model from that in a non seasonal lfc model k but note that when the underlying environmental driver e g ambient temperature is equal to its mean k is equal to k appendix a the magnitude of seasonal variation in growth is determined by c with a value of 1 indicating seasonal cessation of growth when c 0 the model collapses to an lfc model eq 2 which assumes no seasonal variation in growth finally we note that with 0 c 1 the expected or true length of an individual cannot decrease over time appendix a however the structure of our model does allow for observed lengths to decrease from one capture to the next as the result of measurement error traditionally growth models have assumed that l and k are identical for all individuals in a population fabens 1965 estimates of growth parameters can be biased however when models do not account for heterogeneity in growth among individuals particularly in l wang 2004 zhang et al 2009 individual heterogeneity in growth parameters can be modeled as a function of measured covariates e g ectoparasite load or with an individual level random effect we adopt a hybrid approach that includes random effects that allow for individual heterogeneity in λ and l but assumes k is the same for all individuals specifically we consider individual asymptotic length li to be a random variable drawn from a truncated normal distribution 4 l i n l σ β 2 t 0 where l represents mean asymptotic length and σ β 2 represents variance in asymptotic length among individuals we model length at first capture λi with a normal distribution truncated between 0 and the asymptotic length of each individual 5 λ i n λ σ α 2 t 0 l i where λ represents mean length at first capture and σ α 2 represents variance in length at first capture among individuals 2 2 simulations we developed a series of simulations to evaluate the reliability of the seasonal model and to characterize bias in parameter estimates in the first set of simulations we created 100 datasets each comprising length measurements for 600 females across eight survey occasions in each of two consecutive years to ensure that all individuals were captured and measured 2 times in a given year we recaptured all individuals during the survey immediately after they were marked subsequently we assumed an annual survival rate of 0 50 and recapture rate of 0 70 we simulated length measurements assuming seasonal cessation of growth c 1 individual heterogeneity in l and λ and no individual heterogeneity in k for each of these simulated datasets we estimated growth parameters based on four models that reflected different seasonal patterns of growth and varying assumptions about individual heterogeneity 1 a seasonal model where we estimated c and estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ 2 a seasonal model where we fixed c 1 and estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ 3 a seasonal model where we fixed c 1 and estimated individual heterogeneity in λ but not l and 4 a non seasonal model where we estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ in addition we used simulations to assess the effects of recapture rate i e sample size and individual heterogeneity in growth rates on parameter estimates we also simulated length measurements assuming no intra annual variation in growth to assess whether the seasonal model would provide reliable estimates when growth did not vary seasonally additional details about the simulations are in appendix b 2 3 growth of canyon treefrogs 2 3 1 study area we studied canyon treefrogs in the madrean sky island region of southeastern arizona where isolated mountain ranges are separated by vast expanses of desert and semi desert grasslands specifically we surveyed treefrogs in mid elevation 850 1300 m reaches of four canyons in the rincon mountains east of tucson arizona in saguaro national park streams in these reaches are deeply incised characterized by shallow bedrock lined pools most pools are 2 m deep with surface areas 3 12 m2 limited soil bank development and limited aquatic vegetation wallace et al 2010 stream flow varies seasonally a product of a bimodal precipitation regime brown 1982 perennial pools are often connected by shallow riffles and runs between december and april in response to widespread winter rains between july and september localized and high intensity monsoon storms cause sporadic flash floods in late spring may jun and late fall oct nov stream channels between perennial pools typically remain dry grimm and fisher 1992 wallace et al 2010 2 3 2 field surveys we used capture recapture methods to survey treefrogs along four stream reaches that ranged in length from 500 m to 2900 m between april 2014 and june 2016 we captured canyon treefrogs on 11 survey occasions during each occasion we spent 4 10 days capturing treefrogs with consecutive surveys in each reach separated by 1 7 months we captured treefrogs in spring apr may and jun and fall late sep early oct late oct early nov when individuals congregated near perennial pools when we estimated there were 100 treefrogs in a reach we attempted to capture all individuals with snout vent length svl 35 mm when there were 100 treefrogs in a reach we captured as many individuals as possible from areas where treefrogs congregated and were easily accessible to surveyors we captured treefrogs by hand and released individuals after processing at the capture location for each treefrog captured we measured svl and classified sex of adults svl 40 mm based on throat colour wylie 1981 a small number of the adults 10 captured multiple times were classified as male and female on different surveys for analysis we used sex assigned at last capture because secondary sex characteristics i e dark colored throats in males are more likely to be evident when individuals are sexually mature we marked each individual uniquely by injecting a 1 2 mm x 2 7 mm alphanumeric tag in the left calf where skin is transparent we handled treefrogs with vinyl gloves and disinfected equipment between handling individuals to prevent spread of disease our protocol 13 450 was approved by the university of arizona s institutional animal care and use committee to evaluate the time required for post metamorphic treefrogs to reach reproductive age and 90 of asymptotic size we used visual encounter surveys to document when metamorphosis occurred we surveyed the same stream reaches for treefrogs once every 5 10 days between march and october 2014 2015 excluding periods of high stream flow when reaches were inaccessible and treefrogs were difficult to detect during each survey we recorded the number and location of individuals observed in each stage class metamorphs gosner stages 42 45 juveniles estimated svl 40 mm adults gosner 1960 we considered observations of metamorphs or newly emerged juveniles estimated svl 25 mm as evidence of recruitment 2 3 3 model structure to establish a model for inference we constructed a rich model that included seasonal fluctuations in growth allowed l λ and k to vary with sex and allowed for individual heterogeneity in l and λ for asymptotic length we estimated separate variance parameters for males and females 6 l i n β 0 β 1 f i σ β f i 1 2 t 0 where fi 1 for females and 0 for males σ β 1 2 represents variance in asymptotic length among males and σ β 2 2 represents variance in asymptotic length among females we assumed no variation in growth rates among individuals beyond that explained by sex 7 log k i γ 0 γ 1 f i modeling log transformed growth rates ensured positive values of ki gelman and hill 2007 we assumed equal variance in length at first capture among males and females 8 λ i n α 0 α 1 f i σ α 2 t 0 l i for individuals that were never captured with svl 40 mm and therefore never classified as male or female 7 of recaptured individuals we specified 9 f i b e r n ψ where ψ is the probability an individual was female 2 3 4 model implementation and inferences we specified normal distributions n 0 σ2 1000 for all regression parameters α0 α1 β0 β1 γ0 γ1 and half cauchy distributions with mean 0 and scale 5 for all standard deviation parameters σ y σα σβ 1 σβ 2 we specified uniform priors on the unit interval for c ts and ψ we fit models in jags executed from r using the package jagsui kellner 2015 r core team 2016 jags code is provided in appendix c for each model we ran three markov chains initiated at random values for 140 000 iterations we discarded the first 100 000 iterations as adaptation and burn in and retained 1 of every 20 iterations thereafter to summarize the posterior distribution we assessed convergence by inspecting trace plots and gelman rubin diagnostics gelman and rubin 1992 to assess goodness of fit we generated posterior predictive distributions for three summary discrepancy measures the mean maximum and standard deviation sd of length measurements across all individuals and captures chambert et al 2014 we compared histograms of samples from posterior predictive distributions with observed values and calculated posterior predictive p values for each measure with values near 0 5 indicating adequate model fit and values near 0 or 1 indicating poor model fit we assessed whether model estimates were sensitive to prior specification by increasing the scale parameter in half cauchy priors by a factor of four we predicted length of average treefrogs over time based on the seasonal model eq 3 or a model where we fixed c 1 if the posterior distribution of c included only values near the boundary value of 1 assuming 1 svl was 22 5 mm at metamorphosis wylie 1981 2 metamorphosis occurred on 1 july and 1 september based on our visual encounter surveys and 3 growth rates immediately after metamorphosis were similar to those of individuals with svl 35 mm for comparison we also predicted length of canyon treefrogs over time based on estimates from a non seasonal model eq 2 3 results 3 1 simulations for the range of values we explored estimates of growth rate k mean asymptotic length l standard deviation of individual asymptotic lengths σβ and date of maximum growth ts from a seasonal model that estimated c and estimated individual heterogeneity in l and λ were largely unbiased fig 1 with percent relative bias prb ranging from 1 7 to 0 6 table b 1 measurement error σ y was overestimated slightly prb 3 5 4 4 when growth varied seasonally a model that assumed constant growth overestimated variance parameters prb 15 33 table b 1 moreover when individuals were born or metamorphosed if modeling post larval growth in amphibians when growth rates were at or near a seasonal maximum a non seasonal model overestimated the time required to reach sexual maturity by approximately 43 4 weeks fig 2 bias of parameter estimates in a seasonal model particularly k and σ y increased greatly if models failed to account for individual heterogeneity in asymptotic length table b 1 accounting for heterogeneity in k however did not appear to be necessary as estimates of k l ts and σβ were unbiased even when k varied by 5 among individuals table b 2 finally our model was robust to misspecification providing unbiased parameter estimates of k l and σβ prb 1 when there was no seasonal variation in growth rates table b 3 3 2 field surveys we marked 1852 treefrogs 404 22 of which we recaptured at least once for the 189 recaptured individuals that we classified as females we recaptured 85 once 13 twice and 3 three or more times mean 1 2 recaptures female range 1 7 for the 186 recaptured males we recaptured 76 once 19 twice and 5 three or more times mean 1 3 recaptures male range 1 5 we surveyed four stream reaches 223 times in total mean no surveys reach year 27 9 range 26 30 and observed a bimodal pattern in annual recruitment most post metamorphic individuals emerged just prior to the onset of summer monsoon rains metamorphs observed on 46 of surveys between 1 jun and 14 jul or early fall metamorphs observed on 98 of surveys between 24 aug and 17 oct 3 3 growth of canyon treefrogs there was strong evidence of seasonal variation in growth of canyon treefrogs based on estimates of c the magnitude of seasonal oscillations in growth and the correspondence between predicted and observed lengths of treefrogs in spring 2015 appendix d because estimates from a seasonal model indicated that treefrog growth ceased between late december and march 92 of samples from the posterior distribution of c were 0 90 we fixed c 1 in the model we used for inference females grew slower than males mean difference in growth rate 0 60 yr 1 and grew larger difference in mean asymptotic length 6 8 mm table 1 projections of post metamorphic growth indicated that treefrogs typically reached 90 of asymptotic length 4 10 months after metamorphosis fig 3 time to reach asymptotic length varied somewhat with sex and cohort fig 3 only 6 of females and 34 of males we captured had an svl within 1 mm of or greater than mean asymptotic length indicating low rates of post metamorphic survival all diagnostic measures for the final model we used for inference about growth of canyon treefrogs indicated adequate model fit including posterior predictive p values of 0 49 0 81 and 0 52 for mean maximum and sd discrepancy measures respectively appendix e model estimates were not sensitive to specification of priors for standard deviation parameters gelman rubin statistics for all parameters were 1 01 indicating convergence of markov chains and there was little evidence of autocorrelation within chains after thinning iterations by 20 4 discussion sophisticated models have been developed to characterize somatic growth and transition rates of fish and other aquatic organisms e g robins et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 dzul et al 2017 but models for terrestrial vertebrates are uncommon particularly for species that are not harvested often such as amphibians for many species information on growth is lacking because wild animals are difficult to age reliably in the field our model however provides a framework for estimating growth based on repeated measurements of body size from individuals of unknown age data collected commonly during studies that use capture recapture methods seasonal fluctuations or interruptions in growth of fish and other taxa are common garcía berthou et al 2012 multiple approaches have been developed to incorporate seasonality into models of somatic growth including sinusoidal models pitcher and macdonald 1973 somers 1988 polynomial regression brown 1988 gaussian process models sigourney et al 2012 and log linear models dzul et al 2017 we adopted a sinusoidal approach which is phenomenological and does not require specification of mechanisms that might govern seasonal fluctuations in growth if environmental conditions thought to be associated with growth were measured across seasons at the local scale a mechanistic model could be used to assess the relative influence of environmental factors on seasonal growth patterns e g sigourney et al 2012 dzul et al 2017 when these auxiliary data are unavailable however our model provides an approach to estimate growth while accounting for seasonal variation a likely circumstance for organisms that inhabit an array of dynamic environments accounting for seasonal fluctuations in growth can have strong effects on inferences particularly when growth related parameters are used to estimate the rate of population change or to predict population responses to future environmental changes for relatively short lived species that reproduce more than once per year for example time to sexual maturity might vary appreciably among cohorts that develop under different sets of environmental conditions a pattern we observed in canyon treefrogs accounting for seasonal fluctuations in growth may also be necessary to estimate rates of population change or turnover reliably for univoltine or semelparous species that inhabit environments with strong seasonal signals gotthard 2001 for these species seasonal models can provide unbiased estimates of growth rates during the active season whereas non seasonal models effectively average growth rates across active and non active periods we found that models that did not account for existing seasonal fluctuations in growth often overestimated or underestimated depending on when birth or metamorphosis occurs the time required to reach sexual maturity or a particular body size that is physiologically or ecologically important beyond the seasonal component our approach incorporates several features that improve upon conventional von bertalanffy models for growth unlike traditional approaches the hierarchical structure of our model accommodates multiple recaptures of individuals over time which can be especially important when the number of recaptured individuals is small second we modeled length at first capture and individual heterogeneity in asymptotic size features that reduce bias in estimates of growth parameters wang 2004 schofield et al 2013 third a state space formulation allows us to estimate growth while accounting explicitly for measurement error which is likely to be appreciable for post metamorphic amphibians hayek et al 2001 this feature was particularly appealing for canyon treefrogs which can lose 25 of their body mass throughout the day while basking snyder and hammerson 1993 our estimates of asymptotic length are similar to those based on repeated captures of 313 canyon treefrogs from a canyon approximately 90 km ne of our study area l 46 4 and 50 7 for males and females respectively wylie 1981 although our estimate of k is not directly comparable with estimates of growth in the earlier study results from both studies suggest that like other species in the hylidae family canyon treefrogs in southern arizona have rapid rates of post metamorphic growth reaching sizes consistent with sexual maturity approx 40 mm wylie 1981 in 1 year jameson 1956 hamer and mahony 2007 our estimates however contradict the suggestion that canyon treefrogs in colorado wait until their third year to breed hammerson 1999 this could be explained by differences in elevation or temperature factors often associated with geographic variation in post metamorphic growth and other demographic rates duellman and trueb 1986 liao and lu 2010 like most anurans canyon treefrogs are sexual size dimorphic with females reaching larger asymptotic sizes than males duellman and trueb 1986 although females in the population we studied had lower growth rates than males rates were sufficiently high to allow females to breed in the spring mar apr following their first winter regardless of whether they metamorphosed in early summer jun jul or fall sep oct of the previous year in contrast males that metamorphosed in fall likely did not breed until the following summer because growth rates slowed as individuals approach asymptotic size which for males was only 10 15 greater than the length at which they reach sexual maturity there may be strong selection for fast growth in female treefrogs given that low rates of survival limit the number of lifetime breeding opportunities and clutch size is associated positively with female body size wylie 1981 duellman and trueb 1986 fast growth and low survival of adult canyon treefrogs e zylstra unpublished suggest high rates of population turnover although this combination of life history traits may not be unusual for hylid frogs jameson 1956 hamer and mahony 2007 it contrasts with other amphibians in the sky island region including several toad species that can live 2 13 years after metamorphosis and forego breeding when environmental conditions are unfavorable tinsley and tocque 1995 sullivan and fernandez 1999 comparisons of life history traits among closely related or co occurring species and inferences about population dynamics like these for canyon treefrogs are made possible because of intensive capture recapture efforts maximizing the information gained from such surveys to estimate somatic growth in addition to survival is not only a good use of resources but also a way to provide novel insights about factors driving population change and to inform future management efforts for species of conservation concern data accessibility we intend to archive our data in the open science framework credit authorship

24896,coastal and marine natural capital stocks provide a bundle of ecosystem services vital to humans the delivery of these benefits depends on the protection and sustainable management of natural capital through effective nature conservation strategies marine protected areas mpas are recognized worldwide as important tools to protect biodiversity while ensuring the delivery of ecosystem services and promoting sustainable human activities following the results of a national project aimed at assessing the value of natural capital in the italian mpas in this study we assessed the value of marine natural capital stocks in the gulf of naples and campania region southern italy based on a biophysical and trophodynamic accounting model the assessment focused on four macro habitats sciaphilic hard bottom shb photophilic hard bottom phb soft bottom sb and posidonia oceanica seagrass bed psb the total biophysical value of natural capital stocks related to the total area of the gulf of naples and campania region was 5 70 1020 sej and 3 10 1021 sej while the total economic value was 795 92 and 4323 16 m although the shb habitat only represents about 4 and 1 of the total marine area of the gulf of naples and campania region it contributes by 28 and 7 to the total value of natural capital these figures reflect the high convergence of natural input flows into the marine ecosystem for the generation of the shb habitat highlighting the importance of proper measures and actions for its protection in addition the calculated values of natural capital stocks were combined with the bionomic map of the gulf of naples and campania region to show the spatial distribution of natural capital value the outcomes of this study can support local managers and policy makers in

introduction marine and coastal ecosystems are recognized as among the most productive ecosystems in the world unep 2006 hattam et al 2015 the interactions between biotic and abiotic components of marine ecosystems generate ecosystem functions and a bundle of ecosystem services vital for human well being häyhä and franzese 2014 pauna et al 2018 townsend et al 2018 the delivery of benefits to humans depends on the protection of natural capital stocks through effective conservation actions guidetti et al 2008 hoffmann et al 2018 in the last decades the awareness on the importance of biodiversity for natural ecosystems and human economy has considerably increased in fact biodiversity loss influences ecosystem functions in turn altering the capability of natural ecosystems to deliver goods and services cardinale et al 2012 haines young and potschin 2010 vihervaara et al 2019 marine ecosystems are heavily exploited by human activities removing altering or destroying natural habitats the anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems cause biodiversity loss and as a consequence can seriously affect the capability of marine natural capital stocks to provide benefits to humans halpern et al 2008 pauna et al 2019 to protect and effectively manage natural resources at local regional and national scales decision makers require quantitative data on the value of natural capital stocks which in turn support the delivery of ecosystem services flows norton et al 2018 in the last decades there has been an increasing interest towards the need for tools capable of assessing the value of natural capital stocks to convey their importance to local managers and policy makers buonocore et al 2018 hooper et al 2019 neugarten et al 2018 teeb 2010 several authors estimated the value of natural capital and related services in different marine and terrestrial ecosystems by using economic evaluation methods costanza et al 1997 2014 häyhä et al 2015 nikodinoska et

the economic assessment of natural resources buonocore et al 2019 mancini et al 2017 mellino et al 2015 pulselli et al 2011 ulgiati et al 2011 vassallo et al 2017 the assessment of the biophysical and economic value of natural capital is particularly useful in those contexts where a protection regime is established in support of conservation strategies marine protected areas mpas are recognized across multiple international policy processes including the un 2030 agenda for sustainable development and the convention on biological diversity cbd as important tools for protecting biodiversity while contributing to human well being and sustainable development ban et al 2019 rasheed 2020 when effective management measures are in place mpas are capable of meeting the multitude of objectives they are designed for supporting the achievement of sustainability goals at local regional and global scale italy is one of the mediterranean country with the highest concentration of mpas the italian network of mpas includes 29 sites protecting about 47 000 km2 and covering about 9 of the total national marine surface unep wcmc 2019 following the eu biodiversity strategy to 2020 guidelines the italian ministry of the environment and protection of land and sea has launched a research programme entitled environmental accounting in italian marine protected areas aimed at the implementation of an environmental accounting system for all the italian mpas the purpose of the project was to carry out a biophysical and economic assessment of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services flows franzese et al 2015 in the context of this project a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model was developed and applied to assess the value of natural capital stocks in selected mpas vassallo et al 2017 in particular franzese et al 2017 used this environmental accounting model to assess the biophysical and economic value of autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital stocks in the mpa the islands of ventotene and s stefano central italy picone et al 2017 assessed the biophysical value of natural capital stocks in the egadi islands mpa integrating environmental accounting with spatial data on main human uses to account for the trade offs between conservation measures and human activities paoli et al 2018 estimated the value of natural capital stocks in terms of natural resources invested for their generation and maintenance in two mpas located in liguria region northern italy buonocore et al 2019 integrated the emergy and eco exergy methods to account for the value of natural capital stocks in two mpas located in campania region southern italy highlighting that such integration resulted in a useful approach to measure different nature values based on a biophysical perspective in this study we assessed the value of marine natural capital stocks in the gulf of naples and at the larger scale of campania region southern italy based on a biophysical and trophodynamic accounting model the assessment focused on four main habitats sciaphilic hard bottom coralligenous bioconstruction photophilic hard bottom soft bottom and posidonia oceanica seagrass bed in addition the biophysical values of natural capital stocks were also expressed into monetary units to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 area of study campania region is located in southern italy the region hosts a population of about 5 800 000 inhabitants on a total area of 13 671 km2 making it the second most densely populated region of italy istat 2019 its landscape and peculiar geomorphological features the mild climate and the presence of a large number of historical and archaeological sites make campania region an important and well known touristic destination in addition the gulf of naples embracing 385 km of coastline with 25 municipalities includes the port of naples that represents an important commercial hub in the mediterranean sea therefore marine ecosystems are exposed to multiple anthropogenic pressures connected to maritime traffic and tourism activities appolloni et al 2018a b appolloni et al 2018c to preserve marine biodiversity while maintaining these important economic activities several mpas have been instituted along the coastline of campania region among which santa maria di castellabate smc costa deli infreschi e della masseta cim and punta campanella pc santa maria di castellabate and costa degli infreschi e della masseta are two mpas located along the coast of the national park of cilento vallo di diano e alburni they were both established in 2009 by the italian ministry of the environment the two mpas have an extension of 7095 and 2332 ha with a coastline of 18 and 14 km respectively buonocore et al 2019 donnarumma et al 2018 punta campanella is a mpa located in the sorrento peninsula of the gulf of naples it was established in 1997 by the italian ministry of the environment the mpa covers a total area of about 1500 ha with a coastline of about 40 km franzese et al 2008 these three mpas were chosen in this study as a benchmark for assessing natural capital value at the scale of the gulf of naples and campania region 2 2 habitat mapping and data collection at the scale of the gulf of naples the area and the distribution of the benthic habitats were assessed based on a detailed bionomic map published in appolloni et al 2018a fig 1 in addition the areas of the benthic habitats were also compared to those calculated by using the european marine observation and data network emodnet seabed habitats map table 1 at the scale of campania region the benthic habitats within the italian territorial waters 12 nautical miles from the coastline were assessed based on the emodnet seabed habitats map fig 2 not being available a more detailed bionomic map for the regional scale the benthic habitats were clustered into four macro habitats photophilic hard bottoms phb sciaphilic hard bottom shb soft bottom sb and posidonia oceanica beds hp table 1 shows the area of the four macro habitats calculated for the two scales of the gulf of naples and campania region according to appolloni et al 2018a and emodnet the values of natural capital for the investigated macro habitats in the three mpas included in campania region smc cim and pc were assessed through a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model based on the emergy accounting method vassallo et al 2017 buonocore et al 2019 being the marine habitats and main environmental driving forces of these mpas very similar their natural capital values were averaged and used in this study to estimate the value of natural capital stocks at the scale of the gulf of naples and campania region 2 3 the environmental accounting model the emergy accounting method aims at evaluating the environmental performance of a system on the global scale of the biosphere taking into account free environmental inputs e g solar radiation wind rain and geothermal flow human driven material and energy flows and the indirect environmental support embodied in human labor and services brown and ulgiati 2004 brown et al 2016a b franzese et al 2009 2014 2019 according to the emergy accounting method inputs are accounted for in terms of their solar emergy defined as the total amount of solar available energy exergy directly or indirectly required to make a given product or support a given flow and measured in sej solar emergy joules the solar emergy required to generate one unit of product or service is referred to as unit emergy value uev sej j 1 sej g 1 mass energy labor and money inputs to the investigated system are converted into emergy units by using

implement an environmental accounting model based on a biophysical and trophodynamic perspective vassallo et al 2017 this model aimed at calculating the value of natural capital stocks for different

the different habitats of the mpas and conversion of these flows into solar emergy units odum 1996 a detailed explanation on the application of these five steps to smc cim and pc mpas can be found in vassallo et al 2017 biomass raw data used in the model were collected through ad hoc sampling campaigns performed on macro benthic communities and necto benthic fishes for each macro habitat in the investigated mpas buonocore et al 2019 all identified species were clustered in main taxonomic groups the matrixes of the biomass density calculated for all the main taxonomic groups in the three mpas were the basis for assessing natural capital value using the emergy accounting method in addition to complement the biophysical assessment with an economic perspective the biophysical values of natural capital were converted into equivalent monetary values by using the emergy to money ratio indicator lou and ulgiati 2013 tian et al 2017 3 results table 2 summarizes the biophysical value per unit area of natural capital stocks calculated for the three mpas located along the coastline of campania region the average value of the shb habitat was higher compared to the other habitats the average value of natural capital stocks ranged from 2 15 1011 sej m 2 for the sb habitat to 2 57 1012 sej m 2 for the shb habitat while the average economic value ranged from 0 30 m 2 for the sb habitat to 3 60 m 2 for the shb habitat table 3 shows the biophysical value of marine natural capital stocks calculated for the four macro habitats in the gulf of naples and campania region the values calculated for the gulf of naples based on the more detailed bionomic map published by appolloni et al 2018a ranged from 1 52 1019 sej for the phb habitat to 3 36 1020 sej for the sb habitat the total

of marine natural capital stocks in the gulf of naples and in campania region was 795 92 and 4323 16 m table 4 4 discussion local and regional managers and policy makers play an important role in the achievement of local regional and global nature conservation targets to this end they need quantitative information and indicators to measure and monitor natural capital stocks and the services they provide to humans in this study the biophysical value of marine natural capital was assessed at the scale of the gulf of naples and campania region the contribution of the sb and shb habitats to the total value of natural capital stocks was higher compared to the other investigated habitats for both the scales of the gulf of naples and campania region in the case of the sb habitat this is mainly due to the large area covered by this habitat in the gulf of naples 92 and at regional scale 98 instead in the case of the shb although it only represents about 4 and 1 of the total marine area of the gulf of naples and campania region its contribution to the total value of natural capital was 28 and 7 fig 3 this outcome is due to the high value of natural input flows converging into the marine ecosystem for the generation of the shb habitat considering that in the gulf of naples and at regional scale only about 5 and 27 of the shb is protected by mpas the outcomes of this study remark the importance of increasing proper measures and actions for its protection ferrigno et al 2016 2017 casas güell et al 2016 the conversion of the biophysical values of natural capital stocks into monetary units is useful to better convey nature s value to local and regional managers and decision makers these non market monetary values of natural capital still reflect a donor side perspective and should not be interpreted like market based prices adopting a user side economic perspective it is noteworthy that the economic values calculated for the gulf of naples 795 92 m table 4 and campania region 4323 16 m table 4 are referred to the stocks of natural resources and do not include the value of the flows of ecosystem services that are generated by the investigated marine ecosystems moreover it should be remarked that these results were calculated based on values assessed within mpas located in campania region this may lead to an overestimation of natural capital value since mpas are designed to concentrate biodiversity improving species abundance and density the values of natural capital stocks calculated per unit area for the four investigated macro habitats were also combined with the bionomic map of the gulf of naples and campania region to show the spatial distribution of natural capital value in relation to the presence of different benthic habitats figs 4 and 5 these maps useful to visualize and identify areas with higher values of natural capital can support management schemes aimed at addressing the trade off between multiple human uses of the marine environment and conservation goals in addition in the case of the gulf of naples the value of natural capital stocks calculated based on the emodnet bionomic map was 15 lower than the value calculated based on the detailed bionomic map published in appolloni et al 2018a this is due to two main reasons firstly a large area of benthic habitats along the coast of the gulf of naples is not mapped into the emodnet map moreover some areas of high natural capital value especially shb were not included or underestimated within the emodnet map therefore while large scale mapping is still useful when assessing the value of natural resources at larger scales e g for the mediterranean basin more detailed bionomic maps are important especially when performing local and regional scale studies aimed at providing more detailed information to local managers and policy makers in charge of ensuring the sustainable exploitation and effective management of marine resources 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the biophysical and economic value of marine natural capital stocks in the gulf of naples and campania region southern italy the shb habitat showed a high value of natural capital at both the spatial scales of the gulf of naples and campania region this outcome highlights the importance of preserving this habitat through a network of marine protected areas and their effective management the value of natural capital stocks together with the maps showing their spatial distribution at different scales can support local managers and policy makers in charge for implementing nature conservation strategies aimed at ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources a future development of this study could aim at assessing the biophysical and economic value of the ecosystem services generated by the investigated natural capital stocks moreover the outcomes of this study can also represent a benchmark for future studies aimed at assessing the value of natural capital in coastal

24897,mussels as food is widely accepted by people around the world as it possesses good nutritive value along with the local fishes a gradual increase in the market demand of the lamellidens marginalis is observed in the eastern part of india these mussels are collected from reservoirs by the local people for their daily requirements and usual business the reservoirs receive the wastewater or sewage from the nearby tanneries and households consequently people are prone to a high risk of cadmium pollution through the consumption of mussels thus the study of the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the organs of mussel is felt be need of the hour a dynamic model was constructed to observe the daily accumulation of cadmium in the different organs of mussel the model was constructed in the stella 6 0 software and a sensitivity analysis was performed followed by calibration and validation the scenario analysis revealed that the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the gills was sensitive to the input rate of cadmium to the system the retention of cadmium in the alimentary canal and the kidney was dependent on the excretion rate of mussels cadmium deposition in the muscles and hepatopancreas was strongly regulated by the transfer rate of cadmium from the alimentary canal and the depuration rate respectively however the cadmium bioaccumulation in the foot was dependent on the surface area of foot the sensitivity analysis showed that the input rate of cadmium into the system was the system sensitive parameter if the cadmium is checked at the entry point of the reservoir then the mussels could be easily harvested by the local people and there would be less risk of cadmium pollution to the human keywords adsorption bioaccumulation cadmium transport depuration simulation model 1 introduction bioaccumulation is the net accumulation that results from absorption uptake distribution metabolism excretion of a substance in an organism as the process abridges the environment and the organism information on accumulation in aquatic organisms is vital for understanding the fate and effects of a substance in aquatic ecosystems the transfer of bioaccumulative chemicals through food web may lead to biomagnification the mussels are often used to study metal bioaccumulation and has received extensive attention over the last few decades because metal toxicity is directly dependent on metal accumulation the routes and rates of metal uptake are relatively unknown for most of the aquatic organisms luoma 1989 kimbrough et al 2008 the conventions of helsinki commission and european environment agency have included mussels as the organism for assessing chemical contamination in coastal ecosystems roose and udo 1998 galgani et al 2006 in the coastal and freshwater ecosystems mussels have been considered as pollution amplifiers or sentinels due to their excellent filter feeding and bioaccumulation ability since metal bioaccumulation in mussels is an integrated time dependent process the mussels evolve various strategies of accumulation of metals through food water or sediment the degree of bioaccumulation varies by order of several magnitudes under different environmental conditions luoma and rainbow 2005 méndez fernández et al 2017 mussels are either farmed or collected naturally from freshwater systems for human consumption and if contaminated might represent a potential risk for human health along with experiments and field survey model tools are necessary to understand the fate and transport of contaminants and to assess their impacts on communities and ecosystems carafa et al 2006 2009 jurado and rosselli 2007 bacelar et al 2009 dueri et al 2009a b marinov et al 2008 or end up with increasing or decreasing trend of bioaccumulation of heavy metals casas and bacher 2006 ahmed et al 2009 ali and taylor 2010 yasmeen 2011 mahajan 2016 in the management of toxic chemicals the prediction of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation factors in aquatic organisms has become a very crucial aspect for assessing the environmental and human health effects of a particular substance in order to construct a model quantitative knowledge of biokinetics including uptake metabolism excretion and depuration processes of toxicants in the organisms and the critical parameters regulating the processes is needed to predict the fate and bioaccumulation of toxicants along the food web pan and wang 2008 2012 wang and lu 2017 however all these processes are strongly related to particular physiological features feeding nature and metabolism of the aquatic organism to the specific chemical physical features of the compound and to the environmental conditions of the aquatic system in which the organisms exists lu et al 2019 conducted a meta analysis of trace metals including cadmium in the soft tissues of three marine bivalves oysters mussels and calms in china and developed a biokinetic model to determine the baseline concentration of cadmium in the tissue specific environmental quality standards of china wang and tan 2019 reviewed the biokinetic models physiologically based pharmacokinetic models and toxicokinetic toxicodynamic models the model proposed in this research is unique and specific to cadmium bioaccumulation in the soft organs of the mussels that are being consumed by human the objectives of the present research are i to determine the rate parameters of inter organ transfer of cadmium in lamellidens marginalis ii to develop a dynamic model of bioaccumulation of cadmium in the mussel lamellidens marginalis and determine the sensitive rate parameter of accumulation in various internal organs that are edible to human 2 methods the research work was designed into two parts experiment and model development 2 1 experiments in order to understand the bioaccumulation process in lamellidens marginalis and to calculate the rate parameters of the inter tissue transfer of cadmium within the lamellidens marginalis an experiment was designed in the laboratory for this purpose 180 mussels lamellidens marginalis were collected from ten non polluted ponds in and around burdwan west bengal india latitude 23 13 57 04 n and longitude 87 51 48 30 e these mussels were acclimatized in the laboratory condition for 20 days in a large tank containing 50 litres of non chlorinated water then each mussel was transferred to 500 ml beaker cadmium dose was fixed to 3 mg l 1 25 of lc50 of cdcl2 and added to the beaker containing water the initial cadmium concentration of water and different edible and non edible internal organs such as gills hepatopancreas kidney foot alimentary canal and muscle anterior adductor and posterior adductor were estimated five mussels were sacrificed each day and the experiments were continued till 28 days the physico chemical factors of water such as total dissolved solids tds dissolved oxygen do water temperature t ph and conductivity were measured daily using multiparameter pc 700 do meter pdo 520 temperature meter ptm 816 ph meter ph test 10 and multiparameter pc 700 respectively the morphological characters of the mussels such as slant height breadth length surface area of foot and weight of the mussels were calculated before dissection in the present research only t shell length sl and surface area of foot sa foot were incorporated into the model the mussels were dissected and the tissues of gills hepatopancreas kidney foot alimentary canal and muscle were dried in hot air oven at 110 c the tissues were digested in nitric acid hno₃ and hydrochloric acid hcl and stored in eppendorf tubes at 20 c for further analysis the tissues were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas pg 500 f g 2 2 the model the dynamics of bioaccumulation of cadmium in mussels was studied through the construction of a dynamic model in stella 6 0 platform here seven state variables namely medium m gill g alimentary canal a

the model was run from the day 1 to day 28 for calibration using the first set data and validated using the second set data from day 29 to day 56 the parameters or conversion fractions were derived from experiments and incorporated into the model and the best match between the observed and simulated results was accepted for calibration procedure the same values were retained for the validation of the model for the statistical significance chi square test was performed between the simulated and observed data of each organ under study 3 results it was observed that the cadmium concentration in the medium cm initially decreased from day one to day five and gradually increased to the maximum value of 3 43 μgl 1 at day nine and gradually decreased till day twenty one the cm increased for the next period of study the range of variation of cm during calibration and validation was 2 3 3 43 μgl 1 and 2 1 3 5 μgl 1 respectively the calibrated and validated results of cm is shown in fig 2 respectively the cadmium concentration in the gill cg during calibration and validation is shown in fig 3 it was observed that the cg showed a cyclical oscillating pattern that completes the cycle within 14 days the concentration of cadmium in the present study was in the same range as that of jana and das 1997 the range of variation of cg during calibration and validation was 19 87 38 45 μgg 1 and 28 96 49 87 μgg 1 respectively the cadmium concentration in the alimentary canal ca during calibration and validation is shown in fig 4 the range of variation of ca during calibration and validation was 6 47 25 67 μgg 1 and 13 86 28 12 μgg 1 respectively the average transport of cadmium from the alimentary canal to hepatopancreas was very prominent throughout the experiments it was observed that 0 27 μgg 1 day 1 of cadmium get transported to hepatopancreas however the average transport of cadmium from the alimentary canal to muscles kidney and foot were very less and 0 067 μgg 1 day 1 0 031 μgg 1 day 1 and 0 021 μgg 1 day 1 respectively the cadmium concentration in the hepatopancreas ch during calibration and validation is shown in fig 5 the range of variation of ch during calibration and validation was 19 61 25 84 μgg 1 and 20 45 29 81 μgg 1 respectively yap et al 2003 2009 conducted ecotoxicological tests using the green lipped mussel perna viridis under laboratory conditions to study the different rates of accumulation and depuration of cadmium the present study followed the methodology of yap et al 2009 and it was found that the depuration rates were 0 19 μgg

kidney ck during calibration and validation is shown in fig 6 it was observed that cadmium concentration gradually increased throughout the study the kidney acted as a sink of cadmium that received different concentrations of cadmium from alimentary canal muscles and hepatopancreas the range of variation of ck during calibration and validation was 32 48 65 76 μgg 1 and 40 9 93 02 μgg 1 respectively the cadmium concentration in the foot cf during calibration and validation is shown in fig 7 kim and kim 2006 reported that the bivalves could act as a bioindicator for heavy metals cd cr cu ni pb and zn in the sediment of any wetland the soft tissues were dissected and examined in the present experiment the concentration of cadmium fell under the same range as the above authors the range of variation of cf during calibration and validation was 5 92 30 57 μgg 1 and 15 21 34 65 μgg 1 respectively the cf was less in comparison to other organs as there was every chance of desorption of cadmium to the medium the study of desorption was out of scope of the present study and not included in the dynamic model the cadmium concentration in the muscle cmu during calibration and validation is shown in fig 8 it was observed that the cmu showed a very mild periodical oscillating pattern a gradual rise was observed throughout the study the range of variation of cmu during calibration and validation was 23 02 37 86 μgg 1 and 24 73 45 82 μgg 1 respectively different rate parameters of internal and external transport of cadmium were confirmed through laboratory experiments the sensitivity analysis revealed that the input rate was the system sensitive parameter followed by the rate parameter f the rate governing the transfer of cadmium from the gill to the alimentary canal when the input rate of cadmium was increased by 10 all state variables were increased between 21 and 31 respectively the concentration of cadmium in gill decreased to 9 when the value

respectively when the value of the parameter f was increased to 50 the retention of cadmium in the cmu was increased by 16 when value of the f2 was increased by 50 if the values of the f3 and the exc ali were increased to 50 the bioaccumulation at ca was decreased to 19 however no change was observed in the ch pool the bioaccumulation of cadmium was increased to 2 4 and 13 in the ck when the values of f4 f6 and f5 were increased to 50 respectively nevertheless the cadmium bioaccumulation in the ch pool slides to 58 of its original value when the f5 was increased to 50 only 2 decrease and increase were observed in bioaccumulation of cadmium at the cmu and ck respectively when the f6 and f7 were hiked to 50 of its original value the bioaccumulation in the cf was increased to 21 when the f7 and sa foot was increased to 50 the bioaccumulation in the ck slides to 24 if the value of the exc ki was increased to 50 4 discussion the uneven pattern of cadmium dynamics in the medium was due to the imbalance between the uptake process and depuration by lamellidens marginalis metals are sequestered in an immobilized form throughout the different tissues and organs involved in route of metal uptake transport utilization and release the bioaccumulation process of metal in a specific tissue or organ is temporary gills alimentary canal and foot and may be transported to next tissue or organ in a series that may be the site of depuration or sequestration or excretion anterior and posterior adductor muscles hepatopancreas and kidney thomann et al 1997 stewart and malley 1999 propounded that the mussels accumulate cadmium across their gills either through active transport or binds to membrane transported ligands blazka and shaikh 1991 there are published reports on phagocytotic uptake roseman et al 1994 marigómez et al 2002 and ingestion of particles from sediment phase fisher et al 2000 jana and das 1997 showed that the cadmium uptake process in lamellidens marginalis primarily occurs in water medium and the organisms are good biofilters roseman et al 1994 showed that the process of uptake in gills is dependent on the concentration of cadmium in the medium and shell length the present study showed that the bioaccumulation in the gills was comparatively sensitive to the inr than the sl of mussels heugens et al 2003 considered temperature as one of the important toxicity modifying factors in daphnia magna increase in the temperature was positivity correlated with cadmium toxicity in daphnia magna the study corroborates the present findings the bioaccumulation process is advanced by a specific metal binding protein called metallothioneins present in the alimentary canal of mussels and responsible for metal binding phenomena olsson and hogstrand 1987 from the present experiments on mussel organ dissection the cadmium transferred from gill to alimentary canal was found to be 20 which means that 80 of cadmium was filtered through the gill and stored temporarily within it the transport of cadmium from the cells of alimentary canal to other specific organs follows phagocytosis shears and fletcher 1984 robinson and ryan 1988 advocated that the plasma proteins are mainly responsible for bulk of the metal transport in the circulatory system of mussels the depuration rates of hepatopancreas f5 and muscles f6 were lower than the bioaccumulation rates f3 and f2 of the respective organs the study corroborates with the findings of yasmeen and mane 2013 moreover it was found that the bioaccumulation of cadmium in muscles was sensitive to the f2 however the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the hepatopancreas was strongly regulated by the depuration rate f5 regoli 1992 forwarded that the elimination of cadmium from the alimentary canal to the medium or water in the form of fecal matter occurs through exocytosis process in the present research the excretion rate exc ali was lower than the excretion rate exc ki from kidney interestingly both the excretion rates were found to be sensitive to the respective organs though the exc ki was very sensitive to the kidney it was lower than the cumulative effect of other transfer rates from the organs such as alimentary canal muscles and hepatopancreas to the kidney as a result a linear increase in the bioaccumulation was noted in the kidney concerning time however bioaccumulation in the foot was sensitive to the surface area of foot it can be said that adsorption of cadmium to the foot is directly proportional to the surface area exposed to cadmium present in sewage or wastewater the pattern of bioaccumulation in the lamellidens marginalis resulted in 5 27 reduction for all tissues in the order gill liver shell jana and das 1997 at the end of the experiment all the concentrations of cadmium in different tissues and organs in the lamellidens marginalis were high therefore it can be said that lamellidens marginalis might be productively used as a biofilter for the mitigation of cadmium contaminated aquatic systems in the present study the order of cadmium bioaccumulation according to the average deposition in the organs of lamellidens marginalis was kidney gill muscle hepatopancreas foot alimentary canal ghosh et al 2018 showed that the intake rate of cadmium for the people of east kolkata wetlands ekw was 0 062 kg day 1 which was quiet below the optimum intake rate 0 114 kg day 1 according to the provisional tolerable monthly intake ptmi the permissible value of cadmium intake is 25 μg kg 1 body weight as per joint fao who expert committee on food additives jecfa edition 2011 in the ekw the highest value of cadmium uptake was found to be 9 996 μg kg 1 body weight which is lower than the ptmi suggested value the results supported that the people are at high risk in near future if they continue to take cadmium loaded mussels lamellidens marginalis in their meals the model indicated that the total bioaccumulation of cadmium in the edible parts of mussel muscle foot and hepatopancreas was 54 03 μg g 1 the model can be applied to the cadmium contaminated aquatic systems such as east kolkata wetlands and management plans can be implemented for the harvest of mussels before the concentration of cadmium reaches the optimum level to induce human risk moreover all the amount of cadmium bioaccumulated in mussels is not bio accessible houlbrèque et al 2011 studied the bio accessible proportion of cadmium in mussels and showed that only 71 03 of the bioaccumulated cadmium is transferred to the human when cadmium contaminated food is consumed however the present model showed that the input rate is the sensitive parameter which in turn regulates the bioaccumulation process in the soft tissues if the input rate can be monitored at the entry point of any reservoir that receives sewage from the external sources then the bioaccumulation of cadmium can be checked ghosh et al 2018 suggested the application of bio filter to alleviate the cadmium pollution at the entry point of the ekw 5 conclusions the present research highlights the application of modelling concerning the internal and external transport of cadmium in the lamellidens marginalis as it is a good source of protein and one of the bioindicator species in any freshwater system the model is based on the laboratory experiments with a fixed environmental condition where a fixed dose of cadmium is used to observe the general bioaccumulation pattern in the mussel lamellidens marginalis the general bioaccumulation level in the different organs of mussel is found in the order kidney gill muscle hepatopancreas foot alimentary canal it can be concluded from the model that the change in the input rate of cadmium concentration in any aquatic system will alter the bioaccumulation in the organs of mussels in natural ecosystems such as pond lake river or estuary the environmental factors associated with the bioaccumulation process in mussel may vary with time moreover the input rate of cadmium or any heavy metal is not constant in the near future if such variables are incorporated in the model some impressive results or new

24897,mussels as food is widely accepted by people around the world as it possesses good nutritive value along with the local fishes a gradual increase in the market demand of the lamellidens marginalis is observed in the eastern part of india these mussels are collected from reservoirs by the local people for their daily requirements and usual business the reservoirs receive the wastewater or sewage from the nearby tanneries and households consequently people are prone to a high risk of cadmium pollution through the consumption of mussels thus the study of the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the organs of mussel is felt be need of the hour a dynamic model was constructed to observe the daily accumulation of cadmium in the different organs of mussel the model was constructed in the stella 6 0 software and a sensitivity analysis was performed followed by calibration and validation the scenario analysis revealed that the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the gills was sensitive to the input rate of cadmium to the system the retention of cadmium in the alimentary canal and the kidney was dependent on the excretion rate of mussels cadmium deposition in the muscles and hepatopancreas was strongly regulated by the transfer rate of cadmium from the alimentary canal and the depuration rate respectively however the cadmium bioaccumulation in the foot was dependent on the surface area of foot the sensitivity analysis showed that the input rate of cadmium into the system was the system sensitive parameter if the cadmium is checked at the entry point of the reservoir then the mussels could be easily harvested by the local people and there would be less risk of cadmium pollution to the human keywords adsorption bioaccumulation cadmium transport depuration simulation model 1 introduction bioaccumulation is the net accumulation that results from absorption uptake distribution metabolism excretion of a substance in an organism as the process abridges the environment and the organism information on accumulation in aquatic organisms is vital for understanding the fate and effects of a substance in aquatic ecosystems the transfer of bioaccumulative chemicals through food web may lead to biomagnification the mussels are often used to study metal bioaccumulation and has received extensive attention over the last few decades because metal toxicity is directly dependent on metal accumulation the routes and rates of metal uptake are relatively unknown for most of the aquatic organisms luoma 1989 kimbrough et al 2008 the conventions of helsinki commission and european environment agency have included mussels as the organism for assessing chemical contamination in coastal ecosystems roose and udo 1998 galgani et al 2006 in the coastal and freshwater ecosystems mussels have been considered as pollution amplifiers or sentinels due to their excellent filter feeding and bioaccumulation ability since metal bioaccumulation in mussels is an integrated time dependent process the mussels evolve various strategies of accumulation of metals through food water or sediment the degree of bioaccumulation varies by order of several magnitudes under different environmental conditions luoma and rainbow 2005 méndez fernández et al 2017 mussels are either farmed or collected naturally from freshwater systems for human consumption and if contaminated might represent a potential risk for human health along with experiments and field survey model tools are necessary to understand the fate and transport of contaminants and to assess their impacts on communities and ecosystems carafa et al 2006 2009 jurado and rosselli 2007 bacelar et al 2009 dueri et al 2009a b marinov et al 2008 or end up with increasing or decreasing trend of bioaccumulation of heavy metals casas and bacher 2006 ahmed et al 2009 ali and taylor 2010 yasmeen 2011 mahajan 2016 in the management of toxic chemicals the prediction of bioconcentration and bioaccumulation factors in aquatic organisms has become a very crucial aspect for assessing the environmental and human health effects of a particular substance in order to construct a model quantitative knowledge of biokinetics including uptake metabolism excretion and depuration processes of toxicants in the organisms and the critical parameters regulating the processes is needed to predict the fate and bioaccumulation of toxicants along the food web pan and wang 2008 2012 wang and lu 2017 however all these processes are strongly related to particular physiological features feeding nature and metabolism of the aquatic organism to the specific chemical physical features of the compound and to the environmental conditions of the aquatic system in which the organisms exists lu et al 2019 conducted a meta analysis of trace metals including cadmium in the soft tissues of three marine bivalves oysters mussels and calms in china and developed a biokinetic model to determine the baseline concentration of cadmium in the tissue specific environmental quality standards of china wang and tan 2019 reviewed the biokinetic models physiologically based pharmacokinetic models and toxicokinetic toxicodynamic models the model proposed in this research is unique and specific to cadmium bioaccumulation in the soft organs of the mussels that are being consumed by human the objectives of the present research are i to determine the rate parameters of inter organ transfer of cadmium in lamellidens marginalis ii to develop a dynamic model of bioaccumulation of cadmium in the mussel lamellidens marginalis and determine the sensitive rate parameter of accumulation in various internal organs that are edible to human 2 methods the research work was designed into two parts

cadmium within the lamellidens marginalis an experiment was designed in the laboratory for this purpose 180 mussels lamellidens marginalis were collected from ten non polluted ponds in and around burdwan west bengal india latitude 23 13 57 04 n and longitude 87 51 48 30 e these mussels were acclimatized in the laboratory condition for 20 days in a large tank containing 50 litres of non chlorinated water then each mussel was transferred to 500 ml beaker cadmium dose was fixed to 3 mg l 1 25 of lc50 of cdcl2 and added to the beaker containing water the initial cadmium concentration of water and different edible and non edible internal organs such as gills hepatopancreas kidney foot alimentary canal and muscle anterior adductor and posterior adductor were estimated five mussels were sacrificed each day and the experiments were continued till 28 days the physico chemical factors of water such as total dissolved solids tds dissolved oxygen do water temperature t ph and conductivity

as slant height breadth length surface area of foot and weight of the mussels were calculated before dissection in the present research only t shell length sl and surface area of foot sa foot were incorporated into the model the mussels were dissected and the tissues of gills hepatopancreas kidney foot alimentary canal and muscle were dried in hot air oven at 110 c the tissues were digested in nitric acid hno₃ and hydrochloric acid hcl and stored in eppendorf tubes at 20 c for further analysis the tissues were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas pg 500 f g 2 2 the model the

propounded that the mussels accumulate cadmium across their gills either through active transport or binds to membrane transported ligands blazka and shaikh 1991 there are published reports on phagocytotic uptake roseman et al 1994 marigómez et al 2002 and ingestion of particles from sediment phase fisher et al 2000 jana and das 1997 showed that the cadmium uptake process in lamellidens marginalis primarily occurs in water medium and the organisms are good biofilters roseman et al 1994 showed that the process of uptake in gills is dependent on the concentration of cadmium in the medium and shell length the present study showed that the bioaccumulation in the gills was comparatively sensitive to the inr than the sl of mussels heugens et al 2003 considered temperature as one of the important toxicity modifying factors in daphnia magna increase in the temperature was positivity correlated with cadmium toxicity in daphnia magna the study corroborates the present findings the bioaccumulation process is advanced by a specific metal binding protein called metallothioneins present in the alimentary canal of mussels and responsible for metal binding phenomena olsson and hogstrand 1987 from the present experiments on mussel organ dissection the cadmium transferred from gill to alimentary canal was found to be 20 which means that 80 of cadmium was filtered through the gill and stored temporarily within it the transport of cadmium from the cells of alimentary canal to other specific organs follows phagocytosis shears and fletcher 1984 robinson and ryan 1988 advocated that the plasma proteins are mainly responsible for bulk of the metal transport in the circulatory system of mussels the depuration rates of hepatopancreas f5 and muscles f6 were lower than the bioaccumulation rates f3 and f2 of the respective organs the study corroborates with the findings of yasmeen and mane 2013 moreover it was found that the bioaccumulation of cadmium in muscles was sensitive to the f2 however the bioaccumulation of cadmium in the hepatopancreas was strongly regulated by the depuration rate f5 regoli 1992 forwarded that the elimination of cadmium from the alimentary canal to the medium or water in the form of fecal matter occurs through exocytosis process in the present research the excretion rate exc ali was lower than the excretion rate exc ki from kidney interestingly both the excretion rates were found to be sensitive to the respective organs though the exc ki was very sensitive to the kidney it was lower than the cumulative effect of other transfer rates from the organs such as alimentary canal muscles and hepatopancreas to the kidney as a result a linear increase in the bioaccumulation was noted in the kidney concerning time however bioaccumulation in the foot was sensitive to the surface area of foot it can be said that adsorption of cadmium to the foot is directly proportional to the surface area exposed to cadmium present in sewage or wastewater the pattern of bioaccumulation in the lamellidens marginalis resulted in 5 27 reduction for all tissues in the order gill liver shell jana and das 1997 at the end of the experiment all the concentrations of cadmium in different tissues and organs in the lamellidens marginalis were high therefore it can be said that lamellidens marginalis might be productively used as a biofilter for the mitigation of cadmium contaminated aquatic systems in the present study the order of cadmium bioaccumulation according to the average deposition in the organs of lamellidens marginalis was kidney gill muscle hepatopancreas foot alimentary canal ghosh et al 2018 showed that the intake rate of cadmium for the people of east kolkata wetlands ekw was 0 062 kg day 1 which was quiet below the optimum intake rate 0 114 kg day 1 according to the provisional tolerable monthly intake ptmi the permissible value of cadmium intake is 25 μg kg 1 body weight as per joint fao who expert committee on food additives jecfa edition 2011 in the ekw the highest value of cadmium uptake was found to be 9 996 μg kg 1 body weight which is lower than the ptmi suggested value the results supported that the people are at high risk in near future if they continue to take cadmium loaded mussels lamellidens marginalis in their meals the model indicated that the total bioaccumulation of cadmium in the edible parts of mussel muscle foot and hepatopancreas was 54 03 μg g 1 the model can be applied to the cadmium contaminated aquatic systems such as east kolkata wetlands and management plans can be implemented for the harvest of mussels before the concentration of cadmium reaches the optimum level to induce human risk moreover all the amount of cadmium bioaccumulated in mussels is not bio accessible houlbrèque et al 2011 studied the bio accessible proportion of cadmium in mussels and showed that only 71 03 of the bioaccumulated cadmium is transferred to the human when cadmium contaminated food is consumed however the present model showed that the input rate is the sensitive parameter which in turn regulates the bioaccumulation process in the soft tissues if the input rate can be monitored at the entry point of any reservoir that receives sewage from the external sources then the bioaccumulation of cadmium can be checked ghosh et al 2018 suggested the application of bio filter to alleviate the cadmium pollution at the entry point of the ekw 5 conclusions the present research highlights the application of modelling concerning the internal and external transport of cadmium in the lamellidens marginalis as it is a good source of protein and one of the bioindicator species in any freshwater system the model is based on the laboratory experiments with a fixed environmental condition where a fixed dose of cadmium is used to observe the general bioaccumulation pattern in the mussel lamellidens marginalis the general bioaccumulation level in the different organs of mussel is found in the order kidney gill muscle hepatopancreas foot alimentary canal it can be concluded from the model that the change in the input rate of cadmium concentration in any aquatic system will alter the bioaccumulation in the organs of mussels in natural ecosystems such as pond lake river or estuary the environmental factors associated with the bioaccumulation process in mussel may vary with time moreover the input rate of cadmium or any heavy metal is not constant in the near future if such variables are incorporated in the model some impressive results or new

24898,we begin with a mechanistic model that is considered to be a reasonably good predictor of the real life system with a set of parameters determined from prior biophysical studies and expert knowledge for complex mechanistic growth models it is usually advantageous to numerically estimate a subset of the most important parameters i e those that most influence dynamic model behavior based on data and fix the others at their estimated a priori values determining a reduced order parameter subset for end user estimation can be challenging often relying heavily on expert knowledge and trial and error a straightforward but oversimplified method relies on one at a time oat sensitivity of model outputs to changes in individual parameters however this commonly used method fails to account for how simultaneous changes in multiple parameters can significantly impact model outputs in unpredictable ways due to model nonlinearities additionally hidden relationships between parameters can prevent consistent identifiability of parameters from different initial estimates rather than analyzing the effect of individual parameter variation on the model outputs we evaluate the importance of parameters to the curvature of the quadratic cost function sum squared difference between reference and model output sequences this analysis is carried out by calculating the matrix of second order partial derivatives of the cost function aka hessian matrix with respect to the model parameters calculating the cost function hessian allows analysis of changes in multiple parameters simultaneously the method is presented as an analytic reproducible procedure for determining a ranking for parameter importance the procedure is demonstrated on a limited version of the yield safe predictive agroforestry growth model for the analysis 12 model parameters are considered with their nominal values set to those given in a published implementation of yield safe the hessian was calculated at 212 4096 locations systematically selected in the neighborhood of the nominal parameter setting each generating a parameter ranking determined by the relative contribution of each parameter to the cost function curvature the top ranked 6 parameters were the same for 4091 of 4096 locations suggesting that this procedure has potential to guide modelers in recommending the most important parameters for estimation given reasonably good initial parameter estimates and real data keywords predictive modeling agroforestry system identification consistent identifiability parameter space reduction 1 introduction an increasing number of tree growth models are very complicated weiskittel et al 2011 pretzsch et al 2015 when modeling intraspecific interactions between trees or trees and crops grown in close proximity e g in tree polycultures and agroforestry complexity can increase significantly beyond individual or monospecific tree growth models due to the interactions between species monteith et al 1991 van der werf et al 2007 in tree modeling as well as in biophysical modeling of natural processes in general model complexity can become problematic particularly when accurate prediction of outcomes is of primary importance ljung 1999 cox et al 2006 sivakumar 2008 for agroforestry and other crop growth modeling in general outcomes prediction has become particularly timely agroforestry is increasingly seen as an important means to regenerate degraded lands and address climate change challenges while producing economically viable crops verchot et al 2007 jose 2009 jat et al 2016 hillbrand et al 2017 toensmeier 2016 schoeneberger et al 2017 elevitch et al 2018 predictive modeling can extend existing knowledge into novel crop combinations in new environments and justify investment in agroforestry for both producers and policymakers malézieux et al 2009 problems encountered in model predictive accuracy include propagation of model error between interconnected model components uncertainty in parameter model constant values and inadequate data for parameterization and validation beck 1983 young and ratto 2009 when accurate prediction is of primary importance to the modeler reduction in the number of estimated parameters is desirable sjöberg et al 1995 gupta and sharma 2019 the number of parameters estimated can be reduced if variations in some parameters or combinations of parameters contribute little to the model output s the degree of contribution is a combination of richness of the frequencies in the inputs and parameter sensitivities of the model structure yao et al 2003 gutenkunst et al 2007 crout et al 2009 li and vu 2013 additionally the model structure including interactions between submodels can inadvertently render some parameters unidentifiable bellman and åström 1970 beck 1983 young 1983 hengl et al 2007 vilela et al 2009 in order to reduce complexity in predictive models many model reduction schemes have been developed in general model reduction methods approximate the most important dynamics of the system by considering the relationship between inputs and outputs schilders 2008 methods for reducing the complexity are well studied and straightforward for linear models less straightforward for linear approximations of nonlinear models and most challenging for reducing nonlinear models to simpler nonlinear models ljung 2010 mechanistic models are usually in the latter category engendering a range of model reduction approaches model reduction techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition pod project high dimensional data onto a lower dimensional space to derive low dimension models that capture most of the dynamics of the full model hinze and volkwein 2005 kerschen et al 2005 schilders 2008 although pod can be applied to nonlinear models it yields an approximating linear manifold which may be considered a serious limitation in its application to nonlinear models kerschen et al 2005 also based upon analysis of dynamic modes young and ratto 2009 present a seven phase strategy for reducing the complexity of mechanistic models termed data based mechanistic dbm modeling after implementing a computational version of the model the process begins with stochastic analysis using monte carlo simulations to determine the relative importance of different submodels in explaining the dominant model behavior from this step a process called dominant mode analysis is performed over a user defined parameter range to determine a low order approximation of the original model this process generates a mapping of the unreduced model to a reduced order model called the dynamic emulation model dem that can replace the full model over a range of parameter values young 2011 all of the analysis is done in the absence of experimental data with the original model serving as a surrogate for the true system a disadvantage of this approach is the lack of a biophysical interpretation of the resulting dem model recognizing that many process based models are overparameterised and may have poor predictive performance cox et al 2006 followed by crout et al 2009 and others approach model reduction by setting signals in the model to fixed nominal values and evaluating how well each model version performs the signals considered are chosen by the modeler but generally have a mechanistic interpretation an exhaustive search of all possible combinations of signal replacements with constant values are assessed in order to determine which model dynamics may be excluded from the model without significantly degrading performance according to crout et al 2009 the work of cox et al 2006 is distinct from the data based mechanistic modelling of young et al e g young 1998 1999 in that it operates directly on the formulation of the original model rather than synthesizing a simplified linearised stochastic model using data sets generated from the original process based model of these model reduction approaches the method presented here is most similar to that of cox et al 2006 and crout et al 2009 in that it preserves the mechanistic model structure however rather than considering signals within the model analysis is done with respect to input output behavior of the whole model where inputs are the measurable exogenous drivers of the mechanistic model and outputs are only those signals that we are interested in predicting accurately and which can be readily measured this approach may conflict with other modeling preferences such as maintaining the biophysical interpretation of internal model signals or parameter values in exchange for accurate prediction of outputs such input output analysis has been carried out in developing models for highly complex systems such as industrial processes and machines for the purpose of control since the 1970 s balakrishnan and peterka 1969 åström and eykhoff 1971 eykhoff 1981 in this field models may be described as black box which are composed of well understood mathematical expressions or grey box composed of mechanistic descriptions of the physical processes which are frequently nonlinear and not well understood mathematically ljung 1996 as for control systems where accurate prediction is essential accurate prediction may be the primary goals of the modeler for example accurate prediction of tree and crop growth has practical importance in developing and evaluating crop combinations management planning and risk assessment for agroecosystems with wide ranging potential benefits in mitigating risks associated with climate change malézieux et al 2009 in this framework submodel parameters are estimated using empirical data related to the whole system landsberg and sands 2011 such numerically estimated parameters are seen only as a means to adjust model fit and may lose their physical interpretation ljung 1999 others have also acknowledged a shift away from physically interpretable parameters in developing complex models valentine and mäkelä 2005 state in principle the values of parameters may be estimated by lower level process models alternatively the physiological and morphological parameters combine under reasonable assumptions into a set of aggregate parameters whose values can be estimated from inventory data with a statistical fitting procedure in other words the individual parameters may lose their physical interpretation through the fitting to empirical data but the suite of identified parameters combine into aggregate parameters that are used to more accurately model the overall system dynamics to summarize this system identification framework that underlies the approach taken here output prediction is of primary importance rather than the understanding of internal mechanisms signals within the model are no longer necessarily assumed to have physical interpretations biophysical parameter interpretations may no longer be valid given these relaxations from an input output predictive modelling perspective we use input output system analysis approaches to develop a procedure to rank parameters in terms of their importance to model output prediction additionally the procedure presented here includes tests for parameter identifiability in the reduced parameter set 2 approach the procedure presented here begins with a number of assumptions 1 the mechanistic predictive model of interest is trusted based on prior studies 2 there exists an nominal parameter setting that gives an acceptable fit to data even sparse data 3 the primary objective is accurate prediction of outputs 4 model developers wish to recommend a minimum number of model parameters for estimation to model users that will result in a good fit to measured data in other words we begin with a mechanistic model that we consider to be a good representation of the real system whose outputs we wish to predict and we have a parameter setting where the model is believed to perform well because of nonlinearities it is important to note that the analysis is only valid for the neighborhood of a specific parameter setting as parameter importance to the output may change across the feasible range of parameter values 2 1 model class hessian and goodness of fit the procedure presented here was developed for application to mechanistic models constructed from deterministic descriptions submodels characterizing the underlying growth dynamics considered by the modeler to be of importance such as interception and conversion of solar energy biomass growth and transpiration buck sorlin 2013 each submodel is a well studied dynamic process with its own inputs and outputs described by a set of differential or difference equations submodel outputs are often inputs to other submodels buck sorlin 2013 and the same parameters may occur in multiple submodels cox et al 2006 mathematical representations for the dynamic processes within and between submodels are drawn from the extensive body of work in environmental physics e g campbell and norman 2012 monteith and unsworth 2013 quantitative agronomy e g vries and de 1989 villalobos and fereres 2016 and other fields we represent a model by 1 y n f u n θ where f is the mechanistic model y n is a vector of outputs u n is a vector of inputs θ is a vector of m parameters and n is time when the model parameters are set to a nominal setting accepted by modelers and determined by numerical estimation from data prior studies of component submodels and expert knowledge the parameter vector is denoted by θ 0 and the output denoted by y 0 n for the purposes of analysis we also introduce the identifier which is identical to the model in mathematical structure but with parameters set to a priori estimates θ j θ 0 denoted by 2 y j n f u n θ j as a reminder we are assuming that the model with nominal parameters θ 0 is a reasonably good predictor of reality according the modelers i e that we can take y 0 to be a surrogate for the real system a reference output sequence an approach taken by others e g young 2012 therefore the error between the reference model and the identifier at time n for the analysis is 3 r n y 0 n y j n leading to the average quadratic cost function over n steps from time n n 1 to time n 4 v n n 1 n i n n 1 n 1 2 r 2 i the matrix of second partial derivatives of v n n with respect to the model parameters is called the hessian under conditions of continuity of a function f the hessian can be determined analytically yielding an expression that can be calculated at any time n the hessian matrix of the second partial derivatives of a function f is of the form 5 h f 2 f x 1 2 2 f x 1 x 2 2 f x 1 x m 2 f x 2 x 1 2 f x 2 2 2 f x 2 x m 2 f x m x 1 2 f x m x 2 2 f x m 2 we are interested in the average hessian of 4 which contains information about how parameters affect the curvature of the cost function over n steps an m m matrix 6 h v n 1 2 n i 1 n 2 r 2 i x 1 2 2 r 2 i x 1 x 2 2 r 2 i x 1 x m 2 r 2 i x 2 x 1 2 r 2 i x 2 2 2 r 2 i x 2 x m 2 r 2 i x m x 1 2 r 2 i x m x 2 2 r 2 i x m 2 where the x k are the individual parameters the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of h v n which are important in ranking parameter importance to the cost function curvature in the neighborhood of the nominal parameter setting are determined by the solution to 7 h x x d where d is the m m diagonal matrix of eigenvalues λ k and x is an m m matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors x k with the hessian calculated a method to order the importance of the parameters to the cost function curvature is needed in addition to the magnitude of the eigenvalues we are interested in the projections of the eigenvectors onto the parameter axes multiplied by their associated eigenvalues johnson 1988 based on this reasoning the measure for ranking the importance of parameters to the hessian curvature is assigned to be the 1 norm of the projections of the eigenvectors onto each parameter axis multiplied by their respective eigenvalues that is the combined magnitude of the eigenvector projections on the parameter axes for the ith parameter λi is defined as 8 λ i d x i t 1 λ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ m x i t 1 where x i is the ith column of the eigenvector matrix x finally the normalized root mean squared error nrmse goodness of fit measure will be used in the procedure below

comparison sequence and n is the number of data points the possible range of nrmse values is 100 perfect fit to the threshold nrmse value for an acceptable fit depends upon the context and ultimately user preferences a user may consider a 90 fit is good enough in a certain setting while another calls for a 99 fit as applied in the example of section 3 2 2 2 input class model inputs include environmental data such as solar radiation temperature rainfall wind speed relative humidity and soil nutrients historical weather data are available for locations around the world from various databases https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web http koeppen geiger vu wien ac at shifts htm http archive ceda ac uk however data may not be available for the duration many years or the sampling interval e g day month year required by the model a range of stochastic weather data generators has been developed for climate studies that are available for generation of synthetic weather data such synthetic data are widely used for crop growth modeling purposes ailliot et al 2015 and have been made widely available e g palma 2017 2 3 consistent identifiability a model is uniquely identifiable if for any parameterization θ the model has identical outputs for any input and time to the model parameterized by θ ˆ if and only if θ θ ˆ walter 2012 one may begin characterizing the problem of determining identifiability by establishing the model class input class and a criterion for comparison åström and eykhoff 1971 identifiability has been well studied for linear systems ljung 1999 walter 2012 and classes of nonlinear systems e g vilela et al 2009 due to the complex nonlinear nature of many mechanistic models and frequently noisy data theoretical identifiability may be much less of a concern than practical identifiability the ability to uniquely identify parameters in practice walter 2012 for our purposes a model specific concept is introduced consistent identifiability we begin with the a priori parameters θ j and numerically estimate a subset of parameters χ j based upon input output data resulting in estimated parameters θ ˆ j χ j is consistently identifiable if numerical estimation with the same input output sequences yields θ ˆ j for any initialization in the neighborhood of θ j since it is not possible to test every point within a certain distance of θ j in practice one can vary each parameter in χ j plus minus a small percentage away from their θ j values and run the numerical estimation from those initializations 2 4 the hessian informed reduced order parameter estimation hirope procedure this procedure for determining a reduced order space for parameter estimation is based upon analytic evaluation of the average hessian of the quadratic cost function at an a priori parameter setting θ j in the neighborhood of an accepted nominal setting θ 0 the conceptual basis of the hirope procedure for a linear model and the simple 3 parameter logistic equation is presented in detail in elevitch 2018 chapter 2 2 4 1 model prerequisites application of the procedure has the following prerequisites a full deterministic process equations are defined b conditions on parameters are determined including mathematical and realism constraints this may be set by modelers e g all parameters are positive real or by model itself e g prohibiting output of negative biomass c if model input output equations are not twice continuously differentiable with respect to the parameters of interest acceptable differentiable analytic approximations are substituted d the general class of model inputs is known and ample input data at the model time step can be accessed e a parameter optimization algorithm is implemented a list of symbols used in this analysis and associated notes for the example described in detail in section 3 for the yield safe model is given in table 1 2 4 2 steps of the hirope procedure the steps of the model reduction procedure are outlined here for a detailed description see elevitch 2018 chapter 2 the procedure is summarized graphically in fig 1 note that in this analysis we have nominal parameters θ 0 and the a priori estimates θ j are selected in the neighborhood of θ 0 for convenience here we assume that all elements of θ j are 5 away from θ 0 step 1 compare goodness of fit of y 0 with the estimated output y j for inputs u i compare output y 0 for a parameter set θ 0 with the output y j for the a priori θ j parameter set using the nrmse goodness of fit measure 9 if the fit meets the criterion move to step 6 validation step 2 compute hessian h i j and its eigenvectors and eigenvalues compute h i j for θ j using data sequences u i y 0 and y j from simulation of step 1 and determine its eigenvectors and eigenvalues step 3 generate λk parameter ranking from the computed h i j rank parameters using the formula 8 which leads to reduced order parameter sets χ j k step 4 confirm consistent identifiability beginning with highest ranked reduced order parameter set χ j 1 containing only one parameter optimize the parameter value from two nearby locations e g 5 from its a priori value with all other parameters in θ j fixed to their original estimated values to calculate a θ ˆ j step 5 check goodness of fit of y 0 and y ˆ j using the current θ ˆ j generate y ˆ j and calculate the nrmse value relative to y 0 if fit criterion nrmse 99 is met then move to the next step for validation if optimization on the first candidate parameter set does not meet the nrmse criterion then repeat step 4 for the next candidate parameter set and so on until either the fitting criterion is met for the optimization and validation inputs success or not failure of procedure in case of failure revise fit criterion or model step 6 validation validate the optimized parameter set using a number of different input sequences from the same location and calculating their nrmse values if the validating input data also results in an acceptable nrmse value then the model optimization procedure is considered successful otherwise return to step 4 one may proceed to the next candidate parameter set if one wishes to see if there is improvement 3 results this section demonstrates the hirope procedure applied to the yield safe model van der werf et al 2007 the yield safe model may be the most widely used multistory agroforestry model designed for predictive purposes it was developed as a very parameter sparse yet process based model providing the best chance that robust parameter values can be identified van der werf et al 2007 despite yield safe s parsimoniousness it is recognized that only a subset of parameters can reasonably be estimated palma et al 2017 developed by the silvoarable agroforestry for europe safe project during the 2000 s the yield safe model estimates biomass yields of tree rows integrated with arable crops dupraz et al 2005 van der werf et al 2007 graves et al 2010 the model consists of mechanistic descriptions of tree and crop growth in a two story planting configuration driven by environmental inputs solar radiation temperature and precipitation i e it is an input output model that includes both plant growth and interactions between trees and crops recently yield safe was augmented with several new submodels including vapor pressure deficit input to predict transpiration modified water uptake and the effect of the trees on temperature and wind speed among others palma et al 2016 2018b as an initial case study the analysis below is based upon the original version of yield safe described in van der werf et al 2007 and implemented in microsoft excel burgess et al 2014 the analysis is expected to be extendable to the recently introduced more complex versions of yield safe as well as other process based models that meet the procedure criteria the yield safe model is described in detail in van der werf et al 2007 the model includes seven state eq 1 tree biomass 2 tree leaf area 3 number of shoots per tree 4 crop biomass 5 crop leaf area index 6 soil water content and 7 heat sum the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by exogenous inputs of solar radiation temperature and precipitation for the purposes of the present analysis water and soil nutrients will be considered sufficient and non limiting to potential growth which is consistent with the initial parameter calibration assuming non drought stress conditions undertaken by the yield safe team van der werf et al 2007 keesman et al 2011 palma et al 2017 this type of simplification often applied to crop growth model analsis is based upon liebig s law of the minimum which states that plant growth is limited by the scarcest resource van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 van der ploeg et al 1999 the growth equations used here are based upon the excel implementation by burgess et al 2014 without management interventions such as tree thinning and pruning or the water and soil modules as previously mentioned see fig 2 for a graphical depiction of the tree crop combination model with tree parameters listed in table 2 and crop parameters in table 3 3 1 yield safe project s parameterization methods due to lack of input output data for two story agroforestry configurations the yield safe developers have parameterized their model based on yield tables other models such as stics see brisson et al 2003 and field data for monocultures single species plantings of the tree and crop species of interest van der werf et al 2007 described how parameters are determined through a two step process 1 curve fitting to accepted yield tables for tree monocultures and accepted model yields for arable crop monocultures using least squares optimization and manual adjustments 2 fine tuning of certain parameters for a specific site based upon monoculture growth data in later publications regarding yield safe parameterization no specific reproducible methods for parameter estimation are given keesman et al 2011 palma et al 2017 a reproducible procedure is presented here for determining a lower dimensional subspace for parameter estimation that may benefit model users who would like to parameterize the model for new crops and environments 3 2 inputs and validation in order to acquire the needed input data the yield safe developers draw on simulated climate data to drive their model and have developed the web portal clipick climate change web picker http home isa utl pt joaopalma projects agforward clipick to access climate data generated by a number of climate modeling projects palma 2015 2017 palma et al 2018a the data sets available through clipick include a number of future climate scenarios as well as climate data simulated based upon historical measurements of atmospheric aerosols van meijgaard et al 2012 as palma et al 2017 state there are indications that the simulated climate can be used for calibration purposes with minor loss of quality in comparison to real data the basis for using historical data to simulate climate data is documented in lamarque et al 2011 various data sequences extracted from a historical climate scenario were used for the optimization and validation simulations conducted here table 4 typical input output sequences for a 20 year period are depicted in fig 3 3 3 yield safe model implementation and parameter estimation the tree and crop combination growth model was implemented in the matlab system identification toolbox to take advantage of advanced optimization routines and the ability to easily run multiple simulations nominal parameters θ 0 for poplar and annual grass tables 2 and 3 and input u1 1 table 4 model object defined the model equations and the nlgreyest parameter estimation function was used with the default optimization settings the default optimization algorithm used is the trust region reflective newton method for nonlinear least squares ljung 2018 the analytic hessian was derived from the cost function expression see elevitch 2018 for full details a twice continuously differentiable symbolic expression for the cost was first coded in matlab using approximations for discontinuous functions in the growth equations where necessary the hessians of the symbolic cost function expressions for a certain time step were then derived using matlab s hessian function with respect to the parameters of interest the eigenstructure of the calculated hessian for the nonlinear models was determined using the eig function 3 4 hirope applied to yield safe combination model application of the hirope procedure to the separate tree and crop models is presented in detail in elevitch 2018 chapter 3 here we present the main results for the combined tree and crop model in the non water limited case for the example presented here the a priori parameter values θ 1 are set 5 away from their nominal values table 5 3 4 1 step 1 compare goodness of fit of y 0 with the estimated output y 1 for this 2 output model each output is compared with the reference the goodness of fit measures are well below the cut off of 99 fig 4 3 4 2 step 2 compute h i j and its eigenvectors and eigenvalues parameter scaling was employed prior to differentiation and the analytic hessian with respect to the 12 parameters of interest was derived using matlab s hessian function the average hessian calculated for n 5475 15 years was calculated with its eigenvalues and eigenvectors given in table 6 3 4 3 step 3 generate λ parameter ranking based on table 6 and eq 8 the λ values and associated parameter ranking for θ 1 setting are shown in table 7 this leads to a set of candidate parameter vectors χ 1 k for estimation table 8 3 4 4 step 5 check goodness of fit of y 0 and y ˆ 1 to compress the procedure steps for presentation here the optimization algorithm was run from θ 1 for the first seven χ 1 k and the model fit for each was evaluated fig 5 shows the goodness of fit

considered here keesman et al 2011 found tree model εt lm and n 0 to be dominant while εc and k c were dominant for the crop model of these five parameters four are in the top five ranking carried out through the hirope procedure parameter n 0 is one of the lowest ranked parameters according to our analysis it should also be noted that the keesman et al 2011 oat analysis was carried out on data for monocultures of trees and crops rather than trees and crops grown together in a multistrata planting which may account for the difference in results figs 6 and7 show graphically the λi values for the top eight ranked parameters selected by the previous analysis of θ1 4 conclusions reduced order parameter estimation based on the hessian of the cost function in this early investigation uses foundational systems theory straightforward mathematics and off the shelf simulation and optimization software and is by no means a state of the art implementation rather the research presented here is meant to illustrate the value of a priori investigation of parameter identifiability through a conceptual framework the potential of a systematic reproducible approach to determining the importance of parameters in a complex model illuminates an area of model development that can otherwise be shrouded in guesswork and trial and error although the oat analysis by the yield safe modelers led to somewhat similar ranking of the most important parameters keesman et al 2011 the hirope procedure gives a higher confidence in the ranking as it accounts for the effects of simultaneous changes in multiple parameters while also adding confirmation of consistent identifiability initial tests of the hirope procedure on the yield safe model described here gave a consistent parameter ranking in the neighborhood of a nominal setting for the 12 parameter non water limiting tree crop combination model additional investigation is needed to test the procedure on more complex implementations of yield safe with other connecting submodels included and with other plant growth models before any definitive conclusions can be made about the applicability of hirope further refinement of the procedure will be needed additionally the definition of the ranking metric λ proposed here proved to be an effective measure for relative parameter influence on the cost function however this formulation deserves further study especially as the number of parameters increases also as the number of model parameters increases the hessian computational demand increases quadratically an iterative or successive method of reducing the number of parameters for the analysis such as suggested by cox et al 2006 may be considered the procedure proposed here is only a small part of model development although it does involve a considerable amount of work real data are required to validate model predictions and give a model credibility even more important one should confirm which output measurements are needed for model parameterization before undertaking field study analysis of consistent identifiability such as that included in hirope may suggest which output measurements are

24898,we begin with a mechanistic model that is considered to be a reasonably good predictor of the real life system with a set of parameters determined from prior biophysical studies and expert knowledge for complex mechanistic growth models it is usually advantageous to numerically estimate a subset of the most important parameters i e those that most influence dynamic model behavior based on data and fix the others at their estimated a priori values determining a reduced order parameter subset for end user estimation can be challenging often relying heavily on expert knowledge and trial and error a straightforward but oversimplified method relies on one at a time oat sensitivity of model outputs to changes in individual parameters however this commonly used method fails to account for how simultaneous changes in multiple parameters can significantly impact model outputs in unpredictable ways due to model nonlinearities additionally hidden relationships between parameters can prevent consistent identifiability of parameters from different initial estimates rather than analyzing the effect of individual parameter variation on the model outputs we evaluate the importance of parameters to the curvature of the quadratic cost function sum squared difference between reference and model output sequences this analysis is carried out by calculating the matrix of second order partial derivatives of the cost function aka hessian matrix with respect to the model parameters calculating the cost function hessian allows analysis of changes in multiple parameters simultaneously the method is presented as an analytic reproducible procedure for determining a ranking for parameter importance the procedure is demonstrated on a limited version of the yield safe predictive agroforestry growth model for the analysis 12 model parameters are considered with their nominal values set to those given in a published implementation of yield safe the hessian was calculated at 212 4096 locations systematically selected in the neighborhood of the nominal parameter setting each generating a parameter ranking determined by the relative contribution of each parameter to the cost function curvature the top ranked 6 parameters were the same for 4091 of 4096 locations suggesting that this procedure has potential to guide modelers in recommending the most important parameters for estimation given reasonably good initial parameter estimates and real data keywords predictive modeling agroforestry system identification consistent identifiability parameter space reduction 1 introduction an increasing number of tree growth models are very complicated weiskittel et al 2011 pretzsch et al 2015 when modeling intraspecific interactions between trees or trees and crops grown in close proximity e g in tree polycultures and agroforestry complexity can increase significantly beyond individual or monospecific tree growth models due to the interactions between species monteith et al 1991 van der werf et al 2007 in tree modeling as well as in biophysical modeling of natural processes in general model complexity can become problematic particularly when accurate prediction of outcomes is of primary importance ljung 1999 cox et al 2006 sivakumar 2008 for agroforestry and other crop growth modeling in general outcomes prediction has become particularly timely agroforestry is increasingly seen as an important means to regenerate degraded lands and address climate change challenges while producing economically viable crops verchot et al 2007 jose 2009 jat et al 2016 hillbrand et al 2017 toensmeier 2016 schoeneberger et al 2017 elevitch et al 2018 predictive modeling can extend existing knowledge into novel crop combinations in new environments and justify investment in agroforestry for both producers and policymakers malézieux et al 2009 problems encountered in model predictive accuracy include propagation of model error between interconnected model components uncertainty in parameter model constant values and inadequate data for parameterization and validation beck 1983 young and ratto 2009 when accurate prediction is of primary importance to the modeler reduction in the number of estimated parameters is desirable sjöberg et al 1995 gupta and sharma 2019 the number of parameters estimated can be reduced if variations in some parameters or combinations of parameters contribute little to the model output s the degree of contribution is a combination of richness of the frequencies in the inputs and parameter sensitivities of the model structure yao et al 2003 gutenkunst et al 2007 crout et al 2009 li and vu 2013 additionally the model structure including interactions between submodels can inadvertently render some parameters unidentifiable bellman and åström 1970 beck 1983 young 1983 hengl et al 2007 vilela et al 2009 in order to reduce complexity in predictive models many model reduction schemes have been developed in general model reduction methods approximate the most important dynamics of the system by considering the relationship between inputs and outputs schilders 2008 methods for reducing the complexity are well studied and straightforward for linear models less straightforward for linear approximations of nonlinear models and most challenging for reducing nonlinear models to simpler nonlinear models ljung 2010 mechanistic models are usually in the latter category engendering a range of model reduction approaches model reduction techniques such as proper orthogonal decomposition pod project high dimensional data onto a lower dimensional space to derive low dimension models that capture most of the dynamics of the full model hinze and volkwein 2005 kerschen et al 2005 schilders 2008 although pod can be applied to nonlinear models it yields an approximating linear manifold which may be considered a serious limitation in its application to nonlinear models kerschen et al 2005 also based upon analysis of dynamic modes young and ratto 2009 present a seven phase strategy for reducing the complexity of mechanistic models termed data based mechanistic dbm modeling after implementing a computational version of the model the process begins with stochastic analysis using monte carlo simulations to determine the relative importance of different submodels in explaining the dominant model behavior from this step a process called dominant mode analysis is performed over a user defined parameter range to determine a low order approximation of the original model this process generates a mapping of the unreduced model to a reduced order model called the dynamic emulation model dem that can replace the full model over a range of parameter values young 2011 all of the analysis is done in the absence of experimental data with the original model serving as a surrogate for the true system a disadvantage of this approach is the lack of a biophysical interpretation of the resulting dem model recognizing that many process based models are overparameterised and may have poor predictive performance cox et al 2006 followed by crout et al 2009 and others approach model reduction by setting signals in the model to fixed nominal values and evaluating how well each model version performs the signals considered are chosen by the modeler but generally have a mechanistic interpretation an exhaustive search of all possible combinations of signal replacements with constant values are assessed in order to determine which model dynamics may be excluded from the model without significantly degrading performance according to crout et al 2009 the work of cox et al 2006 is distinct from the data based mechanistic modelling of young et al e g young 1998 1999 in that it operates directly on the formulation of the original model rather than synthesizing a simplified linearised stochastic model using data sets generated from the original process based model of these model reduction approaches the method presented here is most similar to that of cox et al 2006 and crout et al 2009 in that it preserves the mechanistic model structure however rather than considering signals within the model analysis is done with respect to input output behavior of the whole model where inputs are the measurable exogenous drivers of the mechanistic model and outputs are only those signals that we are interested in predicting accurately and which can be readily measured this approach may conflict with other modeling preferences such as maintaining the biophysical interpretation of internal model signals or parameter values in exchange for accurate prediction of outputs such input output analysis has been carried out in developing models for highly complex systems such as industrial processes and machines for the purpose of control since the 1970 s balakrishnan and peterka 1969 åström and eykhoff 1971 eykhoff 1981 in this field models may be described as black box which are composed of well understood mathematical expressions or grey box composed of mechanistic descriptions of the physical processes which are frequently nonlinear and not well understood mathematically ljung 1996 as for control systems where accurate prediction is essential accurate prediction may be the primary goals of the modeler for example accurate prediction of tree and crop growth has practical importance in developing and evaluating crop combinations management planning and risk assessment for agroecosystems with wide ranging potential benefits in mitigating risks associated with climate change malézieux et al 2009 in this framework submodel parameters are estimated using empirical data related to the whole system landsberg and sands 2011 such numerically estimated parameters are seen only as a means to adjust model fit and may lose their physical interpretation ljung 1999 others have also acknowledged a shift away from physically interpretable parameters in developing complex models valentine and mäkelä 2005 state in principle the values of parameters may be estimated by lower level process models alternatively the physiological and morphological parameters combine under reasonable assumptions into a set of aggregate parameters whose values can be estimated from inventory data with a statistical fitting procedure in other words the individual parameters may lose their physical interpretation through the fitting to empirical data but the suite of identified parameters combine into aggregate parameters that are used to more accurately model the overall system dynamics to summarize this system identification framework that underlies the approach taken here output prediction is of primary importance rather than the understanding of internal mechanisms signals within the model are no longer necessarily assumed to have physical interpretations biophysical parameter interpretations may no longer be valid given these relaxations from an input output predictive modelling perspective we use input output system analysis approaches to develop a procedure to rank parameters in terms of their importance to model output prediction additionally the procedure presented here includes tests for parameter identifiability in the reduced parameter set 2 approach the procedure presented here begins with a number of assumptions 1 the mechanistic predictive model of interest is trusted based on prior studies 2 there exists an nominal parameter setting that gives an acceptable fit to data even sparse data 3 the primary objective is accurate prediction of outputs 4 model developers wish to recommend a minimum number of model parameters for estimation to model users that will result in a good fit to measured data in other words we begin with a mechanistic model that we consider to be a good representation of the real system whose outputs we wish to predict and we have a parameter setting where the model is believed to perform well because of nonlinearities it is important to note that the analysis is only valid for the neighborhood of a specific parameter setting as parameter importance to the output may change across the feasible range of parameter values 2 1 model class hessian and goodness of fit the procedure presented here was developed for application to mechanistic models constructed from deterministic descriptions submodels characterizing the underlying growth dynamics considered by the modeler to be of importance such as interception and conversion of solar energy biomass growth and transpiration buck sorlin 2013 each submodel is a well studied dynamic process with its own inputs and outputs described by a set of differential or difference equations submodel outputs are often inputs to other submodels buck sorlin 2013 and the same parameters may occur in multiple submodels cox et al 2006 mathematical representations for the dynamic processes within and between submodels are drawn from the extensive body of work in environmental physics e g campbell and norman 2012 monteith and unsworth 2013 quantitative agronomy e g vries and de 1989 villalobos and fereres 2016 and other fields we represent a model by 1 y n f u n θ where f is the mechanistic model y n is a vector of outputs u n is a vector of inputs θ is a vector of m parameters and n is time when the model parameters are set to a nominal setting accepted by modelers and determined by numerical estimation from data prior studies of component submodels and expert knowledge the parameter vector is denoted by θ 0 and the output denoted by y 0 n for the purposes of analysis we also introduce the identifier which is identical to the model in mathematical structure but with parameters set to a priori estimates θ j θ 0 denoted by 2 y j n f u n θ j as a reminder we are assuming that the model with nominal parameters θ 0 is a reasonably good predictor of reality according the modelers i e that we can take y 0 to be a surrogate for the real system a reference output sequence an approach taken by others e g young 2012 therefore the error between the reference model and the identifier at time n for the analysis is 3 r n y 0 n y j n leading to the average quadratic cost function over n steps from time n n 1 to time n 4 v n n 1 n i n n 1 n 1 2 r 2 i the matrix of second partial derivatives of v n n with respect to the model parameters is called the hessian under conditions of continuity of a function f the hessian can be determined analytically yielding an expression that can be calculated at any time n the hessian matrix of the second partial derivatives of a function f is of the form 5 h f 2 f x 1 2 2 f x 1 x 2 2 f x 1 x m 2 f x 2 x 1 2 f x 2 2 2 f x 2 x m 2 f x m x 1 2 f x m x 2 2 f x m 2 we are interested in the average hessian of 4 which contains information about how parameters affect the curvature of the cost function over n steps an m m matrix 6 h v n 1 2 n i 1 n 2 r 2 i x 1 2 2 r 2 i x 1 x 2 2 r 2 i x 1 x m 2 r 2 i x 2 x 1 2 r 2 i x 2 2 2 r 2 i x 2 x m 2 r 2 i x m x 1 2 r 2 i x m x 2 2 r 2 i x m 2 where the x k are the individual parameters the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of h v n which are important in ranking parameter importance to the cost function curvature in the neighborhood of the nominal parameter setting are determined by the solution to 7 h x x d where d is the m m diagonal matrix of eigenvalues λ k and x is an m m matrix whose columns are the corresponding eigenvectors x k with the hessian calculated a method to order the importance of the parameters to the cost function curvature is needed in addition to the magnitude of the eigenvalues we are interested in the projections of the eigenvectors onto the parameter axes multiplied by their associated eigenvalues johnson 1988 based on this reasoning the measure for ranking the importance of parameters to the hessian curvature is assigned to be the 1 norm of the projections of the eigenvectors onto each parameter axis multiplied by their respective eigenvalues that is the combined magnitude of the eigenvector projections on the parameter axes for the ith parameter λi is defined as 8 λ i d x i t 1 λ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ m x i t 1 where x i is the ith column of the eigenvector matrix x finally the normalized root mean squared error nrmse goodness of fit measure will be used in the procedure below

comparison sequence and n is the number of data points the possible range of nrmse values is 100 perfect fit to the threshold nrmse value for an acceptable fit depends upon the context and ultimately user preferences a user may consider a 90 fit is good enough in a certain setting while another calls for a 99 fit as applied in the example of section 3 2 2 2 input class model inputs include

parameterization θ the model has identical outputs for any input and time to the model parameterized by θ ˆ if and only if θ θ ˆ walter 2012 one may begin characterizing the problem of determining identifiability by establishing the model class input class and a criterion for comparison åström and eykhoff 1971 identifiability has been well studied for linear systems ljung 1999 walter 2012 and classes of nonlinear systems e g vilela et al 2009 due to the complex nonlinear nature of many mechanistic models and frequently noisy data theoretical identifiability may be much less of a concern than practical identifiability the ability to uniquely identify parameters in practice walter 2012 for our purposes a model specific concept is introduced consistent identifiability we begin with the a priori parameters θ j and numerically estimate a subset of parameters χ j based upon input output data resulting in estimated parameters θ ˆ j χ j is consistently identifiable if numerical estimation with the same input output sequences yields θ ˆ j for any initialization in the neighborhood of θ j since it is not possible to test every point within a certain distance of θ j in practice one can vary each parameter in χ j plus minus a small percentage away from their θ j values and run the numerical estimation from those initializations 2 4 the hessian informed reduced order parameter estimation hirope procedure this procedure for determining a reduced order space for parameter estimation is based upon analytic evaluation of the average hessian of the quadratic cost function at an a priori parameter setting θ j in the neighborhood of an accepted nominal setting θ 0 the conceptual basis of the hirope procedure for a linear model and the simple 3 parameter logistic equation is presented in detail in elevitch 2018 chapter 2 2 4 1 model prerequisites application of the procedure has the following prerequisites a full deterministic process equations are defined b conditions on parameters are determined including mathematical and realism constraints this may be set by modelers e g all parameters are positive real or by model itself e g prohibiting output of negative biomass c if model input output equations are not twice continuously differentiable with respect to the parameters of interest acceptable differentiable analytic approximations are substituted d the general class of model inputs is known and ample input data at the model time step can be accessed e a parameter optimization algorithm is implemented a list of symbols used in this analysis and associated notes for the example described in detail in section 3 for the yield safe model is given in table 1 2 4 2 steps of the hirope procedure the steps of the model reduction procedure are outlined here for a detailed description see elevitch 2018 chapter 2 the procedure is summarized graphically in fig 1 note that in this analysis we have nominal parameters θ 0 and the a priori estimates θ j are selected in the neighborhood of θ 0 for convenience here we assume that all elements of θ j are 5 away from θ 0 step 1 compare goodness of fit of y 0 with the estimated output y j for inputs u i compare output y 0 for a parameter set θ 0 with the output y j for the a priori θ j parameter set using the nrmse goodness of fit measure 9 if the fit meets the criterion move to step 6 validation step 2 compute hessian h i j and its eigenvectors and eigenvalues compute h i j for θ j using data sequences u i y 0 and y j from simulation of step 1 and determine its eigenvectors and eigenvalues step 3 generate λk parameter ranking from the computed h i j rank parameters using the formula 8 which leads to reduced order parameter sets χ j k step 4 confirm consistent identifiability beginning with highest ranked reduced order parameter set χ j 1 containing only one parameter optimize the parameter value from two nearby locations e g 5 from its a priori value with all other parameters in θ j fixed to their original estimated values to calculate a θ ˆ j step 5 check goodness of fit of y 0 and y ˆ j using the current θ ˆ j generate y ˆ j and calculate the nrmse value relative to y 0 if fit criterion nrmse 99 is met then move to the next step for validation if optimization on the first candidate parameter set does not meet the nrmse criterion then repeat step 4 for the next candidate parameter set and so on until either the fitting criterion is met for the optimization and validation inputs success or not failure of procedure in case of failure revise fit criterion or model step 6 validation validate the optimized parameter set using a number of different input sequences from the same location and calculating their nrmse values if the validating input data also results in an acceptable nrmse value then the model optimization procedure is considered successful otherwise return to step 4 one may proceed to the next candidate parameter set if one wishes to see if there is improvement 3 results this section demonstrates the hirope procedure applied to the yield safe model van der werf et al 2007 the yield safe model may be the most widely used multistory agroforestry model designed for predictive purposes it was developed as a very parameter sparse yet process based model providing the best chance that robust parameter values can be identified van der werf et al 2007 despite yield safe s parsimoniousness it is recognized that only a subset of parameters can reasonably be estimated palma et al 2017 developed by the silvoarable agroforestry for europe safe project during the 2000 s the yield safe model estimates biomass yields of tree rows integrated with arable crops dupraz et al 2005 van der werf et al 2007 graves et al 2010 the model consists of mechanistic descriptions of tree and crop growth in a two story planting configuration driven by environmental inputs solar radiation temperature and precipitation i e it is an input output model that includes both plant growth and interactions between trees and crops recently yield safe was augmented with several new submodels including vapor pressure deficit input to predict transpiration modified water uptake and the effect of the trees on temperature and wind speed among others palma et al 2016 2018b as an initial case study the analysis below is based upon the original version of yield safe described in van der werf et al 2007 and implemented in microsoft excel burgess et al 2014 the analysis is expected to be extendable to the recently introduced more complex versions of yield safe as well as other process based models that meet the procedure criteria the yield safe model is described in detail in van der werf et al 2007 the model includes seven state eq 1 tree biomass 2 tree leaf area 3 number of shoots per tree 4 crop biomass 5 crop leaf area index 6 soil water content and 7 heat sum the model runs on a daily time step and is driven by exogenous inputs of solar radiation temperature and precipitation for the purposes of the present analysis water and soil nutrients will be considered sufficient and non limiting to potential growth which is consistent with the initial parameter calibration assuming non drought stress conditions undertaken by the yield safe team van der werf et al 2007 keesman et al 2011 palma et al 2017 this type of simplification often applied to crop growth model analsis is based upon liebig s law of the minimum which states that plant growth is limited by the scarcest resource van ittersum and rabbinge 1997 van der ploeg et al 1999 the growth equations used here are based upon the excel implementation by burgess et al 2014 without management interventions such as tree thinning and pruning or the water and soil modules as previously mentioned see fig 2 for a graphical depiction of the tree crop combination model with tree parameters listed in table 2 and crop parameters in table 3 3 1 yield safe project s parameterization methods due to lack of input output data for two story agroforestry configurations the yield safe developers have parameterized their model based on yield tables other models such as stics see brisson et al 2003 and field data for monocultures single species plantings of the tree and crop species of interest van der werf et al 2007 described how parameters are determined through a two step process 1 curve fitting to accepted yield tables for tree monocultures and accepted model yields for arable crop monocultures using least squares optimization and manual adjustments 2 fine tuning of certain parameters for a specific site based upon monoculture growth data in later publications regarding yield safe parameterization no specific reproducible methods for parameter estimation are given keesman et al 2011 palma et al 2017 a reproducible procedure is presented here for determining a lower dimensional subspace for parameter estimation that may benefit model users who would like to parameterize the model for new crops and environments 3 2 inputs and validation in order to acquire the needed input data the yield safe developers draw on simulated climate data to drive their model and have developed the web portal clipick climate change web picker http home isa utl pt joaopalma projects agforward clipick to access climate data generated by a number of climate modeling projects palma 2015 2017 palma et al 2018a the data sets available through clipick include a number of future climate scenarios as well as climate data simulated based upon historical measurements of atmospheric aerosols van meijgaard et al 2012 as palma et al 2017 state there are indications that the simulated climate can be used for calibration purposes with minor loss of quality in comparison to real data the basis for using historical data to simulate climate data is documented in lamarque et al 2011 various data sequences extracted from a historical climate scenario were used for the optimization and validation simulations conducted here table 4 typical input output sequences for a 20 year period are depicted in fig 3 3 3 yield safe model implementation and parameter estimation the tree and crop combination growth model was implemented in the matlab system identification toolbox to take advantage of advanced optimization routines and the ability to easily run multiple simulations nominal parameters θ 0 for poplar and annual grass tables 2 and 3 and input u1 1 table 4 model object defined the model equations and the nlgreyest parameter estimation function was used with the default optimization settings the default optimization algorithm used is the trust region reflective newton method for nonlinear least squares ljung 2018 the analytic hessian was derived from the cost function expression see elevitch 2018 for full details a twice continuously differentiable symbolic expression for the cost was first coded in matlab using approximations for discontinuous functions in the growth equations where necessary the hessians of the symbolic cost function expressions for a certain time step were then derived using matlab s hessian function with respect to the parameters of interest the eigenstructure of the calculated hessian for the nonlinear models was determined using the eig function 3 4 hirope applied to yield safe combination model application of the hirope procedure to the separate tree and crop models is presented in detail in elevitch 2018 chapter 3 here we present the main results for the combined tree and crop model in the non water limited case for the example presented here the a priori parameter values θ 1 are set 5 away from their nominal values table 5 3 4 1 step 1 compare goodness of fit of y 0 with the estimated output y 1 for this 2 output model each output is compared with the reference the goodness of fit measures are well below the cut off of 99 fig 4 3 4 2 step 2 compute h i j and its eigenvectors and eigenvalues parameter scaling was employed prior to differentiation and the analytic hessian with respect to the 12 parameters of interest was derived using matlab s hessian function the average hessian calculated for n 5475 15 years was calculated with its eigenvalues and eigenvectors given in table 6 3 4 3 step 3 generate λ parameter ranking based on table 6 and eq 8 the λ values and associated parameter ranking for θ 1 setting are shown in table 7 this leads to a set of candidate parameter vectors χ 1 k for estimation table 8 3 4 4 step 5 check goodness of fit of y 0 and y ˆ 1 to compress the procedure steps for presentation here the optimization algorithm was run from θ 1 for the first seven χ 1 k and the model fit for each was evaluated fig 5 shows the goodness of fit measure nrmse for the first seven χ 1 k both outputs meet the 99 fit criterion for χ1 5 χ1 7 since the reduced order set χ1 7 gives a bigger margin above 99 we proceed with this optimized parameter set 3 4 5 step 4 confirm consistent identifiability χ 1 7 has seven estimated parameters therefore consistent identifiability is tested from 27 or 128 a priori 5 variations of the θ 1 parameter values all estimates converge to the same location θ ˆ ˆ 1 within 0 00464 as shown in table 9 this confirms consistent identifiability for χ 1 7 3 4 6 step 6 validation validation of θ ˆ ˆ 1 with other four other inputs from the test location was successful table 10 3 4 7 comprehensive ranking all 4096 θj to systematically extend the analysis to the space around θ 1 λ k are calculated for all 212 4096 combinations of a priori parameters set at 5 of their nominal values table 11 shows the parameter rankings across all parameter sets the top six parameters are the same for 4091 of 4096 θ j with kc and bt 0 switching places 5 times suggesting robustness of parameter choice for the highest ranking parameters the rankings of the next five lower ranked parameters are mixed the lowest ranked parameter is the same for all θ j it is interesting to note that oat parameter sensitivity analysis carried out by the yield safe modelers led to somewhat different results of the 12 model parameters considered here keesman et al 2011 found tree model εt lm and n 0 to be dominant while εc and k c were dominant for the crop model of these five parameters four are in the top five ranking carried out through the hirope procedure parameter n 0 is one of the lowest ranked parameters according to our analysis it should also be noted that the keesman et al 2011 oat analysis was carried out on data for monocultures of trees and crops rather than trees and crops grown together in a multistrata planting which may account for the difference in results figs 6 and7 show graphically the λi values for the top eight ranked parameters selected by the previous analysis of θ1 4 conclusions reduced order parameter estimation based on the hessian of the cost function in this early investigation uses foundational systems theory straightforward mathematics and off the shelf simulation and optimization software and is by no means a state of the art implementation rather the research presented here is meant to illustrate the value of a priori investigation of parameter identifiability through a conceptual framework the potential of a systematic reproducible approach to determining the importance of parameters in a complex model illuminates an area of model development that can otherwise be shrouded in guesswork and trial and error although the oat analysis by the yield safe modelers led to somewhat similar ranking of the most important parameters keesman et al 2011 the hirope procedure gives a higher confidence in the ranking as it accounts for the effects of simultaneous changes in multiple parameters while also adding confirmation of consistent identifiability initial tests of the hirope procedure on the yield safe model described here gave a consistent parameter ranking in the neighborhood of a nominal setting for the 12 parameter non water limiting tree crop combination model additional investigation is needed to test the procedure on more complex implementations of yield safe with other connecting submodels included and with other plant growth models before any definitive conclusions can be made about the applicability of hirope further refinement of the procedure will be needed additionally the definition of the ranking metric λ proposed here proved to be an effective measure for relative parameter influence on the cost function however this formulation deserves further study especially as the number of parameters increases also as the number of model parameters increases the hessian computational demand increases quadratically an iterative or successive method of reducing the number of parameters for the analysis such as suggested by cox et al 2006 may be considered the procedure proposed here is only a small part of model development although it does involve a considerable amount of work real data are required to validate model predictions and give a model credibility even more important one should confirm which output measurements are needed for model parameterization before undertaking field study analysis of consistent identifiability such as that included in hirope may suggest which output measurements are

calculated assuming an exponential light extinction coefficient a general approach to this model is presented as follows 1 δ g r int ε min f t f f f n f v p d f w where δ g is the daily growth r int the daily intercepted solar radiation ε the radiation use efficiency g mj 1 of global solar radiation and f t f f f n f v p d and f w growth modifiers to account for the effects of air temperature frost nitrogen vapour pressure deficit and water supply respectively the apsim next generation eucalyptus model includes five submodels related to different plant components leaf branch stem coarse root and fine root potential biomass production is modelled by the leaf submodel biomass is partitioned to the different organs according to tree size environmental stresses and genotype specific parametrizations leaf area growth is calculated from leaf growth and a specific leaf area similarly root length is calculated from specific root length different soil layers are considered to describe the vertical distribution of various soil processes available water of each layer depends on the progress of the extraction front to greater depths the potential water uptake is calculated using the product of the available water in the layer and a factor that controls the rate of absorption kl when plant water absorption is lower than the plant demand reductions in growth rate are considered by water deficit full model documentation is available at https www apsim info apsim next generation platform also includes graphs and statistics that show the model performance against the observed data holzworth et al 2018 2 3 weather and soil data the weather data maximum minimum and mean air temperatures solar radiation rainfall relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from the weather stations located in the experimental areas of each forestry company member of the techs project and when data were not available we obtained them from the nearest weather stations belonging to the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet the missing data was filled from the nearest weather stations of the brazilian national water agency ana and from daily gridded meteorological data funk et al 2015 stackhouse et al 2015 xavier et al 2016 the first soil order was reported by pedologists of each forestry company the soil profile required in the apsim model was built based on i pedotransfer functions fitted for brazilian soils assad et al 2001 reichert et al 2009 ii radam brasil 1974 and iii wise batjes 2009 databases pedotransfer functions were used to estimate the soil water content at the permanent wilting point tension of 1500 kpa field capacity tension of 10 kpa and then the soil water holding capacity input data required for these functions sand silt and clay contents were obtained by soil samples collected from each studied location where clay and sand contents were quantified by the densiometric method embrapa 1997 as site and genotype specific root depth information were not available an effective root depth of 3 m was considered according to the findings of christina et al 2017 and pinheiro et al 2019 2 4 model adaptation calibration and evaluation a number of functions were added into the apsim model using pmf as follows wood density and volume basal area frost modifiers and light extinction coefficient modifiers the documentation of the new functions added in the apsim next generation eucalyptus model is presented in the supplementary material section s1 the model calibration was performed based on field data stem biomass stem volume basal area lai biomass partitioning and soil water holding capacity and by data and parametrization already described in the literature most of the parameters were manually changed within a realistic range until a suitable fit was obtained between the estimated and observed values elli et al 2019a the parameters calibrated for all clones are presented in the supplementary material tables s2 and s3 these parameters were chosen due to their ability of predicting eucalyptus genotypes differences elli et al 2019a mattos 2015 valadares 2018 to analyze the model performance the following statistical indexes and errors were considered coefficient of determination r2 which describes the precision of predictions willmott agreement index d willmott et al 1985 which provides the accuracy of predictions modelling efficiency index e nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured variance confidence index c camargo and sentelhas 1997 which describes both precision and accuracy mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse which provide the overall magnitude of the errors and mean error me which indicates the bias in the predictions the relationships between the final stem biomass increment sbi t ha 1 yr 1 and environmental variables annual rainfall and climate moisture index cmi were evaluated this was performed for both observed and estimated sbi values then the slopes obtained from these relationships observed sbi x environmental variables and estimated sbi x environmental variables were compared for each eucalyptus clone to verify if the model captured the key growth responses to climate and genetics the cmi willmott and feddema 1992 was calculated as follows when annual rainfall rain annual reference evapotranspiration ret cmi rain ret 1 when rain ret cmi 1 ret rain positive values of cmi represent wetter climates while negative values represent drier climates willmott and feddema 1992 3 results 3 1 ability of the apsim next generation eucalyptus model to simulate environmental effects the apsim model performed well in simulating stem biomass across contrasting environmental conditions for different clones fig 1 the r2 ranged from 0 76 to 0 93 among the different clones the d index ranged from 0 93 to 0 98 the e index ranged from 0 75 to 0 93 whereas the rmse ranged from 8 2 to 15 4 t ha 1 errors in predictions were higher for the clone c3 as data from different ages were used to evaluate the model performance small panels with the final stem biomass increment sbi were plotted to assess environmental differences on final productivity from this a huge variation of stem biomass was observed across the contrasting environments small panels in fig 1 furthermore the apsim model performed well in simulating the eucalyptus stem volume and basal area figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material the r2 ranged from 0 77 to 0 94 among different clones for stem volume and from 0 69 to 0 92 for basal area the d index ranged from 0 94 to 0 99 and from 0 90 to 0 98 while the rmse ranged from 21 51 to 35 9 m3 ha 1 and from 2 09 to 4 15 m2 ha 1 in the same sequence in most cases the model presented overestimations of the basal area at the beginning of the eucalyptus rotation but after initial growth stage usually from 12 months of age this growth variable was predicted more accurately satisfactory results were also found when modelling the biomass partitioning of different eucalyptus clones fig s8 in the supplementary material 3 2 spatial overview of model performance uncertainties and limitations the apsim eucalyptus model performed well in simulating stem biomass production from different clones for each location but with huge variations among the locations fig 2 the e index ranged from 0 02 to 0 99 the r2 ranged from 0 82 to 0 98 the root mean square error rmse ranged from 4 04 to 14 08 t ha 1 and the mean error me ranged from 12 56 to 13 58 t ha 1 no regional trends were found for e r2 and rmse lesser values of e index 0 5 were found at locations 03 and 08 dry environments and 18 an environment with low temperatures occurrence of frosts and poorly drained soil no large differences in r2 were found among the locations with the values satisfactory at all locations the rmse was higher 10 t ha 1 at locations 03 mg 10 and 24 sp and 18 rs the me tended to be negative in the states of santa catarina paraná and são paulo 3 3 differences in responsiveness of the clones to environmental conditions apsim eucalyptus model was able to identify growth trends from different clones according to environmental variations fig 3 clones varied in responsiveness to environmental conditions for instance clones a1 and q8 presented lower slopes 0 008 from the relationship between sbi and annual rainfall for both observed and estimated values on the other hand the slope for clone b2 was higher for both observed 0 019 and estimated 0 015 values compared to the other clones some limitations for modelling sbi of clones with higher slope i e higher sensitivity to annual rainfall and climate moisture index were found 3 4 eucalyptus traits throughout its rotation apsim eucalyptus model was able to simulate the stem biomass across highly contrasting environments and could identify yield differences between the clones fig 4 for instance considering the eucalyptus stem biomass between 3 5 and 4 years of age in the wet location 22 for clone b2 the observed stem biomass sbobs was 111 4 t ha 1 and the estimated stem biomass sbest was 113 1 t ha 1 while for clone r9 the sbobs was 43 4 t ha 1 and the sbest was 59 2 t ha 1 in the dry location 26 for clone q8 the sbobs was 25 1 t ha 1 and the sbest was 27 7 t ha 1 while for clone a1 the sbobs was 41 2 t ha 1 and the sbest was 38 7 t ha 1 finally in the southeast location 33 for clone b2 the sbobs was 129 6 t ha 1 and the sbest was 115 5 t ha 1 while for clone r9 the sbobs was 87 8 t ha 1 and the sbest was 86 0 t ha 1 lower agreements between the observed and estimated stem biomass were observed in some cases as can be seen in the north location clone k2 and south location clone a1 reductions in observed and estimated biomass growth rate were observed in some specific seasons throughout the eucalyptus rotation generally in periods with severe soil water deficit in southeast northeast and north locations and during periods with lower temperatures and occurrence of frosts in south brazil inter annual and inter seasonal lai variations were observed with different responses according to the environment and clone fig 5 generally maximum lai was observed from 16 to 26 months of age apsim eucalyptus model performed reasonably well when estimating lai and was able to identify lai trends according to environmental variations such as soil water deficit and frost events environment differences were more pronounced than the genetic differences for both observed and estimated lai in a general way the wet location presented higher observed and estimated values of lai while the dry location presented the lower values 3 5 eucalyptus ecophysiological growth modifiers affecting modelled traits environmental effects were also identified by the changes in growth modifiers by the model for different locations fig 6 parameters that affect growth modifiers for soil water deficit fw and vapour pressure deficit fvpd were the same for all clones due to the lack of genotype specific information while those parameters that affect growth modifiers for temperature ft and frost frost were differentiated among clones tables s2 and s3 in the supplementary material the fw and ft were the ones that most impacted eucalyptus yield across locations within the present study the effects of rainfall seasonal variations on fw can be observed at the location 26 classified as dry and 19 in the north of the country locations in the south of brazil presented very low effects of soil water deficit on the other hand frost events affected the growth at some specific days in these locations locations 22 and 33 presented lower effects of frost events and relatively low effects of temperature and water deficit stresses resulting in the highest stemwood biomass production among those assessed in this study fig 6 4 discussion the statistical indexes and errors found in the present study fig 1 are in agreement with other studies involving process based eucalyptus models in brazil and around the world valadares 2018 used the apsim next generation eucalyptus model to simulate aboveground biomass from 9 locations in brazil and 3 locations in australia and found r2 0 91 and e index 0 89 elli et al 2019a assessed the performance of the apsim growth 3 pg and fao models and their multimodel ensemble for estimating eucalyptus stemwood volume under brazilian conditions and found r2 from 0 81 to 0 89 d index from 0 94 to 0 96 e index from 0 75 to 0 85 and c index from 0 85 to 0 90 during the model validation stape et al 2004a used the 3 pg model for simulating wood production of eucalyptus grandis x urophylla grown under different fertilization treatments in the state of são paulo brazil these authors obtained r2 from 0 71 to 0 83 e index from 0 61 to 0 75 and rmse from 5 6 to 7 6 mg ha 1 year 1 sands and landsberg 2002 found r2 0 71 for volume mai simulations from eucalyptus globulus plantations in australia battaglia et al 2004 evaluated the performance of cabala model in simulating eucalyptus volume in tasmania australia and found r2 0 94 and rmse 22 m3 ha 1 gonzález garcía et al 2016 observed r2 0 84 e index 0 79 and rmse 29 51 m3 ha 1 for stem volume estimations of eucalyptus nitens in spain from the individual analysis of each location lesser e indexes were found at locations 03 08 and 18 fig 2 sites 03 and 08 are dry environments especially site 8 where the accumulated annual rainfall was 696 mm year 1 table 1 one possible limitation in the present study is the lack of detailed soil data for building apsim soil profile pedotransfer functions fitted for brazilian soils were used to estimate the soil water holding capacity according to specific characteristics sand clay and silt contents for each site in addition to radam brasil 1974 and wise batjes 2009 databases however soil characteristics may present high horizontal and vertical spatial variability motomiya et al 2011 siqueira et al 2015 besides that the lack of detailed information on the effective root depth for each clone may be a potential cause of uncertainty in such locations lesser e index at site 18 may be related to the occurrence of soil waterlogging during the rainy season since the apsim eucalyptus model does not consider the effects of such event during the simulations this can explain the apsim overestimations in such location fig 2 which is observed by the positive mean error 10 85 t ha 1 whereas in the other locations in south brazil apsim model slightly underestimated the stem biomass mean error from 7 5 to 0 t ha 1 heavy rainfall and poorly drained soils are the main causes of waterlogging events davison 2018 characteristics commonly observed at site 18 waterlogging events stress plants primarily by inhibiting the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen to the root zone and prolonged stress may cause the death of the root system permanent wilting of leaves defoliation and hypoxia constraining respiration basak et al 2015 clemens et al 1978 increases in both observed and estimated eucalyptus stem biomass were found with increasing annual rainfall and climate moisture index fig 3 with a varied responsiveness among clones effects of water supply on eucalyptus wood production have been reported by several studies in brazil and around the world christina et al 2018 hubbard et al 2010 minhas et al 2015 prior and bowman 2014 ryan et al 2010 stape et al 2010 our finds are in agreement with binkley et al 2017 who assessed 27 experimental locations in brazil and found an increase of stemwood production with increasing annual rainfall these authors found different responsiveness among clones to environmental variations across sites similarly gonçalves et al 2017 and scolforo et al 2019 found reductions in eucalyptus stem volume with increasing water deficit in the main regions of commercial eucalyptus plantations in brazil stape et al 2004b assessed eucalyptus traits from 14 locations in north eastern brazil and found the water light and nitrogen use efficiency increased with increasing annual rainfall significant improvement in the accuracy of stem biomass estimations mainly at the beginning of eucalyptus rotation fig 4 were obtained after changes to the light extinction coefficient function in the model growth rate overestimations at initial stages are commonly found in forest modelling studies almeida et al 2004 battaglia et al 2004 miehle et al 2009 the frost functions added into the model reduced uncertainties of simulations in southern brazil two frost functions were added in the model i the photosynthesis modifier for frost ffrost and ii senescence rate for frost ssrf the current version of the model considers the damages vary according to frost intensity age of eucalyptus plantation and genetic material since specific calibrations for each clone were performed alvares et al 2018 modelled monthly frost days in center southern brazil based on minimum air temperature they found the highlands of santa catarina rio grande do sul são paulo and minas gerais states presented on average more than 13 frosts per year thus modelling frost effects on eucalyptus yield may be of high importance for helping foresters in estimating yield more accurately in such regions the observed and estimated lai variation throughout the eucalyptus rotation was justified by the weather seasonality fig 5 lai decreases occurred mostly after periods of water deficit which helps to understand the inter seasonal variability of eucalyptus growth rate in the wet location inter seasonal lai variations were less evident due to the rainfall relatively well distributed along the year our results are in agreement with lemos 2012 who used the 3 pg model on clonal eucalyptus plantations in são paulo state brazil and observed a maximum lai at 18 months of age and seasonal oscillations according to weather conditions over the year hakamada et al 2016 found higher lai at 24 months of age in eucalyptus plantations in the states of bahia and são paulo brazil the growth modifiers of the apsim eucalyptus model varied among locations and over the eucalyptus rotation fig 6 this demonstrates the model was able to simulate effects of both spatial and temporal climate variability on eucalyptus growth this is an important result since long term simulations for assessing effects of weather variability on eucalyptus yield may be a valuable decision support tool in the pursuit of appropriate forest planning and management elli et al 2017a 2017b besides that corbeels et al 2018 and cooper et al 2008 highlight that an efficient way to address climate change impacts may be to focus on strategies for coping with climate variability rather than relying on long term climate change predictions using modelling to identify genotype differences is a big challenge since literature information and field data are still scarce some progresses have been made in this study with the proposed adaptations and a robust calibration of the apsim next generation eucalyptus model for different genotypes model evaluation was performed against data of stem biomass stem volume basal area lai and biomass partitioning despite some uncertainties found during the simulations and considering the wide range of environments and genotypes evaluated apsim next generation eucalyptus model performed very well in simulating eucalyptus complex traits over the main brazilian producing area and was able to identify environmental and genetic effects using apsim next generation eucalyptus model for studying long term effects of climate variability and change on eucalyptus productivity is a promising future application of that for scientific and practical purposes 5 conclusions the apsim next generation eucalyptus model when properly adapted and calibrated was successful in simulating environmental and genetic effects on eucalyptus complex traits such as stem biomass and volume lai and basal area considering the major brazilian eucalyptus clones and the main brazilian producing area in this context apsim eucalyptus model may be a valuable decision support tool for helping foresters and companies in matching suitable genotypes to sites

to hydric thermal and biotic stresses techs from the forestry science and research institute ipef as not all the clones were planted at all locations further information on the number of observed field data for each clone used for evaluating apsim model can be seen in the supplementary material table s1 planting was performed from dec 2011 to jul 2012 varying according to the planting calendar for each location for a planned rotation length of six years for information on soil preparation and fertilization see elli et al 2019b the seedlings were planted in a single plot with eight lines of 15 trees at a spacing of 3 3 m 1111 trees ha 1 resulting in a total plot size of 1080 m2 as the first five trees in each row were used for destructive sampling throughout the experiment period a plot with eight rows of ten trees remained for measuring the diameter at breast height dbh at 1 3 m above ground level and total height h periodically the dbh and h were measured every 6 months march april and september october from the planting date to march april 2017 from these data stem biomass t ha 1 and volume m3 ha 1 were estimated by allometric equations fitted from a destructive analysis of six trees for each clone at location 33 in april 2014 while the basal area was calculated from the diameter at breast height leaf area index lai was estimated using a ceptometer device accupar lp 80 decagon devices usa in locations with contrasting environmental conditions following the same schedule of dbh and h measurements further information about the methodological procedures for fitting allometric equations and estimating lai can be found in mattos 2015 and elli et al 2019a 2 2 apsim next generation eucalyptus model the new apsim eucalyptus model takes into account the eucalyptus modelling structure of the apsim growth model huth et al 2001 but is implemented in the plant modelling framework pmf a software framework for creating models in apsim next generation brown et al 2014 daily biomass production is calculated from daily intercepted solar radiation and a radiation use efficiency rue which is affected by soil and climatic factors interception of solar radiation is calculated assuming an exponential light extinction coefficient a general approach to this model is presented as follows 1 δ g r int ε min f t f f f n f v p d f w where δ g is the daily growth r int the daily intercepted solar radiation ε the radiation use efficiency g mj 1 of global solar radiation and f t f f f n f v p d and f w growth modifiers to account for the effects of air temperature frost nitrogen vapour pressure deficit and water supply respectively the apsim next generation eucalyptus model includes five submodels related to different plant components leaf branch stem coarse root and fine root potential biomass production is modelled by the leaf submodel biomass is partitioned to the different organs according to tree size environmental stresses and genotype specific parametrizations leaf area growth is calculated from leaf growth and a specific leaf area similarly root length is calculated from specific root length different soil layers are considered to describe the vertical distribution of various soil processes available water of each layer depends on the progress of the extraction front to greater depths the potential water uptake is calculated using the product of the available water in the layer and a factor that controls the rate of absorption kl when plant water absorption is lower than the plant demand reductions in growth rate are considered by water deficit full model documentation is available at https www apsim info apsim next generation platform also includes graphs and statistics that show the model performance against the observed data holzworth et al 2018 2 3 weather and soil data the weather data maximum minimum and mean air temperatures solar radiation rainfall relative humidity and wind speed were obtained from the weather stations located in the experimental areas of each forestry company member of the techs project and when data were not available we obtained them from the nearest weather stations belonging to the brazilian national institute of meteorology inmet the missing data was filled from the nearest weather stations of the brazilian national water agency ana and from daily gridded meteorological data funk et al 2015 stackhouse et al 2015 xavier et al 2016 the first soil order was reported by pedologists of each forestry company the soil profile required in the apsim model was built based on i pedotransfer functions fitted for brazilian soils assad et al 2001 reichert et al 2009 ii radam brasil 1974 and iii wise batjes 2009 databases pedotransfer functions were used to estimate the soil water content at the permanent wilting point tension of 1500 kpa field capacity tension of 10 kpa and then the soil water holding capacity input data required for these functions sand silt and clay contents were obtained by soil samples collected from each studied location where clay and sand contents were quantified by the densiometric method embrapa 1997 as site and genotype specific root depth information were not available an effective root depth of 3 m was considered according to the findings of christina et al 2017 and pinheiro et al 2019 2 4 model adaptation calibration and evaluation a number of functions were added into the apsim model using pmf as follows wood density and volume basal area frost modifiers and light extinction coefficient modifiers the documentation of the new functions added in the apsim next generation eucalyptus model is presented in the supplementary material section s1 the model calibration was performed based on field data stem biomass stem volume basal area lai biomass partitioning and soil water holding capacity and by data and parametrization already described in the literature most of the parameters were manually changed within a realistic range until a suitable fit was obtained between the estimated and observed values elli et al 2019a the parameters calibrated for all clones are presented in the supplementary material tables s2 and s3 these parameters were chosen due to their ability of predicting eucalyptus genotypes differences elli et al 2019a mattos 2015 valadares 2018 to analyze the model performance the following statistical indexes and errors were considered coefficient of determination r2 which describes the precision of predictions willmott agreement index d willmott et al 1985 which provides the accuracy of predictions modelling efficiency index e nash and sutcliffe 1970 which indicates the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured variance confidence index c camargo and sentelhas 1997 which describes both precision and accuracy mean absolute error mae and root mean square error rmse which provide the overall magnitude of the errors and mean error me which indicates the bias in the predictions the relationships between the final stem biomass increment sbi t ha 1 yr 1 and environmental variables annual rainfall and climate moisture index cmi were evaluated this was performed for both observed and estimated sbi values then the slopes obtained from these relationships observed sbi x environmental variables and estimated sbi x environmental variables were compared for each eucalyptus clone to verify if the model captured the key growth responses to climate and genetics the cmi willmott and feddema 1992 was calculated as follows when annual rainfall rain annual reference evapotranspiration ret cmi rain ret 1 when rain ret cmi 1 ret rain positive values of cmi represent wetter climates while negative values represent drier climates willmott and feddema 1992 3 results 3 1 ability of the apsim next generation eucalyptus model to simulate environmental effects the apsim model performed well in simulating stem biomass across contrasting environmental conditions for different clones fig 1 the r2 ranged from 0 76 to 0 93 among the different clones the d index ranged from 0 93 to 0 98 the e index ranged from 0 75 to 0 93 whereas the rmse ranged from 8 2 to 15 4 t ha 1 errors in predictions were higher for the clone c3 as data from different ages were used to evaluate the model performance small panels with the final stem biomass increment sbi were plotted to assess environmental differences on final productivity from this a huge variation of stem biomass was observed across the contrasting environments small panels in fig 1 furthermore the apsim model performed well in simulating the eucalyptus stem volume and basal area figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material the r2 ranged from 0 77 to 0 94 among different clones for stem volume and from 0 69 to 0 92 for basal area the d index ranged from 0 94 to 0 99 and from 0 90 to 0 98 while the rmse ranged from 21 51 to 35 9 m3 ha 1 and from 2 09 to 4 15 m2 ha 1 in the same sequence in most cases the model presented overestimations of the basal area at the beginning of the eucalyptus rotation but after initial growth stage usually from 12 months of age this growth variable was predicted more accurately satisfactory results were also found when modelling the biomass partitioning of different eucalyptus clones fig s8 in the supplementary material 3 2 spatial overview of model performance uncertainties and limitations the apsim eucalyptus model performed well in simulating stem biomass production from different clones for each location but with huge variations among the locations fig 2 the e index ranged from 0 02 to 0 99 the r2 ranged from 0 82 to 0 98 the root mean square error rmse ranged from 4 04 to 14 08 t ha 1 and the mean error me ranged from 12 56 to 13 58 t ha 1 no regional trends were found for e r2 and rmse lesser values of e index 0 5 were found at locations 03 and 08 dry environments and 18 an environment with low temperatures occurrence of frosts and poorly drained soil no large differences in r2 were found among the locations with the values satisfactory at all locations the rmse was higher 10 t ha 1 at locations 03 mg 10 and 24 sp and 18 rs the me tended to be negative in the states of santa catarina paraná and são paulo 3 3 differences in responsiveness of the clones to environmental conditions apsim eucalyptus model was able to identify growth trends from different clones according to environmental variations fig 3 clones varied in responsiveness to environmental conditions for instance clones a1 and q8 presented lower slopes 0 008 from the relationship between sbi and annual rainfall for both observed and estimated values on the other hand the slope for clone b2 was higher for both observed 0 019 and estimated 0 015 values compared to the other clones some limitations for modelling sbi of clones with higher slope i e higher sensitivity to annual rainfall and climate moisture index were found 3 4 eucalyptus traits throughout its rotation apsim eucalyptus model was able to simulate the stem biomass across highly contrasting environments and could identify yield differences between the clones fig 4 for instance considering the eucalyptus stem biomass between 3 5 and 4 years of age in the wet location 22 for clone b2 the observed stem biomass sbobs was 111 4 t ha 1 and the estimated stem biomass sbest was 113 1 t ha 1 while for clone r9 the sbobs was 43 4 t ha 1 and the sbest was 59 2 t ha 1 in the dry location 26 for clone q8 the sbobs was 25 1 t ha 1 and the sbest was 27 7 t ha 1 while for clone a1 the sbobs was 41 2 t ha 1 and the sbest was 38 7 t ha 1 finally in the southeast location 33 for clone b2 the sbobs was 129 6 t ha 1 and the sbest was 115 5 t ha 1 while for clone r9 the sbobs was 87 8 t ha 1 and the sbest was 86 0 t ha 1 lower agreements between the observed and estimated stem biomass were observed in some cases as can be seen in the north location clone k2 and south location clone a1 reductions in observed and estimated biomass growth rate were observed in some specific seasons throughout the eucalyptus rotation generally in periods with severe soil water deficit in southeast northeast and north locations and during periods with lower temperatures and occurrence of frosts in south brazil inter annual and inter seasonal lai variations were observed with different responses according to the environment and clone fig 5 generally maximum lai was observed from 16 to 26 months of age apsim eucalyptus model performed reasonably well when estimating lai and was able to identify lai trends according to environmental variations such as soil water deficit and frost events environment differences were more pronounced than the genetic differences for both observed and estimated lai in a general way the wet location presented higher observed and estimated values of lai while the dry location presented the lower values 3 5 eucalyptus ecophysiological growth modifiers affecting modelled traits environmental effects were also identified by the changes in growth modifiers by the model for different locations fig 6 parameters that affect growth modifiers for soil water deficit fw and vapour pressure deficit fvpd were the same for all clones due to the lack of genotype specific information while those parameters that affect growth modifiers for temperature ft and frost frost were differentiated among clones tables s2 and s3 in the supplementary material the fw and ft were the ones that most impacted eucalyptus yield across locations within the present study the effects of rainfall seasonal variations on fw can be observed at the location 26 classified as dry and 19 in the north of the country locations in the south of brazil presented very low effects of soil water deficit on the other hand frost events affected the growth at some specific days in these locations locations 22 and 33 presented lower effects of frost events and relatively low effects of temperature and water deficit stresses resulting in the highest stemwood biomass production among those assessed in this study fig 6 4 discussion the statistical indexes and errors found in the present study fig 1 are in agreement with other studies involving process based eucalyptus models in brazil and around the world valadares 2018 used the apsim next generation eucalyptus model to simulate aboveground biomass from 9 locations in brazil and 3 locations in australia and found r2 0 91 and e index 0 89 elli et al 2019a assessed the performance of the apsim growth 3 pg and fao models and their multimodel ensemble for estimating eucalyptus stemwood volume under brazilian conditions and found r2 from 0 81 to 0 89 d index from 0 94 to 0 96 e index from 0 75 to 0 85 and c index from 0 85 to 0 90 during the model validation stape et al 2004a used the 3 pg model for simulating wood production of eucalyptus grandis x urophylla grown under different fertilization treatments in the state of são paulo brazil these authors obtained r2 from 0 71 to 0 83 e index from 0 61 to 0 75 and rmse from 5 6 to 7 6 mg ha 1 year 1 sands and landsberg 2002 found r2 0 71 for volume mai simulations from eucalyptus globulus plantations in australia battaglia et al 2004 evaluated the performance of cabala model in simulating eucalyptus volume in tasmania australia and found r2 0 94 and rmse 22 m3 ha 1 gonzález garcía et al 2016 observed r2 0 84 e index 0 79 and rmse 29 51 m3 ha 1 for stem volume estimations of eucalyptus nitens in spain from the individual analysis of each location lesser e indexes were found at locations 03 08 and 18 fig 2 sites 03 and 08 are dry environments especially site 8 where the accumulated annual rainfall was 696 mm year 1 table 1 one possible limitation in the present study is the lack of detailed soil data for building apsim soil profile pedotransfer functions fitted for brazilian soils were used to estimate the soil water holding capacity according to specific characteristics sand clay and silt contents for each site in addition to radam brasil 1974 and wise batjes 2009 databases however soil characteristics may present high horizontal and vertical spatial variability motomiya et al 2011 siqueira et al 2015 besides that the lack of detailed information on the effective root depth for each clone may be a potential cause of uncertainty in such locations lesser e index at site 18 may be related to the occurrence of soil waterlogging during the rainy season since the apsim eucalyptus model does not consider the effects of such event during the simulations this can explain the apsim overestimations in such location fig 2 which is observed by the positive mean error 10 85 t ha 1 whereas in the other locations in south brazil apsim model slightly underestimated the stem biomass mean error from 7 5 to 0 t ha 1 heavy rainfall and poorly drained soils are the main causes of waterlogging events davison 2018 characteristics commonly observed at site 18 waterlogging events stress plants primarily by inhibiting the diffusion of atmospheric oxygen to the root zone and prolonged stress may cause the death of the root system permanent wilting of leaves defoliation and hypoxia constraining respiration basak et al 2015 clemens et al 1978 increases in both observed and estimated eucalyptus stem biomass were found with increasing annual rainfall and climate moisture index fig 3 with a varied responsiveness among clones effects of water supply on eucalyptus wood production have been reported by several studies in brazil and around the world christina et al 2018 hubbard et al 2010 minhas et al 2015 prior and bowman 2014 ryan et al 2010 stape et al 2010 our finds are in agreement with binkley et al 2017 who assessed 27 experimental locations in brazil and found an increase of stemwood production with increasing annual rainfall these authors found different responsiveness among clones to environmental variations across sites similarly gonçalves et al 2017 and scolforo et al 2019 found reductions in eucalyptus stem volume with increasing water deficit in the main regions of commercial eucalyptus plantations in brazil stape et al 2004b assessed eucalyptus traits from 14 locations in north eastern brazil and found the water light and nitrogen use efficiency increased with increasing annual rainfall significant improvement in the accuracy of stem biomass estimations mainly at the beginning of eucalyptus rotation fig 4 were obtained after changes to the light extinction coefficient function in the model growth rate overestimations at initial stages are commonly found in forest modelling studies almeida et al 2004 battaglia et al 2004 miehle et al 2009 the frost functions added into the model reduced uncertainties of simulations in southern brazil two frost functions were added in the model i the photosynthesis modifier for frost ffrost and ii senescence rate for frost ssrf the current version of the model considers the damages vary according to frost intensity age of eucalyptus plantation and genetic material since specific calibrations for each clone were performed alvares et al 2018 modelled monthly frost days in center southern brazil based on minimum air temperature they found the highlands of santa catarina rio grande do sul são paulo and minas gerais states presented on average more than 13 frosts per year thus modelling frost effects on eucalyptus yield may be of high importance for helping foresters in estimating yield more accurately in such regions the observed and estimated lai variation throughout the eucalyptus rotation was justified by the weather seasonality fig 5 lai decreases occurred mostly after periods of water deficit which helps to understand the inter seasonal variability of eucalyptus growth rate in the wet location inter seasonal lai variations were less evident due to the rainfall relatively well distributed along the year our results are in agreement with lemos 2012 who used the 3 pg model on clonal eucalyptus plantations in são paulo state brazil and observed a maximum lai at 18 months of age and seasonal oscillations according to weather conditions over the year hakamada et al 2016 found higher lai at 24 months of age in eucalyptus plantations in the states of bahia and são paulo brazil the growth modifiers of the apsim eucalyptus model varied among locations and over the eucalyptus rotation fig 6 this demonstrates the model was able to simulate effects of both spatial and temporal climate variability on eucalyptus growth this is an important result since long term simulations for assessing effects of weather variability on eucalyptus yield may be a valuable decision support tool in the pursuit of appropriate forest planning and management elli et al 2017a 2017b besides that corbeels et al 2018 and cooper et al 2008 highlight that an efficient way to address climate change impacts may be to focus on strategies for coping with climate variability rather than relying on long term climate change predictions using modelling to identify genotype differences is a big challenge since literature information and field data are still scarce some progresses have been made in this study with the proposed adaptations and a robust calibration of the apsim next generation eucalyptus model for different genotypes model evaluation was performed against data of stem biomass stem volume basal area lai and biomass partitioning despite some uncertainties found during the simulations and considering the wide range of environments and genotypes evaluated apsim next generation eucalyptus model performed very well in simulating eucalyptus complex traits over the main brazilian producing area and was able to identify environmental and genetic effects using apsim next generation eucalyptus model for studying long term effects of climate variability and change on eucalyptus productivity is a promising future application of that for scientific and practical purposes 5 conclusions the apsim next generation eucalyptus model when properly adapted and calibrated was successful in simulating environmental and genetic effects on eucalyptus complex traits such as stem biomass and volume lai and basal area considering the major brazilian eucalyptus clones and the main brazilian producing area in this context apsim eucalyptus model may be a valuable decision support tool for helping foresters and companies in matching suitable genotypes to sites
