20155,traditional approaches to water resource engineering have sought to maintain a static optimized state of system performance in providing reliable water supplies energy and flood protection however delivery of these services has been associated with the disruption of freshwater ecosystem functioning driving global scale declines of biodiversity and the loss of ecosystem services climate change is presenting new challenges for water and ecosystem managers alike yet climate change is also creating new opportunities to consider ecological resilience in the design and management of water systems here we describe a set of climate informed ecological resilience principles and associated indicators which can support integration of ecosystem needs within water resource engineering decision making these have the potential to guide climate adaptive water resource management while also provisioning broad benefits to both people and ecosystems in a shifting operating environment keywords freshwater ecosystems ecological resilience ecological indicators water management climate change 1 introduction throughout the 20th century decisions regarding the design of water management systems have traditionally favored large dams and other forms of long lasting infrastructure generous public financing opportunities and economies of scale have promoted the development of large projects intended to maximize water supply reliability flood control and power generation benefits large water infrastructure is projected to have an equally prominent role in 21st century especially in developing economies 99 these investments are widely intended to expand developing economies and alleviate poverty yet climate change is raising new concerns about the performance of water infrastructure under novel and uncertain hydro climatic conditions scientists predict that the frequency and magnitude of extreme events will continue to grow including storms floods and droughts that fall outside observed historical climate variation for which water projects were designed 37 46 deep uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of climate change also raises the likelihood of climate infrastructure mismatches in which water projects are either over or under built 54 further the high cost and significant exposure to climate change greatly increase the risk of investments in large long lived infrastructure 16 awareness of the negative environmental consequences of water infrastructure has also grown construction of dams and ancillary water infrastructure projects has transformed freshwater ecosystems worldwide only a third of all rivers longer than 1000 km now flow freely to the ocean 29 and since 1900 it is estimated that over half of the world s wetlands have disappeared 19 in large part a result of flood control projects that have enabled the reclamation of floodplains for agricultural and other human uses the fragmentation of river networks from dams flow modification unsustainable water abstraction and the conversion of floodplains have collectively reduced the size simplified the physical structure and dampened the environmental variability characteristic of healthy freshwater ecosystems as a consequence water management activities are now recognized as a principal factor driving freshwater biodiversity declines and the loss of ecosystem services worldwide 22 at the same time climate change is expected to interact synergistically with water infrastructure further compounding stresses on freshwater ecosystems 78 as climate change amplifies risks to freshwater ecosystems and water infrastructure alike it is also forcing water managers to explore alternative approaches that are potentially more compatible with freshwater ecosystem needs 69 water resources engineers are seeking new design principles to improve infrastructure performance under an uncertain changing climate 13 84 there is also a growing appreciation of more holistic water infrastructure design approaches that incorporate flexibility 24 the precautionary principle 46 and no regrets strategies 32 such approaches may reduce environmental impacts or even have co benefits for the environment and traditional water sectors we are also witnessing the rapid growth in the number and size of investments in natural infrastructure and nature based solutions by international development banks and national governments 12 this trend is suggestive of an emerging water management paradigm that integrates the values and services of natural ecosystems and aims to simultaneously enhance both the ecological and engineering resilience of water management systems despite this potential water resource engineers and planners generally lack the specialized knowledge required to evaluate the consequences of alternative decisions on the resilience of affected freshwater ecosystems although much has been written on the relationship of ecological resilience to engineering resilience concepts 35 50 26 as well as general principles for quantifying 1 and enhancing ecological resilience 7 there is limited guidance on how to operationalize ecological resilience in water infrastructure design and system planning particularly within the context of a shifting climate building on previous efforts to advance environmentally sustainable water management e g 48 69 we propose that ecosystem resilience fundamentally relies on the maintenance of interacting dimensions of 1 temporal variability 2 spatially heterogeneity and 3 hydrologic connectivity further we recognize 4 the basin or watershed as the key scale of intervention for management actions that build ecological resilience and mitigate the impacts of other ecosystem stressors including flow modification pollution and invasive species 92 90 our understanding of ecological resilience is reflected in aldo leopold s observation that ecosystem health depends on its capacity for self renewal 49 and ability to withstand disturbance without losing its characteristic functions 34 which include the maintenance of habitat for constituent plant and animal species as well as the delivery of valued ecosystem services here we explain how these four principles relate to freshwater ecosystem resilience in the context of a changing climate and consider how they can be quantified and managed for as quantitative indicators by engineers financers and practitioners in design planning and decision frameworks these principles are not new to freshwater ecosystem managers and the relevance of temporal variability spatially heterogeneity hydrologic connectivity and basin scale approaches to ecosystem health and biodiversity conservation are well recognized in the literature e g 72 75 22 however these principles have largely been conceived as conservation strategies for preserving or restoring ecosystems to historical baseline oriented conditions the relationship of these principles to ecological resilience the capacity of ecosystems to collectively adjust and adapt to shifting and potentially novel environmental conditions while preserving desired functions species and services has not been fully explored we argue that these principles take on new meaning in an era of rapid environmental change in ways that may be underappreciated by ecologists and engineers furthermore we recognize that environmental needs remain poorly integrated in water management decision making with ecosystems often considered as isolated components e g species habitats and in post hoc assessments once design and or operational decisions have been finalized a synthesis of guiding principles and associated metrics for understanding how alternative water infrastructure decisions affect general ecological resilience could enable engineers and managers to more holistically evaluate the system level effects of management options early in the planning process our overall goal is to promote the integration of ecological resilience principles into water system planning design and operations to not only improve environmental outcomes but also to help sustain critical services for human populations and enhance the overall resilience of water management systems in an uncertain changing world 2 principles of ecological resilience for freshwater ecosystems 2 1 managing for temporal environmental variability a key principle for promoting ecological resilience is managing for temporal variability 72 freshwater ecosystems are inherently dynamic systems defined by variation in water quantity and quality and physical form the relationship between temporal environmental variability and ecosystem health is well recognized in traditional approaches to freshwater ecosystem management for riverine ecosystems this is expressed by the natural flow regime paradigm 70 which recognizes that predictable patterns of flow variability have a strong influence on aquatic and riparian species adaptations and that flow related disturbances such as floods and droughts exert a dominant control on ecosystem structure and function 52 similar ecological adaptations to the hydroperiod of standing waters have been documented in lakes and wetlands 94 hydrologic variability underpins ecological resilience by dynamically altering the distribution of habitats across drainage networks landscapes and seasons enhancing opportunities for some species while limiting opportunities for others and creating selective pressures that drive local species adaptations at contemporary and evolutionary timescales when environmental variation in lost the capacity of ecosystems to support biological diversity at genetic population and community levels is predicted to decline and with it the loss of adaptive capacity of the ecosystem as a whole to respond to novel environmental conditions such as are emerging under climate change 88 the alteration of natural flow variation in freshwater systems is a well documented consequence of water infrastructure development 71 and a primary driver of freshwater biodiversity loss throughout the world 23 68 modification of flow regimes from water infrastructure is also tightly coupled to changes in water quality for example the natural delivery of sediment is often reduced by upstream dams which can accelerate channel down cutting and floodplain disconnection downstream adversely affecting riparian vegetation and fish spawning habitat and limiting potential for habitat regeneration 42 similarly temperature regimes are a key yet often underappreciated component of environmental variation in freshwater ecosystems that are affected by flow alteration 66 85 for example flow releases from the hypolimnion of a reservoir are colder than would naturally occur whereas epilimnetic flow releases may be artificially warm 66 most freshwater species are sensitive to changes in temperature which directly influences metabolic rates physiology and behavioral characteristics temperature also controls important ecological processes including nutrient cycling productivity and respiration disruption to temperature regimes can lead to population declines of native species and changes in community assembly 66 and ultimately the loss of ecological resilience climate change interacts with human induced changes in both flow and water quality regimes causing an overall rise in water temperatures and driving regional shifts in runoff magnitude 58 and timing 33 and in some regions a growing frequency of precipitation extremes including drought and floods 86 it is also predicted that decreasing streamflow from climate change will shift some perennial streams to an intermittent flow state 39 with profound consequences for aquatic ecosystems to date strategies to restore and preserve variation in flow and water quality regimes have mostly been guided by the natural flow regime paradigm 70 and similar conceptual models e g 95 96 that rely on historical patterns to define management objectives these strategies include the re operation of dams to mimic natural flow variation downstream 45 the installation of variable depth intake devices in reservoirs to modulate the temperature of water releases below dams 79 and introduction of wood 96 and gravel 43 to stream channels to mitigate lost inputs of these materials from upstream and along river corridors given the high cost and persistent effort required artificially replenish wood and gravel proposed alternatives for sustaining natural inputs include the design of water infrastructure that allow for sediment passage 8 siting new infrastructure in locations upstream from major undammed tributaries is another strategy to maintain natural inputs of flow sediment and wood and to buffer the effects of hydromodification on mainstem rivers 43 it is increasingly recognized that strategies that go beyond the natural flow regime 73 are needed to enhance the resilience of freshwater ecosystems in a non stationary world climate impacts on precipitation especially changes in the timing form and intensity of extreme events are especially likely to alter temporal variability in flows and water quality which may be difficult to mitigate indeed attempts to maintain historical patterns of variability through management interventions may actually undermine ecological resilience 55 recently river ecosystem scientists have proposed a functional flow approach 98 which recommends that environmental water be strategically allocated to preserve specific functional elements of flow regimes that support biophysical processes upon which native species depend by focusing on management of ecosystem processes that sustain desired species and services rather than seeking to configure ecosystems in a static optimal state a functional flows approach also allows for flexibility in flow management to accommodate shifting conditions this stands in contrast to traditional approaches that generally define management objectives based on fidelity to historical patterns of biotic and abiotic conditions table 1 a multitude of indicators have been proposed that describe various dimensions of temporal environmental variability in freshwater ecosystems e g 24 66 95 and selecting a subset most relevant for evaluating ecological resilience in a specific decision context is a challenge previous studies e g 14 have used statistical methods to select metrics based on the strength of the relationship between physical parameters e g flow hydraulic and geomorphic variables and ecological responses e g habitat species abundance or community diversity however these relationships are often sensitive to data availability and may not be consistent across space and time making this approach problematic for selecting ecological resilience indicators in contrast others have used an approach informed by expert opinion and literature reviews in which indicators are selected based on known or hypothesized linkages to process based drivers of environmental variation for example to inform river management decisions in california usa yarnell et al 98 focused on flow components with documented relationships to key biophysical processes such as the spring snowmelt recession winter peak flows and summer baseflows similarly in an evaluation of management scenarios for the cache la poudre in colorado usa bestgen et al 6 selected hydrologic indicators for peak flows critical to substrate mobilization channel formation and riparian vegetation recruitment there are few examples in which metrics have explicitly defined in relation to ecological resilience principles one exception is a study by bouska et al 10 who identified a suite of resilience indicators for the upper mississippi river basin umrb usa they considered temporal variability in water quantity and quality as controlling variables and used variation in water surface elevations total suspended solids and nutrient concentrations to assess the ecological resilience of mulitple river reaches within the umrb 2 2 managing for spatial heterogeneity another important dimension of environmental variation for freshwater ecosystem resilience is spatial heterogeneity which relates to the diversity redundancy and spatial configuration of distinct biophysical elements including species biotic assemblages and habitats spatial variation in ecosystems is recognized to be hierarchical in which various processes interact to create and modify patterns of environmental heterogeneity at multiple scales 89 97 for example high flows in river channels transport and deposit large amounts of sediment to other parts of the river channel and floodplain influencing reach scale 100 1000 m habitat patterns but also interact with recruitment of large wood and debris from hillslopes to form scour pools and log jams that influence local 1 10 m habitat complexity this dynamically changing distribution of habitat patches supports a diversity of species which are able to take advantage of distinct shifting biophysical environments present in the landscape the presence of redundant but discontinuous habitat patches in the landscape enhances ecological resilience by buffering freshwater ecosystems from catastrophic change populations that persist in some locations i e refugia may subsequently recolonize those affected by a disturbance 82 the response diversity of organisms to distrubance coupled with habitat specializations contributes to the overall stability of biotic communities 1 environmental heterogeneity also contributes to the expression of biological diversity within populations i e phenotypic and genotypic variation such diversification of sub populations has been linked to asynchronous ecological dynamics that contribute to the stability of freshwater species populations 81 87 and potentially enhance the ability of species to adapt to changing climate conditions 88 anthropogenic water management activities tend to diminish spatial heterogeneity in freshwater ecosystems at local scales widespread modifications of lakes and rivers including shoreline embankments channelization removal of large woody debris and clearing of vegetation collectively reduce the structural complexity of aquatic and riparian habitats changes in hydrologic regimes is often the mechanism by which structural complexity is reduced for example the reduction in peak flows from large dams has been shown to reduce the frequency of riverbed sediment mobilization limit natural channel migration and disrupt the dynamics by which diverse riverine habitats are created and maintained 51 expressed at larger scales the simplification of physical habitat coupled with the homogenization of flow regimes 71 has been linked to population declines and loss of resilience in communities of native species 61 dams can also reduce landscape heterogeneity by restricting access of organisms to historic habitat potentially synchronizing subpopulations in ways that decrease resilience 60 for example thompson et al 88 demonstrated how human modifications to salmon bearing rivers of california have caused the rapid decline of life history diversity expression within chinook salmon and suggest the loss of genetic diversity could limit the ability of the species to cope with extreme environmental variation in the future strategies for managing for spatial heterogeneity in the context of water planning and decision making depend on the scale of the project under consideration traditional approaches to addressing spatial heterogeneity in freshwater ecosystem management have focused on identification and protection of water bodies or watersheds that support disproportionally high biodiveristy i e hotspots or critical habitat for threatened species although protected areas remain an essential strategy for addressing imminent risks to biodiversity designing and implementing protected area networks for freshwater ecosystems has proven difficult 62 furthermore protected areas are rarely designed with consideration of the potential changes in environmental conditions and associated shifts in species ranges associated with climate change resilience oriented approaches for managing spatial heterogeneity may still involve the prioritization of management interventions in specific water bodies or watersheds however management objectives will shift from the conservation of particular species and assemblages to the management of watershed networks that promote ecological resilience through the maintenance of life history diversity that buffers populations from environmental variability i e portfolio effects 81 table 1 for example carlson and satterthwaite 15 analyzed salmon population dynamics in california s central valley and recommended that one of the regions most degraded watersheds be restored to strengthen overall population stability rather than focusing exclusively on watersheds supporting the most abundant fish runs resilience oriented strategies also include interventions that protect or restore natural disturbance processes that create structural complexity in freshwater ecosystems such as floods siting or configuring water projects to avoid impacts to tributary streams is one approach for allowing natural river processes to maintain the natural delivery of flow sediment and wood downstream providing room for the river is another example in which human settlements and infrastructure are set back from the river channel giving the river sufficient space to move erode banks and flood and thereby perform hydrologic water quality and habitat functions 44 these types of passive management interventions designed to enhance environmental heterogeneity may also confer substantial benefits to people through reduced flood risk and costs 44 the spatial heterogeneity of freshwater ecosystems can be quantified at multiple scales as with the selection of metrics that relate to temporal variability resilience indicators related to environmental heterogeneity should be based on known or hypothesized linkages with biophysical processes within the system of interest for example bouska et al 10 identified several resilience indicators corresponding to the spatial heterogeneity of the upper mississippi river system these included metrics related to aquatic habitat diversity and redundancy as well as floodplain inundation diversity at small to moderate spatial scales 1 1000 m heterogeneity can be measured by indicators of structural complexity such as variation in river channel morphology bedforms and substrate 65 and shoreline complexity 40 as well as by indicators of biological complexity such as the diversity and distribution of distinct habitat types present 80 at larger spatial scales 1 1000 km heterogeneity can be assessed by the diversity and spatial configuration of distinct landscape features defined by geology vegetation hydro climate and other biophysical characteristics using readily available geospatial tools e g fragstats 56 however for these and other descriptors of spatial patterning indicators representative of conditions at a single point in time will be less meaningful assess for assessing ecological resilience than if state changes are tracked over time 2 3 managing for hydrologic connectivity freshwater ecosystems are characterized by the dynamic movement and exchange of water across components of the hydrologic cycle and at interfaces with adjacent terrestrial systems transfers of matter energy and organisms resulting from these processes herein referred to as hydrologic connectivity are a fundamental control on freshwater ecosystem functions and integrity 75 freshwater ecologists have identified four relevant dimensions of hydrologic connectivity longitudinal upstream downstream linkages between habitats lateral connectivity between a river channel or lake and adjacent floodplains and riparian areas vertical connectivity with the hyporheic zone groundwater and the atmosphere and temporal seasonal interactions among the three spatial dimensions 93 connectivity of heterogeneous habitat types contributes to resilience by sustaining a diverse pool of species that use a variety of habitats for feeding reproduction resting rearing refuge and migrating 91 connectivity also enhances resilience by allowing biota to recolonize disturbed areas or replenish depleted populations and in the context of climate change is essential for facilitating range shifts of organisms to areas of remaining suitable habitat water infrastructure projects affect multiple dimensions of hydrologic connectivity dams interrupt the longitudinal connectivity of river networks directly as physical barriers or indirectly by reducing flows and drying channels downstream thereby impeding or eliminating the movement and dispersion of sediment nutrients and organisms lateral connectivity between aquatic ecosystems and adjacent floodplains and riparian areas are also disrupted by physical structures such as dikes and levees flow alteration can further reduce lateral connectivity especially from the loss of high flows from upstream dams or diversions that alter the frequency duration and timing of floodplain inundation along rivers or lakeshores climate induced shifts in flow regimes may act synergistically with water infrastructure to intensify interruptions to connectivity for example the combination of dam development and increasing drought risk threatens the tonle sap in cambodia the largest wetland ecosystem in the mekong river basin known to support one of the worlds largest freshwater fisheries that feeds millions of people 2 groundwater pumping from aquifers can alter the timing and direction of groundwater surface water interactions with rivers and lakes directly affecting vertical hydrologic connectivity but potentially reducing longitudinal and lateral connectivity through declining surface water flow and elevations 20 the loss of geomorphic complexity from channelization levee construction and wood removal also reduces hyporheic exchange in river channels which can negatively affect nutrient processing and habitat quality for a variety of freshwater species while human activities tend to reduce connectivity in some cases connectivity may be artificially enhanced via inter basin transfers canals elevated flows potentially altering water quality conditions and creating pathways for non native species invasions 76 connectivity has long been a focus of traditional ecosystem management approaches the removal or modification of dams and other barriers has been a primary strategy for restoring connectivity within river networks 25 dam reoperation experiments involving pulse flow releases have also effectively reconnected downstream habitats 41 lateral connectivity has been enhanced through managed flood flow release and by removing or setting back artificial channel constraints such as levees 67 while these strategies for restoring or enhancing connectivity likely promote ecological resilience their potential benefits are dependent on the spatial and temporal dimensions of connectivity and dynamics of transferred matter previous studies have attempted to quantify the temporal patterns of hydrologic connectivity in stream networks e g 5 but more research is needed to understand how fluxes of water nutrients and organisms within and between freshwater and terrestrial systems contribute to resilience table 1 several indicators have been developed to describe the ecologically relevant dimensions of hydrologic connectivity in freshwater ecosystems human influence on longitudinal connectivity have typically been evaluated by river network fragmentation indices e g 18 changes in lateral connectivity in river and wetland ecosystems have been assessed by indices that describe the spatial configuration of connected hydrologic units 47 recently grill et al 29 proposed an integrated connectivity status index that incorporates all four dimensions of hydrologic connectivity for assessing alteration to free flowing rivers connectivity metrics have also been applied in studies aimed at explicitly enhancing the resilience of river ecosystems including the prioritization of barrier removal to restore ecosystem functions 11 and evaluation of connectivity indicators as part of an ecological resilience assessment of the upper mississippi river 10 2 4 managing freshwater ecosystems at the basin scale the scale of water management decision making dictates how challenges opportunities and solutions are identified negotiated and implemented basin scale management has long been identified as critical for managing water resources 74 and in recent decades basin planning has taken on increasing significance in adapting to climate change 83 90 for ecosystems basin scale governance is often necessary to manage for ecological needs that span jurisdictions administrative and political boundaries sectors and distinct biotic communities a basin perspective also underscores the importance of managing threats to freshwater ecosystems that may be distant from a receiving freshwater body including the effects of land or water management activities that propagate or amplify downstream 22 and is required for addressing cumulative watershed impacts such as from nonpoint source pollution 53 the transition towards basin scale management has been marked by the ratification of global policy conventions e g the ramsar convention the brisbane declaration 3 transboundary water sharing conventions 92 and empowerment of basin institutions to facilitate planning and decision making among interacting management entities that may each have narrow jurisdictional authorities through their role in convening a diverse set of actors basin scale organizations are also viewed as a promising governance strategy for advancing a common vision of human ecological resilience in a changing climate illustrated by basin scale climate adaptation interventions in regions as diverse as the north american great lakes 59 tanzania s pangani basin 38 and europe s danube river 23 from an ecological resilience perspective adaptive governance is a critical feature of basin management which describes the set of institutions and policies that facilitate and foster adaptive decision making gunderson et al 2016 adaptive governance also facilitates the co production and dissemination of knowledge among communities of resource users scientists regulators and managers importantly adaptive governance recognizes the importance of collaborative stakeholder processes in determining management goals for ecosystems which may change over time table 1 the recognition of environmental water needs is another important feature of basin scale governance that relates to the resilience of freshwater ecosystems environmental flow protections vary widely in scope and efficacy but formally defining ecosystem needs as a stakeholder in basin scale water allocation decisions is essential 27 however securing the environmental water needed for ecological resilience strategies will likely require broad societal support built through collaborative stakeholder engagement and institutional capacity building 9 hooper 36 developed a list of performance indicators for evaluating the efficacy of river basin management in the united states guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of basin scale management have also been developed by the oecd 64 although these were not designed for engineering or ecological resilience concerns per se they identify governance features required for ecological resilience management including the need for a basin scale authority that spans levels of governance water sectors and political boundaries accurate and functional water accounting and allocation systems and robust planning and dispute resolution processes elements of the oecd guidelines have recently been refined into a checklist for evaluating the investments in green or nature based water projects that assess the level of climate informed basin level governance 17 to date these criteria have been applied across five continents representing several billion usd investments in large scale resilient gray and nature based solutions that embody aspects of flexible governance legal frameworks regulation and allocation systems 3 discussion water resources engineering is at a critical juncture as the profession endeavors to move beyond myopic economic considerations that have driven project development in the past 4 in recent decades decision makers and water managers have transitioned from a narrow focus on cost minimization under an assumed future state towards a more holistic and precautionary approach that addresses long term needs in supporting a broad range of social environmental and economic benefits however for designers and operators of water infrastructure managing for resilience represents a fundamentally new perspective that presents a broad array of risks and uncertainty 13 given the widespread operational challenges associated with balancing numerous economic and social objectives while accommodating growing hydroclimatic variability it is perhaps unsurprising that ecological resilience criteria have not been considered in decision making we recognize two other factors that may be impeding management of freshwater systems for resilience first although there is a rich body of scientific literature on ecological principles that support the health of freshwater ecosystems the relationship of these principles to ecological resilience has not previously been described in a single source for water management practitioners second engineering decision analysis and operations require metrics and criteria that are quantifiable but a set of practical general resilience indicators for utilization by water resources engineers and managers remains elusive this initial evaluation of ecological resilience indicators which reinforce the capacity of freshwater systems to maintain ecological functions while adapting to a wide range of conditions and changing operating environments is a step towards that end decision making aligned with ecological resilience principles is not only new to engineering it also represents a significant departure from traditional ecosystem management approaches which are retrospective in nature however ongoing climate impacts coupled with other forms of global change may render historically oriented management targets constrictive irrelevant or even damaging 55 this perspective is reinforced by paleoecological studies that recognize the dynamism of eco hydrological systems over longer evolutionary ecological timescales and the problematic nature of defining management benchmarks in relation to recent historical conditions management under an ecological resilience paradigm suggests a more dynamic interactive form of engagement with ecosystems whereby they are adaptively managed for desired conditions and services but potentially with physical and biological characteristics that bear limited resemblance to their recent historical state this represents a new frontier for ecologists and conservation scientists and will inevitably require novel and more intensive forms of stakeholder engagement and collaborative decision making to define ecosystem objectives and management actions despite these challenges there are immediate opportunities for advancing ecological resilience oriented strategies in water management for example approaches for addressing flood hazards are moving away from large structural control measures to more passive designs that expand the flood inundation capacity of the landscape lowering the velocity and water level of flood flows and thereby reducing risk to property and life 67 by restoring lateral hydrologic connectivity with the landscape and accommodating ecologically beneficial high flows this approach has the potential to recover lost floodplain ecosystem functions 67 and is highly compatible with the ecological resilience principles described here the multitude of water infrastructure projects e g dams levees and canals at the end of their functional lifespan and or requiring relicensing represents another opportunity to infuse ecological principles in decision making 21 evaluating the potential ecological resilience benefits of removing water infrastructure against potential costs and risks would be a valuable exercise for prioritizing projects for strategic removal in the future e g 63 looking ahead integration of ecological resilience principles in decision making has the potential to reorient water management towards strategies that allow ecosystems to adapt to novel conditions however it is important to recognize that there are also important social factors including the diversity trust and social networks of stakeholders as well as the capacity of governing institutions that will enable or impede a transition towards such resilient management approaches 30 additional work is needed to quantify both general and specific resilience indicators of socio ecological systems 10 and to demonstrate how they can be incorporated in water management decision frameworks such as in multi criterion decision analysis 31 recently poff et al 69 explored a quantitative approach to evaluate trade offs between ecological and engineering objectives in an integrated vulnerability assessment method referred to as eco engineering decision scaling eeds the approach was initially applied to evaluate flood management alternatives that could reduce flood risk while improving floodplain ecosystem functions eeds has already been integrated within new approaches to non stationary water resources planning and design methodologies 57 while also serving as a complement to established approaches to assessing climate risk in water resources decision making e g 77 these and other climate informed risk assessment approaches hold promise for identifying novel solutions for building ecological and engineering resilience in managed water systems we suggest that as water system designers and managers plan for new infrastructure as well as for re operating and retrofitting existing infrastructure considering ecological resilience principles described here early in the planning process can provide new opportunities for ecosystem improvement with modest management adjustments fewer unintended negative environmental consequences and more cost effective outcomes over the long term

respiration disruption to temperature regimes can lead to population declines of native species and changes in community assembly 66 and ultimately the loss of ecological resilience climate change interacts with human induced changes in both flow and water quality regimes causing an overall rise in water temperatures and driving regional shifts in runoff magnitude 58 and timing 33 and in some regions a growing frequency of precipitation extremes including drought and floods 86 it is also predicted that decreasing streamflow from climate change will shift some perennial streams to an intermittent flow state 39 with profound consequences for aquatic ecosystems to date strategies to restore and preserve variation in flow and water quality regimes have mostly been guided by the natural flow regime paradigm 70 and similar conceptual models e g 95 96 that rely on historical patterns to define management objectives these strategies include the re operation of dams to mimic natural flow variation downstream 45 the installation of variable depth intake devices in reservoirs to modulate the temperature of water releases below dams 79 and introduction of wood 96 and gravel 43 to stream channels to mitigate lost inputs of these materials from upstream and along river corridors given the high cost and persistent effort required artificially replenish wood and gravel proposed alternatives for sustaining natural inputs include the design of water infrastructure that allow for sediment passage 8 siting new infrastructure in locations upstream from major undammed tributaries is another strategy to maintain natural inputs of flow sediment and wood and to buffer the effects of hydromodification on mainstem rivers 43 it is increasingly recognized that strategies that go beyond the natural flow regime 73 are needed to enhance the resilience of freshwater ecosystems in a non stationary world climate impacts on precipitation especially changes in the timing form and intensity of extreme events are especially likely to alter temporal variability in flows and water quality which may be difficult to mitigate indeed attempts to maintain historical patterns of variability through management interventions may actually undermine ecological resilience 55 recently river ecosystem scientists have proposed a functional flow approach 98 which recommends that environmental water be strategically allocated to preserve specific functional elements of flow regimes that support biophysical processes upon which native species depend by focusing on management of ecosystem processes that sustain desired species and services rather than seeking to configure ecosystems in a static optimal state a functional flows approach also allows for flexibility in flow management to accommodate shifting conditions this stands in contrast to traditional approaches that generally define management objectives based on fidelity to historical patterns of biotic and abiotic conditions table 1 a multitude of indicators have been proposed that describe various dimensions of temporal environmental variability in freshwater ecosystems e g 24 66 95 and selecting a subset most relevant for evaluating ecological resilience in a specific decision context is a challenge previous studies e g 14 have used statistical methods to select metrics based on the strength of the relationship between physical parameters e g flow hydraulic and geomorphic variables and ecological responses e g habitat species abundance or community diversity however these relationships are often sensitive to data availability and may not be consistent across space and time making this approach problematic for selecting ecological resilience indicators in contrast others have used an approach informed by expert opinion and literature reviews in which indicators are selected based on known or hypothesized linkages to process based drivers of environmental variation for example to inform river management decisions in california usa yarnell et al 98 focused on flow components with documented relationships to key biophysical processes such as the spring snowmelt recession winter peak flows and summer baseflows similarly in an evaluation of management scenarios for the cache la poudre in colorado usa bestgen et al 6 selected hydrologic indicators for peak flows critical to substrate mobilization channel formation and riparian vegetation recruitment there are few examples in which metrics have explicitly defined in relation to ecological resilience principles one exception is a study by bouska et al 10 who identified a suite of resilience indicators for the upper mississippi river basin umrb usa they considered temporal variability in water quantity and quality as controlling variables and used variation in water surface elevations total suspended solids and nutrient concentrations to assess the ecological resilience of mulitple river reaches within the umrb 2 2 managing for spatial heterogeneity another important dimension of environmental variation for freshwater ecosystem resilience is spatial heterogeneity which relates to the diversity redundancy and spatial configuration of distinct biophysical elements including species biotic assemblages and habitats spatial variation in ecosystems is recognized to be hierarchical in which various processes interact to create and modify patterns of environmental heterogeneity at multiple scales 89 97 for example high flows in river channels transport and deposit large amounts of sediment to other parts of the river channel and floodplain influencing reach scale 100 1000 m habitat patterns but also interact with recruitment of large wood and debris from hillslopes to form scour pools and log jams that influence local 1 10 m habitat complexity this dynamically changing distribution of habitat patches supports a diversity of species which are able to take advantage of distinct shifting biophysical environments present in the landscape the presence of redundant but discontinuous habitat patches in the landscape enhances ecological resilience by buffering freshwater ecosystems from catastrophic change populations that persist in some locations i e refugia may subsequently recolonize those affected by a disturbance 82 the response diversity of organisms to distrubance coupled with habitat specializations contributes to the overall stability of biotic communities 1 environmental heterogeneity also contributes to the expression of biological diversity within populations i e phenotypic and genotypic variation such diversification of sub populations has been linked to asynchronous ecological dynamics that contribute to the stability of freshwater species populations 81 87 and potentially enhance the ability of species to adapt to changing climate conditions 88 anthropogenic water management activities tend to diminish spatial heterogeneity in freshwater ecosystems at local scales widespread modifications of lakes and rivers including shoreline embankments channelization removal of large woody debris and clearing of vegetation collectively reduce the structural complexity of aquatic and riparian habitats changes in hydrologic regimes is often the mechanism by which structural complexity is reduced for example the reduction in peak flows from large dams has been shown to reduce the frequency of riverbed sediment mobilization limit natural channel migration and disrupt the dynamics by which diverse riverine habitats are created and maintained 51 expressed at larger scales the simplification of physical habitat coupled with the homogenization of flow regimes 71 has been linked to population declines and loss of resilience in communities of native species 61 dams can also reduce landscape heterogeneity by restricting access of organisms to historic habitat potentially synchronizing subpopulations in ways that decrease resilience 60 for example thompson et al 88 demonstrated how human modifications to salmon bearing rivers of california have caused the rapid decline of life history diversity expression within chinook salmon and suggest the loss of genetic diversity could limit the ability of the species to cope with extreme environmental variation in the future strategies for managing for spatial heterogeneity in the context of water planning and decision making depend on the scale of the project under consideration traditional approaches to addressing spatial heterogeneity in freshwater ecosystem management have focused on identification and protection of water bodies or watersheds that support disproportionally high biodiveristy i e hotspots or critical habitat for threatened species although protected areas remain an essential strategy for addressing imminent risks to biodiversity designing and implementing protected area networks for freshwater ecosystems has proven difficult 62 furthermore protected areas are rarely designed with consideration of the potential changes in environmental conditions and associated shifts in species ranges associated with climate change resilience oriented approaches for managing spatial heterogeneity may still involve the prioritization of management interventions in specific water bodies or watersheds however management objectives will shift from the conservation of particular species and assemblages to the management of watershed networks that promote ecological resilience through the maintenance of life history diversity that buffers populations from environmental variability i e portfolio effects 81 table 1 for example carlson and satterthwaite 15 analyzed salmon population dynamics in california s central valley and recommended that one of the regions most degraded watersheds be restored to strengthen overall population stability rather than focusing exclusively on watersheds supporting the most abundant fish runs resilience oriented strategies also include interventions that protect or restore natural disturbance processes that create structural complexity in freshwater ecosystems such as floods siting or configuring water projects to avoid impacts to tributary streams is one approach for allowing natural river processes to maintain the natural delivery of flow sediment and wood downstream providing room for the river is another example in which human settlements and infrastructure are set back from the river channel giving the river sufficient space to move erode banks and flood and thereby perform hydrologic water quality and habitat functions 44 these types of passive management interventions designed to enhance environmental heterogeneity may also confer substantial benefits to people through reduced flood risk and costs 44 the spatial heterogeneity of freshwater ecosystems can be quantified at multiple scales as with the selection of metrics that relate to temporal variability resilience indicators related to environmental heterogeneity should be based on known or hypothesized linkages with biophysical processes within the system of interest for example bouska et al 10 identified several resilience indicators corresponding to the spatial heterogeneity of the upper mississippi river system these included metrics related to aquatic habitat diversity and redundancy as well as floodplain inundation diversity at small to moderate spatial scales 1 1000 m heterogeneity can be measured by indicators of structural complexity such as variation in river channel morphology bedforms and substrate 65 and shoreline complexity 40 as well as by indicators of biological complexity such as the diversity and distribution of distinct habitat types present 80 at larger spatial scales 1 1000 km heterogeneity can be assessed by the diversity and spatial configuration of distinct landscape features defined by geology vegetation hydro climate and other biophysical characteristics using readily available geospatial tools e g fragstats 56 however for these and other descriptors of spatial patterning indicators representative of conditions at a single point in time will be less meaningful assess for assessing ecological resilience than if state changes are tracked over time 2 3 managing for hydrologic connectivity freshwater ecosystems are characterized by the dynamic movement and exchange of water across components of the hydrologic cycle and at interfaces with adjacent terrestrial systems transfers of matter energy and organisms resulting from these processes herein referred to as hydrologic connectivity are a fundamental control on freshwater ecosystem functions and integrity 75 freshwater ecologists have identified four relevant dimensions of hydrologic connectivity longitudinal upstream downstream linkages between habitats lateral connectivity between a river channel or lake and adjacent floodplains and riparian areas vertical connectivity with the hyporheic zone groundwater and the atmosphere and temporal seasonal interactions among the three spatial dimensions 93 connectivity of heterogeneous habitat types contributes to resilience by sustaining a diverse pool of species that use a variety of habitats for feeding reproduction resting rearing refuge and migrating 91 connectivity also enhances resilience by allowing biota to recolonize disturbed areas or replenish depleted populations and in the context of climate change is essential for facilitating range shifts of organisms to areas of remaining suitable habitat water infrastructure projects affect multiple dimensions of hydrologic connectivity dams interrupt the longitudinal connectivity of river networks directly as physical barriers or indirectly by reducing flows and drying channels downstream thereby impeding or eliminating the movement and dispersion of sediment nutrients and organisms lateral connectivity between aquatic ecosystems and adjacent floodplains and riparian areas are also disrupted by physical structures such as dikes and levees flow alteration can further reduce lateral connectivity especially from the loss of high flows from upstream dams or diversions that alter the frequency duration and timing of floodplain inundation along rivers or lakeshores climate induced shifts in flow regimes may act synergistically with water infrastructure to intensify interruptions to connectivity for example the combination of dam development and increasing drought risk threatens the tonle sap in cambodia the largest wetland ecosystem in the mekong river basin known to support one of the worlds largest freshwater fisheries that feeds millions of people 2 groundwater pumping from aquifers can alter the timing and direction of groundwater surface water interactions with rivers and lakes directly affecting vertical hydrologic connectivity but potentially reducing longitudinal and lateral connectivity through declining surface water flow and elevations 20 the loss of geomorphic complexity from channelization levee construction and wood removal also reduces hyporheic exchange in river channels which can negatively affect nutrient processing and habitat quality for a variety of freshwater species while human activities tend to reduce connectivity in some cases connectivity may be artificially enhanced via inter basin transfers canals elevated flows potentially altering water quality conditions and creating pathways for non native species invasions 76 connectivity has long been a focus of traditional ecosystem management approaches the removal or modification of dams and other barriers has been a primary strategy for restoring connectivity within river networks 25 dam reoperation experiments involving pulse flow releases have also effectively reconnected downstream habitats 41 lateral connectivity has been enhanced through managed flood flow release and by removing or setting back artificial channel constraints such as levees 67 while these strategies for restoring or enhancing connectivity likely promote ecological resilience their potential benefits are dependent on the spatial and temporal dimensions of connectivity and dynamics of transferred matter previous studies have attempted to quantify the temporal patterns of hydrologic connectivity in stream networks e g 5 but more research is needed to understand how fluxes of water nutrients and organisms within and between freshwater and terrestrial systems contribute to resilience table 1 several indicators have been developed to describe the ecologically relevant dimensions of hydrologic connectivity in freshwater ecosystems human influence on longitudinal connectivity have typically been evaluated by river network fragmentation indices e g 18 changes in lateral connectivity in river and wetland ecosystems have been assessed by indices that describe the spatial configuration of connected hydrologic units 47 recently grill et al 29 proposed an integrated connectivity status index that incorporates all four dimensions of hydrologic connectivity for assessing alteration to free flowing rivers connectivity metrics have also been applied in studies aimed at explicitly enhancing the resilience of river ecosystems including the prioritization of barrier removal to restore ecosystem functions 11 and evaluation of connectivity indicators as part of an ecological resilience assessment of the upper mississippi river 10 2 4 managing freshwater ecosystems at the basin scale the scale of water management decision making dictates how challenges opportunities and solutions are identified negotiated and implemented basin scale management has long been identified as critical for managing water resources 74 and in recent decades basin planning has taken on increasing significance in adapting to climate change 83 90 for ecosystems basin scale governance is often necessary to manage for ecological needs that span jurisdictions administrative and political boundaries sectors and distinct biotic communities a basin perspective also underscores the importance of managing threats to freshwater ecosystems that may be distant from a receiving freshwater body including the effects of land or water management activities that propagate or amplify downstream 22 and is required for addressing cumulative watershed impacts such as from nonpoint source pollution 53 the transition towards basin scale management has been marked by the ratification of global policy conventions e g the ramsar convention the brisbane declaration 3 transboundary water sharing conventions 92 and empowerment of basin institutions to facilitate planning and decision making among interacting management entities that may each have narrow jurisdictional authorities through their role in convening a diverse set of actors basin scale organizations are also viewed as a promising governance strategy for advancing a common vision of human ecological resilience in a changing climate illustrated by basin scale climate adaptation interventions in regions as diverse as the north american great lakes 59 tanzania s pangani basin 38 and europe s danube river 23 from an ecological resilience perspective adaptive governance is a critical feature of basin management which describes the set of institutions and policies that facilitate and foster adaptive decision making gunderson et al 2016 adaptive governance also facilitates the co production and dissemination of knowledge among communities of resource users scientists regulators and managers importantly adaptive governance recognizes the importance of collaborative stakeholder processes in determining management goals for ecosystems which may change over time table 1 the recognition of environmental water needs is another important feature of basin scale governance that relates to the resilience of freshwater ecosystems environmental flow protections vary widely in scope and efficacy but formally defining ecosystem needs as a stakeholder in basin scale water allocation decisions is essential 27 however securing the environmental water needed for ecological resilience strategies will likely require broad societal support built through collaborative stakeholder engagement and institutional capacity building 9 hooper 36 developed a list of performance indicators for evaluating the efficacy of river basin management in the united states guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of basin scale management have also been developed by the oecd 64 although these were not designed for engineering or ecological resilience concerns per se they identify governance features required for ecological resilience management including the need for a basin scale authority that spans levels of governance water sectors and political boundaries accurate and functional water accounting and allocation systems and robust planning and dispute resolution processes elements of the oecd guidelines have recently been refined into a checklist for evaluating the investments in green or nature based water projects that assess the level of climate informed basin level governance 17 to date these criteria have been applied across five continents representing several billion usd investments in large scale resilient gray and nature based solutions that embody aspects of flexible governance legal frameworks regulation and allocation systems 3 discussion water resources engineering is at a critical juncture as the profession endeavors to move beyond myopic economic considerations that have driven project development in the past 4 in recent decades decision makers and water managers have transitioned from a narrow focus on cost minimization under an assumed future state towards a more holistic and precautionary approach that addresses long term needs in supporting a broad range of social environmental and economic benefits however for designers and operators of water infrastructure managing for resilience represents a fundamentally new perspective that presents a broad array of risks and uncertainty 13 given the widespread operational challenges associated with balancing numerous economic and social objectives while accommodating growing hydroclimatic variability it is perhaps unsurprising that ecological resilience criteria have not been considered in decision making we recognize two other factors that may be impeding management of freshwater systems for resilience first although there is a rich body of scientific literature on ecological principles that support the health of freshwater ecosystems the relationship of these principles to ecological resilience has not previously been described in a single source for water management practitioners second engineering decision analysis and operations require metrics and criteria that are quantifiable but a set of practical general resilience indicators for utilization by water resources engineers and managers remains elusive this initial evaluation of ecological resilience indicators which reinforce the capacity of freshwater systems to maintain ecological functions while adapting to a wide range of conditions and changing operating environments is a step towards that end decision making aligned with ecological resilience principles is not only new to engineering it also represents a significant departure from traditional ecosystem management approaches which are retrospective in nature however ongoing climate impacts coupled with other forms of global change may render historically oriented management targets constrictive irrelevant or even damaging 55 this perspective is reinforced by paleoecological studies that recognize the dynamism of eco hydrological systems over longer evolutionary ecological timescales and the problematic nature of defining management benchmarks in relation to recent historical conditions management under an ecological resilience paradigm suggests a more dynamic interactive form of engagement with ecosystems whereby they are adaptively managed for desired conditions and services but potentially with physical and biological characteristics that bear limited resemblance to their recent historical state this represents a new frontier for ecologists and conservation scientists and will inevitably require novel and more intensive forms of stakeholder engagement and collaborative decision making to define ecosystem objectives and management actions despite these challenges there are immediate opportunities for advancing ecological resilience oriented strategies in water management for example approaches for addressing flood hazards are moving away from large structural control measures to more passive designs that expand the flood inundation capacity of the landscape lowering the velocity and water level of flood flows and thereby reducing risk to property and life 67 by restoring lateral hydrologic connectivity with the landscape and accommodating ecologically beneficial high flows this approach has the potential to recover lost floodplain ecosystem functions 67 and is highly compatible with the ecological resilience principles described here the multitude of water infrastructure projects e g dams levees and canals at the end of their functional lifespan and or requiring relicensing represents another opportunity to infuse ecological principles in decision making 21 evaluating the potential ecological resilience benefits of removing water infrastructure against potential costs and risks would be a valuable exercise for prioritizing projects for strategic removal in the future e g 63 looking ahead integration of ecological resilience principles in decision making has the potential to reorient water management towards strategies that allow ecosystems to adapt to novel conditions however it is important to recognize that there are also important social factors including the diversity trust and social networks of stakeholders as well as the capacity of governing institutions that will enable or impede a transition towards such resilient management approaches 30 additional work is needed to quantify both general and specific resilience indicators of socio ecological systems 10 and to demonstrate how they can be incorporated in water management decision frameworks such as in multi criterion decision analysis 31 recently poff et al 69 explored a quantitative approach to evaluate trade offs between ecological and engineering objectives in an integrated vulnerability assessment method referred to as eco engineering decision scaling eeds the approach was initially applied to evaluate flood management alternatives that could reduce flood risk while improving floodplain ecosystem functions eeds has already been integrated within new approaches to non stationary water resources planning and design methodologies 57 while also serving as a complement to established approaches to assessing climate risk in water resources decision making e g 77 these and other climate informed risk assessment approaches hold promise for identifying novel solutions for building ecological and engineering resilience in managed water systems we suggest that as water system designers and managers plan for new infrastructure as well as for re operating and retrofitting existing infrastructure considering ecological resilience principles described here early in the planning process can provide new opportunities for ecosystem improvement with modest management adjustments fewer unintended negative environmental consequences and more cost effective outcomes over the long term

20156,we explore the triumvirate of resilience persistence adaptability and transformability in the context of england s water supply infrastructure system risk based decision making and simulation models are increasingly being used to guide water resource management in england we argue that these approaches and tools are sufficient to analyse persistence and adaptability provided they incorporate systems coping and recovery during and after extreme events along with a broad framing of human economic and environmental impacts on the other hand we find that transformability is not readily incorporated into risk based decision making and related simulation tools as it relies amongst other things on the capacity of institutions to identify and implement change in england risk based concepts and simulation tools provide evidence with which to quantify water supply system persistence during shocks and adaptability on a range of timescales an historical analysis reveals the adaptability of england s water supply system in response to changing economic needs for water and societal expectations for water security as well as external drivers including conservation of the aquatic environment and the politics of privatisation of water utilities the frequency and impact of harmful drought events suggests a low degree of persistence we find a potential for transformability through more strategic national scale assessment and planning and setting up resilience targets that are consistent across the country however we also show that the system has not initiated such potentially transformational changes until very recently 1 introduction the concept of resilience has acquired increasing prominence in water policy and research over the past decade 70 this growing interest in resilience partially emerges from the awareness of the evident threats posed by water to society as well as the negative impacts of human activities on the aquatic environment this latter point is particularly important as chronic over exploitation of aquatic ecosystems is undermining their capacity to recover in turn undermining the water security services they provide 64 as resilience emerges as a framing for global water challenges it becomes important to explore its applicability to water resource management in practice is resilience just a broad objective of water resource management or can the attributes of resilience persistence adaptability and transformability be quantified in the context of a specific water resource system this paper attempts to answer this question it does so by exploring the extent to which a resilience framing can underpin national scale water planning taking england s water supply infrastructure system as an example building on the conceptual considerations presented in this special issue of water security this paper presents and discusses the existing evidence on the resilience of england s water resource system in section 2 we compare the attributes of resilience with more established risk based approaches for water management this comparison serves to demonstrate the commonalities and divergences between these different framings of water management here we also explain how simulation tools underpinning risk based decision making also provide powerful instruments to study the resilience of water resource systems in section 3 we examine the resilience of england s water supply system through a historical and quantitative analysis in section 4 we draw some general lessons from the case study 2 risk and resilience framings of water resource management 2 1 resilience elsewhere in this special issue of water security the concept of resilience has been explored in some depth herein resilience is recognised as being associated with persistence adaptability and transformability pat 28 80 boltz et al this issue the first and to some extent the second of these three concepts were already incorporated in hashimoto et al s 1982 three criteria for evaluating the performance of engineered water resource systems reliability resiliency and vulnerability in hashimoto s work these three measures describe how likely a system is to fail reliability how quickly it recovers from failure resiliency and how severe the consequences of failure may be vulnerability hashimoto s framework incorporates attributes of persistence within all three criteria it also incorporates adaptability in resiliency because this criterion reveals system boundaries and thresholds however hashimoto s framework does not describe how a system might transform itself under chronic or acute stress meaning that attributes of transformability seem to inhabit a different level in our understanding of water resource systems transformational changes as opposed to incremental ones require a paradigm shift within the system under consideration 53 as such a transformation could be regarded as a system moving from one state to another or establishing a new configuration and function when pushed beyond its present state for example in water resources management this transformation could imply a shift from isolated water supply networks e g old state to a fully connected water supply distribution system e g new state following demographic growth e g factor responsible for pushing the system in the new state such a phase transition could actually imply that the system has been unable to persist or adapt under external forcing so has changed its state for transformation to be a positive attribute of resilience we cannot be indifferent to its outcome a resilient transformation needs to be a deliberate set of choices that are designed to 1 enhance overall system function 2 introduce new system components and 3 minimize loss of system services in the face of new disturbances on a range of different spatial and temporal scales for water resource systems and all human managed systems transformability implies a role for human institutions in building capacity for transformability this capacity to recognise the need for transformation define and design the transformation implement it and monitor and evaluate its effectiveness is at the heart of water resource system transformability this reflexive process of problem identification evaluation and options appraisal implementation and monitoring is a classical management cycle this process is also implicit in integrated water resources management which also rightly emphasises the importance of engaging stakeholders in the process versions of this process are being played out in every country where there are deliberate efforts to manage water resources for the future in that sense water resources management is inherently resilience focused however where resilience thinking takes us further is by emphasising aspects of water resource systems that may otherwise be overlooked in particular those related to transformability 2 2 risk concepts relevant to framing persistence adaptability and transformability water resource management is increasingly being regarded as a risk management problem 40 33 77 especially in advanced economies that have already extensively exploited their water resources whilst less economically developed countries need to provide new beneficial water services domestic and industrial water supplies irrigation waterway navigation in advanced economies where these services are nearly universal attention shifts to managing the risks to those supplies 42 and other water related hazards such as flooding water resources management becomes a process of managing the risks to and from water where risks are here interpreted as harmful outcomes related to water the shift to a risk based approach has been further motivated by growing recognition of the uncertain impacts of climate change 41 71 a risk based approach provides an explicit framework to deal with the uncertain occurrence of water related harmful events it also provides a framework for incorporating variability on a range of timescales though hydrological variability e g in surface flows and groundwater has always been recognised traditionally planners have 1 tended to reduce the complexities of hydrological variability to simplified representative estimates of water supply and demand 11 and 2 assumed stationary statistical models of key hydroclimatic variables 49 a risk based approach involves more explicitly quantifying variability in supply and demand on a range of different timescales in order to identify the frequency severity and duration of events in which the water supply system is unable to meet demand in order to quantify risk it is necessary to explicitly quantify the potential harmful outcomes for people and the environment of water related events of a range of different severities and durations e g agricultural production losses due to a water shortage or the economic damage incurred after a flood indeed an advantage of a risk based approach is that risks are expressed in terms of the observable outcomes that people care about risk therefore provides a conceptual framework for management of water resources and delivery of water services in fig 1 we conceive of water resources management as a process of cost effectively managing harmful outcomes for people and the aquatic environment some of these outcomes can be attributed to environmental factors e g droughts floods whilst others are a consequence of human in action e g treatment plant failure that is a state when assets are no longer capable of performing their intended functions this conceptual framework unifies the various functions of a water utility s business and connects them to the two high level risks that the utility is responsible for managing risks in the future will change on a range of different timescales risk analysis provides a snapshot of risk at a given point in time subject to given assumptions adjusting those assumptions to reflect possible future scenarios provides a method for quantifying the impacts of future changes for example due to climatic changes e g shifting precipitation and evapotranspiration patterns socio economic changes e g population growth and changing patterns of demand for water and deliberate human interventions e g infrastructure investments or new regulations risk analysis thereby provides an essential tool for adaptation decision making because it allows policy makers to compare options e g building a reservoir reducing leakage from distribution networks based on their ability to cost effectively reduce risks analysis of risk provides a crucial but incomplete understanding of resilience analysis of risk seeks to explicitly consider the full range of possible stressors and shocks to which a system might be exposed risk analysis systematically considers the consequences of those shocks answering questions about the persistence of the system to shocks not all risk analyses consider the capacity of a system to cope and recover from shocks i e adaptability but the simulation methodologies that we describe below are well suited to analysing the severity and duration of disruptions for different water users strategies for persisting and to some extent adapting during disruptions can be encoded in simulation models used in risk analyses whilst methods for decision making under uncertainty provide tools for long term adaptation e g 37 39 76 later in this paper we will explore the aspects of adaptability and transformability i e the capacity of the human actors in the water system to manage resilience and envision create transformations that are not so readily incorporated in a risk based approach but first we will further consider the use of simulation modelling for analysing risk and resilience 2 3 understanding persistence adaptability and transformability through simulation models simulation models have come to play a central role in the analysis and management of water resource systems growing emphasis on resilience of these systems is further motivating the use of simulation models because resilience is inherently associated with the dynamics of a system and simulation models seek to explicitly represent those dynamics alternative methods such as linear programming which has been widely used in water resources planning e g 63 are much less suited to the analysis of risk and resilience as they do not readily enable quantification of the severity and duration of disruption or the effectiveness of strategies for coping with disruption 55 simulation modelling is particularly powerful because of the capacity to test and explore shocks and scenarios that have never happened by subjecting a simulator of a water resource system to those conditions in silico system stress testing through computer simulation is one of the most important tools for resilience testing especially when that is combined with scenario exercises for the multiple stakeholders responsible for a system 13 this approach typically referred to as exploratory modelling 4 uses simulation models to ask what if questions unravelling the implications of different assumptions and hypotheses about future trends on water related outcomes of concern e g the frequency of water shortages in order to analyse risks to a water resource system a simulation model needs to encompass relevant hazards system response to those hazards and the outcomes for people and the environment a comprehensive simulation of the resilience of a water utility would include all of the processes included in fig 1 in practice this involves several different types of simulation models addressing water supply systems water quality sewers and asset reliability here we explore the example of a typical water resource system simulator which is itself a composition of a series of coupled sub simulators the purpose of this type of simulator is to test the performance of the system under changing conditions of climate and demand system performance within a given future state is often quantified through metrics such as those defined in hashimoto et al 1982 and across ensembles of plausible futures using measures of robustness 46 these supplies may be for a variety of different users including agricultural and energy users but here our focus is upon public water supplies i e supplies to households and industries that are connected to piped networks of treated water rather than using their own private water sources even given this narrowing of the scope from the framework set out in fig 1 simulating this sub system involves coupling several different models fig 2 1 climatic boundary conditions although many methods exist for direct simulation of streamflow e g 60 45 using climate as the upstream boundary of a system simulator is attractive because i it enables simulations from climate models to be used if necessary after appropriate downscaling to test possible future climatic conditions and ii climate model outputs implicitly represent spatial and temporal dependencies between the several climatic variables that influence water resource systems most notably precipitation and the variables that determine evapotranspiration 2 surface and groundwater hydrology hydrological models transform climatic inputs notably rainfall into quantities of water that may be withdrawn from rivers and or groundwater at specified locations 79 because the quantity of water at a given location is an aggregation of a complex series of spatial temporal processes these are dynamical models though the representation of spatial complexity varies from lumped catchment models to spatially explicit gridded models 3 water supply infrastructure withdrawals storage pumping and allocation rules water resource system models simulate the functioning of the water supply infrastructure typically on daily or monthly timescales e g 84 54 system simulation models can represent rules for withdrawal of water from water bodies e g licence arrangements to preserve environmental flows operation of storage e g reservoirs groundwater and allocation of water to different users they take as input conditions projections of water demand see 4 below and can simulate the amount by which demand may be voluntarily or forcibly reduced during times of scarcity through water use restrictions 4 water use a variety of methods exist for projecting water demands from households agriculture and other economic sectors 23 traditionally models focus on low time resolution data on consumption acquired through billing or limited measurement campaigns and employ deterministic forecast methods house peters and chang 2011 for example basic estimates of domestic water consumption are typically based on projections of population and an estimate of the consumption of water per capita these approaches are still widely used in the water industry 81 but they fail to provide an accurate characterization of the response of users to different levels of restrictions and other exogenous factors such as climatic conditions recent advances in smart metering technology provide a promising avenue to advance residential water demand modelling and thus significantly improve the ability of water resource system simulators to model users response to restrictions and other demand side measures 15 advances in economic analysis also allow for an improved understanding and modelling of the impact of water use restrictions on multiple users 30 32 this understanding is crucial as it feeds directly into the cost benefit assessment of policy options needed to reduce the risk of water shortages although simulation models provide key advantages for testing water system resilience their application as shown in fig 2 entails some limitations linking different models from global climate models to hydrological models into a modelling chain can propagate uncertainty from each individual model leading to biased or overconfident projections and make it difficult to attribute total estimated uncertainty to its sources 72 climate model projections in particular are characterized by biases which mean that considerable caution is needed when interpreting them 52 hence risk analysis approaches based on the process in fig 2 should always be accompanied by extensive sensitivity analysis to identify options that robustly achieve the desired objectives that is options that perform acceptably well across a wide range of conditions even those that are outside the ones projected with the modelling chain 65 in addition advances in decision making under uncertainty now allow to explicitly account for opportunities to learn about the future evolution of risks and respond to new information as it becomes available 27 in summary simulators of the type described above can be used to analyse two attributes of resilience persistence of a water resource system with respect to climatic shocks like droughts by subjecting the simulator to a wide range of possible drought conditions including conditions that are much more severe than have been observed in the past stress testing in this way helps to identify the conditions under which the system resistance is exceeded i e it fails 12 69 adaptability on a range of different timescales capacity to cope during system failure can be explored by simulating drought management strategies e g the provision of alternative supplies or temporary permission to exceed regulatory limits on water withdrawals on longer timescales a variety of alternative strategies for increasing supply or reducing demand can be simulated simulation of alternative adaptation plans can provide evidence of the plan s expected outcomes and trade offs in the context of changed climatic conditions and socio economic demands 9 47 85 8 further evidence of adaptability and to some extent transformability can be provided by enhancing the dynamic representation of water use and decision making hydro economic models that couple system simulation with simulation of decision making by multiple agents e g farmers are now quite commonplace 10 44 and they have been applied to model a range of responses including financial hedging 29 57 and integrated management of forests and water 34 it is more challenging to simulate the reflexive behaviour by agents who chose to reconfigure a system in response to external stimuli typically these choices are taken as being exogenous however dynamic e g 7 5 75 and agent based e g 36 models are increasingly being applied to simulate endogenous feedbacks and responses to disturbances in coupled human water systems in addition water system models can be used interactively to expose managers to changing conditions identify decisions points and weakness in water management plans 83 well functioning institutions provide the capacity to foresee the effects of stressors to which a system may not as it is currently configured be able to adapt even if it implements the adaptive strategies that have been tested and optimised in simulation models this capacity is particularly important in the context of climate change adaptation where investment strategies need to be routinely re evaluated in light of new information and uncertainties in projections 24 under these circumstances institutional innovation is also required to enable system transformability which is what we describe in the next section using an example from england 3 application 3 1 overview and motivation the recent history of water resources management in england provides the focal point for the examination of the resilience of water resource systems in this paper england is unusual in the international context as direct withdrawals for agriculture are just a few percent of total withdrawals whilst public supplies account for about half of the total as such the management of the public water supply system and its infrastructure plays a central role in the system s resilience england s water resource system is a good case study as it faces major challenges with growing urban populations and changing consumption patterns the need for urban water supplies is expected to increase further 25 beside changes in demand and user behaviour england s water resource system also faces significant challenges arising from climate change 82 the uk has completed two climate change risk assessments ccra which are mandated under the 2008 climate change act each of these ccras has highlighted risks to water supplies as being one of the greatest climate risks for the uk 16 the terminology of resilience has taken hold in the english water industry to frame responses to these challenges water utilities now have a duty of resilience which was mandated in the 2014 water act the water act imposed on water utilities in england a primary duty to secure resilience as regards environmental pressures population growth and changes in consumer behaviour since then the water sector has been working to operationalise this legal responsibility the ways in which the water sector in england has framed water resilience and the decision making tools and processes that are being considered to assess options to secure resilience therefore represent an interesting and potentially important case which is the focus of this section 3 2 assessing the resilience of england s water resource system through historical analysis 3 2 1 persistence and adaptability water infrastructure in england has for the most part been regionally managed the needs for water of a growing population and industrial sector during the industrial revolution were met by cities and regions planning water infrastructure including the proliferation of reservoirs in the north and west the need for a national perspective was recognised in the 1970s with the creation of the water resources planning board at that time the planning approach was deterministic did not employ computer simulation models and emphasised supply options without much consideration of demand management uncertainties in demand or climate change the last large reservoir to be completed in england was kielder water in northumberland with a volume of 200 billion litres of water making it the country s largest reservoir it was built to provide water supplies to industries in the north east of england these industries shortly afterwards went into economic decline meaning that the stored water in that region of the country is now under utilised in 1989 the water industry in england was privatised into ten water and sewage companies and twenty nine smaller supply only companies 61 water companies were created in scotland wales and northern ireland with different public ownership arrangements privatisation of the water industry in england was a major reform of institutional configuration though it was not motivated by water security nor a pursuit of resilience the motivation came from a political ideology of privatisation and the need to increase investment by accessing private finance after a period of under investment in assets 2 the decision making process within water utilities was framed as providing an acceptable level of service i e water security for customers as users of public water supplies became known within a price cap system where the economic regulator the office of water services ofwat sets an upper limit on service tariffs increases the environmental regulator environment agency determines constraints on water abstraction and discharges to safeguard the needs of aquatic ecosystems and the water quality regulator the drinking water inspectorate provides independent assurance of the quality of drinking water water companies are required to demonstrate security of water supplies in their development of a water resources management plan wrmp every five years the wrmp looks at least 25 years into the future and includes projections of demand the impacts of climate change changes in regulatory limits on water withdrawals and associated uncertainties the five yearly cycle is designed to ensure that the wrmps are inherently adaptable they are revisited in the light of new information about system performance and new evidence about drivers of future change water withdrawals by agricultural fish farming energy and industry which together make up 1 10 28 and 12 of water withdrawals alongside 48 for public water supplies 18 are regulated by the environment agency there has been growing recognition that water withdrawals from some catchments and groundwater bodies may be environmentally unsustainable so a programme of reforming water allocation is under way 19 26 this had been given further impetus by the european water framework directive which requires all member states to ensure that water bodies have good ecological status in some respect the arrangements for water resources management that were brought into being during privatisation have functioned as intended asset management has improved and leakage from the ageing pipe network although still high at 22 1 has reduced from 30 at the time of privatisation 58 the water resource system has largely been able to maintain function in response to disruptions i e persistence with few notable exceptions in 1995 reservoirs in england s west yorkshire region ran dry and the water company yorkshire water had to transport water by truck to provide emergency supplies to its customer for a period of five months 3 in 2007 supplies to 350 000 users in gloucestershire south west england were disrupted for 17 days following flooding of mythe water treatment works 66 water use restrictions and emergency water abstractions are key measures to keep the system functioning during a disruption hosepipe restrictions i e restrictions on water use for gardening and car washing are consistently applied every few years together with emergency permits that allow water companies to abstract more water than normally allowed environment agency data provided to the 59 these measures have so far enabled the system to return to its normal functions following drought ensuring the security of public water supplies and demonstrating some level of persistence however these measures have not taken away the negative impacts of drought which are still felt by the local economy for example see 78 and the environment for example see 14 3 2 2 transformability while england s water resource system shows attributes of persistence and adaptability its potential for transformability is yet to be fully realized the wrmps provide a transparent forward planning method however they do not provide an explicit estimate of the risk of water shortages nor a strategic overview of the system at the national level 43 this latter aspect would allow planners to make the most of the available resources at national scale and plan system transformations moreover whilst each water company follows the same guidelines in producing its wrmp the target levels of service for customers vary between water companies as well as their achievement in reducing leakage and demand the limits to understanding and planning for the resilience of england s water supplies became particularly apparent in early 2012 when after two consecutive exceptionally dry winters london and the south east of england faced the possibility of water shortages 50 recognising the need for more strategic planning in 2016 the government tasked water uk the industry body representing the water utilities to conduct a study of a water resources long term planning framework wrltpf water uk 2016 unusually for an industry that had become dominated by analysis at the scale of individual water companies the wrltpf took a national perspective and examined a range of strategic supply options including more transfers of water between water companies a further step in this shift was made by the national infrastructure commission which was brought into being in 2015 to provide strategic advice to the government on the uk s infrastructure needs and priorities in 2018 the national infrastructure commission undertook a strategic review of water supply infrastructure 59 in the meantime water companies have successfully developed an approach for working together into regional groups which are joined together in the national framework provided by the government and regulators the role of regional planning has been given a statutory role by the recent environment bill 2019 there is also a recent move toward setting and adopting national targets related to resilience the national infrastructure commission has recommended that companies plan for being resilient to a drought with annual probability of 0 2 59 the industry and government adopted a target to halve the level of leakage by 2050 20 and the government is also exploring the possibility of establishing a target for per capita consumption 21 and 22 as well as other environment related targets this is a notable shift from the status quo of each company establishing their own ambitions in the area largely driven by a combination of costs and customers willingness to pay nic 2019 these reflect the potential for transformability of england s water supply institutions i e the capacity of water supply institutions to transform themselves to anticipate and respond to changing threats it remains to be seen whether the above actions and institutional reforms will be operationalised into transformational changes of the system that demonstrably enhances resilience 3 3 measuring persistence adaptability and transformability of england s water resource system through simulation in england the requirements for a national perspective on water resources and for an explicit understanding of risk and resilience have driven innovation in simulation modelling established methods have proved not to be adequate to provide quantified estimates of risks of water shortages or to explore the benefits in terms of risk reduction and costs of policies and investments to improve the resilience of water supplies 43 this resulted in the development of a risk based approach that as discussed in section 2 2 can be used to analyse the resilience of the system in particular the attributes of persistence and adaptability and to a lesser extent transformability here we give a short overview of these tools and the interpretation of the results in terms of the three aspects of resilience 3 3 1 climatic boundary conditions a combination of i historic drought observations and reconstructions 74 and ii synthetic droughts consistent with possible future climatic conditions has been established to stress test the resilience of water resource systems in england synthetic droughts have been generated using a very large ensemble of regional climate model simulations run with the weather home w h modelling system 38 the w h simulations generated 40 000 years of synthetic weather conditions which included some extremely severe and prolonged droughts future projections were generated for the periods 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 3 3 2 surface and groundwater hydrology the water industry in england has widely used the future flows simulations 67 68 to test water supply security under extreme drought conditions the future flows simulations are a consistent set of daily river flow and monthly groundwater levels time series across england and wales generated using regional climate model output and the national grid2grid model 6 as shown in section 3 3 3 they enable the investigation of the impact of unprecedented droughts i e droughts longer and more severe than the ones present in the historical record on water supply security advances in national hydrological models hold promise for further hydrological stress testing in england the dynatop 56 and gr4j 73 catchment hydrological models have been calibrated nationally and run with all of the w h climate simulations these national hydrological models are still under development in particular to better represent groundwater yields water withdrawals and discharges back into rivers 17 given that the greatest hydrological disturbances to the water supply system are likely to cover multiple regions of england and the uk more broadly the development of a spatially coherent representation of hydrology at a national scale is essential 3 3 3 water supply infrastructure and water use since privatisation of the water industry planning and operation of water supply infrastructure has been done at the level of individual water companies some agreements for transfer of water between neighbouring companies existed before privatisation so have been assumed to be inputs outputs to from these company systems however the resilience of the national system as a whole incorporating all the water supply zones was not scrutinised until the water uk 2016 and nic 2018 studies mentioned above the nic 2018 quantified the additional water supply capacity needed under different scenarios of population growth climate change and drought fig 3 two climate change and population scenarios were used to represent underlying average conditions while three drought scenarios from the future flows ensemble section 3 3 2 were employed to simulate the system s response under extreme circumstances 59 a national water infrastructure system model see 48 was used to calculate future water balances under the different scenario combinations and quantify the additional capacity required in case of drought under historic drought conditions 1 annual probability an additional capacity of about 2700 3000 million litres per day would be required in england to avoid having to impose prolonged water use restrictions on domestic users under a severe drought 0 5 annual probability and an extreme drought 0 2 annual probability an additional 600 1000 million litres per day would be required as shown in fig 3 the south east of england emerges as the most vulnerable region to drought highlighting its water infrastructure needs further analysis is required to integrate aspects of water quality and freshwater ecosystem response to these estimates e g 35 3 3 4 costs and benefits of interventions to achieve resilience to appraise options to counteract drought in england the national infrastructure commission compared the cost of deploying emergency drought interventions with the cost of proactively providing resilience through new infrastructure water demand management and leakage reduction the economic cost of drought is generally quantified by studying expressed willingness to pay to avoid restrictions on water use for domestic users in england these have been estimated to be about 160 per household per day water uk 2016 macro economic estimates of the impacts of water restrictions on industrial supply and demand have also been developed 30 32 however both willingness to pay surveys and macroeconomic estimates of the economic costs of droughts and related water use restrictions are characterized by high uncertainties recognising these large uncertainties the national infrastructure commission 59 analysed the counterfactual scenario of providing emergency supplies e g moving water by road or sea tankers and emergency desalination these emergency drought interventions are considered to be plausible alternatives to severe restrictions on water use in large parts of the country the short term cost of emergency interventions during the severe and extreme drought scenarios were compared with the long term cost of building proactive resilience through investments in water infrastructure demand management and leakage reduction to the same drought events fig 4 shows the comparison of the two costs for four different combinations of drought climate change and population growth the darker coloured bars represent the cost of emergency supplies while the lighter bars represent the cost of proactive resilience on a discounted time horizon to 2050 the cost of providing emergency drought supplies was found to exceed the cost of planned interventions to manage demand for water reduce leakage and provide strategic additional supplies in all the climate population and drought scenarios based on the results shown in fig 4 the national infrastructure commission recommended investment and policy reforms in order to proactively enhance system resilience through the three track approach of demand management fixing leakage and provision of additional supplies in particular through inter basin transfers at a strategical national level the commission found a strong case for adopting nation wide targets for resilience leakage reduction and water metering it also highlighted the potential for a more connected system through increasing inter basin transfers 3 3 5 summary the application of simulation tools to test the resilience of england s water resource system under changing climatic and demographic pressures has shown that in its current configuration the system is characterised by an increasing incidence and impact of drought events suggesting low persistence on the other hand an option appraisal exercise identified actions that are robust and adaptable given the uncertainty from climate and population scenarios and also highlighted the opportunities for more transformational changes these achievements have been supported by a shift to strategic national scale simulation tools which in itself demonstrates good adaptability of the system to embrace changes 4 conclusions this paper has explored the applicability of resilience concepts in the context of england s water supply infrastructure system the analysis has shown how the concepts and tools of risk based decision making can be used to characterise resilience through assessing persistence adaptability and transformability of a system the case study of england s water infrastructure system shows that resilience can be used to guide strategic planning of national scale water resource systems and to assess the performance of these systems under changing conditions in terms of england specific results the analysis shows that england s water resource system already incorporates aspects of persistence and adaptability at present there is potential for transformational change through increased national level strategic assessment and planning another potential for transformation is in the adoption of national targets in terms of drought resilience leakage or per capita consumption these transformations if indeed they can be considered as such are the first to be conceived explicitly in terms of resilience other general lessons from the application of resilience concepts to england s water supply system include 1 simulations models enhance understanding of water system resilience at multiple spatial scales as in many parts of the world water infrastructure in england has co evolved with changing patterns of demand associated with population growth and economic structural changes and growth this co evolution has in part been planned in anticipation of future needs whilst also being in response to events that have stressed the system besides evidence from system performance in extreme events which are by definition rare until recently there has been limited explicit understanding of water system resilience though traditional deterministic metrics like supply demand balance do give some indication of whether or not the system is resilient quantified understanding of resilience is now being greatly enhanced by the availability of simulation models that can test system response to a wide range of extreme conditions water resource system modelling in england has until recently taken place at the scale of individual water companies and has not explicitly quantified the consequences of failure at a national scale this situation is also now changing driven by growing recognition of the need to explicitly explore the trade offs between the risk of water shortages and the costs of enhancing system resilience at the national scale innovations in downscaling climate scenarios broad scale hydrology and system simulation are providing the tools to better analyse and design for system resilience the national infrastructure commission s analysis has modelled the costs and effectiveness of strategies for coping in the most extreme drought conditions meanwhile tools for scenario analysis are informing the selection of planned adaptive strategies as new insights about system resilience emerge through simulation models particular attention will need to be paid to the use of this scientific information in decision making and its interplay with existing institutional dynamics 51 2 systemic analysis identifies the potential for transformational changes a system wide analysis enables testing the potential for changes that could be discarded at sub system level as not efficient or too burdensome as the national infrastructure commission analysis shows the case for some more transformative changes only emerges when taking into account the national level picture 3 regular updating of water management plans provides framework for adaptability and persistence the requirements for water resource management plans to be updated on a five year cycle alongside the climate change risk assessment and national infrastructure assessment which are also revisited on a five yearly basis provide further inputs to resilience as would progress towards water system management at a national scale in this sense a framework for resilience building exists at least with respect to the persistence and adaptability of public water supplies 4 further steps are needed to integrate all aspects of resilience a complete systems approach for water system resilience is still work in progress as demonstrating transformability would involve expanding the set of management options to intentionally diagnose and design for transformability advances in decision making under uncertainty e g 27 85 could provide important tools to demonstrate transformability because they allow managers to assess the potential to learn about the future evolution of risks and respond to new information as it becomes available finally further steps are needed to integrate aspects related to flood risk management water quality and

20156,we explore the triumvirate of resilience persistence adaptability and transformability in the context of england s water supply infrastructure system risk based decision making and simulation models are increasingly being used to guide water resource management in england we argue that these approaches and tools are sufficient to analyse persistence and adaptability provided they incorporate systems coping and recovery during and after extreme events along with a broad framing of human economic and environmental impacts on the other hand we find that transformability is not readily incorporated into risk based decision making and related simulation tools as it relies amongst other things on the capacity of institutions to identify and implement change in england risk based concepts and simulation tools provide evidence with which to quantify water supply system persistence during shocks and adaptability on a range of timescales an historical analysis reveals the adaptability of england s water supply system in response to changing economic needs for water and societal expectations for water security as well as external drivers including conservation of the aquatic environment and the politics of privatisation of water utilities the frequency and impact of harmful drought events suggests a low degree of persistence we find a potential for transformability through more strategic national scale assessment and planning and setting up resilience targets that are consistent across the country however we also show that the system has not initiated such potentially transformational changes until very recently 1 introduction the concept of resilience has acquired increasing prominence in water policy and research over the past decade 70 this growing interest in resilience partially emerges from the awareness of the evident threats posed by water to society as well as the negative impacts of human activities on the aquatic environment this latter point is particularly important as chronic over exploitation of aquatic ecosystems is undermining their capacity to recover in turn undermining the water security services they provide 64 as resilience emerges as a framing for global water challenges it becomes important to explore its applicability to water resource management in practice is resilience just a broad objective of water resource management or can the attributes of resilience persistence adaptability and transformability be quantified in the context of a specific water resource system this paper attempts to answer this question it does so by exploring the extent to which a resilience framing can underpin national scale water planning taking england s water supply infrastructure system as an example building on the conceptual considerations presented in this special issue of water security this paper presents and discusses the existing evidence on the resilience of england s water resource system in section 2 we compare the attributes of resilience with more established risk based approaches for water management this comparison serves to demonstrate the commonalities and divergences between these different framings of water management here we also explain how simulation tools underpinning risk based decision making also provide powerful instruments to study the resilience of water resource systems in section 3 we examine the resilience of england s water supply system through a historical and quantitative analysis in section 4 we draw some general lessons from the case study 2 risk and resilience framings of water resource management 2 1 resilience elsewhere in this special issue of water security the concept of resilience has been explored in some depth herein resilience is recognised as being associated with persistence adaptability and transformability pat 28 80 boltz et al this issue the first and to some extent the second of these three concepts were already incorporated in hashimoto et al s 1982 three criteria for evaluating the performance of engineered water resource systems reliability resiliency and vulnerability in hashimoto s work these three measures describe how likely a system is to fail reliability how quickly it recovers from failure resiliency and how severe the consequences of failure may be vulnerability hashimoto s framework incorporates attributes of persistence within all three criteria it also incorporates adaptability in resiliency because this criterion reveals system boundaries and thresholds however hashimoto s framework does not describe how a system might transform itself under chronic or acute stress meaning that attributes of transformability seem to inhabit a different level in our understanding of water resource systems transformational changes as opposed to incremental ones require a paradigm shift within the system under consideration 53 as such a transformation could be regarded as a system moving from one state to another or establishing a new configuration and function when pushed beyond its present state for example in water resources management this transformation could imply a shift from isolated water supply networks e g old state to a fully connected water supply distribution system e g new state following demographic growth e g factor responsible for pushing the system in the new state such a phase transition could actually imply that the system has been unable to persist or adapt under external forcing so has changed its state for transformation to be a positive attribute of resilience we cannot be indifferent to its outcome a resilient transformation needs to be a deliberate set of choices that are designed to 1 enhance overall system function 2 introduce new system components and 3 minimize loss of system services in the face of new disturbances on a range of different spatial and temporal scales for water resource systems and all human managed systems transformability implies a role for human institutions in building capacity for transformability this capacity to recognise the need for transformation define and design the transformation implement it and monitor and evaluate its effectiveness is at the heart of water resource system transformability this reflexive process of problem identification evaluation and options appraisal implementation and monitoring is a classical management cycle this process is also implicit in integrated water resources management which also rightly emphasises the importance of engaging stakeholders in the process versions of this process are being played out in every country where there are deliberate efforts to manage water resources for the future in that sense water resources management is inherently resilience focused however where resilience thinking takes us further is by emphasising aspects of water resource systems that may otherwise be overlooked in particular those related to transformability 2 2 risk concepts relevant to framing persistence adaptability and transformability water resource management is increasingly being regarded as a risk management problem 40 33 77 especially in advanced economies that have already extensively exploited their water resources whilst less economically developed countries need to provide new beneficial water services domestic and industrial water supplies irrigation waterway navigation in advanced economies where these services are nearly universal attention shifts to managing the risks to those supplies 42 and other water related hazards such as flooding water resources management becomes a process of managing the risks to and from water where risks are here interpreted as harmful outcomes related to water the shift to a risk based approach has been further motivated by growing recognition of the uncertain impacts of climate change 41 71 a risk based approach provides an explicit framework to deal with the uncertain occurrence of water related harmful events it also provides a framework for incorporating variability on a range of timescales though hydrological variability e g in surface flows and groundwater has always been recognised traditionally planners have 1 tended to reduce the complexities of hydrological variability to simplified representative estimates of water supply and demand 11 and 2 assumed stationary statistical models of key hydroclimatic variables 49 a risk based approach involves more explicitly quantifying variability in supply and demand on a range of different timescales in order to identify the frequency severity and duration of events in which the water supply system is unable to meet demand in order to quantify risk it is necessary to explicitly quantify the potential harmful outcomes for people and the environment of water related events of a range of different severities and durations e g agricultural production losses due to a water shortage or the economic damage incurred after a flood indeed an advantage of a risk based approach is that risks are expressed in terms of the observable outcomes that people care about risk therefore provides a conceptual framework for management of water resources and delivery of water services in fig 1 we conceive of water resources management as a process of cost effectively managing harmful outcomes for people and the aquatic environment some of these outcomes can be attributed to environmental factors e g droughts floods whilst others are a consequence of human in action e g treatment plant failure that is a state when assets are no longer capable of performing their intended functions this conceptual framework unifies the various functions of a water utility s business and connects them to the two high level risks that the utility is responsible for managing risks in the future will change on a range of different timescales risk analysis provides a snapshot of risk at a given point in time subject to given assumptions adjusting those assumptions to reflect possible future scenarios provides a method for quantifying the impacts of future changes for example due to climatic changes e g shifting precipitation and evapotranspiration patterns socio economic changes e g population growth and changing patterns of demand for water and deliberate human interventions e g infrastructure investments or new regulations risk analysis thereby provides an essential tool for adaptation decision making because it allows policy makers to compare options e g building a reservoir reducing leakage from distribution networks based on their ability to cost effectively reduce risks analysis of risk provides a crucial but incomplete understanding of resilience analysis of risk seeks to explicitly consider the full range of possible stressors and shocks to which a system might be exposed risk analysis systematically considers the consequences of those shocks answering questions about the persistence of the system to shocks not all risk analyses consider the capacity of a system to cope and recover from shocks i e adaptability but the simulation methodologies that we describe below are well suited to analysing the severity and duration of disruptions for different water users strategies for persisting and to some extent adapting during disruptions can be encoded in simulation models used in risk analyses whilst methods for decision making under uncertainty provide tools for long term adaptation e g 37 39 76 later in this paper we will explore the aspects of adaptability and transformability i e the capacity of the human actors in the water system to manage resilience and envision create transformations that are not so readily incorporated in a risk based approach but first we will further consider the use of simulation modelling for analysing risk and resilience 2 3 understanding persistence adaptability and transformability through simulation models simulation models have come to play a central role in the analysis and management of water resource systems growing emphasis on resilience of these systems is further motivating the use of simulation models because resilience is inherently associated with the dynamics of a system and simulation models seek to explicitly represent those dynamics alternative methods such as linear programming which has been widely used in water resources planning e g 63 are much less suited to the analysis of risk and resilience as they do not readily enable quantification of the severity and duration of disruption or the effectiveness of strategies for coping with disruption 55 simulation modelling is particularly powerful because of the capacity to test and explore shocks and scenarios that have never happened by subjecting a simulator of a water resource system to those conditions in silico system stress testing through computer simulation is one of the most important tools for resilience testing especially when that is combined with scenario exercises for the multiple stakeholders responsible for a system 13 this approach typically referred to as exploratory modelling 4 uses simulation models to ask what if questions unravelling the implications of different assumptions and hypotheses about future trends on water related outcomes of concern e g the frequency of water shortages in order to analyse risks to a water resource system a simulation model needs to encompass relevant hazards system response to those hazards and the outcomes for people and the environment a comprehensive simulation of the resilience of a water utility would include all of the processes included in fig 1 in practice this involves several different types of simulation models addressing water supply systems water quality sewers and asset reliability here we explore the example of a typical water resource system simulator which is itself a composition of a series of coupled sub simulators the purpose of this type of simulator is to test the performance of the system under changing conditions of climate and demand system performance within a given future state is often quantified through metrics such as those defined in hashimoto et al 1982 and across ensembles of plausible futures using measures of robustness 46 these supplies may be for a variety of different users including agricultural and energy users but here our focus is upon public water supplies i e supplies to households and industries that are connected to piped networks of treated water rather than using their own private water sources even given this narrowing of the scope from the framework set out in fig 1 simulating this sub system involves coupling several different models fig 2 1 climatic boundary conditions although many methods exist for direct simulation of streamflow e g 60 45 using climate as the upstream boundary of a system simulator is attractive because i it enables simulations from climate models to be used if necessary after appropriate downscaling to test possible future climatic conditions and ii climate model outputs implicitly represent spatial and temporal dependencies between the several climatic variables that influence water resource systems most notably precipitation and the variables that determine evapotranspiration 2 surface and groundwater hydrology hydrological models transform climatic inputs notably rainfall into quantities of water that may be withdrawn from rivers and or groundwater at specified locations 79 because the quantity of water at a given location is an aggregation of a complex series of spatial temporal processes these are dynamical models though the representation of spatial complexity varies from lumped catchment models to spatially explicit gridded models 3 water supply infrastructure withdrawals storage pumping and allocation rules water resource system models simulate the functioning of the water supply infrastructure typically on daily or monthly timescales e g 84 54 system simulation models can represent rules for withdrawal of water from water bodies e g licence arrangements to preserve environmental flows operation of storage e g reservoirs groundwater and allocation of water to different users they take as input conditions projections of water demand see 4 below and can simulate the amount by which demand may be voluntarily or forcibly reduced during times of scarcity through water use restrictions 4 water use a variety of methods exist for projecting water demands from households agriculture and other economic sectors 23 traditionally models focus on low time resolution data on consumption acquired through billing or limited measurement campaigns and employ deterministic forecast methods house peters and chang 2011 for example basic estimates of domestic water consumption are typically based on projections of population and an estimate of the consumption of water per capita these approaches are still widely used in the water industry 81 but they fail to provide an accurate characterization of the response of users to different levels of restrictions and other exogenous factors such as climatic conditions recent advances in smart metering technology provide a promising avenue to advance residential water demand modelling and thus significantly improve the ability of water resource system simulators to model users response to restrictions and other demand side measures 15 advances in economic analysis also allow for an improved understanding and modelling of the impact of water use restrictions on multiple users 30 32 this understanding is crucial as it feeds directly into the cost benefit assessment of policy options needed to reduce the risk of water shortages although simulation models provide key advantages for testing water system resilience their application as shown in fig 2 entails some limitations linking different models from global climate models to hydrological models into a modelling chain can propagate uncertainty from each individual model leading to biased or overconfident projections and make it difficult to attribute total estimated uncertainty to its sources 72 climate model projections in particular are characterized by biases which mean that considerable caution is needed when interpreting them 52 hence risk analysis approaches based on the process in fig 2 should always be accompanied by extensive sensitivity analysis to identify options that robustly achieve the desired objectives that is options that perform acceptably well across a wide range of conditions even those that are outside the ones projected with the modelling chain 65 in addition advances in decision making under uncertainty now allow to explicitly account for opportunities to learn about the future evolution of risks and respond to new information as it becomes available 27 in summary simulators of the type described above can be used to analyse two attributes of resilience persistence of a water resource system with respect to climatic shocks like droughts by subjecting the simulator to a wide range of possible drought conditions including conditions that are much more severe than have been observed in the past stress testing in this way helps to identify the conditions under which the system resistance is exceeded i e it fails 12 69 adaptability on a range of different timescales capacity to cope during system failure can be explored by simulating drought management strategies e g the provision of alternative supplies or temporary permission to exceed regulatory limits on water withdrawals on longer timescales a variety of alternative strategies for increasing supply or reducing demand can be simulated simulation of alternative adaptation plans can provide evidence of the plan s expected outcomes and trade offs in the context of changed climatic conditions and socio economic demands 9 47 85 8 further evidence of adaptability and to some extent transformability can be provided by enhancing the dynamic representation of water use and decision making hydro economic models that couple system simulation with simulation of decision making by multiple agents e g farmers are now quite commonplace 10 44 and they have been applied to model a range of responses including financial hedging 29 57 and integrated management of forests and water 34 it is more challenging to simulate the reflexive behaviour by agents who chose to reconfigure a system in response to external stimuli typically these choices are taken as being exogenous however dynamic e g 7 5 75 and agent based e g 36 models are increasingly being applied to simulate endogenous feedbacks and responses to disturbances in coupled human water systems in addition water system models can be used interactively to expose managers to changing conditions identify decisions points and weakness in water management plans 83 well functioning institutions provide the capacity to foresee the effects of stressors to which a system may not as it is currently configured be able to adapt even if it implements the adaptive strategies that have been tested and optimised in simulation models this capacity is particularly important in the context of climate change adaptation where investment strategies need to be routinely re evaluated in light of new information and uncertainties in projections 24 under these circumstances institutional innovation is also required to enable system transformability which is what we describe in the next section using an example from england 3 application 3 1 overview and motivation the recent history of water resources management in england provides the focal point for the examination of the resilience of water resource systems in this paper england is unusual in the international context as direct withdrawals for agriculture are just a few percent of total withdrawals whilst public supplies account for about half of the total as such the management of the public water supply system and its infrastructure plays a central role in the system s resilience england s water resource system is a good case study as it faces major challenges with growing urban populations and changing consumption patterns the need for urban water supplies is expected to increase further 25 beside changes in demand and user behaviour england s water resource system also faces significant challenges arising from climate change 82 the uk has completed two climate change risk assessments ccra which are mandated under the 2008 climate change act each of these ccras has highlighted risks to water supplies as being one of the greatest climate risks for the uk 16 the terminology of resilience has taken hold in the english water industry to frame responses to these challenges water utilities now have a duty of resilience which was mandated in the 2014 water act the water act imposed on water utilities in england a primary duty to secure resilience as regards environmental pressures population growth and changes in consumer behaviour since then the water sector has been working to operationalise this legal responsibility the ways in which the water sector in england has framed water resilience and the decision making tools and processes that are being considered to assess options to secure resilience therefore represent an interesting and potentially important case which is the focus of this section 3 2 assessing the resilience of england s water resource system through historical analysis 3 2 1 persistence and adaptability water infrastructure in england has for the most part been regionally managed the needs for water of a growing population and industrial sector during the industrial revolution were met by cities and regions planning water infrastructure including the proliferation of reservoirs in the north and west the need for a national perspective was recognised in the 1970s with the creation of the water resources planning board at that time the planning approach was deterministic did not employ computer simulation models and emphasised supply options without much consideration of demand management uncertainties in demand or climate change the last large reservoir to be completed in england was kielder water in northumberland with a volume of 200 billion litres of water making it the country s largest reservoir it was built to provide water supplies to industries in the north east of england these industries shortly afterwards went into economic decline meaning that the stored water in that region of the country is now under utilised in 1989 the water industry in england was privatised into ten water and sewage companies and twenty nine smaller supply only companies 61 water companies were created in scotland wales and northern ireland with different public ownership arrangements privatisation of the water industry in england was a major reform of institutional configuration though it was not motivated by water security nor a pursuit of resilience the motivation came from a political ideology of privatisation and the need to increase investment by accessing private finance after a period of under investment in assets 2 the decision making process within water utilities was framed as providing an acceptable level of service i e water security for customers as users of public water supplies became known within a price cap system where the economic regulator the office of water services ofwat sets an upper limit on service tariffs increases the environmental regulator environment agency determines constraints on water abstraction and discharges to safeguard the needs of aquatic ecosystems and the water quality regulator the drinking water inspectorate provides independent assurance of the quality of drinking water water companies are required to demonstrate security of water supplies in their development of a water resources management plan wrmp every five years the wrmp looks at least 25 years into the future and includes projections of demand the impacts of climate change changes in regulatory limits on water withdrawals and associated uncertainties the five yearly cycle is designed to ensure that the wrmps are inherently adaptable they are revisited in the light of new information about system performance and new evidence about drivers of future change water withdrawals by agricultural fish farming energy and industry which together make up 1 10 28 and 12 of water withdrawals alongside 48 for public water supplies 18 are regulated by the environment agency there has been growing recognition that water withdrawals from some catchments and groundwater bodies may be environmentally unsustainable so a programme of reforming water allocation is under way 19 26 this had been given further impetus by the european water framework directive which requires all member states to ensure that water bodies have good ecological status in some respect the arrangements for water resources management that were brought into being during privatisation have functioned as intended asset management has improved and leakage from the ageing pipe network although still high at 22 1 has reduced from 30 at the time of privatisation 58 the water resource system has largely been able to maintain function in response to disruptions i e persistence with few notable exceptions in 1995 reservoirs in england s west yorkshire region ran dry and the water company yorkshire water had to transport water by truck to provide emergency supplies to its customer for a period of five months 3 in 2007 supplies to 350 000 users in gloucestershire south west england were disrupted for 17 days following flooding of mythe water treatment works 66 water use restrictions and emergency water abstractions are key measures to keep the system functioning during a disruption hosepipe restrictions i e restrictions on water use for gardening and car washing are consistently applied every few years together with emergency permits that allow water companies to abstract more water than normally allowed environment agency data provided to the 59 these measures have so far enabled the system to return to its normal functions following drought ensuring the security of public water supplies and demonstrating some level of persistence however these measures have not taken away the negative impacts of drought which are still felt by the local economy for example see 78 and the environment for example see 14 3 2 2 transformability while england s water resource system shows attributes of persistence and adaptability its potential for transformability is yet to be fully realized the wrmps provide a transparent forward planning method however they do not provide an explicit estimate of the risk of water shortages nor a strategic overview of the system at the national level 43 this latter aspect would allow planners to make the most of the available resources at national scale and plan system transformations moreover whilst each water company follows the same guidelines in producing its wrmp the target levels of service for customers vary between water companies as well as their achievement in reducing leakage and demand the limits to understanding and planning for the resilience of england s water supplies became particularly apparent in early 2012 when after two consecutive exceptionally dry winters london and the south east of england faced the possibility of water shortages 50 recognising the need for more strategic planning in 2016 the government tasked water uk the industry body representing the water utilities to conduct a study of a water resources long term planning framework wrltpf water uk 2016 unusually for an industry that had become dominated by analysis at the scale of individual water companies the wrltpf took a national perspective and examined a range of strategic supply options including more transfers of water between water companies a further step in this shift was made by the national infrastructure commission which was brought into being in 2015 to provide strategic advice to the government on the uk s infrastructure needs and priorities in 2018 the national infrastructure commission undertook a strategic review of water supply infrastructure 59 in the meantime water companies have successfully developed an approach for working together into regional groups which are joined together in the national framework provided by the government and regulators the role of regional planning has been given a statutory role by the recent environment bill 2019 there is also a recent move toward setting and adopting national targets related to resilience the national infrastructure commission has recommended that companies plan for being resilient to a drought with annual probability of 0 2 59 the industry and government adopted a target to halve the level of leakage by 2050 20 and the government is also exploring the possibility of establishing a target for per capita consumption 21 and 22 as well as other environment related targets this is a notable shift from the status quo of each company establishing their own ambitions in the area largely driven by a combination of costs and customers willingness to pay nic 2019 these reflect the potential for transformability of england s water supply institutions i e the capacity of water supply institutions to transform themselves to anticipate and respond to changing threats it remains to be seen whether the above actions and institutional reforms will be operationalised into transformational changes of the system that demonstrably enhances resilience 3 3 measuring persistence adaptability and transformability of england s water resource system through simulation in england the requirements for a national perspective on water resources and for an explicit understanding of risk and resilience have driven innovation in simulation modelling established methods have proved not to be adequate to provide quantified estimates of risks of water shortages or to explore the benefits in terms of risk reduction and costs of policies and investments to improve the resilience of water supplies 43 this resulted in the development of a risk based approach that as discussed in section 2 2 can be used to analyse the resilience of the system in particular the attributes of persistence and adaptability and to a lesser extent transformability here we give a short overview of these tools and the interpretation of the results in terms of the three aspects of resilience 3 3 1 climatic boundary conditions a combination of i historic drought observations and reconstructions 74 and ii synthetic droughts consistent with possible future climatic conditions has been established to stress test the resilience of water resource systems in england synthetic droughts have been generated using a very large ensemble of regional climate model simulations run with the weather home w h modelling system 38 the w h simulations generated 40 000 years of synthetic weather conditions which included some extremely severe and prolonged droughts future projections were generated for the periods 2020 2049 and 2070 2099 3 3 2 surface and groundwater hydrology the water industry in england has widely used the future flows simulations 67 68 to test water supply security under extreme drought conditions the future flows simulations are a consistent set of daily river flow and monthly groundwater levels time series across england and wales generated using regional climate model output and the national grid2grid model 6 as shown in section 3 3 3 they enable the investigation of the impact of unprecedented droughts i e droughts longer and more severe than the ones present in the historical record on water supply security advances in national hydrological models hold promise for further hydrological stress testing in england the dynatop 56 and gr4j 73 catchment hydrological models have been calibrated nationally and run with all of the w h climate simulations these national hydrological models are still under development in particular to better represent groundwater yields water withdrawals and discharges back into rivers 17 given that the greatest hydrological disturbances to the water supply system are likely to cover multiple regions of england and the uk more broadly the development of a spatially coherent representation of hydrology at a national scale is essential 3 3 3 water supply infrastructure and water use since privatisation of the water industry planning and operation of water supply infrastructure has been done at the level of individual water companies some agreements for transfer of water between neighbouring companies existed before privatisation so have been assumed to be inputs outputs to from these company systems however the resilience of the national system as a whole incorporating all the water supply zones was not scrutinised until the water uk 2016 and nic 2018 studies mentioned above the nic 2018 quantified the additional water supply capacity needed under different scenarios of population growth climate change and drought fig 3 two climate change and population scenarios were used to represent underlying average conditions while three drought scenarios from the future flows ensemble section 3 3 2 were employed to simulate the system s response under extreme circumstances 59 a national water infrastructure system model see 48 was used to calculate future water balances under the different scenario combinations and quantify the additional capacity required in case of drought under historic drought conditions 1 annual probability an additional capacity of about 2700 3000 million litres per day would be required in england to avoid having to impose prolonged water use restrictions on domestic users under a severe drought 0 5 annual probability and an extreme drought 0 2 annual probability an additional 600 1000 million litres per day would be required as shown in fig 3 the south east of england emerges as the most vulnerable region to drought highlighting its water infrastructure needs further analysis is required to integrate aspects of water quality and freshwater ecosystem response to these estimates e g 35 3 3 4 costs and benefits of interventions to achieve resilience to appraise options to counteract drought in england the national infrastructure commission compared the cost of deploying emergency drought interventions with the cost of proactively providing resilience through new infrastructure water demand management and leakage reduction the economic cost of drought is generally quantified by studying expressed willingness to pay to avoid restrictions on water use for domestic users in england these have been estimated to be about 160 per household per day water uk 2016 macro economic estimates of the impacts of water restrictions on industrial supply and demand have also been developed 30 32 however both willingness to pay surveys and macroeconomic estimates of the economic costs of droughts and related water use restrictions are characterized by high uncertainties recognising these large uncertainties the national infrastructure commission 59 analysed the counterfactual scenario of providing emergency supplies e g moving water by road or sea tankers and emergency desalination these emergency drought interventions are considered to be plausible alternatives to severe restrictions on water use in large parts of the country the short term cost of emergency interventions during the severe and extreme drought scenarios were compared with the long term cost of building proactive resilience through investments in water infrastructure demand management and leakage reduction to the same drought events fig 4 shows the comparison of the two costs for four different combinations of drought climate change and population growth the darker coloured bars represent the cost of emergency supplies while the lighter bars represent the cost of proactive resilience on a discounted time horizon to 2050 the cost of providing emergency drought supplies was found to exceed the cost of planned interventions to manage demand for water reduce leakage and provide strategic additional supplies in all the climate population and drought scenarios based on the results shown in fig 4 the national infrastructure commission recommended investment and policy reforms in order to proactively enhance system resilience through the three track approach of demand management fixing leakage and provision of additional supplies in particular through inter basin transfers at a strategical national level the commission found a strong case for adopting nation wide targets for resilience leakage reduction and water metering it also highlighted the potential for a more connected system through increasing inter basin transfers 3 3 5 summary the application of simulation tools to test the resilience of england s water resource system under changing climatic and demographic pressures has shown that in its current configuration the system is characterised by an increasing incidence and impact of drought events suggesting low persistence on the other hand an option appraisal exercise identified actions that are robust and adaptable given the uncertainty from climate and population scenarios and also highlighted the opportunities for more transformational changes these achievements have been supported by a shift to strategic national scale simulation tools which in itself demonstrates good adaptability of the system to embrace changes 4 conclusions this paper has explored the applicability of resilience concepts in the context of england s water supply infrastructure system the analysis has shown how the concepts and tools of risk based decision making can be used to characterise resilience through assessing persistence adaptability and transformability of a system the case study of england s water infrastructure system shows that resilience can be used to guide strategic planning of national scale water resource systems and to assess the performance of these systems under changing conditions in terms of england specific results the analysis shows that england s water resource system already incorporates aspects of persistence and adaptability at present there is potential for transformational change through increased national level strategic assessment and planning another potential for transformation is in the adoption of national targets in terms of drought resilience leakage or per capita consumption these transformations if indeed they can be considered as such are the first to be conceived explicitly in terms of resilience other general lessons from the application of resilience concepts to england s water supply system include 1 simulations models enhance understanding of water system resilience at multiple spatial scales as in many parts of the world water infrastructure in england has co evolved with changing patterns of demand associated with population growth and economic structural changes and growth this co evolution has in part been planned in anticipation of future needs whilst also being in response to events that have stressed the system besides evidence from system performance in extreme events which are by definition rare until recently there has been limited explicit understanding of water system resilience though traditional deterministic metrics like supply demand balance do give some indication of whether or not the system is resilient quantified understanding of resilience is now being greatly enhanced by the availability of simulation models that can test system response to a wide range of extreme conditions water resource system modelling in england has until recently taken place at the scale of individual water companies and has not explicitly quantified the consequences of failure at a national scale this situation is also now changing driven by growing recognition of the need to explicitly explore the trade offs between the risk of water shortages and the costs of enhancing system resilience at the national scale innovations in downscaling climate scenarios broad scale hydrology and system simulation are providing the tools to better analyse and design for system resilience the national infrastructure commission s analysis has modelled the costs and effectiveness of strategies for coping in the most extreme drought conditions meanwhile tools for scenario analysis are informing the selection of planned adaptive strategies as new insights about system resilience emerge through simulation models particular attention will need to be paid to the use of this scientific information in decision making and its interplay with existing institutional dynamics 51 2 systemic analysis identifies the potential for transformational changes a system wide analysis enables testing the potential for changes that could be discarded at sub system level as not efficient or too burdensome as the national infrastructure commission analysis shows the case for some more transformative changes only emerges when taking into account the national level picture 3 regular updating of water management plans provides framework for adaptability and persistence the requirements for water resource management plans to be updated on a five year cycle alongside the climate change risk assessment and national infrastructure assessment which are also revisited on a five yearly basis provide further inputs to resilience as would progress towards water system management at a national scale in this sense a framework for resilience building exists at least with respect to the persistence and adaptability of public water supplies 4 further steps are needed to integrate all aspects of resilience a complete systems approach for water system resilience is still work in progress as demonstrating transformability would involve expanding the set of management options to intentionally diagnose and design for transformability advances in decision making under uncertainty e g 27 85 could provide important tools to demonstrate transformability because they allow managers to assess the potential to learn about the future evolution of risks and respond to new information as it becomes available finally further steps are needed to integrate aspects related to flood risk management water quality and

20157,water security is key to planetary resilience for human society to flourish in the face of global change atmospheric moisture recycling the process of water evaporating from land flowing through the atmosphere and falling out again as precipitation over land is the invisible mechanism by which water influences resilience that is the capacity to persist adapt and transform through land use change mainly by agricultural expansion humans are destabilizing and modifying moisture recycling and precipitation patterns across the world here we provide an overview of how moisture recycling changes may threaten tropical forests dryland ecosystems agriculture production river flows and water supplies in megacities and review the budding literature that explores possibilities to more consciously manage and govern moisture recycling novel concepts such as the precipitationshed allows for the source region of precipitation to be understood addressed and incorporated in existing water resources tools and sustainability frameworks we conclude that achieving water security and resilience requires that we understand the implications of human influence on moisture recycling and that new research is paving the way for future possibilities to manage and mitigate potentially catastrophic effects of land use and water system change keywords water precipitation evaporation moisture recycling resilience system dynamics water governance 1 introduction the movement and availability of water through surface soil and atmosphere is an important biophysical basis for water security and is crucial for the resilience of human society resilience includes the ability to persist in the face of a perturbation to adapt to change and to transform leading to new system configurations of functions and interactions 1 water resilience can be defined as the role of water in enhancing this persistence adaptability and transformability of a desired system state 2 3 today in a new era of social hydro ecological dynamics 4 6 significant anthropogenic impacts to the water cycle are re wiring human water dynamics and compromising the capacity of the biosphere to support the human endeavor while much of the focus in water management is on the visible water flows in rivers and the use and pollution of this water by humans most global freshwater flows are largely invisible each year 70 000 to 100 000 km3 of water evaporates from land into the atmosphere where it combines with oceanic evaporation then 100 000 to 130 000 km3 yr 1 of atmospheric water falls as precipitation on land providing the water that eventually flows off the land into the rivers and back to the ocean 7 these atmospheric water flows vastly surpass the 45 000 km3 yr 1 of global river flows 8 ocean to land moisture transport notably through atmospheric rivers 9 10 and monsoon systems 11 13 provides about 60 of precipitation on land conversely land to land moisture transport driven by terrestrial evaporation accounts for 40 of precipitation over land 14 this process of evaporation from land traveling through the atmosphere as vapor and returning to the land surface as precipitation is often referred to as terrestrial moisture recycling fig 1 a which is the focus of this paper for brevity we will simply refer to terrestrial moisture recycling as moisture recycling in this article broadly speaking precipitation occurs under specific circumstances including the availability of water vapor proximity to saturation and a dynamic or thermodynamic process that can drive precipitation 15 the intensity and pattern of moisture recycling also depends on evaporation and transpiration patterns 17 geographic location 18 and spatial scale 19 vegetation plays a particularly important role as it can alter the evaporative flow from land to atmosphere and thus regulates not only regional water availability but also precipitation elsewhere the relative role of vegetation varies strongly on a regional basis fig 1 bc and with seasons 20 the flow of evaporation can be in the form of fast fluxes of water vapor water that evaporates quickly after being intercepted by the land and vegetation surfaces such as the forest floor and canopy or slow fluxes water that evaporates after infiltrating into soil moisture and used for biomass production in plants as transpiration or that evaporates from open water while fast fluxes are most important for maintaining a quick turnover of moisture recycling locally slow fluxes occur long into the dry period and help support more distant precipitation during dry seasons 21 moisture recycling offers a mechanism through which processes and management of land can affect both the quantity and spatio temporal distribution of invisible atmospheric flows of water and consequently the resilience of the ecological and social ecological systems that depend on it anthropogenic influences on terrestrial evaporation include climate change induced modification of temperature and water availability 23 24 carbon dioxide fertilization 25 and land use changes such as deforestation irrigated croplands and reservoirs 26 28 land use change further has the ability to modify circulation patterns such as through the influence of irrigation on monsoon onset in the indian sub continent 17 and afforestation impacts to wind directions in the amazon 29 because rainfall is a key determinant of the local hydroclimate that ecosystems and societies have adapted to substantial and abrupt changes in moisture recycling can lead to a reduction of local resilience and increase the risk for irreversible regime shifts based on a review of water related regime shifts falkenmark et al 2019 proposed moisture feedback as one of eight core resilience functions of water 3 in this paper we summarise the current state of knowledge on human influences to moisture recycling and on the contribution of atmospheric moisture recycling to water security and the resilience of different ecological and social ecological systems both locally and at a distance we then consider implications for governance and the importance of a planetary perspective on building a water resilient future 1 1 regime shifts and resilience a regime shift refers to a large and abrupt system wide re configuration of interactions and or functions often triggered by an external perturbation or change in internal dynamics 30 33 regime shifts can be non linear with gradual changes leading to abrupt responses in the system they occur when system thresholds are passed for some systems they are easily reversible however in most regime shifts internal feedbacks among system drivers change resulting in hysteresis effects where the external drivers need to be restored beyond the point when the regime shift happened this may be both very costly and difficult to reverse or even irreversible in the context of moisture recycling the key dimensions are precipitation and vegetative cover in some cases the transition from low to high vegetation cover is continuous fig 2 a while in other systems especially tropical forest systems a hysteresis may exist between a lower vegetation savanna state and a higher vegetation forest cover state fig 2b 2 evidence of moisture recycling influence on water resilience in various systems 2 1 tropical rainforests forests are disproportionately important to the global water cycle owing to their high and persistent evaporation rates e g tropical evergreen broadleaf forests currently occupy about 10 of the earth s land surface but contribute 22 of land evaporation and receive 29 of precipitation on land 20 forests in general including tropical broadleaf forests sustain transpiration long into rainless periods through their high soil moisture holding capacity and roots that reach deeper water in the soil while also supplying high evaporation rates from interception of rainfall in the canopy forest floor as well as tree trunk vegetation and lichen 20 36 38 conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land or pasture generally decreases soil moisture and interception storage consequently this decreases evaporation the amount of moisture recycled and precipitation available for downwind regions the average moisture recycling over the large continuous tropical forests of amazon and congo is 25 45 depending on moisture tracking methods and study region selection 39 40 in parts of the amazon and congo up to 50 of the forest precipitation originates from the forest itself 41 internal moisture recycling in forests is especially important during drought years when in the amazon and congo for instance recycling increases by 7 15 41 42 decreasing amounts of precipitation both annual and seasonal over tropical forests is strongly connected to forest resilience with a forest savanna bistability range of 1000 2400 mm yr 1 of precipitation 34 43 for a savanna to return to a forest requires higher precipitation rates than the rainfall level that caused forest collapse due to hysteresis induced by moisture recycling and fire feedbacks fig 2b moisture recycling feedbacks are further important in large continuous forest areas as they allow deforestation induced declines in evaporation to cascade leading to self amplified forest loss when precipitation decreases 21 35 44 45 the fundamental importance of moisture recycling for both sustaining tropical forest structure function and for regulating the flow of moisture to downwind regions suggests that forests will need to be a key point of consideration in understanding the relationship between water security and moisture recycling 2 2 drylands and savannas drylands and savannas typically experience water scarcity accompanied by high temperatures drylands are not necessarily characterized by low rainfall but their high mean temperatures and strong seasonality with long drought periods mean that a high proportion of the precipitation is evaporated nonetheless plant dryland ecosystems and biodiversity are extremely well adapted to this characteristic water scarcity and climatic variability dryland plant ecosystems show many specific adaptations to water stress including the ability to limit transpiration by storing water within the plant to develop deep roots that reach deep soil moisture or groundwater or to become dormant through long dry spells 38 46 moisture recycling fosters resilience in drylands through stabilizing vegetation driven ecohydrological feedbacks 47 48 fig 3 these feedbacks include maintenance of plant community structure and the associated plant water storage 49 50 as aridity increases the bistability between a vegetated and unvegetated state can become more abrupt 51 underlining the importance of the interplay among vegetation feedbacks and atmospheric moisture recycling feedbacks in the extremely arid kalahari when woody vegetation with the associated relatively higher soil moisture flips to an absence of vegetation and soil moisture this leads to increased system unpredictability 52 thus the delicate ecohydrological balance of dryland vegetation suggests that the functional characteristics of this recycling can change abruptly evidence suggests that moderate tree cover in the dry tropics can be beneficial for water availability by maximising groundwater recharge 53 others show that grasslands can potentially better withstand extreme weather events than forests in semi arid regions under climate change 54 it remains to be studied how moisture recycling affects hydrologically optimal tree cover in dryland regions under climate change 2 3 agriculture 2 3 1 rainfed agriculture rainfed agriculture comprises between 60 and 80 of global food production 55 57 specifically water productivity in dryland agricultural production systems tends to be extremely low 58 yet dryland agriculture provides the primary livelihood for about 8 of the world population many of whom live in extreme poverty 59 supplemental irrigation is often not possible due to the scarcity or inaccessibility of 58 60 surface water resources 58 60 moreover possibilities to secure food supplies through international trade can be limited by a lack of either economic or physical access to imported food 61 even small declines in precipitation could therefore have disproportionately large impacts on agricultural yields and food security of dryland communities 58 also rainfall seasonality e g onset length and magnitude of growing season rainfall has a significant impact on the functioning of dryland rainfed agriculture and ecosystems examples from the sahel suggest that besides sufficient seasonal rainfall length of the rainy season and steady rainfall after the first wet spells when seeds tend to be sown are crucial for successful harvest 62 recent studies have emphasised the importance of moisture recycling in the resilience of rainfed agricultural systems bagley et al 63 found that land use change in the evaporation sources of major global breadbaskets could reduce their moisture availability from between 8 and 17 with significant impacts on grain yields ranging from 1 to 17 particularly in arid regions such as the central asian wheat belt keys et al 16 studied the moisture recycling of seven locations where rainfed agriculture is particularly vulnerable to reductions in precipitation and found that some regions notably in east asia are more vulnerable to land use change pressure in key evaporation source regions expansion of agriculture at the expense of the amazon has also been shown to be a hydrologic no win situation due to decreased crop yields caused by reduction in rainfall supplied by forest evaporation 64 besides managing upwind moisture supply regions rainfed agriculture can also do more to foster resilient and adaptable agricultural systems while maintaining its own moisture recycling self regulation and downwind provision of moisture the primary method here is the vapor shift i e shifting soil moisture evaporation to agriculturally productive plant transpiration 58 65 2 3 2 irrigated agriculture irrigation induced evaporation is known to have strong impacts on the hydrological cycle globally and regionally for instance de vrese et al 66 found that over a third of the annual mean precipitation in some of the arid regions of eastern africa can be attributed to moisture recycling from irrigated agriculture in asia evaporation arising from irrigated agriculture contributes significantly to rainfall in asia as well comprising between 7 to 15 of indian pakistani nepalese and tibetan precipitation and over 20 in parts of northern pakistan 67 this pattern holds true in north america as well in the great plains of the us irrigation in nebraska oklahoma south dakota and kansas has been associated with enhanced precipitation throughout the midwestern states 68 coupled regional climate modelling shows that irrigation in the california central valley can be linked to runoff increases of about 30 in the colorado river 69 broadly increased groundwater extraction to mitigate changes in moisture recycling provides a false sense of water security and instead undermines resilience a common limitation of current global hydrologic models is their limited capacity to account for decreases in river flow caused by groundwater withdrawal withdrawals from the us high plains aquifer from 1940 1980 outweighed insignificant local precipitation increases and caused moderate to severe river flow depletion through a decline in groundwater levels 70 in arid european regions there is a clear inverse relationship between a decrease in moisture recycling and increases in groundwater use 71 as groundwater resources eventually disappear the agricultural systems adapted to this practice may struggle 2 4 river flows moisture recycling studies have often used river basins as their study region to analyse internal basin recycling 39 72 the sources of precipitation over a basin 40 73 and the fate of evaporation from a basin 17 anthropogenic modifications of river flows such as construction of reservoirs and water transfers also greatly affect evaporation 74 and presumably moisture recycling recently coupled land atmosphere modelling has more directly studied the effect of deforestation and irrigation on river flows through moisture recycling using a coupled land surface moisture recycling framework wang erlandsson et al 75 show that taking moisture recycling into account i e allowing evaporation change to change precipitation almost halves the estimate of human land use change impacts on globally aggregated river flow from 1200 km3 yr 1 to 650 km3 yr 1 their results exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity in the congo volga and ob basins river flow increases are reduced by more than half in the amazon river flow increases drop radically from 1630 to 270 m3 s 1 and in the yenisei the sign of river flow change is reversed from an increase 150 m3 s 1 to a decrease 220 m3 s 1 the ability of land atmosphere feedbacks to reverse the sign of change in river flow has also been shown under a business as usual deforestation scenario in the xingu river basin in the amazon where accounting for land atmosphere feedbacks switched river flow change estimates from an increase of 10 12 to a decrease of 30 36 76 weng et al 77 further show that the heterogeneity of moisture recycling effects on amazonian river flows extend to sub basin levels and identify sensitive sink and influential source regions the combined effect of land use change on river flows through changes in the water balance depends on complex interactions among spatial and temporal dynamics among ground surface and atmospheric water flows in addition to the need for saturation and dynamical drivers e g cooling or lifting it is also important to evaluate what configurations of internal versus external land use changes lead to persistence in precipitation supply facilitate adaptation in part of the river basin or completely transform the function and structure of the river basin the critical issue of how river resilience is affected by feedbacks between river flow change and moisture recycling remains to be investigated 2 5 megacities urban regions are rapidly expanding increasing demands on scarce water resources the water security of urban areas is a hotly studied topic 78 and the surface water that urban areas depend on is in many cases exposed to various moisture recycling pressures keys et al 79 found that for 29 global megacities municipal water was sourced from surface water supplies or actively recharged groundwater which ultimately rely on precipitation falling within the watershed factors impacting moisture recycling such as the pace of land use change sensitivity to dry vs wet year dynamics and pre existing water scarcity were particularly important understanding and managing moisture recycling see section 3 may need to be a part of designs to accommodate the needs of growing urban populations urban water infrastructure is commonly designed for robustness to and recovery from water stresses and extreme events with buffering capacity enabled by reservoirs canals pipes treatment and distribution networks 80 these engineered approaches to water system resilience contribute to reliability predictability and to adaptability but represent a more limited capacity to transform 3 management and governance of moisture recycling tools and concepts 3 1 basic spatial units of moisture recycling precipitationshed and evaporationshed given the central role that terrestrial moisture recycling plays in water security it would be useful to have an approach that a can assist in the identification of areas that provide rainfall to a given location and b is flexible enough to incorporate multiple datasets models and spatial and temporal scales the precipitationshed serves this purpose and is defined as the upwind surface both water and land that contributes evaporation to a given location s precipitation fig 4 also see keys et al 16 as depicted evaporation rises up from the surface flows through the atmosphere and falls as precipitation downwind 3 2 integrating scales and boundaries of moisture recycling governance and social ecological systems managing moisture recycling for resilience requires a recognition of the complexity of moisture recycling systems keys and wang erlandsson 4 describe this complexity in terms of moisture recycling social ecological systems that can range along a spectrum from isolated regional to telecoupled an example of a telecoupled moisture recycling system is the precipitationshed for the country of bolivia moisture recycling provides a biogeophysical connection from the brazilian and peruvian amazon to bolivia s precipitation however socioeconomic infrastructure e g roads telecoms and institutions e g biological preserves international treaties create telecoupled connections and feedbacks increasing both system complexity and making deterministic policies or management unsuitable in terms of the evidence presented earlier management can mean a variety of different things first rainfed systems such as forests drylands and rainfed agriculture can be thought of as both providers of evaporation i e sources as well as beneficiaries i e sinks moisture recycling management of these landscapes thus ought to reflect this duality giving thought to both the key aspects of evaporation flow as well as precipitation however some other types of moisture recycling systems are one or the other such as irrigation systems which are primarily generators of evaporation to the atmosphere or urban systems which are primarily users of runoff that is generated by terrestrial moisture recycling in these cases the management might take a different form since it is focused on a specific part of the atmospheric water cycle knowledge of moisture recycling system architecture does not on its own confer an ability to manage moisture recycling an understanding of system lags and feedbacks is also critical to appreciate the appropriate temporal and spatial scales for measurement monitoring and determination of management efficacy keys and falkenmark 65 suggest that different socio hydrology systems operate at different timescales often nested within one another additionally the ability to detect an anthropogenic change in moisture recycling is complicated by internal climate variability 81 limited work examines the types of moisture recycling connections that may exist particularly among nations and the types of governance appropriate for each 82 83 however unlike surface water atmospheric water does not channel into creeks streams and rivers but rather flows continuously with wind currents around the planet despite hypothetical examples intentional management and governance of moisture recycling remains highly theoretical yet substantial evidence relates moisture recycling to the function and resilience of ecological and human systems alike consequently we must understand how changes in land use modification of surface and groundwater systems agriculture and urbanization are not only changing terrestrial landscapes but are altering vital planetary water flows 3 3 integration of moisture recycling in existing sustainability management tools and frameworks blending moisture recycling into existing sustainability efforts is essential to regional and planetary resilience moisture recycling has been scientifically described and evaluated as a key ecosystem service globally and its inclusion in existing ecosystem service frameworks has been outlined 22 likewise moisture recycling should be included in environmental and natural resource governance efforts such as international conservation mechanisms and planning methods and potentially in trade and certification programs or other market and multilateral instruments 83 studies are further exploring the possibility to incorporate moisture recycling in water footprint assessments 84 which otherwise conventionally regard evaporation as a loss 85 at the largest possible scale the planetary boundary framework which is used in sustainability policy and governance proposes limits to water modifications for earth to remain habitable for humanity 86 moisture recycling is currently only implicitly accounted for in the planetary boundary for freshwater use through the proxy variable total blue water consumption 86 87 and in the land system change boundary 88 to explicitly account for human modifications of different components in the water cycle a proposed revision of the water planetary boundary suggests six sub boundaries one of which concerns the role of moisture recycling for maintaining the stability of the atmospheric circulation system 89 ongoing work aims to determine the most important distributed hydrologic units for maintaining the stability of the atmospheric circulation system such as keystone regions which are disproportionately important to the earth system 90 91 4 conclusions understanding moisture recycling can nurture water resilience moisture recycling and human interactions are only beginning to be understood anthropogenic changes to the land surface in one location have significant potential to impact completely different disconnected regions accordingly we must develop a better scientific understanding and more suitable models for land atmosphere interactions and regime shifts this is particularly urgent as moisture recycling through its influence on precipitation has profound implications for humanity from agriculture forestry and urban water security to regional climatic stability and earth system resilience tropical forests serve as one of the most critical biomes for maintaining moisture recycling globally and are thus critical to water resilience drylands and rainfed agriculture both exhibit a dependence on moisture recycling but also a complex self regulatory role that is still not fully understood irrigated systems especially those driven by groundwater increase short term moisture recycling and perceived resilience but threaten long term resilience when societies overdraw groundwater to meet precipitation deficits finally urban areas depend on their upwind hinterlands for stable and predictable sources of precipitation in this way moisture recycling further underscores water s role as a master variable for the resilience of human civilization recent research points at multiple possibilities to address moisture recycling in management and governance introducing the management unit of precipitionshed considering vegetation regulated moisture recycling as an ecosystem service as well as incorporation of moisture recycling in existing water resources tools and concepts existing efforts to consider moisture recycling in water footprinting river basin management and planetary boundaries are only at the exploration stage and future work needs to both dive deeper into local regional contexts and explore potential synergies with other sustainability management frameworks humanity has already unintentionally and substantially engineered precipitation patterns through land use change and conscious protection of the terrestrial water cycle is now urgently

20157,water security is key to planetary resilience for human society to flourish in the face of global change atmospheric moisture recycling the process of water evaporating from land flowing through the atmosphere and falling out again as precipitation over land is the invisible mechanism by which water influences resilience that is the capacity to persist adapt and transform through land use change mainly by agricultural expansion humans are destabilizing and modifying moisture recycling and precipitation patterns across the world here we provide an overview of how moisture recycling changes may threaten tropical forests dryland ecosystems agriculture production river flows and water supplies in megacities and review the budding literature that explores possibilities to more consciously manage and govern moisture recycling novel concepts such as the precipitationshed allows for the source region of precipitation to be understood addressed and incorporated in existing water resources tools and sustainability frameworks we conclude that achieving water security and resilience requires that we understand the implications of human influence on moisture recycling and that new research is paving the way for future possibilities to manage and mitigate potentially catastrophic effects of land use and water system change keywords water precipitation evaporation moisture recycling resilience system dynamics water governance 1 introduction the movement and availability of water through surface soil and atmosphere is an important biophysical basis for water security and is crucial for the resilience of human society resilience includes the ability to persist in the face of a perturbation to adapt to change and to transform leading to new system configurations of functions and interactions 1 water resilience can be defined as the role of water in enhancing this persistence adaptability and transformability of a desired system state 2 3 today in a new era of social hydro ecological dynamics 4 6 significant anthropogenic impacts to the water cycle are re wiring human water dynamics and compromising the capacity of the biosphere to support the human endeavor while much of the focus in water management is on the visible water flows in rivers and the use and pollution of this water by humans most global freshwater flows are largely invisible each year 70 000 to 100 000 km3 of water evaporates from land into the atmosphere where it combines with oceanic evaporation then 100 000 to 130 000 km3 yr 1 of atmospheric water falls as precipitation on land providing the water that eventually flows off the land into the rivers and back to the ocean 7 these atmospheric water flows vastly surpass the 45 000 km3 yr 1 of global river flows 8 ocean to land moisture transport notably through atmospheric rivers 9 10 and monsoon systems 11 13 provides about 60 of precipitation on land conversely land to land moisture transport driven by terrestrial evaporation accounts for 40 of precipitation over land 14 this process of evaporation from land traveling through the atmosphere as vapor and returning to the land surface as precipitation is often referred to as terrestrial moisture recycling fig 1 a which is the focus of this paper for brevity we will simply refer to terrestrial moisture recycling as moisture recycling in this article broadly speaking precipitation occurs under specific circumstances including the availability of water vapor proximity to saturation and a dynamic or thermodynamic process that can drive precipitation 15 the intensity and pattern of moisture recycling also depends on evaporation and transpiration patterns 17 geographic location 18 and spatial scale 19 vegetation plays a particularly important role as it can alter the evaporative flow from land to atmosphere and thus regulates not only regional water availability but also precipitation elsewhere the relative role of vegetation varies strongly on a regional basis fig 1 bc and with seasons 20 the flow of evaporation can be in the form of fast fluxes of water vapor water that evaporates quickly after being intercepted by the land and vegetation surfaces such as the forest floor and canopy or slow fluxes water that evaporates after infiltrating into soil moisture and used for biomass production in plants as transpiration or that evaporates from open water while fast fluxes are most important for maintaining a quick turnover of moisture recycling locally slow fluxes occur long into the dry period and help support more distant precipitation during dry seasons 21 moisture recycling offers a mechanism through which processes and management of land can affect both the quantity and spatio temporal distribution of invisible atmospheric flows of water and consequently the resilience of the ecological and social ecological systems that depend on it anthropogenic influences on terrestrial evaporation include climate change induced modification of temperature and water availability 23 24 carbon dioxide fertilization 25 and land use changes such as deforestation irrigated croplands and reservoirs 26 28 land use change further has the ability to modify circulation patterns such as through the influence of irrigation on monsoon onset in the indian sub continent 17 and afforestation impacts to wind directions in the amazon 29 because rainfall is a key determinant of the local hydroclimate that ecosystems and societies have adapted to substantial and abrupt changes in moisture recycling can lead to a reduction of local resilience and increase the risk for irreversible regime shifts based on a review of water related regime shifts falkenmark et al 2019 proposed moisture feedback as one of eight core resilience functions of water 3 in this paper we summarise the current state of knowledge on human influences to moisture recycling and on the contribution of atmospheric moisture recycling to water security and the resilience of different ecological and social ecological systems both locally and at a distance we then consider implications for governance and the importance of a planetary perspective on building a water resilient future 1 1 regime shifts and resilience a regime shift refers to a large and abrupt system wide re configuration of interactions and or functions often triggered by an external perturbation or change in internal dynamics 30 33 regime shifts can be non linear with gradual changes leading to abrupt responses in the system they occur when system thresholds are passed for some systems they are easily reversible however in most regime shifts internal feedbacks among system drivers change resulting in hysteresis effects where the external drivers need to be restored beyond the point when the regime shift happened this may be both very costly and difficult to reverse or even irreversible in the context of moisture recycling the key dimensions are precipitation and vegetative cover in some cases the transition from low to high vegetation cover is continuous fig 2 a while in other systems especially tropical forest systems a hysteresis may exist between a lower vegetation savanna state and a higher vegetation forest cover state fig 2b 2 evidence of moisture recycling influence on water resilience in various systems 2 1 tropical rainforests forests are disproportionately important to the global water cycle owing to their high and persistent evaporation rates e g tropical evergreen broadleaf forests currently occupy about 10 of the earth s land surface but contribute 22 of land evaporation and receive 29 of precipitation on land 20 forests in general including tropical broadleaf forests sustain transpiration long into rainless periods through their high soil moisture holding capacity and roots that reach deeper water in the soil while also supplying high evaporation rates from interception of rainfall in the canopy forest floor as well as tree trunk vegetation and lichen 20 36 38 conversion of tropical forests to agricultural land or pasture generally decreases soil moisture and interception storage consequently this decreases evaporation the amount of moisture recycled and precipitation available for downwind regions the average moisture recycling over the large continuous tropical forests of amazon and congo is 25 45 depending on moisture tracking methods and study region selection 39 40 in parts of the amazon and congo up to 50 of the forest precipitation originates from the forest itself 41 internal moisture recycling in forests is especially important during drought years when in the amazon and congo for instance recycling increases by 7 15 41 42 decreasing amounts of precipitation both annual and seasonal over tropical forests is strongly connected to forest resilience with a forest savanna bistability range of 1000 2400 mm yr 1 of precipitation 34 43 for a savanna to return to a forest requires higher precipitation rates than the rainfall level that caused forest collapse due to hysteresis induced by moisture recycling and fire feedbacks fig 2b moisture recycling feedbacks are further important in large continuous forest areas as they allow deforestation induced declines in evaporation to cascade leading to self amplified forest loss when precipitation decreases 21 35 44 45 the fundamental importance of moisture recycling for both sustaining tropical forest structure function and for regulating the flow of moisture to downwind regions suggests that forests will need to be a key point of consideration in understanding the relationship between water security and moisture recycling 2 2 drylands and savannas drylands and savannas typically experience water scarcity accompanied by high temperatures drylands are not necessarily characterized by low rainfall but their high mean temperatures and strong seasonality with long drought periods mean that a high proportion of the precipitation is evaporated nonetheless plant dryland ecosystems and biodiversity are extremely well adapted to this characteristic water scarcity and climatic variability dryland plant ecosystems show many specific adaptations to water stress including the ability to limit transpiration by storing water within the plant to develop deep roots that reach deep soil moisture or groundwater or to become dormant through long dry spells 38 46 moisture recycling fosters resilience in drylands through stabilizing vegetation driven ecohydrological feedbacks 47 48 fig 3 these feedbacks include maintenance of plant community structure and the associated plant water storage 49 50 as aridity increases the bistability between a vegetated and unvegetated state can become more abrupt 51 underlining the importance of the interplay among vegetation feedbacks and atmospheric moisture recycling feedbacks in the extremely arid kalahari when woody vegetation with the associated relatively higher soil moisture flips to an absence of vegetation and soil moisture this leads to increased system unpredictability 52 thus the delicate ecohydrological balance of dryland vegetation suggests that the functional characteristics of this recycling can change abruptly evidence suggests that moderate tree cover in the dry tropics can be beneficial for water availability by maximising groundwater recharge 53 others show that grasslands can potentially better withstand extreme weather events than forests in semi arid regions under climate change 54 it remains to be studied how moisture recycling affects hydrologically optimal tree cover in dryland regions under climate change 2 3 agriculture 2 3 1 rainfed agriculture rainfed agriculture comprises between 60 and 80 of global food production 55 57 specifically water productivity in dryland agricultural production systems tends to be extremely low 58 yet dryland agriculture provides the primary livelihood for about 8 of the world population many of whom live in extreme poverty 59 supplemental irrigation is often not possible due to the scarcity or inaccessibility of 58 60 surface water resources 58 60 moreover possibilities to secure food supplies through international trade can be limited by a lack of either economic or physical access to imported food 61 even small declines in precipitation could therefore have disproportionately large impacts on agricultural yields and food security of dryland communities 58 also rainfall seasonality e g onset length and magnitude of growing season rainfall has a significant impact on the functioning of dryland rainfed agriculture and ecosystems examples from the sahel suggest that besides sufficient seasonal rainfall length of the rainy season and steady rainfall after the first wet spells when seeds tend to be sown are crucial for successful harvest 62 recent studies have emphasised the importance of moisture recycling in the resilience of rainfed agricultural systems bagley et al 63 found that land use change in the evaporation sources of major global breadbaskets could reduce their moisture availability from between 8 and 17 with significant impacts on grain yields ranging from 1 to 17 particularly in arid regions such as the central asian wheat belt keys et al 16 studied the moisture recycling of seven locations where rainfed agriculture is particularly vulnerable to reductions in precipitation and found that some regions notably in east asia are more vulnerable to land use change pressure in key evaporation source regions expansion of agriculture at the expense of the amazon has also been shown to be a hydrologic no win situation due to decreased crop yields caused by reduction in rainfall supplied by forest evaporation 64 besides managing upwind moisture supply regions rainfed agriculture can also do more to foster resilient and adaptable agricultural systems while maintaining its own moisture recycling self regulation and downwind provision of moisture the primary method here is the vapor shift i e shifting soil moisture evaporation to agriculturally productive plant transpiration 58 65 2 3 2 irrigated agriculture irrigation induced evaporation is known to have strong impacts on the hydrological cycle globally and regionally for instance de vrese et al 66 found that over a third of the annual mean precipitation in some of the arid regions of eastern africa can be attributed to moisture recycling from irrigated agriculture in asia evaporation arising from irrigated agriculture contributes significantly to rainfall in asia as well comprising between 7 to 15 of indian pakistani nepalese and tibetan precipitation and over 20 in parts of northern pakistan 67 this pattern holds true in north america as well in the great plains of the us irrigation in nebraska oklahoma south dakota and kansas has been associated with enhanced precipitation throughout the midwestern states 68 coupled regional climate modelling shows that irrigation in the california central valley can be linked to runoff increases of about 30 in the colorado river 69 broadly increased groundwater extraction to mitigate changes in moisture recycling provides a false sense of water security and instead undermines resilience a common limitation of current global hydrologic models is their limited capacity to account for decreases in river flow caused by groundwater withdrawal withdrawals from the us high plains aquifer from 1940 1980 outweighed insignificant local precipitation increases and caused moderate to severe river flow depletion through a decline in groundwater levels 70 in arid european regions there is a clear inverse relationship between a decrease in moisture recycling and increases in groundwater use 71 as groundwater resources eventually disappear the agricultural systems adapted to this practice may struggle 2 4 river flows moisture recycling studies have often used river basins as their study region to analyse internal basin recycling 39 72 the sources of precipitation over a basin 40 73 and the fate of evaporation from a basin 17 anthropogenic modifications of river flows such as construction of reservoirs and water transfers also greatly affect evaporation 74 and presumably moisture recycling recently coupled land atmosphere modelling has more directly studied the effect of deforestation and irrigation on river flows through moisture recycling using a coupled land surface moisture recycling framework wang erlandsson et al 75 show that taking moisture recycling into account i e allowing evaporation change to change precipitation almost halves the estimate of human land use change impacts on globally aggregated river flow from 1200 km3 yr 1 to 650 km3 yr 1 their results exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity in the congo volga and ob basins river flow increases are reduced by more than half in the amazon river flow increases drop radically from 1630 to 270 m3 s 1 and in the yenisei the sign of river flow change is reversed from an increase 150 m3 s 1 to a decrease 220 m3 s 1 the ability of land atmosphere feedbacks to reverse the sign of change in river flow has also been shown under a business as usual deforestation scenario in the xingu river basin in the amazon where accounting for land atmosphere feedbacks switched river flow change estimates from an increase of 10 12 to a decrease of 30 36 76 weng et al 77 further show that the heterogeneity of moisture recycling effects on amazonian river flows extend to sub basin levels and identify sensitive sink and influential source regions the combined effect of land use change on river flows through changes in the water balance depends on complex interactions among spatial and temporal dynamics among ground surface and atmospheric water flows in addition to the need for saturation and dynamical drivers e g cooling or lifting it is also important to evaluate what configurations of internal versus external land use changes lead to persistence in precipitation supply facilitate adaptation in part of the river basin or completely transform the function and structure of the river basin the critical issue of how river resilience is affected by feedbacks between river flow change and moisture recycling remains to be investigated 2 5 megacities urban regions are rapidly expanding increasing demands on scarce water resources the water security of urban areas is a hotly studied topic 78 and the surface water that urban areas depend on is in many cases exposed to various moisture recycling pressures keys et al 79 found that for 29 global megacities municipal water was sourced from surface water supplies or actively recharged groundwater which ultimately rely on precipitation falling within the watershed factors impacting moisture recycling such as the pace of land use change sensitivity to dry vs wet year dynamics and pre existing water scarcity were particularly important understanding and managing moisture recycling see section 3 may need to be a part of designs to accommodate the needs of growing urban populations urban water infrastructure is commonly designed for robustness to and recovery from water stresses and extreme events with buffering capacity enabled by reservoirs canals pipes treatment and distribution networks 80 these engineered approaches to water system resilience contribute to reliability predictability and to adaptability but represent a more limited capacity to transform 3 management and governance of moisture recycling tools and concepts 3 1 basic spatial units of moisture recycling precipitationshed and evaporationshed given the central role that terrestrial moisture recycling plays in water security it would be useful to have an approach that a can assist in the identification of areas that provide rainfall to a given location and b is flexible enough to incorporate multiple datasets models and spatial and temporal scales the precipitationshed serves this purpose and is defined as the upwind surface both water and land that contributes evaporation to a given location s precipitation fig 4 also see keys et al 16 as depicted evaporation rises up from the surface flows through the atmosphere and falls as precipitation downwind 3 2 integrating scales and boundaries of moisture recycling governance and social ecological systems managing moisture recycling for resilience requires a recognition of the complexity of moisture recycling systems keys and wang erlandsson 4 describe this complexity in terms of moisture recycling social ecological systems that can range along a spectrum from isolated regional to telecoupled an example of a telecoupled moisture recycling system is the precipitationshed for the country of bolivia moisture recycling provides a biogeophysical connection from the brazilian and peruvian amazon to bolivia s precipitation however socioeconomic infrastructure e g roads telecoms and institutions e g biological preserves international treaties create telecoupled connections and feedbacks increasing both system complexity and making deterministic policies or management unsuitable in terms of the evidence presented earlier management can mean a variety of different things first rainfed systems such as forests drylands and rainfed agriculture can be thought of as both providers of evaporation i e sources as well as beneficiaries i e sinks moisture recycling management of these landscapes thus ought to reflect this duality giving thought to both the key aspects of evaporation flow as well as precipitation however some other types of moisture recycling systems are one or the other such as irrigation systems which are primarily generators of evaporation to the atmosphere or urban systems which are primarily users of runoff that is generated by terrestrial moisture recycling in these cases the management might take a different form since it is focused on a specific part of the atmospheric water cycle knowledge of moisture recycling system architecture does not on its own confer an ability to manage moisture recycling an understanding of system lags and feedbacks is also critical to appreciate the appropriate temporal and spatial scales for measurement monitoring and determination of management efficacy keys and falkenmark 65 suggest that different socio hydrology systems operate at different timescales often nested within one another additionally the ability to detect an anthropogenic change in moisture recycling is complicated by internal climate variability 81 limited work examines the types of moisture recycling connections that may exist particularly among nations and the types of governance appropriate for each 82 83 however unlike surface water atmospheric water does not channel into creeks streams and rivers but rather flows continuously with wind currents around the planet despite hypothetical examples intentional management and governance of moisture recycling remains highly theoretical yet substantial evidence relates moisture recycling to the function and resilience of ecological and human systems alike consequently we must understand how changes in land use modification of surface and groundwater systems agriculture and urbanization are not only changing terrestrial landscapes but are altering vital planetary water flows 3 3 integration of moisture recycling in existing sustainability management tools and frameworks blending moisture recycling into existing sustainability efforts is essential to regional and planetary resilience moisture recycling has been scientifically described and evaluated as a key ecosystem service globally and its inclusion in existing ecosystem service frameworks has been outlined 22 likewise moisture recycling should be included in environmental and natural resource governance efforts such as international conservation mechanisms and planning methods and potentially in trade and certification programs or other market and multilateral instruments 83 studies are further exploring the possibility to incorporate moisture recycling in water footprint assessments 84 which otherwise conventionally regard evaporation as a loss 85 at the largest possible scale the planetary boundary framework which is used in sustainability policy and governance proposes limits to water modifications for earth to remain habitable for humanity 86 moisture recycling is currently only implicitly accounted for in the planetary boundary for freshwater use through the proxy variable total blue water consumption 86 87 and in the land system change boundary 88 to explicitly account for human modifications of different components in the water cycle a proposed revision of the water planetary boundary suggests six sub boundaries one of which concerns the role of moisture recycling for maintaining the stability of the atmospheric circulation system 89 ongoing work aims to determine the most important distributed hydrologic units for maintaining the stability of the atmospheric circulation system such as keystone regions which are disproportionately important to the earth system 90 91 4 conclusions understanding moisture recycling can nurture water resilience moisture recycling and human interactions are only beginning to be understood anthropogenic changes to the land surface in one location have significant potential to impact completely different disconnected regions accordingly we must develop a better scientific understanding and more suitable models for land atmosphere interactions and regime shifts this is particularly urgent as moisture recycling through its influence on precipitation has profound implications for humanity from agriculture forestry and urban water security to regional climatic stability and earth system resilience tropical forests serve as one of the most critical biomes for maintaining moisture recycling globally and are thus critical to water resilience drylands and rainfed agriculture both exhibit a dependence on moisture recycling but also a complex self regulatory role that is still not fully understood irrigated systems especially those driven by groundwater increase short term moisture recycling and perceived resilience but threaten long term resilience when societies overdraw groundwater to meet precipitation deficits finally urban areas depend on their upwind hinterlands for stable and predictable sources of precipitation in this way moisture recycling further underscores water s role as a master variable for the resilience of human civilization recent research points at multiple possibilities to address moisture recycling in management and governance introducing the management unit of precipitionshed considering vegetation regulated moisture recycling as an ecosystem service as well as incorporation of moisture recycling in existing water resources tools and concepts existing efforts to consider moisture recycling in water footprinting river basin management and planetary boundaries are only at the exploration stage and future work needs to both dive deeper into local regional contexts and explore potential synergies with other sustainability management

20158,resilience is increasingly recognized as an imperative for any prospect of sustainable development as it relates to our ability to sustain human well being and progress under the planetary and societal changes that we face now and into the future yet we are ill prepared to meet this challenge we neither fully understand nor manage consistently for resilience of the human and natural systems that we must steward through extraordinary change a unifying approach and common currency would help us to understand and manage for resilience under uncertain futures water is an essential defining element in human and natural systems human civilization and water systems have co evolved as a coupled system with the majority of natural freshwater systems transformed to meet our demands shifting patters of water availability in space and time will define key pathways and tipping points for our resilience and thus requirements for water system resilience must guide the trajectories and boundaries of human development here we consider the thesis that water offers a key to unlocking the complex challenge of designing and managing for the resilience of coupled human natural systems we examine what constitutes a resilient system what drives freshwater resilience and how pathways to human resilience may be charted and navigated through the medium of water our theoretical treatise frames a portfolio of research that tests this thesis including modeling and applications to water and water dependent systems 1 introduction when considering the complex dynamics of natural ecosystems nearly a half century ago holling 32 and his contemporaries described resilience as the ability of ecosystems to respond to changes in external conditions through internal changes in composition configuration and relationships in order to maintain coherent function resilience refers to the ability to thrive under change it has since been broadly adopted to describe the behavior not only of ecological systems but also of human systems from built infrastructure and agricultural systems to economies cities and our transformed earth system 20 27 87 today resilience is increasingly recognized as an imperative for any prospect of sustainable development as it pertains to our ability to sustain human progress in the face of change whether incremental or abrupt expected or surprising 19 understanding and building the resilience of human and natural systems is an urgent concern as we face the increasingly immediate and severe effects of earth system change on our tightly coupled human social ecological system 60 66 67 34 the earth system is currently unstable in many dimensions portending numerous possible futures and presenting urgent choices between transforming to a sustainable social organization and stewarding the earth for continued human progress or failing to preserve a biosphere suitable for our survival and precipitating the collapse of human civilization 14 it seems an insurmountable challenge to build the resilience of complex human systems to planetary and societal changes of an uncertain pace variability and magnitude complexity wedded with uncertainty is confounding thus we neither fully understand nor manage consistently for resilience rather our designs respond to those vulnerabilities most evident and acute which therefore have emerged as priorities for the affected communities in coastal low lying regions we begin with storms and sea level rise whereas in areas suffering chronic wildfires droughts or disease or pressured by demographic growth and socio economic change we design for the resilience of vulnerable populations and assets to those particular stressors more commonly with lesser ambition and an aversion to incur the costs of mitigating risks that seem less immediate we design for the least cost solution to proximate threats a coherent approach to understanding and solving for the resilience of human systems remains elusive while our current designs may not be wrong the lack of a consistent coherent approach to designing for our resilience is a crucial shortcoming at a minimum it limits our ability to evaluate alternative resilience design choices perhaps more importantly it undermines our ability to effectively identify and act on key system features crucial to resilience strategies this likely results in a greater frequency of overlooking issues affecting resilience and thus in deficient designs here we suggest that fresh water 1 here we refer exclusively to fresh water in terrestrial and atmospheric systems not saline water in marine systems throughout we use the term water for simplicity 1 can serve as a key to solving that puzzle that water is central to so many dimensions of social ecological resilience it may serve as a master variable offering a coherent approach to understanding designing and managing for resilience in the anthropocene water and climate are common defining factors of human and natural systems determining their productivity and function as well as their vulnerability to global change the warming climate will determine the magnitude of earth system change and the parameters within which we must operate to solve for our resilient future 66 67 climate change impacts will be most immediately and acutely expressed through water notably through changes in water quantity quality and distribution relative to human needs 61 and in extreme events such as flooding and droughts along with climate water dictates the diversity and distribution of the terrestrial biosphere water is central to the functioning of the earth system and is a critical determinant of the quality and quantity of ecosystem services 58 59 water of a specific quantity quality and timing is required to preserve the composition and function of natural ecosystems under localized disturbances and broader environmental change under climate change water availability and variability will define how the terrestrial biosphere adapts shifting the distribution of species and ecosystems to accommodate new conditions and thereby directly affecting established human interactions with previously prevailing environmental norms water s central role in the biosphere has long implied that many of the most important human development challenges are related to water 15 and to freshwater resilience 16 water availability has historically defined where humans could settle and produce and has thereby guided the development of societies and economies human ingenuity has enabled us to overcome the physical limits imposed by nature at least temporarily by damming and diverting water to where we choose to settle to farm and to prosper yet we have now reached a scale of human demand and water footprint that surpasses conventional solutions 45 76 79 58 16 climate change is altering patterns of water availability across the planet while human demand for water resources grows unabated 16 the increasing frequency and amplitude of water related shocks and stresses from more intense droughts and floods to seasonal shifts in precipitation are a critical resilience concern 71 70 human ingenuity is again tested as we grapple with adapting to a highly uncertain and increasingly volatile future 14 here we argue that a coherent approach to understanding and solving for the resilience of human systems under future earth system and societal change can be found by basing our designs on water water is an essential and defining element a crucial factor or a master variable guiding the nature and function of interacting human and natural systems shifting patterns of water in space and time will define key pathways and boundaries for their development and resilience as such we submit that water provides a consistent and robust basis for navigating the complexity and uncertainty of designing and managing for the resilience of coupled human natural systems we draw confidence that water offers a path to our future from the knowledge that water has defined and enabled human progress throughout history 41 83 human civilization and water systems have co evolved as a coupled social ecological system 65 41 42 our work builds upon seminal writings that form the theoretical foundations of social ecological resilience 32 21 of engineering resilience in water resources management 18 8 64 and of freshwater ecology 56 74 we consider what constitutes a resilient system what influences water system resilience and how pathways to human resilience may be charted and navigated through the medium of water related work compiled in a special issue of water security further explores this thesis including modeling metrics and scenario planning work as well as applications to water systems and to human systems dependent on water 7 10 22 26 36 44 72 75 2 conceptual framing resilient systems building upon the work of homer dixon et al 34 we define a system as a set of causally connected entities that are distinguishable as an identifiable whole and that self organize to persist in characteristic function over an extended period of time we refer to natural systems as ecological systems with identities formed by their distinct composition of species structure and relationships and with characteristic ecological

the ability to change from one type of system to another with different controlling variables structure functions and feedbacks 48 transformation results in a change in both system identity and

can reasonably predict threshold conditions and proximate equilibria to which water dependent systems may shift as has been done for agricultural systems 23 aquatic ecosystems 13 35 53 river catchments 80 and urban water systems 38 accordingly we can manage for resilience as it relates to all three capabilities persistence and adaptation within current boundaries and transformation beyond while this may appear inordinately difficult such designs are possible with water systems as we have demonstrated throughout history 41 65 83 recently resilience by design rbd has been developed to

uncertainty we should instead shift to designing for resilience pat rbd enables such calculations and comparisons 3 the resilience of freshwater ecosystems and human hydrologic systems freshwater ecosystems comprise lakes rivers aquifers marshes and other wetlands we rely upon freshwater ecosystems for many valuable services including water provisioning and quality regulation waste and storm water management sustaining productive fisheries as well as recreation aesthetics other cultural services and existence values these ecosystem services in turn depend on the functional integrity of natural freshwater ecosystems and the biodiversity they harbor freshwater resilience refers to the ability of natural freshwater ecosystems to persist adapt and transform to sustain coherent function under change 58 55 ecosystem services may be considered the function of freshwater ecosystems for the purpose of characterizing their resilience freshwater ecosystems exhibit resilience in their ability to maintain their production of ecosystem services under changes in temperature precipitation and species interactions as well as under human stresses of pollution habitat transformation and modified flow regimes because human prosperity is dependent on the continued provision of these services 46 73 preserving the attributes necessary for the resilience of freshwater ecosystems must be a central development aim solving for freshwater resilience requires identifying the endogenous and exogenous variables that influence system function identifying possible threshold effects driven by the interaction of those variables and considering the possibility of alternate system states endogenous attributes comprising freshwater ecosystem identity include thermal light chemical and nutrient characteristics sediment and organic matter inputs native biota and perhaps most critically the hydrologic flow regime 56 3 exogenous factors influencing system function and boundary conditions include temperature precipitation and human induced changes for instance infrastructure and land use changes commonly disrupt the flow regime and native biota and introduce pollutants and alien species managing for variability and maintaining environmental heterogeneity and landscape connectivity are central to freshwater resilience as they enable broad ecosystem response to changing conditions 31 63 55 74 freshwater system function is guided by the interaction of endogenous attributes and exogenous conditions when exogenous conditions such as land use or climate change force significant alteration of endogenous attributes toward thresholds of persistence and adaptability freshwater ecosystems become unstable and unpredictable once a threshold is transgressed regime shift may result in a dramatic reorganization to establish a new equilibrium state such transformations make it very difficult to restore natural freshwater systems to their previous state and function 62 eutrophication and local species extirpation are examples of potentially irreversible impacts of freshwater ecosystem transformation the potential consequences of transformation are particularly salient to decisions related to freshwater ecosystem management given their critical importance to human well being and resilience our transformation of natural freshwater ecosystems to managed hydrological systems has enabled human societies and economies to flourish in places where water resources would otherwise have been insufficient or insufficiently reliable to support our development over time the majority of freshwater ecosystems have been modified to meet human demands at the turn of the last millennium over half of large river systems had been dammed with reservoirs intercepting more than 40 per cent of global river discharge 78 77 47 39 those transformations have continued and accelerated a recent global assessment found that only 37 percent of rivers longer than 1000 km remain free flowing over their entire length and less than a quarter flow uninterrupted to the oceans 25 modern water systems are so heavily modified that management for resilience must consider their integrated and interdependent social ecological technological makeup and not uniquely their natural attributes management of modified freshwater systems or human hydrologic systems hhs must account for both natural and anthropogenic variables and their interactions the development of hhs models with capabilities of simulating both hydrological and human induced water functions has emerged in response to this need 37 82 84 including some anticipating responses to climate change 7 57 by design human hydrologic systems hhs are composed configured and operated in order to generate desired services to downstream communities 9 we dam rivers to store and supply water we connect surface flows to increase water provision and we open wells to bring groundwater to the surface for our use the preferred configuration of a hhs is defined to meet human demands for specific functions stakeholder demand for ecosystem services and critically their tolerance for costs and risk of diminished or lost services 2 reveal preferences for water system function and thus alternative design options traditionally the engineering of water systems has been guided by the imperative of sustaining specific services through the configuration and management of state variables identity for persistence under historic hydroclimatic variability water resources management interventions can lead to dramatic changes in hhs identity and function including unwelcome transformations such as the drying of lake chad and the aral sea and the degradation of innumerable river deltas and wetlands 9 climate and environmental change will trigger further transformations pushing natural and human systems beyond thresholds of their current equilibria into novel states consequently we must build and manage water systems for their adaptability and transformability to new configurations and new norms of function avoiding collapse and mitigating the costs of system failure water resources management approaches to supply energy food and water must be coupled with strategies for building human social ecological resilience at basin scale consistent with natural freshwater ecosystem boundaries in such efforts we must strive to maintain critical landscape functions such as moisture feedback from forests precipitation soil moisture and stable base flows key to regional and planetary resilience 58 59 36 we can design and manage water systems hhs for resilience through changes in their composition and configuration or system identity we can moderate consumptive use and reuse regulate temperature and chemical inputs manage water releases to maintain or alter environmental flows and deploy technologies that restore ecosystem services e g pollutant species and sediment removal we can also modify natural and hard infrastructure to provide for greater or lesser water capture storage and flows 51 our decisions and designs will either strengthen or impair freshwater ecosystem resilience with critical consequences for the provision of services vital to our economic and social welfare given the inevitable change that will occur in freshwater and hhs systems our ability to predict and guide their adaptation and transformation to avoid damaging and costly failures and transitions to undesirable new states is fundamental to solving for our resilience our managed adaptations and transformations should aim to preserve as much of the natural freshwater ecosystem identity and function as possible to sustain their many valuable contributions to human well being and to preserve their natural resilience capabilities 4 building resilience through water considering human systems generally resilience refers to the capacity to continually adjust and self organize in the face of change in order maintain the current development path or to actively transform onto a new development trajectory e g 17 80 86 this applies to simple and to highly complex systems alike from monoculture farms to diversified economies cities and our human managed earth system designing for the resilience of human systems can be dauntingly complex as a comprehensive articulation of system identity and function is difficult to achieve let alone to measure instead we rely upon identifying conditions that can enable or support its emergence 11 while we have made important progress in describing the characteristics of resilient systems and developing uniform frameworks and assessment processes e g 5 6 40 49 50 81 resilience must be measured not merely by a system s attributes and identity but fundamentally by its ability to persevere in its function solving for resilience requires that we design and manage human systems for persistence and adaptability to preserve their function under change and for transformability to enable system reorganization towards a preferred state once current functions can no longer be sustained technological innovation has been a hallmark of human development and adaptation to social and environmental challenges and will be fundamental to our successful response and future resilience social feedback mechanisms can mediate transitions and build resilience social norms cultural values institutions markets technology knowledge and learning all serve to inform our approach to managing natural and human systems 16 14 however protecting and restoring the ecological attributes and functions of natural systems are paramount to preserving the productive capacities of the earth system and its natural resilience in our endeavor to build a productive and resilient human future preserving natural systems and their services is imperative the requirements for freshwater system resilience help to define the limits of acceptable human system development and resilience particularly when such development is predicated upon the certainty of water services since human and water systems are coupled and co evolving the identity and function of human systems commonly derive from the availability and variability of water services and thus from the conditions necessary for water system resilience in designing for resilient human systems water further serves as a master variable due to its deep connections across all systems agricultural energy industrial urban and virtually all aspects of the human endeavor as a necessary underpinning of human system resilience water allows for our estimation of boundary conditions and equilibria to design for persistence adaptability and transformability pat in discrete and complex systems and across scales additionally as water is a critical factor in natural and human system productivity and resilience from local to planetary scales 16 58 59 it provides a coherent means of understanding and managing vital teleconnections from atmospheric cycles to surface flows and soil moisture sound design and decision making for resilience require a coherent approach that reveals interdependencies and enables a rigorous evaluation of development options as water is a finite resource essential to nearly all discrete human systems agriculture energy and complex systems cities economies alike it provides a consistent and coherent basis for complex system scenario modeling planning for pat and choices among resilience design and development alternatives moreover because we can diagnose design and manage water system identities to provide specific functions relative to changing conditions water system resilience can reveal what is necessary for the resilience of virtually all human systems from these necessary resilience parameters we may explore and design for sufficient conditions for human system resilience by considering other stressors drivers of system function and threshold conditions water cannot address all system stressors consider cybersecurity seismic activity species extinction additionally some systems are inherently decoupled from water or designed to be so however as water is necessary in virtually every system and vital in most it provides a coherent basis for understanding and navigating complex human system resilience in most instances the particular opportunity offered by water is that we can manage this vital input to and driver of human system resilience through water system hhs design and operation deriving the necessary conditions for human system resilience on the basis of what is required for water system resilience provides a coherent means of understanding and navigating our future development in short water is a master variable 5 conclusions throughout history we have managed and transformed freshwater ecosystems to fuel our development with little regard for preserving the component species systems and natural functions vital to their and to our resilience as we face prospects of earth system change and growing threats of water insecurity across the planet we must no longer heedlessly transform freshwater systems to pursue unsustainable gains in human development as water systems cross critical tipping points so will natural and human systems transform and risk collapse consequently our designs for managed adaptations and transformations should aim to preserve natural freshwater ecosystem identity and function to sustain their many valuable contributions to human well being and to preserve their natural resilience capabilities water is life humanity s fate is intimately tied to the fate of freshwater systems 16 any prospect of human development and resilience to planetary and societal changes that our future holds will depend upon our careful stewardship of water systems solving for resilience through the medium of water may guide us through threshold conditions novel states and alternative pathways towards resilience in the face of the complex and urgent challenge of solving for resilience in the modern era we submit that water may serve as a master variable enabling a coherent approach to defining the conditions and actions necessary to avoid collapse and revealing pathways for our persistence adaptation and transformation to preferred futures acknowledgement we are grateful for the generous support provided by the resilience shift for this work 
20158,resilience is increasingly recognized as an imperative for any prospect of sustainable development as it relates to our ability to sustain human well being and progress under the planetary and societal changes that we face now and into the future yet we are ill prepared to meet this challenge we neither fully understand nor manage consistently for resilience of the human and natural systems that we must steward through extraordinary change a unifying approach and common currency would help us to understand and manage for resilience under uncertain futures water is an essential defining element in human and natural systems human civilization and water systems have co evolved as a coupled system with the majority of natural freshwater systems transformed to meet our demands shifting patters of water availability in space and time will define key pathways and tipping points for our resilience and thus requirements for water system resilience must guide the trajectories and boundaries of human development here we consider the thesis that water offers a key to unlocking the complex challenge of designing and managing for the resilience of coupled human natural systems we examine what constitutes a resilient system what drives freshwater resilience and how pathways to human resilience may be charted and navigated through the medium of water our theoretical treatise frames a portfolio of research that tests this thesis including modeling and applications to water and water dependent systems 1 introduction when considering the complex dynamics of natural ecosystems nearly a half century ago holling 32 and his contemporaries described resilience as the ability of ecosystems to respond to changes in external conditions through internal changes in composition configuration and relationships in order to maintain coherent function resilience refers to the ability to thrive under change it has since been broadly adopted to describe the behavior not only of ecological systems but also of human systems from built infrastructure and agricultural systems to economies cities and our transformed earth system 20 27 87 today resilience is increasingly recognized as an imperative for any prospect of sustainable development as it pertains to our ability to sustain human progress in the face of change whether incremental or abrupt expected or surprising 19 understanding and building the resilience of human and natural systems is an urgent concern as we face the increasingly immediate and severe effects of earth system change on our tightly coupled human social ecological system 60 66 67 34 the earth system is currently unstable in many dimensions portending numerous possible futures and presenting urgent choices between transforming to a sustainable social organization and stewarding the earth for continued human progress or failing to preserve a biosphere suitable for our survival and precipitating the collapse of human civilization 14 it seems an insurmountable challenge to build the resilience of complex human systems to planetary and societal changes of an uncertain pace variability and magnitude complexity wedded with uncertainty is confounding thus we neither fully understand nor manage consistently for resilience rather our designs respond to those vulnerabilities most evident and acute which therefore have emerged as priorities for the affected communities in coastal low lying regions we begin with storms and sea level rise whereas in areas suffering chronic wildfires droughts or disease or pressured by demographic growth and socio economic change we design for the resilience of vulnerable populations and assets to those particular stressors more commonly with lesser ambition and an aversion to incur the costs of mitigating risks that seem less immediate we design for the least cost solution to proximate threats a coherent approach to understanding and solving for the resilience of human systems remains elusive while our current designs may not be wrong the lack of a consistent coherent approach to designing for our resilience is a crucial shortcoming at a minimum it limits our ability to evaluate alternative resilience design choices perhaps more importantly it undermines our ability to effectively identify and act on key system features crucial to resilience strategies this likely results in a greater frequency of overlooking issues affecting resilience and thus in deficient designs here we suggest that fresh water 1 here we refer exclusively to fresh water in terrestrial and atmospheric systems not saline water in marine systems throughout we use the term water for simplicity 1 can serve as a key to solving that puzzle that water is central to so many dimensions of social ecological resilience it may serve as a master variable offering a coherent approach to understanding designing and managing for resilience in the anthropocene water and climate are common defining factors of human and natural systems determining their productivity and function as well as their vulnerability to global change the warming climate will determine the magnitude of earth system change and the parameters within which we must operate to solve for our resilient future 66 67 climate change impacts will be most immediately and acutely expressed through water notably through changes in water quantity quality and distribution relative to human needs 61 and in extreme events such as flooding and droughts along with climate water dictates the diversity and distribution of the terrestrial biosphere water is central to the functioning of the earth system and is a critical determinant of the quality and quantity of ecosystem services 58 59 water of a specific quantity quality and timing is required to preserve the composition and function of natural ecosystems under localized disturbances and broader environmental change under climate change water availability and variability will define how the terrestrial biosphere adapts shifting the distribution of species and ecosystems to accommodate new conditions and thereby directly affecting established human interactions with previously prevailing environmental norms water s central role in the biosphere has long implied that many of the most important human development challenges are related to water 15 and to freshwater resilience 16 water availability has historically defined where humans could settle and produce and has thereby guided the development of societies and economies human ingenuity has enabled us to overcome the physical limits imposed by nature at least temporarily by damming and diverting water to where we choose to settle to farm and to prosper yet we have now reached a scale of human demand and water footprint that surpasses conventional solutions 45 76 79 58 16 climate change is altering patterns of water availability across the planet while human demand for water resources grows unabated 16 the increasing frequency and amplitude of water related shocks and stresses from more intense droughts and floods to seasonal shifts in precipitation are a critical resilience concern 71 70 human ingenuity is again tested as we grapple with adapting to a highly uncertain and increasingly volatile future 14 here we argue that a coherent approach to understanding and solving for the resilience of human systems under future earth system and societal change can be found by basing our designs on water water is an essential and defining element a crucial factor or a master variable guiding the nature and function of interacting human and natural systems shifting patterns of water in space and time will define key pathways and boundaries for their development and resilience as such we submit that water provides a consistent and robust basis for navigating the complexity and uncertainty of designing and managing for the resilience of coupled human natural systems we draw confidence that water offers a path to our future from the knowledge that water has defined and enabled human progress throughout history 41 83 human civilization and water systems have co evolved as a coupled social ecological system 65 41 42 our work builds upon seminal writings that form the theoretical foundations of social ecological resilience 32 21 of engineering resilience in water resources management 18 8 64 and of freshwater ecology 56 74 we consider what constitutes a resilient system what influences water system resilience and how pathways to human resilience may be charted and navigated through the medium of water related work compiled in a special issue of water security further explores this thesis including modeling metrics and scenario planning work as well as applications to water systems and to human systems dependent on water 7 10 22 26 36 44 72 75 2 conceptual framing resilient systems building upon the work of homer dixon et al 34 we define a system as a set of causally connected entities that are distinguishable as an identifiable whole and that self organize to persist in characteristic function over an extended period of time we refer to natural systems as ecological systems with identities formed by their distinct composition of species structure and relationships and with characteristic ecological functions and services we restrict our treatment to ecosystems that are largely influenced by fresh water inputs of precipitation surface flows and groundwater i e primarily terrestrial but also near

technology in human development we recognize that human systems may be more precisely characterized as social ecological technological systems 43 human systems exist in a dynamic nexus comprising

ability to maintain their production of ecosystem services under changes in temperature precipitation and species interactions as well as under human stresses of pollution habitat transformation and modified flow regimes because human prosperity is dependent on the continued provision of these services 46 73 preserving the attributes necessary for the resilience of freshwater ecosystems must be a central development aim solving for freshwater resilience requires identifying the endogenous and exogenous variables that influence system function identifying possible threshold effects driven by the interaction of those variables and considering the possibility of alternate system states endogenous attributes comprising freshwater ecosystem identity include thermal light chemical and nutrient characteristics sediment and organic matter inputs native biota and perhaps most critically the hydrologic flow regime 56 3 exogenous factors influencing system function and boundary conditions include temperature precipitation and human induced changes for instance infrastructure and land use changes commonly disrupt the flow regime and native biota and introduce pollutants and alien species managing for variability and maintaining environmental heterogeneity and landscape connectivity are central to freshwater resilience as they enable broad ecosystem response to changing conditions 31 63 55 74 freshwater system function is guided by the interaction of endogenous attributes and exogenous conditions when exogenous conditions such as land use or climate change force significant alteration of endogenous attributes toward thresholds of persistence and adaptability freshwater ecosystems become unstable and unpredictable once a threshold is transgressed regime shift may result in a dramatic reorganization to establish a new equilibrium state such transformations make it very difficult to restore natural freshwater systems to their previous state and function 62 eutrophication and local species extirpation are examples of potentially irreversible impacts of freshwater ecosystem transformation the potential consequences of transformation are particularly salient to decisions related to freshwater ecosystem management given their critical importance to human well being and resilience our transformation of natural freshwater ecosystems to managed hydrological systems has enabled human societies and economies to flourish in places where water resources would otherwise have been insufficient or insufficiently reliable to support our development over time the majority of freshwater ecosystems have been modified to meet human demands at the turn of the last millennium over half of large river systems had been dammed with reservoirs intercepting more than 40 per cent of global river discharge 78 77 47 39 those transformations have continued and accelerated a recent global assessment found that only 37 percent of rivers longer than 1000 km remain free flowing over their entire length and less than a quarter flow uninterrupted to the oceans 25 modern water systems are so heavily modified that management for resilience must consider their integrated and interdependent social ecological technological makeup and not uniquely their natural attributes management of modified freshwater systems or human hydrologic systems hhs must account for both natural and anthropogenic variables and their interactions the development of hhs models with capabilities of simulating both hydrological and human induced water functions has emerged in response to this need 37 82 84 including some anticipating responses to climate change 7 57 by design human hydrologic systems hhs are composed configured and operated in order to generate desired services to downstream communities 9 we dam rivers to store and supply water we connect surface flows to increase water provision and we open wells to bring groundwater to the surface for our use the preferred configuration of a hhs is defined to meet human demands for specific functions stakeholder demand for ecosystem services and critically their tolerance for costs and risk of diminished or lost services 2 reveal preferences for water system function and thus alternative design options traditionally the engineering of water systems has been guided by the imperative of sustaining specific services through the configuration and management of state variables identity for persistence under historic hydroclimatic variability water resources management interventions can lead to dramatic changes in hhs identity and function including unwelcome transformations such as the drying of lake chad and the aral sea and the degradation of innumerable river deltas and wetlands 9 climate and environmental change will trigger further transformations pushing natural and human systems beyond thresholds of their current equilibria into novel states consequently we must build and manage water systems for their adaptability and transformability to new configurations and new norms of function avoiding collapse and mitigating the costs of system failure water resources management approaches to supply energy food and water must be coupled with strategies for building human social ecological resilience at basin scale consistent with natural freshwater ecosystem boundaries in such efforts we must strive to maintain critical landscape functions such as moisture feedback from forests precipitation soil moisture and stable base flows key to regional and planetary resilience 58 59 36 we can design and manage water systems hhs for resilience through changes in their composition and configuration or system identity we can moderate consumptive use and reuse regulate temperature and chemical inputs manage water releases to maintain or alter environmental flows and deploy technologies that restore ecosystem services e g pollutant species and sediment removal we can also modify natural and hard infrastructure to provide for greater or lesser water capture storage and flows 51 our decisions and designs will either strengthen or impair freshwater ecosystem resilience with critical consequences for the provision of services vital to our economic and social welfare given the inevitable change that will occur in freshwater and hhs systems our ability to predict and guide their adaptation and transformation to avoid damaging and costly failures and transitions to undesirable new states is fundamental to solving for our resilience our managed adaptations and transformations should aim to preserve as much of the natural freshwater ecosystem identity and function as possible to sustain their many valuable contributions to human well being and to preserve their natural resilience capabilities 4 building resilience through water considering human systems generally resilience refers to the capacity to continually adjust and self organize in the face of change in order maintain the current development path or to actively transform onto a new development trajectory e g 17 80 86 this applies to simple and to highly complex systems alike from monoculture farms to diversified economies cities and our human managed earth system designing for the resilience of human systems can be dauntingly complex as a comprehensive articulation of system identity and function is difficult to achieve let alone to measure instead we rely upon identifying conditions that can enable or support its emergence 11 while we have made important progress in describing the characteristics of resilient systems and developing uniform frameworks and assessment processes e g 5 6 40 49 50 81 resilience must be measured not merely by a system s attributes and identity but fundamentally by its ability to persevere in its function solving for resilience requires that we design and manage human systems for persistence and adaptability to preserve their function under change and for transformability to enable system reorganization towards a preferred state once current functions can no longer be sustained technological innovation has been a hallmark of human development and adaptation to social and environmental challenges and will be fundamental to our successful response and future resilience social feedback mechanisms can mediate transitions and build resilience social norms cultural values institutions markets technology knowledge and learning all serve to inform our approach to managing natural and human systems 16 14 however protecting and restoring the ecological attributes and functions of natural systems are paramount to preserving the productive capacities of the earth system and its natural resilience in our endeavor to build a productive and resilient human future preserving natural systems and their services is imperative the requirements for freshwater system resilience help to define the limits of acceptable human system development and resilience particularly when such development is predicated upon the certainty of water services since human and water systems are coupled and co evolving the identity and function of human systems commonly derive from the availability and variability of water services and thus from the conditions necessary for water system resilience in designing for resilient human systems water further serves as a master variable due to its deep connections across all systems agricultural energy industrial urban and virtually all aspects of the human endeavor as a necessary underpinning of human system resilience water allows for our estimation of boundary conditions and equilibria to design for persistence adaptability and transformability pat in discrete and complex systems and across scales additionally as water is a critical factor in natural and human system productivity and resilience from local to planetary scales 16 58 59 it provides a coherent means of understanding and managing vital teleconnections from atmospheric cycles to surface flows and soil moisture sound design and decision making for resilience require a coherent approach that reveals interdependencies and enables a rigorous evaluation of development options as water is a finite resource essential to nearly all discrete human systems agriculture energy and complex systems cities economies alike it provides a consistent and coherent basis for complex system scenario modeling planning for pat and choices among resilience design and development alternatives moreover because we can diagnose design and manage water system identities to provide specific functions relative to changing conditions water system resilience can reveal what is necessary for the resilience of virtually all human systems from these necessary resilience parameters we may explore and design for sufficient conditions for human system resilience by considering other stressors drivers of system function and threshold conditions water cannot address all system stressors consider cybersecurity seismic activity species extinction additionally some systems are inherently decoupled from water or designed to be so however as water is necessary in virtually every system and vital in most it provides a coherent basis for understanding and navigating complex human system resilience in most instances the particular opportunity offered by water is that we can manage this vital input to and driver of human system resilience through water system hhs design and operation deriving the necessary conditions for human system resilience on the basis of what is required for water system resilience provides a coherent means of understanding and navigating our future development in short water is a master variable 5 conclusions throughout history we have managed and transformed freshwater ecosystems to fuel our development with little regard for preserving the component species systems and natural functions vital to their and to our resilience as we face prospects of earth system change and growing threats of water insecurity across the planet we must no longer heedlessly transform freshwater systems to pursue unsustainable gains in human development as water systems cross critical tipping points so will natural and human systems transform and risk collapse consequently our designs for managed adaptations and transformations should aim to preserve natural freshwater ecosystem identity and function to sustain their many valuable contributions to human well being and to preserve their natural resilience capabilities water is life humanity s fate is intimately tied to the fate of freshwater systems 16 any prospect of human development and resilience to planetary and societal changes that our future holds will depend upon our careful stewardship of water systems solving for resilience through the medium of water may guide us through threshold conditions novel states and alternative pathways towards resilience in the face of the complex and urgent challenge of solving for resilience in the modern era we submit that water may serve as a master variable enabling a coherent approach to defining the conditions and actions necessary to avoid collapse and revealing pathways for our persistence adaptation and transformation to preferred futures acknowledgement we are grateful for the generous support provided by the resilience shift for this work 
20159,the third pole is the headwater region for asian major rivers providing water for millions of people inside and around driven by rainfall and snowfall with large spatial and temporal variation in their amount water availability reviewed here is buffered by snow glaciers groundwater and springs most glaciers have been losing mass contributing to annual excess discharge significant depletions of groundwater and drying up of many springs are observed in some areas of the region summary of runoff components across the region shows rainfall is the major contributor followed by snow and glacier melt though their relative contribution varies among basins modelling studies project a changing seasonality of river runoff increased extremes and a high variability among the river basins keywords third pole water availability precipitation glaciers snow climate change 1 introduction the third pole is known as the fresh water tower of asia 21 85 outside the polar regions it has the highest concentration of snow and glaciers with a glacial volume of about 7000 km3 23 and acts as a source region for large river systems in central southern and eastern asia 64 fig 1 water from the snow and glaciers along with rainfall feed the major rivers originated on the third pole and water from these river basins fulfill the needs of drinking water irrigation energy industry and sanitation for about 210 million people within the region and about 1 3 billion people downstream of the region 6 owing to recent changes in climate the uncertainty about water availability is increasing in the region 49 during the period of 1901 2014 the annual mean surface air temperature has increased by over 0 104 c per decade with most parts of the third pole experiencing a warming trend especially the tibetan plateau 62 similarly the trend of precipitation has also increased in the region more rapidly since the mid 1980 s 62 though the interannual variability of precipitation is very complex with higher variability found in the central and western part on the tibetan plateau 47 increases in temperature and precipitation as well as changes in precipitation patterns and accelerated melting of snow and glaciers all contribute to the increasing uncertainty in water availability of the region 22 many review studies have assessed the changes in climatic variables and their impact on water resources within the sub regions of the third pole bibi et al 9 assessed the recent climatic changes over the tibetan plateau and the responses of cryosphere biosphere and hydrosphere similarly yang et al 84 reviewed the changes in climatic variables on the tibetan plateau and then assessed the response of water and energy cycles to the changes in those variables cuo et al 16 reviewed the changes in seasonal and long term flow patterns of streamflow among different categories of rivers in the tibetan plateau and their responses to climate change and human activities all these reviews have been conducted for a sub region of the third pole region and have focused on the past climate change and its impacts on the water resources there is a clear need for a study focused on the impacts of climate change on both past and future water resources within the entire third pole region in addition groundwater and springs were seldomly mentioned in previous review studies in this review we have summarized some of the principal components of water resources in the third pole including rainfall and snowfall as primary drivers whereas glaciers snow springs and groundwater as the buffers and the impacts of current and future climate change on these water resources in addition this study also evaluates the adequacy of observations and uncertainty among future climate change projections 2 primary drivers of water availability precipitation is the primary driver of water availability in the third pole region precipitation generally has two forms namely rainfall which is dominant at low elevation and snowfall at high elevation it is hard to distinguish snowfall from rainfall due to limited observations of snowfall and it is also complex to estimate the threshold temperature for snow and rain accurately which is considered to vary significantly among different climates within northern hemisphere 34 though rainfall is the key driver in most of the upper river basins on the tibetan plateau snowfall is also an important component of the water cycle and may account for a large part of total precipitation in areas with high elevation and low temperatures 47 zhang et al 88 found that the contribution of snowmelt was particularly higher than that of rainfall in upper indus indicating that majority of precipitation there falls as snowfall rather than rainfall in some mountainous areas of tarim river basin snowfall is also found to be the major form of precipitation 78 due to the difficulties mentioned above the spatial and temporal analysis is generally conducted based on the total precipitation without distinguishing snow from rainfall processes affecting the precipitation are very complex resulting in its large spatial and temporal variation within the region caused by the interaction of local and large scale circulation systems 74 within the tibetan plateau precipitation shows a high spatial variability with a strong north south gradient and east west seasonality caused due to orographic and climatic effects 25 from the tarim river basin in the northern third pole to the southeast himalayan foothills the precipitation was observed to vary from 50 to more than 6000 mm yr 1 47 in the eastern himalaya the majority of precipitation falls in between june and september because of the influence of indian and east asian monsoon climate system compared to eastern parts precipitation in western parts is much more uniformly distributed throughout the year due to the effects of the westerlies and southwesterly airflows 11 on the central tibetan plateau in the northeast qilian mountains and in the himalaya most of the precipitation falls in summer months 47 in the karakoram region about two thirds of the precipitation at high altitude occurs during the winter months 30 and half of it is attributed to the eastward propagating cyclones which provide winter precipitation to northwestern parts of the indian subcontinent 7 in the western and central tibetan plateau and in northwestern india the interannual variability of precipitation is high whereas in the eastern and elevated parts it is low within the whole tibetan plateau precipitation shows a slightly decreasing trend during 1901 2014 whereas during 1961 2013 it shows a statistically significant increase and more rapid increase since the mid 1980s 62 it should be noted that most meteorological stations are in the eastern and southern tp and very few stations are located at higher than 5000 m the predictions of precipitation based on the limited observations may be somewhat biased thus more in situ hydrometeorological observations are needed in future 3 buffers in the hydrological system 3 1 snow snow is an important water resource because snowmelt is an important contributor to discharge in the major upstream river basins of the third pole the snow covered area varies significantly among different basins with the highest annual average snow coverage in yangtze river basin and lowest in amudarya river basin table 1 although 59 of the tibetan plateau is covered with snow in winter 58 it shows a large variation in the seasonality of snow cover among the basins in the upstream indus basin large parts are snow covered for prolonged periods during the year snow ablation peaks at the end of spring and snow accumulation starts in early winter 31 for the brahmaputra river basin snow cover is at its maximum at the beginning of spring and is minimal in summer months 72 for the upstream parts of the amudarya and ganges river basins the maximum value of snow cover occurs in late winter after which snow ablation starts and minimum snow coverage is observed during summer 18 72 for the upper mekong and yellow river basins the snow cover is highest in winter months with ablation starting in spring months and peaking in summer months 38 in the upstream salween river basin the maximum value of snow cover occurs in the late autumn and ablation starts at the beginning of spring and peaking in summer months 42 for upstream yangtze river basin highest snow cover occurs in mid autumn whereas snow ablation starts sharply from late spring peaking in summer 42 3 2 glaciers glaciers within the third pole are an important source of fresh water available in the region out of a total area of about 5 million km2 glaciers cover a total area of about 98 000 km2 and have a total volume of 7 0 1 8 103 km3 23 both the glacier coverage and glacier volumes in major river basins vary significantly from one to another with the highest amounts found in indus table 1 since 1970s due to global warming most of the glaciers of the tibetan plateau have been losing mass with a general reduction of 9 85 during 2000 2016 negative mass balances were observed for brahmaputra indus ganges amudarya salween yangtze and mekong with values ranging from about 0 09 to 5 1 gt yr 1 leading to an annual excess discharge ranging from 163 66 m3 s 1 to 3 2 m3 s 1 whereas a positive mass balance for tarim river basin was observed with a value of about 0 4 gt yr 1 12 it should be noted that positive mass balances are observed in some areas including the inner tibetan plateau 87 central karakoram and the western pamir 26 increase in summer snowfall in pamir due to increase in irrigation intensity in lowlands of hma particularly in tarim river basin could favor the increase in glacial growth in pamir region 17 positive glacier mass balance in karakoram may be attributed to increased winter precipitation 86 and the summer cooling 24 these studies indicate the complex effects of climate as well as anthropogenic activities affecting the glaciers in the region 3 3 groundwater groundwater is a very important source of water in the lowlands of the third pole it provides an important water resource for about 75 of the irrigated areas in south asia 65 in the himalaya catchments it acts as transient storage of water 20 in the third pole significant depletion of groundwater has been observed in indian plains and adjacent regions 10 in northwestern indian states satellite based estimates of groundwater depletion is 17 7 4 5 km3 yr during 2002 2008 63 there have been notable depletions in nepal as well 19 54 in most parts of the third pole information about hydro geological aspect of aquifers is mostly unknown the studies that have been carried out are by characterizing aquifer systems or understanding about geological formation and hydrogeological characterstics in places such as northeastern india 48 46 northwestern india 50 41 and nepal 69 35 54 in the tibetan plateau groundwater is considered mainly recharged by infiltration from snow or glacier melts at high elevations and could be crucial for sustaining baseflow and springs 27 in central nepal himalaya the contribution of groundwater is found to be even higher than snow and glacier melt 2 climate change can impact groundwater resources with the effects of precipitation or temperature changes on the recharging capability 70 for example the groundwater storages of the tibetan plateau are found to increase during 2003 2009 possibly due to increased snow glacier melts and or precipitation 82 however due to scarce observational data for groundwater there are only a few model based studies which fully account for ground water processes in the region 2 50 59 3 4 springs springs serve as a primary source of water in majority of households in the himalaya mountains due to the inaccessibility to water from major rivers flowing into deep valleys for example in the indian himalaya springs provide water for about 64 of the total irrigated land 61 although precipitation is found to generally increase springs are reported to be drying up in the region possibly due to the rather unstable rainfall pattern such as the shorter duration of rainfall and a reduction in winter rainfall found in sikkim the increasing effects of human activity 61 77 71 or the perturbation caused by earthquake 56 it is reported that many springs are drying up in the himalaya watersheds 66 including the indian himalaya with nearly half of natural springs found to be drying up 3 the central himalaya such as nepal where 12 of springs are observed to have dried up during the last 10 years 56 and the eastern himalaya such as sikkim where spring discharge has decreased by almost 35 in the 2000 s 77 however due to the scarcity of data the condition of most of the springs is yet unknown only a few studies have been carried out to establish the relationship between precipitation spring discharge and recharge in small and distributed areas 52 80 77 79 67 40 55 it is shown that there is large variation in the third pole in the eastern part of the third pole in sikkim and uttarakhand rainfall and spring discharge are well correlated 77 1 whereas inverse patterns with monthly rainfall are also seen in western himalaya such as kashmir 51 4 runoff and its components different studies using different modeling methods such as degree day 31 45 4 and energy balance methods 88 have been used to quantify the total runoff and its different components namely the glacial melt snowmelt rainfall and baseflow in different upstream river basins of the third pole region lutz et al 45 used a high resolution cryospheric hydrological model based on the degree day approach to assess the contributions of all the components of runoff in the major upstream river basins of the tibetan plateau with an energy balance method for snow modelling and a degree day approach for simulating glacier melts including snow melts on top of glacier zhang et al 88 used the distributed hydrologic model vic to assess the contributions of snowmelt glacier melt and rainfall to runoff in different upstream river basins of the tibetan plateau recently armstrong et al 4 have proposed a new method for differentiating snow on land snow on glacier ice and exposed glacier ice by improving modice modis persistent ice method based on a two strike classification of ice free pixels in combination with the modscag modis snow covered area and grain size retrieval algorithm to create more accurate snow and glacier maps and they used the improved snow and glacier cover data as input for a temperature index model to successfully obtain the contributions of snow and glacier melt in five major river basins of the third pole based on studies by armstrong et al 4 kamp and pan 36 lutz et al 45 and zhang et al 88 and so on which are representative across nine basins a summary of total runoff components for each major basin as well as the whole region are provided in table 2 generally rainfall runoff is the most important component for most of the major basins except the indus amudarya and tarim basins where snow or glacier melt seem to be dominant it is obvious that the components and relative proportions of them can vary much for different basins for example in brahmaputra river basin although the annual snow coverage is around 20 of the total basin area rainfall runoff dominates the total runoff 45 88 where monsoon season contributes to about 70 of annual total precipitation which is also the main melt season for this basin with wet downstream climate lowering the impact of meltwater contributions 32 for the upstream major basins including mekong salween yellow and yangtze the contribution of snowmelt is relatively moderate with its contribution to total annual runoff mainly within 20 30 45 88 however seasonal snowmelt can contribute greater than 50 in amudarya 4 36 and indus 4 such differences can be partly explained by their different snow coverage indus basin has very large snow coverage and its major part is covered with snow for prolonged periods of the year 31 whereas for ganges mekong salween yellow and yangtze river basins the annual snow coverage is less than or equal to 10 of their respective basin area 28 similar to snowmelt the importance of glacier melt also varies dramatically among the different basins the indus has the largest contribution to streamflow from glacial melt 31 45 with much lower contribution of the other major basins such as the yellow yangtze mekong and salween with reported contributions mostly less than 20 68 88 29 it has been indicated that the relative importance of glacier melt increases with proximity to the glaciers 45 for example glacial melt only contributes about 12 of total runoff in upstream ganges river basin 45 but increases up to about 21 and 58 for dudhkoshi and langtang respectively which are both upstream highly glacierized sub basins of ganges river 59 it should be noted that due to the differences in basin definitions study periods modeling approaches input and calibration data observations there are truly some differences in the discharge components reported by different literatures indicating a possibly large uncertainty in some basins the most significant difference may be the snowmelt contributions of ui ug and ub with the large standard derivations of 44 27 and 35 respectively as shown in table 2 for example the snowmelt contributions in ui ug and ub from armstrong et al 4 are all much larger than those from lutz et al 45 it may be because of their different melt modelling subroutines and different discharge observations armstrong et al 4 used improved snow and glacier cover data as input for snow glacier melt modelling and lutz et al 45 calibrated their model using more upstream gauge stations 5 climate change impacts it has been indicated that most parts of the third pole have undergone a significant warming trend in regions such as the tibetan plateau precipitation shows an increasing trend after the 1980s due to these trends in the climatic variables there will be more uncertainty and variability in the hydrological cycle of the region such complexity is reflected in the glacier response during the last several decades with the most intense glacier retreat occurring in the monsoon dominated region less retreat in the transition region and the least retreat in the westerlies dominated region 85 future climate projections under different rcp scenarios also show negative mass balance and lower equilibrium line altitudes by the end of the century for the himalayan region with some percentage of glaciers facing eventual disappearance 14 rise of global temperatures by 1 5 c will lead to a decrease of around 36 of total glacial mass stored in the high mountain asia 39 changes in climatic conditions in winter westerlies have been linked with increases in snow water equivalent swe in indus and ganges catchments resulting in more snowfall in parts of indus 13 76 53 in high mountain asia increased temperature 85 causes an earlier melting of snow 73 and more precipitation falls in the form of rain in the majority of the region 45 37 and this results in negative summer swe trends in the region along with projections of increasing temperatures total precipitation also shows an increasing trend by the middle of twenty first century 37 due to these ongoing and projected changes in glacier and snow coverage and projected precipitation trends the timing of water availability may change and this could pose challenges for water management although the total water availability may only increase the challenge is to deal with shifts in timing and an increase in extremes several modelling studies have been conducted to evaluate the impacts of climate change on future water resources immerzeel et al 32 used a glacio hydrological model for projecting runoff at the end of the century for baltoro and langtang catchments in spite of their different climates it was indicated that both catchments showed a consistent increase in total streamflow with projected glacial melt increase expected to be main cause for streamflow increase in baltoro and projected precipitation increase expected to be main cause for streamflow increase in langtang catchment this study concluded that water availability in this century was very less likely to decline and river basins depending on glacier melt and monsoon rainfall would continue to meet the expected increase in water demands within vulnerable river basins such as indus lutz et al 44 had analyzed the changes in seasonality and hydrological extremes in the upper indus basin predictions for seasonality of flow included minor increases in summer flow and increased flow in other seasons in near future period of 2021 2050 and decreases in summer flow and stronger increased flow in other seasons for far future period of 2071 2100 mainly driven by increases in extreme precipitation increase in flooding events during 21st century due to increases in intensity and frequency of extreme discharges were predicted for most of the upper indus basin their study suggested developing sound basin wide adaption strategies that could take into account changing demand and supply in the indus basin similarly wijngaard et al 81 had assessed the future changes in climatic extremes and hydrological extremes for the upper indus upper ganges and upper brahmaputra river basins and found out that climatic extremes were projected to increase in magnitude by end of 21st century with precipitation extremes increasing mostly in upper indus basin in rainfall dominated upper brahmaputra river basin increases in precipitation extremes may contribute to discharge extremes such studies have also been conducted in lhasa river 57 koshi 8 and shigar 75 watersheds which generally project an increase in runoff however the rather big uncertainty from the evidently different outputs of different climate models is still a large problem in future projection studies as indicated by immerzeel et al 32 6 conclusion due to complexity of processes affecting precipitation there is large spatial and temporal variability in the region two forms of precipitation on the third pole namely the snowfall and rainfall also add to the variability seasonality of snow cover shows a large variation among different river basins with maximum snow cover varying from early spring e g brahmaputra mid autumn e g upstream yangtze late autumn e g upstream salween to winter e g upper mekong yellow amudarya and ganges many glaciers have been losing mass in the region contributing to annual excess river discharge within the river basins where the glaciers are situated significant depletion of groundwater has been observed in the indian plains and nepal the lack of sufficient observational data has led to an inadequate understanding of groundwater hydrology in the region many springs are reported to be drying up or becoming seasonal in the region however due to the lack of observational data the condition of most of the springs is still unknown the summary of hydrological modeling studies indicates that for all the river basins cumulatively rainfall is the main contributor to runoff followed by snow and glacial melt the relative contribution of these components however varies greatly among the different river basins due to the increase in precipitation and glacial melt near future water availability is generally projected to increase for various river basins and sub basins with also clear seasonal shifts in some basins hydrological and climatic extremes were also predicted to increase in some river basins with increase in precipitation extremes causing an increase in discharge extremes however there is large uncertainty in these future projections owing to climate model uncertainty acknowledgements this review is supported by the strategic priority research program of the chinese academy of sciences xda20060202 and the second

in their amount water availability reviewed here is buffered by snow glaciers groundwater and springs most glaciers have been losing mass contributing to annual excess discharge significant depletions of groundwater and drying up of many springs are observed in some areas of the region summary of runoff components across the region shows rainfall is the major contributor followed by snow and glacier melt though their relative contribution varies among basins modelling studies project a changing seasonality of river runoff increased extremes and a high variability among the river basins keywords third pole water availability precipitation glaciers snow climate change 1 introduction the third pole is known as the fresh water tower of asia 21 85 outside the polar regions it has the highest concentration of snow and glaciers with a glacial volume of about 7000 km3 23 and acts as a source region for large river systems in central southern and eastern asia 64 fig 1 water from the snow and glaciers along with rainfall feed the major rivers originated on the third pole and water from these river basins fulfill the needs of drinking water irrigation energy industry and sanitation for about 210 million people within the region and about 1 3 billion people downstream of the region 6 owing to recent changes in climate the uncertainty about water availability is increasing in the region 49 during the period of 1901 2014 the annual mean surface air temperature has increased by over 0 104 c per decade with most parts of the third pole experiencing a warming trend especially the tibetan plateau 62 similarly the trend of precipitation has also increased in the region more rapidly since the mid 1980 s 62 though the interannual variability of precipitation is very complex with higher variability found in the central and western part on the tibetan plateau 47 increases in temperature and precipitation as well as changes in precipitation patterns and accelerated melting of snow and glaciers all contribute to the increasing uncertainty in water availability of the region 22 many review studies have assessed the changes in climatic variables and their impact on water resources within the sub regions of the third pole bibi et al 9 assessed the recent climatic changes over the tibetan plateau and the responses of cryosphere biosphere and hydrosphere similarly yang et al 84 reviewed the changes in climatic variables on the tibetan plateau and then assessed the response of water and energy cycles to the changes in those variables cuo et al 16 reviewed the changes in seasonal and long term flow patterns of streamflow among different categories of rivers in the tibetan plateau and their responses to climate change and human activities all these reviews have been conducted for a sub region of the third pole region and have focused on the past climate change and its impacts on the water resources there is a clear need for a study focused on the impacts of climate change on both past and future water resources within the entire third pole region in addition groundwater and springs were seldomly mentioned in previous review studies in this review we have summarized some of the principal components of water resources in the third pole including rainfall and snowfall as primary drivers whereas glaciers snow springs and groundwater as the buffers and the impacts of current and future climate change on these water resources in addition this study also evaluates the adequacy of observations and uncertainty among future climate change projections 2 primary drivers of water availability precipitation is the primary driver of water availability in the third pole region precipitation generally has two forms namely rainfall which is dominant at low elevation and snowfall at high elevation it is hard to distinguish snowfall from rainfall due to limited observations of snowfall and it is also complex to estimate the threshold temperature for snow and rain accurately which is considered to vary significantly among different climates within northern hemisphere 34 though rainfall is the key driver in most of the upper river basins on the tibetan plateau snowfall is also an important component of the water cycle and may account for a large part of total precipitation in areas with high elevation and low temperatures 47 zhang et al 88 found that the contribution of snowmelt was particularly higher than that of rainfall in upper indus indicating that majority of precipitation there falls as snowfall rather than rainfall in some mountainous areas of tarim river basin snowfall is also found to be the major form of precipitation 78 due to the difficulties mentioned above the spatial and temporal analysis is generally conducted based on the total precipitation without distinguishing snow from rainfall processes affecting the precipitation are very complex resulting in its large spatial and temporal variation within the region caused by the interaction of local and large scale circulation systems 74 within the tibetan plateau precipitation shows a high spatial variability with a strong north south gradient and east west seasonality caused due to orographic and climatic effects 25 from the tarim river basin in the northern third pole to the southeast himalayan foothills the precipitation was observed to vary from 50 to more than 6000 mm yr 1 47 in the eastern himalaya the majority of precipitation falls in between june and september because of the influence of indian and east asian monsoon climate system compared to eastern parts precipitation in western parts is much more uniformly distributed throughout the year due to the effects of the westerlies and southwesterly airflows 11 on the central tibetan plateau in the northeast qilian mountains and in the himalaya most of the precipitation falls in summer months 47 in the karakoram region about two thirds of the precipitation at high altitude occurs during the winter months 30 and half of it is attributed to the eastward propagating cyclones which provide winter precipitation to northwestern parts of the indian subcontinent 7 in the western and central tibetan plateau and in northwestern india the interannual variability of precipitation is high whereas in the eastern and elevated parts it is low within the whole tibetan plateau precipitation shows a slightly decreasing trend during 1901 2014 whereas during 1961 2013 it shows a statistically significant increase and more rapid increase since the mid 1980s 62 it should be noted that most meteorological stations are in the eastern and southern tp and very few stations are located at higher than 5000 m the predictions of precipitation based on the limited observations may be somewhat biased thus more in situ hydrometeorological observations are needed in future 3 buffers in the hydrological system 3 1 snow snow is an important water resource because snowmelt is an important contributor to discharge in the major upstream river basins of the third pole the snow covered area varies significantly among different basins with the highest annual average snow coverage in yangtze river basin and lowest in amudarya river basin table 1 although 59 of the tibetan plateau is covered with snow in winter 58 it shows a large variation in the seasonality of snow cover among the basins in the upstream indus basin large parts are snow covered for prolonged periods during the year snow ablation peaks at the end of spring and snow accumulation starts in early winter 31 for the brahmaputra river basin snow cover is at its maximum at the beginning of spring and is minimal in summer months 72 for the upstream parts of the amudarya and ganges river basins the maximum value of snow cover occurs in late winter after which snow ablation starts and minimum snow coverage is observed during summer 18 72 for the upper mekong and yellow river basins the snow cover is highest in winter months with ablation starting in spring months and peaking in summer months 38 in the upstream salween river basin the maximum value of snow cover occurs in the late autumn and ablation starts at the beginning of spring and peaking in summer months 42 for upstream yangtze river basin highest snow cover occurs in mid autumn whereas snow ablation starts sharply from late spring peaking in summer 42 3 2 glaciers glaciers within the third pole are an important source of fresh water available in the region out of a total area of about 5 million km2 glaciers cover a total area of about 98 000 km2 and have a total volume of 7 0 1 8 103 km3 23 both the glacier coverage and glacier volumes in major river basins vary significantly from one to another with the highest amounts found in indus table 1 since 1970s due to global warming most of the glaciers of the tibetan plateau have been losing mass with a general reduction of 9 85 during 2000 2016 negative mass balances were observed for brahmaputra indus ganges amudarya salween yangtze and mekong with values ranging from about 0 09 to 5 1 gt yr 1 leading to an annual excess discharge ranging from 163 66 m3 s 1 to 3 2 m3 s 1 whereas a positive mass balance for tarim river basin was observed with a value of about 0 4 gt yr 1 12 it should be noted that positive mass balances are observed in some areas including the inner tibetan plateau 87 central karakoram and the western pamir 26 increase in summer snowfall in pamir due to increase in irrigation intensity in lowlands of hma particularly in tarim river basin could favor the increase in glacial growth in pamir region 17 positive glacier mass balance in karakoram may be attributed to increased winter precipitation 86 and the summer cooling 24 these studies indicate the complex effects of climate as well as anthropogenic activities affecting the glaciers in the region 3 3 groundwater groundwater is a very important source of water in the lowlands of the third pole it provides an important water resource for about 75 of the irrigated areas in south asia 65 in the himalaya catchments it acts as transient storage of water 20 in the third pole significant depletion of groundwater has been observed in indian plains and adjacent regions 10 in northwestern indian states satellite based estimates of groundwater depletion is 17 7 4 5 km3 yr during 2002 2008 63 there have been notable depletions in nepal as well 19 54 in most parts of the third pole information about hydro geological aspect of aquifers is mostly unknown the studies that have been carried out are by characterizing aquifer systems or understanding about geological formation and hydrogeological characterstics in places such as northeastern india 48 46 northwestern india 50 41 and nepal 69 35 54 in the tibetan plateau groundwater is considered mainly recharged by infiltration from snow or glacier melts at high elevations and could be crucial for sustaining baseflow and springs 27 in central nepal himalaya the contribution of groundwater is found to be even higher than snow and glacier melt 2 climate change can impact groundwater resources with the effects of precipitation or temperature changes on the recharging capability 70 for example the groundwater storages of the tibetan plateau are found to increase during 2003 2009 possibly due to increased snow glacier melts and or precipitation 82 however due to scarce observational data for groundwater there are only a few model based studies which fully account for ground water processes in the region 2 50 59 3 4 springs springs serve as a primary source of water in majority of households in the himalaya mountains due to the inaccessibility to water from major rivers flowing into deep valleys for example in the indian himalaya springs provide water for about 64 of the total irrigated land 61 although precipitation is found to generally increase springs are reported to be drying up in the region possibly due to the rather unstable rainfall pattern such as the shorter duration of rainfall and a reduction in winter rainfall found in sikkim the increasing effects of human activity 61 77 71 or the perturbation caused by earthquake 56 it is reported that many springs are drying up in the himalaya watersheds 66 including the indian himalaya with nearly half of natural springs found to be drying up 3 the central himalaya such as nepal where 12 of springs are observed to have dried up during the last 10 years 56 and the eastern himalaya such as sikkim where spring discharge has decreased by almost 35 in the 2000 s 77 however due to the scarcity of data the condition of most of the springs is yet unknown only a few studies have been carried out to establish the relationship between precipitation spring discharge and recharge in small and distributed areas 52 80 77 79 67 40 55 it is shown that there is large variation in the third pole in the eastern part of the third pole in sikkim and uttarakhand rainfall and spring discharge are well correlated 77 1 whereas inverse patterns with monthly rainfall are also seen in western himalaya such as kashmir 51 4 runoff and its components different studies using different modeling methods such as degree day 31 45 4 and energy balance methods 88 have been used to quantify the total runoff and its different components namely the glacial melt snowmelt rainfall and baseflow in different upstream river basins of the third pole region lutz et al 45 used a high resolution cryospheric hydrological model based on the degree day approach to assess the contributions of all the components of runoff in the major upstream river basins of the tibetan plateau with an energy balance method for snow modelling and a degree day approach for simulating glacier melts including snow melts on top of glacier zhang et al 88 used the distributed hydrologic model vic to assess the contributions of snowmelt glacier melt and rainfall to runoff in different upstream river basins of the tibetan plateau recently armstrong et al 4 have proposed a new method for differentiating snow on land snow on glacier ice and exposed glacier ice by improving modice modis persistent ice method based on a two strike classification of ice free pixels in combination with the modscag modis snow covered area and grain size retrieval algorithm to create more accurate snow and glacier maps and they used the improved snow and glacier cover data as input for a temperature index model to successfully obtain the contributions of snow and glacier melt in five major river basins of the third pole based on studies by armstrong et al 4 kamp and pan 36 lutz et al 45 and zhang et al 88 and so on which are representative across nine basins a summary of total runoff components for each major basin as well as the whole region are provided in table 2 generally rainfall runoff is the most important component for most of the major basins except the indus amudarya and tarim basins where snow or glacier melt seem to be dominant it is obvious that the components and relative proportions of them can vary much for different basins for example in brahmaputra river basin although the annual snow coverage is around 20 of the total basin area rainfall runoff dominates the total runoff 45 88 where monsoon season contributes to about 70 of annual total precipitation which is also the main melt season for this basin with wet downstream climate lowering the impact of meltwater contributions 32 for the upstream major basins including mekong salween yellow and yangtze the contribution of snowmelt is relatively moderate with its contribution to total annual runoff mainly within 20 30 45 88 however seasonal snowmelt can contribute greater than 50 in amudarya 4 36 and indus 4 such differences can be partly explained by their different snow coverage indus basin has very large snow coverage and its major part is covered with snow for prolonged periods of the year 31 whereas for ganges mekong salween yellow and yangtze river basins the annual snow coverage is less than or equal to 10 of their respective basin area 28 similar to snowmelt the importance of glacier melt also varies dramatically among the different basins the indus has the largest contribution to streamflow from glacial melt 31 45 with much lower contribution of the other major basins such as the yellow yangtze mekong and salween with reported contributions mostly less than 20 68 88 29 it has been indicated that the relative importance of glacier melt increases with proximity to the glaciers 45 for example glacial melt only contributes about 12 of total runoff in upstream ganges river basin 45 but increases up to about 21 and 58 for dudhkoshi and langtang respectively which are both upstream highly glacierized sub basins of ganges river 59 it should be noted that due to the differences in basin definitions study periods modeling approaches input and calibration data observations there are truly some differences in the discharge components reported by different literatures indicating a possibly large uncertainty in some basins the most significant difference may be the snowmelt contributions of ui ug and ub with the large standard derivations of 44 27 and 35 respectively as shown in table 2 for example the snowmelt contributions in ui ug and ub from armstrong et al 4 are all much larger than those from lutz et al 45 it may be because of their different melt modelling subroutines and different discharge observations armstrong et al 4 used improved snow and glacier cover data as input for snow glacier melt modelling and lutz et al 45 calibrated their model using more upstream gauge stations 5 climate change impacts it has been indicated that most parts of the third pole have undergone a significant warming trend in regions such as the tibetan plateau precipitation shows an increasing trend after the 1980s due to these trends in the climatic variables there will be more uncertainty and variability in the hydrological cycle of the region such complexity is reflected in the glacier response during the last several decades with the most intense glacier retreat occurring in the monsoon dominated region less retreat in the transition region and the least retreat in the westerlies dominated region 85 future climate projections under different rcp scenarios also show negative mass balance and lower equilibrium line altitudes by the end of the century for the himalayan region with some percentage of glaciers facing eventual disappearance 14 rise of global temperatures by 1 5 c will lead to a decrease of around 36 of total glacial mass stored in the high mountain asia 39 changes in climatic conditions in winter westerlies have been linked with increases in snow water equivalent swe in indus and ganges catchments resulting in more snowfall in parts of indus 13 76 53 in high mountain asia increased temperature 85 causes an earlier melting of snow 73 and more precipitation falls in the form of rain in the majority of the region 45 37 and this results in negative summer swe trends in the region along with projections of increasing temperatures total precipitation also shows an increasing trend by the middle of twenty first century 37 due to these ongoing and projected changes in glacier and snow coverage and projected precipitation trends the timing of water availability may change and this could pose challenges for water management although the total water availability may only increase the challenge is to deal with shifts in timing and an increase in extremes several modelling studies have been conducted to evaluate the impacts of climate change on future water resources immerzeel et al 32 used a glacio hydrological model for projecting runoff at the end of the century for baltoro and langtang catchments in spite of their different climates it was indicated that both catchments showed a consistent increase in total streamflow with projected glacial melt increase expected to be main cause for streamflow increase in baltoro and projected precipitation increase expected to be main cause for streamflow increase in langtang catchment this study concluded that water availability in this century was very less likely to decline and river basins depending on glacier melt and monsoon rainfall would continue to meet the expected increase in water demands within vulnerable river basins such as indus lutz et al 44 had analyzed the changes in seasonality and hydrological extremes in the upper indus basin predictions for seasonality of flow included minor increases in summer flow and increased flow in other seasons in near future period of 2021 2050 and decreases in summer flow and stronger increased flow in other seasons for far future period of 2071 2100 mainly driven by increases in extreme precipitation increase in flooding events during 21st century due to increases in intensity and frequency of extreme discharges were predicted for most of the upper indus basin their study suggested developing sound basin wide adaption strategies that could take into account changing demand and supply in the indus basin similarly wijngaard et al 81 had assessed the future changes in climatic extremes and hydrological extremes for the upper indus upper ganges and upper brahmaputra river basins and found out that climatic extremes were projected to increase in magnitude by end of 21st century with precipitation extremes increasing mostly in upper indus basin in rainfall dominated upper brahmaputra river basin increases in precipitation extremes may contribute to discharge extremes such studies have also been conducted in lhasa river 57 koshi 8 and shigar 75 watersheds which generally project an increase in runoff however the rather big uncertainty from the evidently different outputs of different climate models is still a large problem in future projection studies as indicated by immerzeel et al 32 6 conclusion due to complexity of processes affecting precipitation there is large spatial and temporal variability in the region two forms of precipitation on the third pole namely the snowfall and rainfall also add to the variability seasonality of snow cover shows a large variation among different river basins with maximum snow cover varying from early spring e g brahmaputra mid autumn e g upstream yangtze late autumn e g upstream salween to winter e g upper mekong yellow amudarya and ganges many glaciers have been losing mass in the region contributing to annual excess river discharge within the river basins where the glaciers are situated significant depletion of groundwater has been observed in the indian plains and nepal the lack of sufficient observational data has led to an inadequate understanding of groundwater hydrology in the region many springs are reported to be drying up or becoming seasonal in the region however due to the lack of observational data the condition of most of the springs is still unknown the summary of hydrological modeling studies indicates that for all the river basins cumulatively rainfall is the main contributor to runoff followed by snow and glacial melt the relative contribution of these components however varies greatly among the different river basins due to the increase in precipitation and glacial melt near future water availability is generally projected to increase for various river basins and sub basins with also clear seasonal shifts in some basins hydrological and climatic extremes were also predicted to increase in some river basins with increase in precipitation extremes causing an increase in discharge extremes however there is large uncertainty in these future projections owing to climate model uncertainty acknowledgements this review is supported by the strategic priority research program of the chinese academy of sciences xda20060202 and the second
