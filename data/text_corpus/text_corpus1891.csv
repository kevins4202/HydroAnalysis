9455,water scarcity and deficiency of trace elements e g cu and mn in soils of arid and semi arid areas are major constrains to crop growth and development the application of brackish water drip irrigation system bwdis coupled with trace elements is probably an effective way to solve this problem however fouling problems caused by trace elements in bwdis were inevitable therefore this paper evaluates the mechanism of different types of trace element chelated fertilizers on the fouling of emitters in bwdis by using long period high frequency periodic flow monitoring and mineral fraction analysis the influence of chelated fertilizers such as copper edta cu and manganese edta mn and traditional micro fertilizers copper sulfate cuso4 and manganese sulfate mnso4 on emitter fouling in bwdis were investigated results suggested compared with ck the edta cu effectively alleviated the emitter fouling increasing the average discharge ratio dra and christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu by 21 0 28 9 and 36 7 67 6 respectively due to the strong adsorption ability edta cu adsorb the ca2 and mg2 in bwdis which enhanced the structural stability reduced the flocculation and deposition ability in the fouling and indirectly reduced the content of calcium and silica fouling in addition compared with ck the edta mn significantly aggravated the emitter fouling in bwdis decreasing the dra and cu by 18 2 22 5 and 24 5 43 1 respectively edta mn directly increased the content of ca2 and mg2 in bwdis due to strong flocculation which destroyed the morphology of edta mn chelates and indirectly increased the content of calcium silica fouling calcite muscovite k feldspar dolomite and chlorite thus reduced the anti clogging ability of bwdis considering these results this study does not recommend the application of edta mn for manganese fertilizer in bwdis this study provides a new perspective on the rapid application of micronutrient fertilization in bwdis with potential implications for sustainable development in arid and semi arid areas key words brackish water drip irrigation integration of water and fertilizer irrigation and fertilization emitter fouling 1 introduction scarcity of fresh water resource and soil micronutrient in arid and semi arid regions are major constrain restricting the sustainable agricultural development and soil environmental safety oliver and gregory 2015 fang and zhang 2020 zhi et al 2022 the effective utilization of inferior water could be a meaningful measure to fulfill the irrigation water demands china s arid regions especially in the northwest are rich in brackish water resources although the abundant resources of brackish water are being extensively successfully utilized for agricultural irrigation xie et al 2011 zhu et al 2019 the direct brackish water irrigation due to high salinity may be detrimental to the soil environment and crop health zhao et al 2020 the brackish water drip irrigation systems bwdis due its precision reduce the salt stress in soil root zone chen et al 2020 and improve the crop growth environment he et al 2017 in addition brackish water contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions resulting in precipitate and particulate fouling in emitter flow channels of bwdis zhangzhong et al 2016 consequently reduced fertilization and irrigation uniformity of bwdis and even scrapped the whole drip irrigation system so far research advances alleviation of bwdis clogging mainly focused on changing water quality characteristics rohit katuri et al 2019 and magnetization methods sahin et al 2012 liu et al 2021b lili et al 2021 conducted a study on the effect of water salinity on emitter clogging in bwdis and found that as the salinity of brackish water increases it promotes the formation of clogging substances only few studies have examined the effect of bwdis on emitter clogging under different types of fertilizer application liu et al 2021a stated that the different types of fertilizer are the key factors affecting emitter clogging in bwdis wang et al 2020 suggested ammonium phosphate reduced emitter clogging of bwdis meanwhile ma et al 2020 and muhammad et al 2021 reported that the application of acid based phosphate such as ammonium polyphosphate and urea phosphate fertilizer in saline waters significantly reduced the emitter clogging therefore reasonable selection of fertilizer type would provide a new perspective to resolve the emitter clogging issue in bwdis recently chelated trace elements attracted wide attention and broad application prospect souri and hatamian 2019 manganese and copper are essential trace elements for crop growth and development and their deficiency not only affects crop quality but also soil texture li et al 2020 according to the survey there is a relative lack of manganese and copper the trace elements required by crops in the soil of the arid regions of northwest china especially in xinjiang s tarim basin and its surrounding areas zhang et al 2005 han et al 2010 saifuding et al 2010 hu et al 2019 therefore the supplementation of trace element manganese and copper fertilizer by drip irrigation which is not only easy to operate but also harmless to crops has become the most effective way at present so far the previous literatures extensively reported the effects of manganese and copper fertilizer on improving crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency fageria and santos 2014 wang et al 2019 however the critical effects of aforementioned fertilizer on emitter clogging in bwdis has not been explored yet chelated edta fertilizer is rich in carboxyl hydroxyl amino and other active functional groups which will react with ca2 and mg2 in brackish water and produce chemical fouling li et al 2019a resulting in clogging of drip irrigation system thus two types of edta copper edta cu and manganese edta mn fertilizers and two types of traditional micro fertilizers copper sulfate cuso4 manganese sulfate mnso4 were studied the effect of micronutrient fertilizers on fouling in bwdis were investigated by means of x ray diffraction the objectives of this study were 1 to clarify the effects of edta cu and edta mn fertilizer on hydraulic performance and fouling in bwdis 2 to reveal the influence mechanism and regulation pathway of edta cu and edta mn fertilizer on calcium silica fouling in bwdis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in the irrigation experimental station 81 11 43 e 40 37 24 n of water resources management center of the 1st division of the xinjiang production and construction corps china the experiment consisted of five independent and identical drip irrigation system test platforms as shown in fig 1 three different types of non pressure compensated drip irrigation sprinklers with flow rates of 1 0 l h 1 6 l h and 2 0 l h were used in the experiment and three different types of emitters representing three different samples under the same treatment factor conditions were used to study the clogging mechanism of the drip irrigation system and the detailed structural parameters are shown in table s1 the testing system consist of three layers of 15 m long and 16 mm internal diameter drip irrigation laterals and each layer represents a single type of drip lateral the emitters were evenly installed along drip laterals with 30 cm spacing interval a total of 50 emitters per drip irrigation belt the initial flow test of all emitters at the beginning of system operation each type of emitter was replicated 8 time which were used for sampling at different hours of system operation and a stacked filtration system was installed at the head of bwdis during the experiment the brackish water was first stored in a water tank hereafter filtered through the laminated filter length width and height size 290 260 150 mm filter precision 120 µm before interring the bwdis flushing devices installed at the end part of bwdis to flush the system after every 8 d at the flow rate of 0 45 m s song et al 2017 the study utilized brackish groundwater located at an experimental station temporarily stored in a covered groundwater tank using a small amount of fertilizer added several times stirred until completely dissolved and well mixed before being injected into the tank at a total dissolved salt tds concentration of 3000 mg l for each treatment finally a total of five treatments were set up for no fertilizer ck two types of edta chelated copper and manganese fertilizers edta cu and edta mn and two types of traditional micro fertilizers cuso4 and mnso4 with specific information on fertilizer manufacturers and compound content shown in supplementary materials table s2 because there is no uniform threshold for drip irrigation application concentration of micronutrient fertilizers the previous survey found that compared with the second soil survey in the area the lowest trace element content of manganese in the effective state was 1 48 mg l a decrease of 53 58 and the lowest copper in the effective state was 0 33 mg l a decrease of 47 51 zheng et al 2003 this study micronutrient fertilization concentration for manganese and copper was 0 5 mg l and 0 2 mg l bres et al 2010 kang 2012 cary et al 2015 and the number of fertilization applications were 3 and 9 respectively bian et al 2018 the system used groundwater brackish with a total dissolved salinity tds of 3000 mg l and operated from july 26 2020 to october 2 2020 meanwhile a total of two water samples were taken from the tanks of the test platform on august 2 2020 and october 2 2020 respectively and their irrigation water quality parameters are shown in table s3 of the supplementary material in addition this system was tested for continuous acceleration han et al 2019 using recirculating water treatment and pressure dividers the bwdis operated under optimal operating conditions for a total of 64 days 12 h per day representing 8 years of total irrigation time in the actual field alternate irrigation and fertilization was adopted li et al 2006 with fertilizer application occurring in the middle of the entire system operation with 0 8 m3 of irrigation water while manganese fertilizer was applied at a rate of 283 3 mg per application and copper fertilizer at a rate of 113 3 mg per application the system tested the outflow of the emitter every 8 days 2 2 evaluation of emitter hydraulic performance during the operation all 50 emitters on each drip irrigation belt were tested for hydraulic performance after 8 days of system operation the weighing method is used to test the flow rate of the emitter and the test time of each emitter is 3 min before the flow rate test of the emitter the pressure of the head of the drip irrigation system is adjusted to ensure that the system inlet pressure is stable at 0 1mpa when the flow rate is tested ma et al 2020 thereafter a high precision electronic balance precision of 10 4 g was used to calculate the average discharge variation rate dra li et al 2019b and christiansen of uniformity cao et al 2020 as this was an outdoor experiment the irrigation water or surrounding temperature could be a key factor to effect emitter outflow thus the irrigation water temperature was monitored regularly to eliminate the effect of water temperature changes on flow pei et al 2013 liu et al 2019 meanwhile the temperature changes in different periods are shown in fig s1 of the supplementary material 1 dra i 1 n q it q i

clogging substances in drip irrigation systems caco3 will stabilize eventually as calcite minerals usually the possibility of caco3 precipitation can be evaluated by langelier saturation index lsi ayers and westcot 1985 when lsi 0 caco3 of solution is considered to be in supersaturated state and can still continue to fouling when lsi 0 caco3 in solution is considered to be in a saturated state and neither fouling nor dissolution is possible when lsi 0 caco3 in solution is considered to be in a non saturated state and the solution can still continue to dissolve langelier 1936 4 lsi ph ph s where ph is the irrigation water ph and phs is saturated solution ph 2 4 emitter fouling substances extraction and analysis during the experiment 15 samples with emitter flow rates close to the average relative flow rate were selected at the head middle and end of bwdis at 16 32 48 and 64 days of operation respectively emitter samples were carefully stripped placed in a zip lock bags and 45 ml of deionized water was added to detach the fouling substance from emitter flow channels using an ultrasonic cleaner for 20 min manufacturer hangzhou farent ultrasonic cleaning co ltd model no gvs 10 l hereafter 15 ml of treated suspension was centrifuged to balance solid residues in bottom of centrifuge tubes after centrifugation the fouling substances were dried at a constant temperature of

4 g model ert to obtain the final dry weight dw of fouling substances the fouling substances were ground gently and subjected to x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance to obtain the polycrystalline diffraction pattern and phase composition 2 5 statistical analysis spss software was used for single factor analysis anova to determine the significant differences of water quality parameters among different treatments spearman correlation analysis and structural equation model sem was performed using amos v 24 ibm usa to calculate the interactions between different fouling substances and its effects on the performance bwdis 3 results and analysis 3 1 effects of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers application on irrigation water quality system operation at the beginning and late thermostatic tank water quality tests respectively through the test found fig 2 table s4 we can see that the application of chelated edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 increased the contents of cu2 hco3 and zeta potential in brackish water while the content of ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 were significantly p 0 05 decreased when compared with ck on the other hand the application of chelated edta mn fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the water ph hco3 and zeta potential and significantly p 0 05 increased contents of ca2 mn2 so4 2 comparing with conventional cuso4 fertilizer edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 while increased the ph hco3 and unit of zeta potential the application of edta mn fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the hco3 and zeta potential while increased the ca2 mg2 so4 2 co3 2 when compared with conventional mnso4 fertilizer overall the cuso4 fertilizer and chelated edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 and increased hco3 and zeta potential then ck in brackish water similarly the application of chelated edta mn fertilizer increased the content of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 while decreased the hco3 and zeta potential in brackish water 3 2 effect of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on bwdis performance and fouling the general profile of hydraulic performance dra and cu and fouling characteristics of bwdis under different fertilizer treatments are shown in fig 3 see supplementary materials fig s2 and fig s3 of the dynamics of dra and cu for individual emitter types as shown in fig 3a b with the increase of system operation time both dra and cu of different fertilization treatments showed a trend of slowly decreasing then rapidly decreasing and then slowly decreasing mainly dra and cu showed a slow decreasing trend from 0 to 16 d of system operation a rapid decreasing trend from 16 to 48 d of system operation and a slow decreasing trend again from 48 to 64 d of system operation at the end of system operation chelated edta cu fertilizer increased dra and cu of bwdis by an average of 5 4 and 12 5 respectively compared with ck treatment while chelated edta mn fertilizer decreased dra and cu by 9 1 and 19 5 respectively also as indicated by the correlation between dra and cu fig 3c d compared with ck the application of chelated edta cu fertilizer p 0 05 increased the dra and cu of bwdis by 17 0 and 22 0 while chelated edta mn fertilizer reduced the dra and cu by 26 0 and 35 0 respectively as well as the edta cu fertilizer increased the dra and cu of bwdis by 62 0 and 71 0 then the conventional cuso4 fertilizer at the same time the edta mn fertilizer decreased the dra and cu of bwdis by 61 0 and 78 0 when compared with conventional mnso4 fertilizer the variation of total dw and relative proportion of fouling mineral component in emitter flow channels of bwdis are shown in fig 3e f the fouling total dw in bwdis decreased by 2 0 5 5 mg cm2 in edta cu fertilizer while increased by 1 1 3 5 mg cm2 in edta mn fertilizer when compared with ck on the other hand the edta cu treatment decreased by 5 5 20 9 mg cm2 while edta mn treatment increased by 7 7 14 4 mg cm2 when compared with cuso4 and mnso4 treatment respectively the x ray diffraction analysis shows the mineral compositions of fouling substance in bwdis mainly include quartz sio2 muscovite k mg al 2 04 si3 34al0 66 o10 oh 2 calcite caco3 k feldspar knaalsi3o8 and chlorite mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 and dolomite camg co3 2 according to the main chemical elements the mineral components were divided into calcium and silica fouling which were accounted for 14 8 25 3 and 74 7 85 2 respectively 3 3 effect of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on calcium fouling the time series variation and correlations of calcium fouling among different treatments are shown in fig 4a f the content of calcium fouling was linearly increased with increase of operating days of bwdis the total content of carbonate fouling showed a significant increasing trend under different fertilizer compared with ck the total content of calcium fouling was significantly p 0 05 reduced by 1 2 4 9 with the application of edta cu among which the content of calcite was increased by 1 8 and dolomite was decreased by 25 0 the content of calcium fouling under edta mn was increased by 9 6 29 2 in which the calcite was decreased by 3 5 and dolomite increased by 87 8 meanwhile compared with cuso4 the edta cu reduced the total content of calcium fouling by 21 0 herein the content of calcite increased by 41 7 and dolomite reduced by 78 8 compared with mnso4 edta mn increased the calcium fouling by 43 4 in which calcite was increased by 15 9 and dolomite by 71 4 3 4 effect of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on silica fouling the time series variation in content of silica fouling fig 5a j showed the consistent variation trend with that of calcium fouling in bwdis after the same operating days compared with ck the application of edta cu decreased by total content of silica fouling by 0 1 7 2 in which the quartz and k feldspar contents were increased by 1 3 3 5 and 21 2 26 9 respectively while the contents of muscovite and chlorite decreased by 1 7 7 8 and 3 2 59 9 respectively compared with ck the application of edta mn increased the content of silica fouling by 3 2 7 8 while quartz was decreased by 0 4 3 8 among these the contents of muscovite k feldspar and chlorite were increased by 5 5 15 2 0 5 3 6 and 12 3 14 4 respectively meanwhile compared with cuso4 the content of silicates were decreased by 3 6 23 5 in which quartz and k feldspar increased by 3 1 19 1 and 36 0 40 9 while muscovite and chlorite were decreased by 18 1 28 6 and 23 6 68 1 respectively compared with mnso4 the total content of silicates were increased by 9 6 24 6 in which the quartz decreased by 11 3 15 2 while k feldspar muscovite and chlorite increased by 20 9 51 6 12 8 42 6 and 6 5 25 5 respectively 3 5 influence path analysis of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers the spearmen s correlation analysis fig 6 a that when manganese copper fertilizer is applied generally more than 68 of the mineral component fouling is closely related to the physical and chemical parameters of water the results show that there is a significant correlation between the ph ca2 mg2 mn2 cu2 hco3 co3 2 so4 2 and zeta of brackish water and calcium fouling calcite dolomite and silica fouling dolomite k feldspar chlorite and quartz p 0 05 through the structural equation model fig 6 b it is also found that the results of structural equation model sem analysis are consistent with spearman s analysis and the water quality parameters are consistent with calcium fouling β 0 86 p 0 01 and silica fouling β 0 57 p 0 01 in general the application of manganese copper fertilizer directly changes the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 so4 2 and zeta in brackish water indirectly changes the contents of calcium fouling and silica fouling and then affects the fouling content of drip irrigation system β concentrated between 0 26 and 0 97 4 discussions 4 1 edta cu and edta mn fertilizers significantly change brackish water quality the application of edta cu significantly p 0 05 decreased the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 so4 2 and zeta potential while increased the ph and hco3 fig 2 in brackish irrigation water this could be due to the edta is in rich of functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups li et al 2019a and edta cu formed by edta and cu2 has a strong adsorption capacity it can undergo complex chemical reactions with metal ions such as ca2 and mg2 in bwdis plenio et al 1997 thus reducing the content of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water in addition edta significantly p 0 05 affected the solubility of carbonates in brackish water li et al 2019c reduces the content of co3 2 and promoted to be converted into hco3 ma et al 2020 thus increasing ph and hco3 content in brackish water and chelate or adsorb by the suspended solids wang and wang 2005 which positively affected the activities of sulfate free radicals and hydroxyl groups ahmad et al 2012 thereby reducing the content of so4 2 at the same time the application of edta cu fertilizer also introduced a large positive charges electrostatic adsorption with positive charges such as ca2 mg2 and the electric double layer is compressed to produce a potential difference soja et al 2018 which increases the zeta potential in brackish water on the other hand the edta mn significantly p 0 05 increased the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 while decreased the hco3 and zeta potential in brackish water this could be mainly due to the formation of stable complex between edta and mn2 babu et al 2004 however due to the weaker oxidizing of mn2 the flocculation capacity of mn2 is stronger than cu2 karbassi and nadjafpour 1996 thus making stronger the flocculation capacity of edta mn than edta cu which affect the thermodynamic affinity of ca2 mg2 and other metal ions in brackish water which break the morphology of chelate edta cu which is conducive to the accumulation of edta ca and edta mg sediments in drip irrigation system kent et al 2002 at the same time edta mn fertilizer affected the solubility of brackish water promoted the conversion of hco3 to co3 2 and h and increased the content of co3 2 in addition the hydroxyl functional group contained in edta mn could increase the electrochemical reaction rate of chelate chang et al 2009 resulting in electrochemical behavior between edta mn and anion which leads to increase of current intensity treacy et al 2000 edta mn releases free mn2 in brackish water through oxidation decomposition and oxidizes divalent manganese ions into trivalent manganese ions manganese oxides are rich in hydroxyl groups on their surfaces and due to the low zero charge point of manganese oxide minerals which increases the absorption and enrichment capacity of sulfate free radicals and hydroxyl groups gao et al 2020a 4 2 impact mechanism of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on calcium silica fouling our results showed that the application of chelated manganese and copper fertilizer directly affected the content of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water which indirectly effected the fouling of minerals bwdis through the chelation adsorption between manganese copper and brackish water the content of calcium carbonate fouling in bwdis was significantly p 0 05 decreased and increased with application of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers fig 3 on one hand edta cu fertilizer positive impact the ph and contents of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water inhibited the adsorption ability between ca2 and mg2 with edta cu garcia blas et al 2019 reducing the reaction of ca2 mg2 with co3 2 so4 2 and hco3 to form caco3 caso4 and camg co3 2 however since the solubility of caco3 is smaller than caso4 trendafelov et al 1995 which camg co3 2 is increases the risk of chemical reaction between ca2 and caso4 to produce caco3 leading to increased calcite content and decreased dolomite content however the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the content of calcite and dolomite edta can form a stable complex with mn2 babu et al 2004 which did not easily dissolve calcite and dolomite and react with other substances in addition the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the content of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water promoting the risk of ca2 and mg2 reacting with co3 2 so4 2 and hco3 in water to form fouling such as caco3 caso4 and camg co3 2 at the same time we also found by calculating the lsi values that the lsi values in edta cu and edta mn fertilizer treatments were 0 64 and 0 58 respectively both of which were greater than 0 both of them were in supersaturated state which destroyed the structure of the chelate thompson et al 2000 reduced the secondary nucleation rate of calcite promoted the conversion of hco3 to co3 2 and h increased the co3 2 content and increased the growth rate of calcite fouling bharthasarathi and murugakoothan 2014 which led to an increase in calcite content the application of both edta cu and edta mn fertilizers decreased and increased the silica fouling content of bwdis fig 4 edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the contents of muscovite and chlorite while increased the contents of quartz and k feldspar that was mainly because edta cu fertilizer contains active functional groups and has strong adsorption capacity which provided a great amount of binding sites for muscovite to be adsorbed on the surface of muscovite zhu et al 2020 the electrostatic attraction increased the muscovite crystal structure zhang et al 2015 while the affinity of chlorite was affected by chelation and the reduced the chlorite content by chemical adsorption gao et al 2020b moreover the quartz and k feldspar fouling has higher permeability and surface porosity shafiq et al 2018 however due to the low permeability of edta cu shafiq et al 2019 the permeability and porosity of quartz and k feldspar become smaller and fouling deposition was more likely to occur furthermore the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the content of muscovite k feldspar and chlorite but decreased the content of quartz fouling which could be mainly due to the application of edta mn fertilizer edta mn contains hydroxyl and other active functional groups which will form competitive adsorption with muscovite k feldspar and chlorite in silica fouling through the electron transfer the oxidation rate of mn2 was increased li et al 2016 which enhanced the flocculation capacity of edta mn resulting in more muscovite k feldspar and chlorite fouling in addition the gradual increase of mn2 oxidation rate the edta mn hydroxyl complex inhibited the adsorption of quartz lelis et al 2016 and inhibited the flocculation and sedimentation intensity of quartz that reduced the content of quartz fouling the edta cu and edta mn would directly affect the calcium silica fouling by changing the quality major parameters and there was a significant interaction between calcium and silica fouling fig 6b p 0 05 appreciable impact in the content of calcium fouling also provided a wide speared binding sites for silica fouling meyer 1984 which can change the content of silicon fouling through mutual coupling meanwhile the change of silica fouling content also provides opportunities for the formation of calcium fouling therefore the aforementioned two types of fouling are directly depended and compete with each other shen et al 2019 manganese and copper fertilizer directly affected the brackish water quality which will indirectly affected the content of calcium silica fouling and content of total fouling in bwdis at the same time in brackish water with high calcium and magnesium ion content the application of dilute acid has also become an effective way to alleviate brackish water drip irrigation mainly by reducing the content of calcium fouling in the emitter hao et al 2018 which in turn results in the removal of clogging substances aali et al 2009 in this study we found that the calcium fouling content was only 14 8 25 3 and most of it was present in the form of silica fouling with 74 7 85 2 for which the use of reasonable effective and anti clogging fertilizers became crucial in this study in order to avoid this important effect in conclusion based on ours results the application of edta cu fertilizer as copper fertilizer in bwdis while edta mn fertilizer is not suitable to be used as manganese fertilizer in bwdis however the economic cost limitation is unfavorable for the widespread use of edta cu fertilizer future studies should consider different types of manganese and copper fertilizers under different mineralization conditions to verify the reliability and widespread application of the results 5 conclusions the following major conclusions can be drawn from the present study 1 compared with ck the application of edta cu reduced the content of fouling by 3 6 6 7 in emitter flow channels of bwdis resulting to increase the dra and cu by 2 1 28 9 and 6 8 26 4 respectively while the application of edta mn increased content of fouling by 2 0 4 4 which decreased the dra and cu by 5 7 13 2 and 15 3 19 4 in bwdis 2 the total content of calcium and silica fouling decreased by 1 2 4 9 and 0 1 7 2 application of edta cu however the total content of calcium and silica fouling increased by 9 6 29 2 and 3 2 7 8 in edta mn when compared with ck 3 the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the ca2 and mg2 content of brackish water which indirectly increased the content of calcite dolomite muscovite k feldspar and chlorite while decreasing the content of quartz consequently increased the possibility for clogging of bwdis while edta cu reduced the content of ca2 and mg2 which indirectly reduced the content of dolomite muscovite and chlorite and increased the content of quartz calcite and k feldspar thus decreased the possibility of clogging on bwdis 4 based on the results of this study we recommend the use of edta cu and mnso4 fertilizers instead of cuso4 and edta mn fertilizers for drip irrigation of manganese and copper fertilizers in brackish water

9455,water scarcity and deficiency of trace elements e g cu and mn in soils of arid and semi arid areas are major constrains to crop growth and development the application of brackish water drip irrigation system bwdis coupled with trace elements is probably an effective way to solve this problem however fouling problems caused by trace elements in bwdis were inevitable therefore this paper evaluates the mechanism of different types of trace element chelated fertilizers on the fouling of emitters in bwdis by using long period high frequency periodic flow monitoring and mineral fraction analysis the influence of chelated fertilizers such as copper edta cu and manganese edta mn and traditional micro fertilizers copper sulfate cuso4 and manganese sulfate mnso4 on emitter fouling in bwdis were investigated results suggested compared with ck the edta cu effectively alleviated the emitter fouling increasing the average discharge ratio dra and christiansen coefficient of uniformity cu by 21 0 28 9 and 36 7 67 6 respectively due to the strong adsorption ability edta cu adsorb the ca2 and mg2 in bwdis which enhanced the structural stability reduced the flocculation and deposition ability in the fouling and indirectly reduced the content of calcium and silica fouling in addition compared with ck the edta mn significantly aggravated the emitter fouling in bwdis decreasing the dra and cu by 18 2 22 5 and 24 5 43 1 respectively edta mn directly increased the content of ca2 and mg2 in bwdis due to strong flocculation which destroyed the morphology of edta mn chelates and indirectly increased the content of calcium silica fouling calcite muscovite k feldspar dolomite and chlorite thus reduced the anti clogging ability of bwdis considering these results this study does not recommend the application of edta mn for manganese fertilizer in bwdis this study provides a new perspective on the rapid application of micronutrient fertilization in bwdis with potential implications for sustainable development in arid and semi arid areas key words brackish water drip irrigation integration of water and fertilizer irrigation and fertilization emitter fouling 1 introduction scarcity of fresh water resource and soil micronutrient in arid and semi arid regions are major constrain restricting the sustainable agricultural development and soil environmental safety oliver and gregory 2015 fang and zhang 2020 zhi et al 2022 the effective utilization of inferior water could be a meaningful measure to fulfill the irrigation water demands china s arid regions especially in the northwest are rich in brackish water resources although the abundant resources of brackish water are being extensively successfully utilized for agricultural irrigation xie et al 2011 zhu et al 2019 the direct brackish water irrigation due to high salinity may be detrimental to the soil environment and crop health zhao et al 2020 the brackish water drip irrigation systems bwdis due its precision reduce the salt stress in soil root zone chen et al 2020 and improve the crop growth environment he et al 2017 in addition brackish water contains high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions resulting in precipitate and particulate fouling in emitter flow channels of bwdis zhangzhong et al 2016 consequently reduced fertilization and irrigation uniformity of bwdis and even scrapped the whole drip irrigation system so far research advances alleviation of bwdis clogging mainly focused on changing water quality characteristics rohit katuri et al 2019 and magnetization methods sahin et al 2012 liu et al 2021b lili et al 2021 conducted a study on the effect of water salinity on emitter clogging in bwdis and found that as the salinity of brackish water increases it promotes the formation of clogging substances only few studies have examined the effect of bwdis on emitter clogging under different types of fertilizer application liu et al 2021a stated that the different types of fertilizer are the key factors affecting emitter clogging in bwdis wang et al 2020 suggested ammonium phosphate reduced emitter clogging of bwdis meanwhile ma et al 2020 and muhammad et al 2021 reported that the application of acid based phosphate such as ammonium polyphosphate and urea phosphate fertilizer in saline waters significantly reduced the emitter clogging therefore reasonable selection of fertilizer type would provide a new perspective to resolve the emitter clogging issue in bwdis recently chelated trace elements attracted wide attention and broad application prospect souri and hatamian 2019 manganese and copper are essential trace elements for crop growth and development and their deficiency not only affects crop quality but also soil texture li et al 2020 according to the survey there is a relative lack of manganese and copper the trace elements required by crops in the soil of the arid regions of northwest china especially in xinjiang s tarim basin and its surrounding areas zhang et al 2005 han et al 2010 saifuding et al 2010 hu et al 2019 therefore the supplementation of trace element manganese and copper fertilizer by drip irrigation which is not only easy to operate but also harmless to crops has become the most effective way at present so far the previous literatures extensively reported the effects of manganese and copper fertilizer on improving crop yield and fertilizer use efficiency fageria and santos 2014 wang et al 2019 however the critical effects of aforementioned fertilizer on emitter clogging in bwdis has not been explored yet chelated edta fertilizer is rich in carboxyl hydroxyl amino and other active functional groups which will react with ca2 and mg2 in brackish water and produce chemical fouling li et al 2019a resulting in clogging of drip irrigation system thus two types of edta copper edta cu and manganese edta mn fertilizers and two types of traditional micro fertilizers copper sulfate cuso4 manganese sulfate mnso4 were studied the effect of micronutrient fertilizers on fouling in bwdis were investigated by means of x ray diffraction the objectives of this study were 1 to clarify the effects of edta cu and edta mn fertilizer on hydraulic performance and fouling in bwdis 2 to reveal the influence mechanism and regulation pathway of edta cu and edta mn fertilizer on calcium silica fouling in bwdis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in the irrigation experimental station 81 11 43 e 40 37 24 n of water resources management center of the 1st division of the xinjiang production and construction corps china the experiment consisted of five independent and identical drip irrigation system test platforms as shown in fig 1 three different types of non pressure compensated drip irrigation sprinklers with flow rates of 1 0 l h 1 6 l h and 2 0 l h were used in the experiment and three different types of emitters representing three different samples under the same treatment factor conditions were used to study the clogging mechanism of the drip irrigation system and the detailed structural parameters are shown in table s1 the testing system consist of three layers of 15 m long and 16 mm internal diameter drip irrigation laterals and each layer represents a single type of drip lateral the emitters were evenly installed along drip laterals with 30 cm spacing interval a total of 50 emitters per drip irrigation belt the initial flow test of all emitters at the beginning of system operation each type of emitter was replicated 8 time which were used for sampling at different hours of system operation and a stacked filtration system was installed at the head of bwdis during the experiment the brackish water was first stored in a water tank hereafter filtered through the laminated filter length width and height size 290 260 150 mm filter precision 120 µm before interring the bwdis flushing devices installed at the end part of bwdis to flush the system after every 8 d at the flow rate of 0 45 m s song et al 2017 the study utilized brackish groundwater located at an experimental station temporarily stored in a covered groundwater tank using a small amount of fertilizer added several times stirred until completely dissolved and well mixed before being injected into the tank at a total dissolved salt tds concentration of 3000 mg l for each treatment finally a total of five treatments were set up for no fertilizer ck two types of edta chelated copper and manganese fertilizers edta cu and edta mn and two types of traditional micro fertilizers cuso4 and mnso4 with specific information on fertilizer manufacturers and compound content shown in supplementary materials table s2 because there is no uniform threshold for drip irrigation application concentration of micronutrient fertilizers the previous survey found that compared with the second soil survey in the area the lowest trace element content of manganese in the effective state was 1 48 mg l a decrease of 53 58 and the lowest copper in the effective state was 0 33 mg l a decrease of 47 51 zheng et al 2003 this study micronutrient fertilization concentration for manganese and copper was 0 5 mg l and 0 2 mg l bres et al 2010 kang 2012 cary et al 2015 and the number of fertilization applications were 3 and 9 respectively bian et al 2018 the system used groundwater brackish with a total dissolved salinity tds of 3000 mg l and operated from july 26 2020 to october 2 2020 meanwhile a total of two water samples were taken from the tanks of the test platform on august 2 2020 and october 2 2020 respectively and their irrigation water quality parameters are shown in table s3 of the supplementary material in addition this system was tested for continuous acceleration han et al 2019 using recirculating water treatment and pressure dividers the bwdis operated under optimal operating conditions for a total of 64 days 12 h per day representing 8 years of total irrigation time in the actual field alternate irrigation and fertilization was adopted li et al 2006 with fertilizer application occurring in the middle of the entire system operation with 0 8 m3 of irrigation water while manganese fertilizer was applied at a rate of 283 3 mg per application and copper fertilizer at a rate of 113 3 mg per application the system tested the outflow of the emitter every 8 days 2 2 evaluation of emitter hydraulic performance during the operation all 50 emitters on each drip irrigation belt were tested for hydraulic performance after 8 days of system operation the weighing method is used to test the flow rate of the emitter and the test time of each emitter is 3 min before the flow rate test of the emitter the pressure of the head of the drip irrigation system is adjusted to ensure that the system inlet pressure is stable at 0 1mpa when the flow rate is tested ma et al 2020 thereafter a high precision electronic balance precision of 10 4 g was used to calculate the average discharge variation rate dra li et al 2019b and christiansen of uniformity cao et al 2020 as this was an outdoor experiment the irrigation water or surrounding temperature could be a key factor to effect emitter outflow thus the irrigation water temperature was monitored regularly to eliminate the effect of water temperature changes on flow pei et al 2013 liu et al 2019 meanwhile the temperature changes in different periods are shown in fig s1 of the supplementary material 1 dra i 1 n q it q i

clogging substances in drip irrigation systems caco3 will stabilize eventually as calcite minerals usually the possibility of caco3 precipitation can be evaluated by langelier saturation index lsi ayers and westcot 1985 when lsi 0 caco3 of solution is considered to be in supersaturated state and can still continue to fouling when lsi 0 caco3 in solution is considered to be in a saturated state and neither fouling nor dissolution is possible when lsi 0 caco3 in solution is considered to be in a non saturated state and the solution can still continue to dissolve langelier 1936 4 lsi ph ph s where ph is the irrigation water ph and phs is saturated solution ph 2 4 emitter fouling substances extraction and analysis during the experiment 15 samples with emitter flow rates close to the average relative flow rate were selected at the head middle and end of bwdis at 16 32 48 and 64 days of operation respectively emitter samples were carefully stripped placed in a zip lock bags and 45 ml of deionized water was added to detach the fouling substance from emitter flow channels using an ultrasonic cleaner for 20 min manufacturer hangzhou farent ultrasonic cleaning co ltd model no gvs 10 l hereafter 15 ml of treated suspension was centrifuged to balance solid residues in bottom of centrifuge tubes after centrifugation the fouling substances were dried at a constant temperature of

4 g model ert to obtain the final dry weight dw of fouling substances the fouling substances were ground gently and subjected to x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance to obtain the polycrystalline diffraction pattern and phase composition 2 5 statistical analysis spss software was used for single factor analysis anova to determine the significant differences of water quality parameters among different treatments spearman correlation analysis and structural equation model sem was performed using amos v 24 ibm usa to calculate the interactions between different fouling substances and its effects on the performance bwdis 3 results and analysis 3 1 effects of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers application on irrigation water quality system operation at the beginning and late thermostatic tank water quality tests respectively through the test found fig 2 table s4 we can see that the application of chelated edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 increased the contents of cu2 hco3 and zeta potential in brackish water while the content of ph ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 were significantly p 0 05 decreased when compared with ck on the other hand the application of chelated edta mn fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the water ph hco3 and zeta potential and significantly p 0 05 increased contents of ca2 mn2 so4 2 comparing with conventional cuso4 fertilizer edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 while increased the ph hco3 and unit of zeta potential the application of edta mn fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the hco3 and zeta potential while increased the ca2 mg2 so4 2 co3 2 when compared with conventional mnso4 fertilizer overall the cuso4 fertilizer and chelated edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 and increased hco3 and zeta potential then ck in brackish water similarly the application of chelated edta mn fertilizer increased the content of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 while decreased the hco3 and zeta potential in brackish water 3 2 effect of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on bwdis performance and fouling the general profile of hydraulic performance dra and cu and fouling characteristics of bwdis under different fertilizer treatments are shown in fig 3 see supplementary materials fig s2 and fig s3 of the dynamics of dra and cu for individual emitter types as shown in fig 3a b with the increase of system operation time both dra and cu of different fertilization treatments showed a trend of slowly decreasing then rapidly decreasing and then slowly decreasing mainly dra and cu showed a slow decreasing trend from 0 to 16 d of system operation a rapid decreasing trend from 16 to 48 d of system operation and a slow decreasing trend again from 48 to 64 d of system operation at the end of system operation chelated edta cu fertilizer increased dra and cu of bwdis by an average of 5 4 and 12 5 respectively compared with ck treatment while chelated edta mn fertilizer decreased dra and cu by 9 1 and 19 5 respectively also as indicated by the correlation between dra and cu fig 3c d compared with ck the application of chelated edta cu fertilizer p 0 05 increased the dra and cu of bwdis by 17 0 and 22 0 while chelated edta mn fertilizer reduced the dra and cu by 26 0 and 35 0 respectively as well as the edta cu fertilizer increased the dra and cu of bwdis by 62 0 and 71 0 then the conventional cuso4 fertilizer at the same time the edta mn fertilizer decreased the dra and cu of bwdis by 61 0 and 78 0 when compared with conventional mnso4 fertilizer the variation of total dw and relative proportion of fouling mineral component in emitter flow channels of bwdis are shown in fig 3e f the fouling total dw in bwdis decreased by 2 0 5 5 mg cm2 in edta cu fertilizer while increased by 1 1 3 5 mg cm2 in edta mn fertilizer when compared with ck on the other hand the edta cu treatment decreased by 5 5 20 9 mg cm2 while edta mn treatment increased by 7 7 14 4 mg cm2 when compared with cuso4 and mnso4 treatment respectively the x ray diffraction analysis shows the mineral compositions of fouling substance in bwdis mainly include quartz sio2 muscovite k mg al 2 04 si3 34al0 66 o10 oh 2 calcite caco3 k feldspar knaalsi3o8 and chlorite mg al 6 si al 4o10 oh 8 and dolomite camg co3 2 according to the main chemical elements the mineral components were divided into calcium and silica fouling which were accounted for 14 8 25 3 and 74 7 85 2 respectively 3 3 effect of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on calcium fouling the time series variation and correlations of calcium fouling among different treatments are shown in fig 4a f the content of calcium fouling was linearly increased with increase of operating days of bwdis the total content of carbonate fouling showed a significant increasing trend under different fertilizer compared with ck the total content of calcium fouling was significantly p 0 05 reduced by 1 2 4 9 with the application of edta cu among which the content of calcite was increased by 1 8 and dolomite was decreased by 25 0 the content of calcium fouling under edta mn was increased by 9 6 29 2 in which the calcite was decreased by 3 5 and dolomite increased by 87 8 meanwhile compared with cuso4 the edta cu reduced the total content of calcium fouling by 21 0 herein the content of calcite increased by 41 7 and dolomite reduced by 78 8 compared with mnso4 edta mn increased the calcium fouling by 43 4 in which calcite was increased by 15 9 and dolomite by 71 4 3 4 effect of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on silica fouling the time series variation in content of silica fouling fig 5a j showed the consistent variation trend with that of calcium fouling in bwdis after the same operating days compared with ck the application of edta cu decreased by total content of silica fouling by 0 1 7 2 in which the quartz and k feldspar contents were increased by 1 3 3 5 and 21 2 26 9 respectively while the contents of muscovite and chlorite decreased by 1 7 7 8 and 3 2 59 9 respectively compared with ck the application of edta mn increased the content of silica fouling by 3 2 7 8 while quartz was decreased by 0 4 3 8 among these the contents of muscovite k feldspar and chlorite were increased by 5 5 15 2 0 5 3 6 and 12 3 14 4 respectively meanwhile compared with cuso4 the content of silicates were decreased by 3 6 23 5 in which quartz and k feldspar increased by 3 1 19 1 and 36 0 40 9 while muscovite and chlorite were decreased by 18 1 28 6 and 23 6 68 1 respectively compared with mnso4 the total content of silicates were increased by 9 6 24 6 in which the quartz decreased by 11 3 15 2 while k feldspar muscovite and chlorite increased by 20 9 51 6 12 8 42 6 and 6 5 25 5 respectively 3 5 influence path analysis of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers the spearmen s correlation analysis fig 6 a that when manganese copper fertilizer is applied generally more than 68 of the mineral component fouling is closely related to the physical and chemical parameters of water the results show that there is a significant correlation between the ph ca2 mg2 mn2 cu2 hco3 co3 2 so4 2 and zeta of brackish water and calcium fouling calcite dolomite and silica fouling dolomite k feldspar chlorite and quartz p 0 05 through the structural equation model fig 6 b it is also found that the results of structural equation model sem analysis are consistent with spearman s analysis and the water quality parameters are consistent with calcium fouling β 0 86 p 0 01 and silica fouling β 0 57 p 0 01 in general the application of manganese copper fertilizer directly changes the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 so4 2 and zeta in brackish water indirectly changes the contents of calcium fouling and silica fouling and then affects the fouling content of drip irrigation system β concentrated between 0 26 and 0 97 4 discussions 4 1 edta cu and edta mn fertilizers significantly change brackish water quality the application of edta cu significantly p 0 05 decreased the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 so4 2 and zeta potential while increased the ph and hco3 fig 2 in brackish irrigation water this could be due to the edta is in rich of functional groups such as carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups li et al 2019a and edta cu formed by edta and cu2 has a strong adsorption capacity it can undergo complex chemical reactions with metal ions such as ca2 and mg2 in bwdis plenio et al 1997 thus reducing the content of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water in addition edta significantly p 0 05 affected the solubility of carbonates in brackish water li et al 2019c reduces the content of co3 2 and promoted to be converted into hco3 ma et al 2020 thus increasing ph and hco3 content in brackish water and chelate or adsorb by the suspended solids wang and wang 2005 which positively affected the activities of sulfate free radicals and hydroxyl groups ahmad et al 2012 thereby reducing the content of so4 2 at the same time the application of edta cu fertilizer also introduced a large positive charges electrostatic adsorption with positive charges such as ca2 mg2 and the electric double layer is compressed to produce a potential difference soja et al 2018 which increases the zeta potential in brackish water on the other hand the edta mn significantly p 0 05 increased the contents of ca2 mg2 co3 2 and so4 2 while decreased the hco3 and zeta potential in brackish water this could be mainly due to the formation of stable complex between edta and mn2 babu et al 2004 however due to the weaker oxidizing of mn2 the flocculation capacity of mn2 is stronger than cu2 karbassi and nadjafpour 1996 thus making stronger the flocculation capacity of edta mn than edta cu which affect the thermodynamic affinity of ca2 mg2 and other metal ions in brackish water which break the morphology of chelate edta cu which is conducive to the accumulation of edta ca and edta mg sediments in drip irrigation system kent et al 2002 at the same time edta mn fertilizer affected the solubility of brackish water promoted the conversion of hco3 to co3 2 and h and increased the content of co3 2 in addition the hydroxyl functional group contained in edta mn could increase the electrochemical reaction rate of chelate chang et al 2009 resulting in electrochemical behavior between edta mn and anion which leads to increase of current intensity treacy et al 2000 edta mn releases free mn2 in brackish water through oxidation decomposition and oxidizes divalent manganese ions into trivalent manganese ions manganese oxides are rich in hydroxyl groups on their surfaces and due to the low zero charge point of manganese oxide minerals which increases the absorption and enrichment capacity of sulfate free radicals and hydroxyl groups gao et al 2020a 4 2 impact mechanism of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers on calcium silica fouling our results showed that the application of chelated manganese and copper fertilizer directly affected the content of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water which indirectly effected the fouling of minerals bwdis through the chelation adsorption between manganese copper and brackish water the content of calcium carbonate fouling in bwdis was significantly p 0 05 decreased and increased with application of edta cu and edta mn fertilizers fig 3 on one hand edta cu fertilizer positive impact the ph and contents of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water inhibited the adsorption ability between ca2 and mg2 with edta cu garcia blas et al 2019 reducing the reaction of ca2 mg2 with co3 2 so4 2 and hco3 to form caco3 caso4 and camg co3 2 however since the solubility of caco3 is smaller than caso4 trendafelov et al 1995 which camg co3 2 is increases the risk of chemical reaction between ca2 and caso4 to produce caco3 leading to increased calcite content and decreased dolomite content however the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the content of calcite and dolomite edta can form a stable complex with mn2 babu et al 2004 which did not easily dissolve calcite and dolomite and react with other substances in addition the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the content of ca2 and mg2 in brackish water promoting the risk of ca2 and mg2 reacting with co3 2 so4 2 and hco3 in water to form fouling such as caco3 caso4 and camg co3 2 at the same time we also found by calculating the lsi values that the lsi values in edta cu and edta mn fertilizer treatments were 0 64 and 0 58 respectively both of which were greater than 0 both of them were in supersaturated state which destroyed the structure of the chelate thompson et al 2000 reduced the secondary nucleation rate of calcite promoted the conversion of hco3 to co3 2 and h increased the co3 2 content and increased the growth rate of calcite fouling bharthasarathi and murugakoothan 2014 which led to an increase in calcite content the application of both edta cu and edta mn fertilizers decreased and increased the silica fouling content of bwdis fig 4 edta cu fertilizer significantly p 0 05 reduced the contents of muscovite and chlorite while increased the contents of quartz and k feldspar that was mainly because edta cu fertilizer contains active functional groups and has strong adsorption capacity which provided a great amount of binding sites for muscovite to be adsorbed on the surface of muscovite zhu et al 2020 the electrostatic attraction increased the muscovite crystal structure zhang et al 2015 while the affinity of chlorite was affected by chelation and the reduced the chlorite content by chemical adsorption gao et al 2020b moreover the quartz and k feldspar fouling has higher permeability and surface porosity shafiq et al 2018 however due to the low permeability of edta cu shafiq et al 2019 the permeability and porosity of quartz and k feldspar become smaller and fouling deposition was more likely to occur furthermore the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the content of muscovite k feldspar and chlorite but decreased the content of quartz fouling which could be mainly due to the application of edta mn fertilizer edta mn contains hydroxyl and other active functional groups which will form competitive adsorption with muscovite k feldspar and chlorite in silica fouling through the electron transfer the oxidation rate of mn2 was increased li et al 2016 which enhanced the flocculation capacity of edta mn resulting in more muscovite k feldspar and chlorite fouling in addition the gradual increase of mn2 oxidation rate the edta mn hydroxyl complex inhibited the adsorption of quartz lelis et al 2016 and inhibited the flocculation and sedimentation intensity of quartz that reduced the content of quartz fouling the edta cu and edta mn would directly affect the calcium silica fouling by changing the quality major parameters and there was a significant interaction between calcium and silica fouling fig 6b p 0 05 appreciable impact in the content of calcium fouling also provided a wide speared binding sites for silica fouling meyer 1984 which can change the content of silicon fouling through mutual coupling meanwhile the change of silica fouling content also provides opportunities for the formation of calcium fouling therefore the aforementioned two types of fouling are directly depended and compete with each other shen et al 2019 manganese and copper fertilizer directly affected the brackish water quality which will indirectly affected the content of calcium silica fouling and content of total fouling in bwdis at the same time in brackish water with high calcium and magnesium ion content the application of dilute acid has also become an effective way to alleviate brackish water drip irrigation mainly by reducing the content of calcium fouling in the emitter hao et al 2018 which in turn results in the removal of clogging substances aali et al 2009 in this study we found that the calcium fouling content was only 14 8 25 3 and most of it was present in the form of silica fouling with 74 7 85 2 for which the use of reasonable effective and anti clogging fertilizers became crucial in this study in order to avoid this important effect in conclusion based on ours results the application of edta cu fertilizer as copper fertilizer in bwdis while edta mn fertilizer is not suitable to be used as manganese fertilizer in bwdis however the economic cost limitation is unfavorable for the widespread use of edta cu fertilizer future studies should consider different types of manganese and copper fertilizers under different mineralization conditions to verify the reliability and widespread application of the results 5 conclusions the following major conclusions can be drawn from the present study 1 compared with ck the application of edta cu reduced the content of fouling by 3 6 6 7 in emitter flow channels of bwdis resulting to increase the dra and cu by 2 1 28 9 and 6 8 26 4 respectively while the application of edta mn increased content of fouling by 2 0 4 4 which decreased the dra and cu by 5 7 13 2 and 15 3 19 4 in bwdis 2 the total content of calcium and silica fouling decreased by 1 2 4 9 and 0 1 7 2 application of edta cu however the total content of calcium and silica fouling increased by 9 6 29 2 and 3 2 7 8 in edta mn when compared with ck 3 the application of edta mn fertilizer increased the ca2 and mg2 content of brackish water which indirectly increased the content of calcite dolomite muscovite k feldspar and chlorite while decreasing the content of quartz consequently increased the possibility for clogging of bwdis while edta cu reduced the content of ca2 and mg2 which indirectly reduced the content of dolomite muscovite and chlorite and increased the content of quartz calcite and k feldspar thus decreased the possibility of clogging on bwdis 4 based on the results of this study we recommend the use of edta cu and mnso4 fertilizers instead of cuso4 and edta mn fertilizers for drip irrigation of manganese and copper fertilizers in brackish water

nutrient supply flower growth stage harvest time thakur et al 2020 ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c storage and processing of roses and the method of extracting essential oils rusanov et al 2005 have a significant effect on the quality quantity and biological activities of r damascena essential oil water is one of the most important environmental factors that affect the quality and quantity of r damascena essential oil ghavam 2021 these waters have nutrients that act as fertilizers for the plant and have been shown to increase the quantity and quality of agricultural products hespanhol and prost 1994 rezapour et al 2017 the effect of wastewater irrigation on altering the quality of lippia citriodora essential oil bensabah et al 2015 and on altering the chemical composition and enzymatic inhibitory activities of origanum syriacum var syriacum ali shtayeh et al 2018 has been approved nitrogen phosphorus and potassium seem to play a key role in increasing the substrate and activating enzymes required for essential oil biosynthesis arvin 2019 for example the effects of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium on the quantity and quality of thymus pubescens boiss kotschy ex celak ebrahimi gajoti and abdi ghazijahani 2020 matricaria recutita l dadkhah et al 2012 and satureja hortensis l arvin 2019 essential oils have been registered previous studies have shown that in all cases the essential oils extracted from plants treated with wastewater were free of heavy metals lydakis simantiris et al 2016 elsokkary and aboukila 2020 many studies on the diversity of compounds and function of r damascena essential oil under different environmental conditions mirza and najafpour navaei 2016 ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c and tabaei aghdaei et al 2007 and yousefi and jaimand 2018 and the influence of the foliar application of iron and potassium nanoplates heydari et al 2019 has been done in iran but so far no study has been done on the effect of different irrigation treatments especially unconventional water on the yield and variety and change of essential oil components of r damascena therefore the present study was conducted to evaluate and compare the quality quantity and antibacterial antifungal activity of r damascena essential oil under different irrigation treatments treated wastewater and well water at the university of kashan kashan iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection and identification of plant materials two r damascena fields under drip irrigation with well water and treated wastewater were selected at the university of kashan kashan iran cultivation was monitored for one year and irrigation period was 7 months with an interval of 20 days the need for irrigation until the end of the flowering stage is between 115 and 510 mm and until the end of the growing season is between 820 and 1130 mm three random points were identified at each field then at each point the flowers sepals and petals were collected from different bushes at least 150 bushes at each point in may 2019 coinciding with the beginning of buds opening at 6 a m the samples were transferred to the laboratory after harvest and kept at 4 c for 3 h the collected species were identified and approved by a botanist and were recorded and kept in the herbarium of the faculty of natural resources and earth sciences university of kashan kashan iran 2 2 analysis of irrigation water samples of different waters were transferred to the water laboratory for different tests acidity with ph meter electrical conductivity with ec meter chloride with the argentometric method nitrate and phosphate and fluoride aby uv vis spectrophotometric absorption alkalinity by hydrochloric acid titration method and total hardness by complexometric titration method by edta were determined sodium potassium and calcium were measured and determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and tds was determined by gravimetric method the properties of treated wastewater and well water are shown in table 1 2 3 extraction separation and calculation of essential oil quantity to extract 350 gr of fresh plant material was weighed at each point of harvest the material was then poured into a 2000 ml flask and double distilled water was added to it the clevenger apparatus was connected to the desired balloon and after 4 h the essential oil was extracted by water distillation for separation the essential oil collected in the clevenger end tubes was washed with n pentane merck germany and completely separated from the water by sodium sulfate the pure essential oil was stored in a dark closed container at 4 c until further testing the yield quantity of essential oil at each harvest point repetition was calculated in terms of essential oil weight plant material weight w w and was obtained as the average standard deviation azarnivand et al 2010 2 4 qualitative analysis and identification of chemical compounds of essential oil qualitative analysis and identification of essential oil compounds were performed by a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer gc ms gas chromatograph model 6890 coupled with mass spectrometer model n 5973 made by agilent company with hp 5ms capillary column with the stationary phase of 5 methyl phenyl siloxane length 30 m inner diameter 0 25 mm the thickness of the stagnant layer 0 25 µm was used the thermal programming of the column started at 60 c and then increased at a rate of 3 c min until it reached a temperature of 246 c the injection detector temperature was set at 250 c the ionization energy was 70 electron volts the volume of the injected sample was 1 microliter with a split of 1 50 the type of gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min first serial alkanes c8 c25 were injected into the gc ms device under the mentioned conditions and the inhibition time of each component was obtained on the column subsequently the retention index ri of the compounds in the essential oil was calculated and was compared with the values mentioned in authentic sources also to prove the detected compounds the main mass spectra of the sample of the unknown component of the essential oil were compared with the standard spectra provided by the device library and the name of the unknown compounds were found and their structure was obtained from reliable sources adams 2007 2 5 determination of antibacterial antifungal activity of essential oil to evaluate the antimicrobial antifungal activity of essential oil standard microbial strains were prepared from the iranian research organization on science and technology irost which included four gram positive bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis cip 81 55 staphylococcus aureus atcc 29737 bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 and streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615 and five gram negative bacteria such as klebsiella pneumonia atcc 10031 escherichia coli atcc 10536 pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 salmonella paratyphi a serotype atcc 5702 and shigella dysenteriae ptcc 1188 and the fungi such as aspergillus brasiliensis atcc 16404 and candida albicans atcc 10231 to determine the inhibition zone using the agar diffusion method plates containing müller hinton agar culture medium for bacteria and sabouraud dextrose agar for fungi were prepared the essential oil was also dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and reached a concentration of 300 μg ml 100 μl of microbial suspensions were cultured with turbidity equivalent to half mcfarland under uniform conditions at the culture medium wells with a diameter of 6 mm were made in culture media and 10 μl of essential oil was added to each well then the plates inoculated with bacterial strains were heated at 37 c for 24 h and the plates inoculated with fungi and yeast were heated at 30 c for 72 and 48 h in the incubator respectively the diameter of the inhibition zone in millimeters was determined by an antibiogram ruler and reported as the mean standard deviation to determine the minimum inhibition concentration mic of growth 96 sterile microplates and dilution methods in broth media were used at first from each essential oil sample the concentrations of 1000 500 250 125 62 5 31 25 and 15 63 μg ml were prepared 200 μl of the solution including 95 μl of culture medium 5 μl of microbial suspension diluted with 0 5 mcfarland and 100 μl of one of the different concentrations of essential oil were added to each of the microplate wells the plates inoculated with bacterial strains were heated at 37 c for 24 h and the plates inoculated with fungi and yeast were heated at 30 c for 72 and 48 h in the incubator respectively mic was determined according to the turbidity and color change interval in each of the microplate wells to determine the minimum bactericidal fungicidal concentration mbc mfc after 24 h of heating 5 μl of each of the microplate wells in which there was no growth clear well was inoculated into nutrient agar medium and they were heated at 37 c for 24 h the gentamicin and rifampin antibiotics were used for bacteria and nystatin was used for fungi to compare their inhibitory power with essential oils as a positive control for each essential oil sample these experiments were repeated three times 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss 22 0 software first the normality of statistical variables quantity quality and antibacterial antifungal activity was evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov test and after ensuring the normality of the data a statistically significant evaluation of differences was performed using one way anova with a 99 confidence level the means were compared using duncan s test with a probability level of one percent error 3 results 3 1 analysis of irrigation water the results of irrigation water analysis showed that there was a significant difference between different characteristics of well water and treated wastewater except potassium p 0 01 table 1 all characteristics of treated wastewater except electrical conductivity nitrate and hardness were higher than well water in the treated wastewater the amount of mg2 170 ppm was significantly higher than the allowable standards of the department of environment iran for the use of wastewater in agriculture 100 ppm and drinking water for humans 30 ppm also the amount of cl and no3 in both irrigation water samples was more than the allowable limit for agriculture bensabah et al 2015 also reported excessive levels of chloride in municipal wastewater and confirmed that municipal water supply was responsible for cl although the amount of sodium cation in the sample of well water 182 9 ppm was not significantly different from treated wastewater 185 4 ppm and it was less than the allowable limit for human drinking it was significantly higher than the standard of the department of environment iran for agriculture the presence of high concentrations of sodium ions in irrigation water may cause plant toxicity and reduce soil permeability yazdanee et al 2014 interestingly the tds at 1030 ppm in well water was significantly higher than its permissible limit of human and agricultural consumption this was while with the amount of 992 ppm in the treated wastewater it was only more than the allowable limit announced by the department of environment iran for agriculture tds is another important factor in water quality and has a great effect on chemical transfer and conversion and ionization of materials ahmadpur et al 2014 3 2 analysis of essential oil quantity the results showed that the yield of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater 0 1527 0 0045 was higher than the one irrigated with well water 0 1143 0 0014 the highest yield of r damascena essential oil in iran has been reported from the gilan region 0 20 which is contrary to the present results yassa et al 2009 increased yield of essential oil under treated wastewater treatment can be due to the greater amount of mineral elements typically higher uptake of water and nutrients may increase photosynthetic activity and ultimately increase assimilation di paolo and rinaldi 2008 the highest amount of mg2 ca2 po43 and hco3 were related to the treated wastewater which may be possible factors influencing the increase of essential oil yield irrigation with water with a high concentration of mg2 leads to increased production of secondary metabolites and yield rahman et al 2017 phosphate is effective in regulating photosynthesis and supplying the carbon skeleton and substrate required for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and thus increasing the amount of essential oil el gohary et al 2015 similarly hassanpour darvishi and aliabadi farahani 2011 for satureja hortensis l and elsokkary and aboukila 2020 for ocimum basilicum l and origanum marjoram l reported an increase in the yield of essential oils affected by the treated wastewater on the other hand the reduction of electrical conductivity in the treated wastewater relative to well water is one of the possible factors affecting the increase of essential oil yield bonacina et al 2017 equated the increase in essential oil yield for melissa officinalis l with a decrease in electrical conductivity contrary to the present results yazdani biouki et al 2020 reported an increase in the yield of r damascena essential oil due to the increase in water salinity the production of plant secondary metabolites is highly influenced by environmental conditions especially biological and abiotic stresses among which electrical conductivity has a great effect on the biosynthesis of plant essential oils and affects the composition of essential oils in different plants karray bouraoui et al 2009 also lower amounts of nitrate in treated wastewater 5 3480 ppm compared to well water 6 5440 ppm can increase the essential oil yield of samples irrigated with treated wastewater nematzade et al 2019 for origanum vulgare subsp gracile k koch ietsw reported an inverse trend in the effect of nitrate on essential oil yield studies have shown that the use of different nitrogen sources such as nitrate can change the growth yield quality and composition of plant chemicals tabatabaei et al 2006 3 3 analysis of essential oil quality based on the results of the analysis of r damascena essential oil under different irrigations 56 different compounds were identified with 1 2 100 relative percentages table 2 fig 1 and 2 the highest number of compounds belonged to r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water 49 compounds 32 common compounds with different amounts were observed in both essential oils of r damascena and there was a significant difference between the mean amount of components under different irrigations p 0 01 similar results in terms of differences in the composition of essential oils under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water have been registered by bensabah et al 2015 for mentha spicata l by sahraiyan et al 2018 for s hortensis and by elsokkary and aboukila 2020 for o basilicum and o marjoram the production of secondary compounds in plants is not always the same and several factors can affect the production of these compounds according to previous studies species or genus growth stage and development special seasonal conditions the level of access to mineral nutrients and the quality of irrigation water are some of these factors verpoorte et al 2002 oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant group of compounds in r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater followed by non terpenoids with a significant difference this trend was observed in the essential oil samples irrigated with well water with slight differences and non terpenoids and oxygenated monoterpenes were the dominant groups with no significant differences the dominance of these two groups of compounds in r damascena essential oil has been confirmed in iran ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c citronellol 32 38 geraniol 12 86 nonadecane 10 14 and heneicosane 6 16 were the predominant compounds of r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation following to the findings of thakur et al 2020 on this essential oil in the himalayas the predominant compounds in r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water were geraniol 17 81 citronellol 17 67 nonadecane 12 87 heptadecane 5 60 and heneicosane 5 44 similarly bayrak and akgul 1994 in turkey recorded geraniol 36 22 and citronellol 30 54 as the first and second dominant compounds of this essential oil heptadecane has been reported as one of the predominant compounds in r damascena essential oil in bulgaria krasimir et al 2011 although r damascena essential oil is a complex mixture of different compounds citronellol and geraniol compounds are the most important volatile substances that are widely used in the perfumery cosmetics and soap industries citronellol and geraniol as two important compounds of monoterpenes in r damascena essential oil are considered as the most important indicators of its aroma for use in industry mirzaei et al 2015 the best aroma of this essential oil is when the geraniol citronellol ratio is more than 1 25 başer 1992 in the present study irrigation treatment with treated wastewater increased this ratio to 2 52 compared to r damascena essential oil irrigated by well water 1 01 on the other hand in the essential oil of r damascena irrigated with treated wastewater other dominant compounds such as henicosan triclosan and heptadecane not only did not increase but also their amount has been reduced and it is very important in the quality of r damascena essential oil although essential oils are made primarily by directing genetic processes their production is significantly influenced by environmental factors ghavam alborz et al 2020 it seems that the increase of po43 and ca2 and the decrease of no3 in irrigation water have been the main factors in changing the compound of essential oils from non terpenoids to oxygenated monoterpenes many factors cause changes in the quality of essential oils so nutrient is one of the important factors in changing the number of essential oil compounds heydari et al 2019 similarly for r damascena essential oil ghavam 2021 has reported the effect of increasing soil phosphorus and potassium on increasing geraniol and citronellol and the effect of increasing soil nitrogen on the increasing of nonterpenoids eugenol was another important and predominant compound in essential oils irrigated with well water 4 84 and irrigated with treated wastewater 4 30 while there was no significant difference in its amount between the two essential oils this composition has not been observed in most studies in iran safaei ghomi et al 2009 yousefi et al 2018 however the highest amount of this composition has been reported from the yazdel region iran 2 40 ghavam 2021 it seems that this composition varies based on ecological characteristics in the populations of a species therefore the difference in geographical areas is a very important factor in the difference in the chemical composition of the essential oil of the populations of a species mazooji et al 2010 germacrene d with the value of 3 56 was observed in the sample irrigated with well water while its amount decreased to 2 62 in the sample irrigated with treated wastewater similarly germacrene d 0 28 3 95 has been reported in different regions of kashan iran mirza and najafpour navaei 2016 ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c it seems that germacrene d is affected by the increase of nitrate and electrical conductivity in well water compared to treated wastewater linalool is an important compound for the aromatic cosmetics and chemical industry herman et al 2016 there was no statistical difference in the amount of linalool in r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater 2 29 and well water 2 47 in most previous studies in different regions linalool has not been presented in r damascena essential oil or has been reported very little the highest amount of linalool was recorded from northern iran 3 8 yassa et al 2009 irrigation water does not seem to have an effect on the synthesis of linalool and its synthesis is influenced by other environmental factors such as soil and climate the presence of phenyl ethyl alcohol in r damascena essential oil is one of the important indicators of fragrance which is often eliminated by distillation during the essential oil extraction process mainly due to its solubility in water in this study phenyl ethyl alcohol was significantly increased from 1 46 in the essential oil extracted from r damascena irrigated by well water to 2 18 in the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater in r damascena essential oil in iran phenyl ethyl alcohol is usually either unreported or reported in small amounts which its highest reported amount is from the kashan region 2 95 safaei ghomi et al 2009 the increase of this compound under the influence of irrigation treatment with wastewater indicates the importance of the dominance of phosphate fluoride magnesium calcium and bicarbonate in this water on the synthesis of this important compound the increase of phenyl ethyl alcohol under the influence of irrigation treatment with treated wastewater indicates the importance of the dominance of phosphate fluoride magnesium calcium and bicarbonate in this irrigated water on the synthesis of this important compound similarly thakur et al 2020 reported an increase in phenyl ethyl alcohol in r damascena essential oil under the influence of fertilizer treatments mineral elements enter the composition of enzymes responsible for the biochemical processes of plants vaičiulytė et al 2017 farnesol is one of the important compounds that affect the quality of r damascena essential oil and its healing properties farnesol in the essential oil of r damascena under well water irrigation was observed as two isomers of cis farnesol 0 17 and trans farnesol 3 03 and in essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation was observed only as trans farnesol isomer with a small amount of 0 35 in previous studies on r damascena essential oil farnesol isomers were either absent or reported in small amounts shamspur and mostafavi 2011 safaei ghomi et al 2009 the highest amount of farnesol was observed as a trans farnesol isomer with a value of 2 01 in yazdel ghavam 2021 it seems that increasing nitrate and decreasing phosphate in well water are the main factors that contradict the results of ghavam 2021 also the presence of rose oxide isomers is another factor affecting the taste and aroma quality of r damascena essential oil in the present study only the trans rose oxide isomer was observed which its highest value was in the essential oil irrigated by treated wastewater 0 16 and was significantly reduced in the essential oil irrigated by well water 0 08 the present findings are consistent with the results of yassa et al 2009 in northern iran 0 1 and contradict the results of ghavam 2021 in sefidshahr iran 1 30 reduction or absence of different isomers of farnesol and rose oxide due to irrigation with treated wastewater indicates that the synthesis of these compounds in r damascena essential oil is strongly dependent on irrigation water and its various properties especially in terms of salinity phosphate and nitrate the synthesis of the compounds responsible for the odor and aroma of r damascena essential oil seems to be strongly dependent on the balance of high consumption elements np of irrigation water to have a high quality product in terms of essential oil in cultivating r damascena special attention should be paid to the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water the effect of increasing salinity on the synthesis of monoterpenes has been also confirmed chrysargyris et al 2019 3 4 analysis of antibacterial antifungal activity of essential oil anova results showed that there was a significant difference between the diameter of the inhibition zone of the studied essential oils and positive control antibiotics against gram positives s aureus s epidermidis and s pyogenes gram negative k pneumoniae as well as a brasiliensis p 0 01 table 3 the largest diameter of the inhibition zone belonged to the essential oil of r damascena under well water irrigation against a brasiliensis 15 mm which in comparison with the antibiotic nystatin 30 mm had good inhibitory power and these results were consistent with the findings of ghavam 2021 the difference in the effect of essential oil on different fungi depends on the structure of the cell wall and its constituents and consequently the degree of penetration of the essential oil and its effect on the cell wall and intracellular organs khajehie et al 2017 on the other hand the presence of different chemical compounds in essential oils has caused them to have different biological effects sadeghi et al 2015 it seems that the predominance of non terpenoid compounds such as nonadecane heptadecane and 1 nonadecene the predominance of monoterpene compounds such as geraniol and citronellal and the predominance of sesquiterpene compounds such as germacrene d and trans farnesol in r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water can be the cause of its significant antifungal activity the antifungal effects of citronellal and germacron d in r damascena essential oil have been confirmed mimica dukic et al 2004 başer 1992 studies have shown that the biological activity of essential oil can be due to minor compounds and with small amounts which have a synergistic effect with dominant compounds younessi et al 2019 hence the significant difference in the amount of many terpene compounds eg α pinene β pinene β myrcene α terpinolene d limonene β ocimene caryophyllene oxide cis farnesol etc in r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water compared to this essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater can be among the other possible factors affecting this antifungal activity other antibacterial activities of r damascena essential oil in a well water irrigated sample were against the gram negative k pneumoniae with an inhibition zone diameter of 8 50 0 50 it has created an inhibition zone equal to rifampin 8 mm and half of the gentamicin 17 mm however its minimum inhibitory and lethal concentration against k pneumoniae were not significant mbc and mic 500 μg ml similar results for r damascena essential oil against k pneumoniae have been reported by jirovetz et al 2006 in bulgaria inhibition zone diameter 10 mm and mic 600 μg ml and by ghavam et al 2021a 2021b in isfahan iran inhibition zone diameter 8 mm and mbc and mic 500 μg ml the reason for the strong antibacterial effect of essential oil in a well water irrigated sample in comparison with the lack of antibacterial effect of essential oil in a treated wastewater irrigated sample against k pneumoniae is related to the difference between the dominant and minor components of the essential oils the effect of pure geraniol and eugenol extracted from r damascena essential oil against k pneumoniae has been confirmed gochev et al 2008 on the other hand the results showed that the diameter of the inhibition zone of r damascena under irrigation with well water against gram positive s aureus was 11 33 0 58 which had good inhibitory activity against s aureus compared to rifampin 21 mm and gentamicin 27 mm and is consistent with the results of ghavam et al 2021a 2021b from the ghamsar region iran creating the growth inhibition zone diameter by geraniol citronellal and eugenol extracted from r damascena essential oil against s aureus has been confirmed jirovetz et al 2006 on the other hand the higher amount of some by products in the essential oil in the well water irrigated sample than the essential oil in the treated wastewater irrigated sample is another factor affecting its antibacterial activity against s aureus the effect of alpha pinene beta pinene linalool farnesol and limonene against s aureus has been confirmed mohammadi et al 2016 yi et al 2019 gilsic et al 2007 the highest inhibition zone diameter of r damascena essential oil against s aureus has been reported in bulgaria 18 3 0 4 mm gochev et al 2008 it should be noted that the minimum concentration required for inhibition and lethality of r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water against s aureus was 500 μg ml and 1000 μg ml respectively and was significantly different from the potency of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater mic and mbc 125 μg ml and the antibiotic rifampin mic 31 25 μg ml table 4 ataee bojd et al 2014 reported the mic value of r damascena essential oil 10 μg ml which contradicts the results of this study the increase of inhibitory and lethal power in r damascena essential oil irrigated by effluent can be related to the increase of trans rose oxide citronellol phenethyl alcohol and methyl eugenol which has also been reported by yi et al 2019 the diameter of the inhibition zone of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water against gram positive s pyogenes was 10 67 mm and 9 33 mm respectively which was relatively good compared to rifampin 21 mm and gentamicin 32 mm the present findings are following the results of ghavam et al 2021a 2021b in isfahan iran and ghavam 2021a 2021b in yazdel and sefidshahr iran gram positive bacteria are more sensitive to essential oils than gram negative bacteria ghavam 2021a 2021b kalemba and kunicka 2003 shohayeb et al 2014 reported more sensitivity of gram positive bacteria compared to gram negative bacteria to r damascena essential oil it seems that the common compounds such as citronellol geranic acid α guaiene δ guaiene eicosane and heneicosane in the two samples of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water which are mainly higher in the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater are the main guiding and effective factors on antibacterial activity the findings also indicated that the mic and mbc values of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water against s pyogenes were 31 25 μg ml and 250 μg ml respectively which were relatively weak compared to rifampin and gentamicin 0 975 μg ml another activity of r damascena essential oil was the inhibition zone against gram positive s epidermidis 11 mm which was relatively good in comparison with rifampin 27 mm and gentamicin 45 mm the highest area of inhibition against s epidermidis 21 5 1 0 mm was recorded from bulgaria gochev et al 2008 in iran a report of the creation of the inhibition zone against s epidermidis 9 mm has been recorded in the ghamsar region isfahan ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c studies have shown that the geraniol citronellal eugenol and linalool compounds have antibacterial effects against s epidermidis gochev et al 2008 although the studied essential oils did not create an inhibition zone against other bacterial and yeast strains with mic and mbc values from 15 63 to 1000 μg ml they inhibited or stopped the growth of different strains the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity of r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation was against gram negative p aeruginosa mic 15 63 μg ml which was very significant in comparison with rifampin 31 25 μg ml and gentamicin 7 81 μg ml ataee bojd et al 2014 reported the lack of inhibitory power against p aeruginosa for r damascena essential oil which is contrary to the results of this study another notable activity of essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater was against gram negative e coli mic 31 25 μg ml and mbc 250 μg ml which had an inhibitory power effect equal to gentamicin 31 25 μg ml and once weaker than rifampin 15 63 μg ml similarly the mic value for the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater against e coli was recorded at 10 μg ml ataee bojd et al 2014 and 512 μg ml gochev et al 2008 differences in antimicrobial activities of essential oils of a species in different regions can be due to differences in the type and amount of chemical compounds ghavam 2022 popović djordjević et al 2019 due to the decrease in inhibitory power of r damascena essential oil under well water irrigation against gram negatives p aeruginosa and e coli mic 250 μg ml it can be seen that this decreasing trend has been accompanied by a decrease in dominant and minor compounds such as citronellol β elemene geranic acid methyl eugenol δ guaiene eicosane heneicosane and docosane the effect of citronellol on the inhibition of these two bacteria has been confirmed gochev et al 2008 the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity of both studied essential oil samples was against candida albicans the mic and mbc values of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater were 62 50 μg ml which was twice as strong as that of r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water and the antibiotic nystatin mic and mbc 125 μg ml in sefidshahr javinan and isfahan iran similar results ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c and in bulgaria opposite results gochev et al 2008 from the activity of r damascena essential oil against candida albicans have been reported the main reason for the strong anti yeast activity of r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation may be due to the predominance of oxygenated monoterpenes in it the effects of linalool trans rose oxide citronellol and geraniol against candida have been demonstrated kim and park 2012 zore et al 2011 kunduhoglu 2017 and jirovetz et al 2006 the decrease of anti yeast activity of essential oil under well water irrigation can be associated with the increase of alkanes compounds another relatively strong inhibitory activity of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater was against gram positive b subtilis mic 62 50 μg ml which was once weaker than rifampin 31 25 μg ml ghavam et al 2021a 2021b recorded the inhibition zone diameter against b subtilis 0 58 10 67 mm for the essential oil in the kamoo region citronellol with the highest amount of essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater is the main cause of this activity the effect of citronellol against some strains of bacillus has been confirmed gochev et al 2008 4 conclusion based on the results of the present study it can be concluded that r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater had a significant and valuable yield quantity and chemical compounds quality the predominant compounds of r damascena under irrigation with well water were geraniol citronellol nonadecane and heptadecane which were changed to citronellol geraniol nonadecane and heneicosane in the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater differences in the chemical compounds of the studied essential oils caused various antibacterial antifungal properties against standard strains as a result the essential oil irrigated with well water had better antimicrobial activity than the other essential oil mainly by creating a significant inhibition zone against a brasiliensis and k pneumoniae in contrast r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation had the best performance in terms of mic value against p aeruginosa and c albicans with twice the potency of positive controls in general essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation can be a possible optionin terms of quantity and quality of flavor inhibitory and lethality against some microorganisms

9456,water is one of the important environmental factors affecting the quality and quantity of rosa damascena herrm essential oil this study aimed to evaluate and compare the quality quantity and antibacterial antifungal activity of r damascena essential oil in fields under irrigation treatments such as treated wastewater and well water at the university of kashan kashan iran in each field flowers sepals and petals were collected from different bushes in may 2019 coinciding with the beginning of buds opening after extracting the essential oil by water distillation using the clevenger apparatus the analysis and identification of the compounds were performed by a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer gc ms the antibacterial antifungal activity of the essential oils was evaluated by determining the diameter of the inhibition zone by the agar diffusion method and determining the minimum concentration of growth inhibitor and bactericidal fungal lethality the results of quantitative analysis of essential oil showed that the highest yield belonged to r damascena irrigated with treated wastewater with a value of 0 1527 0 0045 based on the results of the analysis of chemical compounds citronellol 32 38 geraniol 12 86 nonadecane 10 14 and heneicosane 6 16 were the predominant compounds of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater and geraniol 17 81 citronellol 17 67 nonadecane 12 87 heptadecane 5 60 and heneicosane 5 44 were the predominant compounds of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with well water the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity of r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation was against gram negatives pseudomonas aeruginosa mic 15 63 μg ml and candida albicans mic 62 50 μg ml which were twice as strong as control antibiotics such as rifampin and nystatin therefore it can be found that irrigation with treated wastewater increases the quantity and quality and antimicrobial

inhibitory activities of origanum syriacum var syriacum ali shtayeh et al 2018 has been approved nitrogen phosphorus and potassium seem to play a key role in increasing the substrate and activating enzymes required for essential oil biosynthesis arvin 2019 for example the effects of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium on the quantity and quality of thymus pubescens boiss kotschy ex celak ebrahimi gajoti and abdi ghazijahani 2020 matricaria recutita l dadkhah et al 2012 and satureja hortensis l arvin 2019 essential oils have been registered previous studies have shown that in all cases the essential oils extracted from plants treated with wastewater were free of heavy metals lydakis simantiris et al 2016 elsokkary and aboukila 2020 many studies on the diversity of compounds and function of r damascena essential oil under different environmental conditions mirza and najafpour navaei 2016 ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c and tabaei aghdaei et al 2007 and yousefi and jaimand 2018 and the influence of the foliar application of iron and potassium nanoplates heydari et al 2019 has been done in iran but so far no study has been done on the effect of different irrigation treatments especially unconventional water on the yield and variety and change of essential oil components of r damascena therefore the present study was conducted to evaluate and compare the quality quantity and antibacterial antifungal activity of r damascena essential oil under different irrigation treatments treated wastewater and well water at the university of kashan kashan iran 2 materials and methods 2 1 collection and identification of plant materials two r damascena fields under drip irrigation with well water and treated wastewater were selected at the university of kashan kashan iran cultivation was monitored for one year and irrigation period was 7 months with an interval of 20 days the need for irrigation until the end of the flowering stage is between 115 and 510 mm and until the end of the growing season is between 820 and 1130 mm three random points were identified at each field then at each point the flowers sepals and petals were collected from different bushes at least 150 bushes at each point in may 2019 coinciding with the beginning of buds opening at 6 a m the samples were transferred to the laboratory after harvest and kept at 4 c for 3 h the collected species were identified and approved by a botanist and were recorded and kept in the herbarium of the faculty of natural resources and earth sciences university of kashan kashan iran 2 2 analysis of irrigation water samples of different waters were transferred to the water laboratory for different tests acidity with ph meter electrical conductivity with ec meter chloride with the argentometric method nitrate and phosphate and fluoride aby uv vis spectrophotometric absorption alkalinity by hydrochloric acid titration method and total hardness by complexometric titration method by edta were determined sodium potassium and calcium were measured and determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and tds was determined by gravimetric method the properties of treated wastewater and well water are shown in table 1 2 3 extraction separation and calculation of essential oil quantity to extract 350 gr of fresh plant material was weighed at each point of harvest the material was then poured into a 2000 ml flask and double distilled water was added to it the clevenger apparatus was connected to the desired balloon and after 4 h the essential oil was extracted by water distillation for separation the essential oil collected in the clevenger end tubes was washed with n pentane merck germany and completely separated from the water by sodium sulfate the pure essential oil was stored in a dark closed container at 4 c until further testing the yield quantity of essential oil at each harvest point repetition was calculated in terms of essential oil weight plant material weight w w and was obtained as the average standard deviation azarnivand et al 2010 2 4 qualitative analysis and identification of chemical compounds of essential oil qualitative analysis and identification of essential oil compounds were performed by a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer gc ms gas chromatograph model 6890 coupled with mass spectrometer model n 5973 made by agilent company with hp 5ms capillary column with the stationary phase of 5 methyl phenyl siloxane length 30 m inner diameter 0 25 mm the thickness of the stagnant layer 0 25 µm was used the thermal programming of the column started at 60 c and then increased at a rate of 3 c min until it reached a temperature of 246 c the injection detector temperature was set at 250 c the ionization energy was 70 electron volts the volume of the injected sample was 1 microliter with a split of 1 50 the type of gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 5 ml min first serial alkanes c8 c25 were injected into the gc ms device under the mentioned conditions and the inhibition time of each component was obtained on the column subsequently the retention index ri of the compounds in the essential oil was calculated and was compared with the values mentioned in authentic sources also to prove the detected compounds the main mass spectra of the sample of the unknown component of the essential oil were compared with the standard spectra provided by the device library and the name of the unknown compounds were found and their structure was obtained from reliable sources adams 2007 2 5 determination of antibacterial antifungal activity of essential oil to evaluate the antimicrobial antifungal activity of essential oil standard microbial strains were prepared from the iranian research organization on science and technology irost which included four gram positive bacteria such as staphylococcus epidermidis cip 81 55 staphylococcus aureus atcc 29737 bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 and streptococcus pyogenes atcc 19615 and five gram negative bacteria such as klebsiella pneumonia atcc 10031 escherichia coli atcc 10536 pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 salmonella paratyphi a serotype atcc 5702 and shigella dysenteriae ptcc 1188 and the fungi such as aspergillus brasiliensis atcc 16404 and candida albicans atcc 10231 to determine the inhibition zone using the agar diffusion method plates containing müller hinton agar culture medium for bacteria and sabouraud dextrose agar for fungi were prepared the essential oil was also dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and reached a concentration of 300 μg ml 100 μl of microbial suspensions were cultured with turbidity equivalent to half mcfarland under uniform conditions at the culture medium wells with a diameter of 6 mm were made in culture media and 10 μl of essential oil was added to each well then the plates inoculated with bacterial strains were heated at 37 c for 24 h and the plates inoculated with fungi and yeast were heated at 30 c for 72 and 48 h in the incubator respectively the diameter of the inhibition zone in millimeters was determined by an antibiogram ruler and reported as the mean standard deviation to determine the minimum inhibition concentration mic of growth 96 sterile microplates and dilution methods in broth media were used at first from each essential oil sample the concentrations of 1000 500 250 125 62 5 31 25 and 15 63 μg ml were prepared 200 μl of the solution including 95 μl of culture medium 5 μl of microbial suspension diluted with 0 5 mcfarland and 100 μl of one of the different concentrations of essential oil were added to each of the microplate wells the plates inoculated with bacterial strains were heated at 37 c for 24 h and the plates inoculated with fungi and yeast were heated at 30 c for 72 and 48 h in the incubator respectively mic was determined according to the turbidity and color change interval in each of the microplate wells to determine the minimum bactericidal fungicidal concentration mbc mfc after 24 h of heating 5 μl of each of the microplate wells in which there was no growth clear well was inoculated into nutrient agar medium and they were heated at 37 c for 24 h the gentamicin and rifampin antibiotics were used for bacteria and nystatin was used for fungi to compare their inhibitory power with essential oils as a positive control for each essential oil sample these experiments were repeated three times 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was performed using spss 22 0 software first the normality of statistical variables quantity quality and antibacterial antifungal activity was evaluated using the kolmogorov smirnov test and after ensuring the normality of the data a statistically significant evaluation of differences was performed using one way anova with a 99 confidence level the means were compared using duncan s test with a probability level of one percent error 3 results 3 1 analysis of irrigation water the results of irrigation water analysis showed that there was a significant difference between different characteristics of well water and treated wastewater except potassium p 0 01 table 1 all characteristics of treated wastewater except electrical conductivity nitrate and hardness were higher than well water in the treated wastewater the amount of mg2 170 ppm was significantly higher than the allowable standards of the department of environment iran for the use of wastewater in agriculture 100 ppm and drinking water for humans 30 ppm also the amount of cl and no3 in both irrigation water samples was more than the allowable limit for agriculture bensabah et al 2015 also reported excessive levels of chloride in municipal wastewater and confirmed that municipal water supply was responsible for cl although the amount of sodium cation in the sample of well water 182 9 ppm was not significantly different from treated wastewater 185 4 ppm and it was less than the allowable limit for human drinking it was significantly higher than the standard of the department of environment iran for agriculture the presence of high concentrations of sodium ions in irrigation water may cause plant toxicity and reduce soil permeability yazdanee et al 2014 interestingly the tds at 1030 ppm in well water was significantly higher than its permissible limit of human and agricultural consumption this was while with the amount of 992 ppm in the treated wastewater it was only more than the allowable limit announced by the department of environment iran for agriculture tds is another important factor in water quality and has a great effect on chemical transfer and conversion and ionization of materials ahmadpur et al 2014 3 2 analysis of essential oil quantity the results showed that the yield of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater 0 1527 0 0045 was higher than the one irrigated with well water 0 1143 0 0014 the highest yield of r damascena essential oil in iran has been reported from the gilan region 0 20 which is contrary to the present results yassa et al 2009 increased yield of essential oil under treated wastewater treatment can be due to the greater amount of mineral elements typically higher uptake of water and nutrients may increase photosynthetic activity and ultimately increase assimilation di paolo and rinaldi 2008 the highest amount of mg2 ca2 po43 and hco3 were related to the treated wastewater which may be possible factors influencing the increase of essential oil yield irrigation with water with a high concentration of mg2 leads to increased production of secondary metabolites and yield rahman et al 2017 phosphate is effective in regulating photosynthesis and supplying the carbon skeleton and substrate required for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and thus increasing the amount of essential oil el gohary et al 2015 similarly hassanpour darvishi and aliabadi farahani 2011 for satureja hortensis l and elsokkary and aboukila 2020 for ocimum basilicum l and origanum marjoram l reported an increase in the yield of essential oils affected by the treated wastewater on the other hand the reduction of electrical conductivity in the treated wastewater relative to well water is one of the possible factors affecting the increase of essential oil yield bonacina et al 2017 equated the increase in essential oil yield for melissa officinalis l with a decrease in electrical conductivity contrary to the present results yazdani biouki et al 2020 reported an increase in the yield of r damascena essential oil due to the increase in water salinity the production of plant secondary metabolites is highly influenced by environmental conditions especially biological and abiotic stresses among which electrical conductivity has a great effect on the biosynthesis of plant essential oils and affects the composition of essential oils in different plants karray bouraoui et al 2009 also lower amounts of nitrate in treated wastewater 5 3480 ppm compared to well water 6 5440 ppm can increase the essential oil yield of samples irrigated with treated wastewater nematzade et al 2019 for origanum vulgare subsp gracile k koch ietsw reported an inverse trend in the effect of nitrate on essential oil yield studies have shown that the use of different nitrogen sources such as nitrate can change the growth yield quality and composition of plant chemicals tabatabaei et al 2006 3 3 analysis of essential oil quality based on the results of the analysis of r damascena essential oil under different irrigations 56 different compounds were identified with 1 2 100 relative percentages table 2 fig 1 and 2 the highest number of compounds belonged to r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water 49 compounds 32 common compounds with different amounts were observed in both essential oils of r damascena and there was a significant difference between the mean amount of components under different irrigations p 0 01 similar results in terms of differences in the composition of essential oils under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water have been registered by bensabah et al 2015 for mentha spicata l by sahraiyan et al 2018 for s hortensis and by elsokkary and aboukila 2020 for o basilicum and o marjoram the production of secondary compounds in plants is not always the same and several factors can affect the production of these compounds according to previous studies species or genus growth stage and development special seasonal conditions the level of access to mineral nutrients and the quality of irrigation water are some of these factors verpoorte et al 2002 oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant group of compounds in r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater followed by non terpenoids with a significant difference this trend was observed in the essential oil samples irrigated with well water with slight differences and non terpenoids and oxygenated monoterpenes were the dominant groups with no significant differences the dominance of these two groups of compounds in r damascena essential oil has been confirmed in iran ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c citronellol 32 38 geraniol 12 86 nonadecane 10 14 and heneicosane 6 16 were the predominant compounds of r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation following to the findings of thakur et al 2020 on this essential oil in the himalayas the predominant compounds in r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water were geraniol 17 81 citronellol 17 67 nonadecane 12 87 heptadecane 5 60 and heneicosane 5 44 similarly bayrak and akgul 1994 in turkey recorded geraniol 36 22 and citronellol 30 54 as the first and second dominant compounds of this essential oil heptadecane has been reported as one of the predominant compounds in r damascena essential oil in bulgaria krasimir et al 2011 although r damascena essential oil is a complex mixture of different compounds citronellol and geraniol compounds are the most important volatile substances that are widely used in the perfumery cosmetics and soap industries citronellol and geraniol as two important compounds of monoterpenes in r damascena essential oil are considered as the most important indicators of its aroma for use in industry mirzaei et al 2015 the best aroma of this essential oil is when the geraniol citronellol ratio is more than 1 25 başer 1992 in the present study irrigation treatment with treated wastewater increased this ratio to 2 52 compared to r damascena essential oil irrigated by well water 1 01 on the other hand in the essential oil of r damascena irrigated with treated wastewater other dominant compounds such as henicosan triclosan and heptadecane not only did not increase but also their amount has been reduced and it is very important in the quality of r damascena essential oil although essential oils are made primarily by directing genetic processes their production is significantly influenced by environmental factors ghavam alborz et al 2020 it seems that the increase of po43 and ca2 and the decrease of no3 in irrigation water have been the main factors in changing the compound of essential oils from non terpenoids to oxygenated monoterpenes many factors cause changes in the quality of essential oils so nutrient is one of the important factors in changing the number of essential oil compounds heydari et al 2019 similarly for r damascena essential oil ghavam 2021 has reported the effect of increasing soil phosphorus and potassium on increasing geraniol and citronellol and the effect of increasing soil nitrogen on the increasing of nonterpenoids eugenol was another important and predominant compound in essential oils irrigated with well water 4 84 and irrigated with treated wastewater 4 30 while there was no significant difference in its amount between the two essential oils this composition has not been observed in most studies in iran safaei ghomi et al 2009 yousefi et al 2018 however the highest amount of this composition has been reported from the yazdel region iran 2 40 ghavam 2021 it seems that this composition varies based on ecological characteristics in the populations of a species therefore the difference in geographical areas is a very important factor in the difference in the chemical composition of the essential oil of the populations of a species mazooji et al 2010 germacrene d with the value of 3 56 was observed in the sample irrigated with well water while its amount decreased to 2 62 in the sample irrigated with treated wastewater similarly germacrene d 0 28 3 95 has been reported in different regions of kashan iran mirza and najafpour navaei 2016 ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c it seems that germacrene d is affected by the increase of nitrate and electrical conductivity in well water compared to treated wastewater linalool is an important compound for the aromatic cosmetics and chemical industry herman et al 2016 there was no statistical difference in the amount of linalool in r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater 2 29 and well water 2 47 in most previous studies in different regions linalool has not been presented in r damascena essential oil or has been reported very little the highest amount of linalool was recorded from northern iran 3 8 yassa et al 2009 irrigation water does not seem to have an effect on the synthesis of linalool and its synthesis is influenced by other environmental factors such as soil and climate the presence of phenyl ethyl alcohol in r damascena essential oil is one of the important indicators of fragrance which is often eliminated by distillation during the essential oil extraction process mainly due to its solubility in water in this study phenyl ethyl alcohol was significantly increased from 1 46 in the essential oil extracted from r damascena irrigated by well water to 2 18 in the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater in r damascena essential oil in iran phenyl ethyl alcohol is usually either unreported or reported in small amounts which its highest reported amount is from the kashan region 2 95 safaei ghomi et al 2009 the increase of this compound under the influence of irrigation treatment with wastewater indicates the importance of the dominance of phosphate fluoride magnesium calcium and bicarbonate in this water on the synthesis of this important compound the increase of phenyl ethyl alcohol under the influence of irrigation treatment with treated wastewater indicates the importance of the dominance of phosphate fluoride magnesium calcium and bicarbonate in this irrigated water on the synthesis of this important compound similarly thakur et al 2020 reported an increase in phenyl ethyl alcohol in r damascena essential oil under the influence of fertilizer treatments mineral elements enter the composition of enzymes responsible for the biochemical processes of plants vaičiulytė et al 2017 farnesol is one of the important compounds that affect the quality of r damascena essential oil and its healing properties farnesol in the essential oil of r damascena under well water irrigation was observed as two isomers of cis farnesol 0 17 and trans farnesol 3 03 and in essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation was observed only as trans farnesol isomer with a small amount of 0 35 in previous studies on r damascena essential oil farnesol isomers were either absent or reported in small amounts shamspur and mostafavi 2011 safaei ghomi et al 2009 the highest amount of farnesol was observed as a trans farnesol isomer with a value of 2 01 in yazdel ghavam 2021 it seems that increasing nitrate and decreasing phosphate in well water are the main factors that contradict the results of ghavam 2021 also the presence of rose oxide isomers is another factor affecting the taste and aroma quality of r damascena essential oil in the present study only the trans rose oxide isomer was observed which its highest value was in the essential oil irrigated by treated wastewater 0 16 and was significantly reduced in the essential oil irrigated by well water 0 08 the present findings are consistent with the results of yassa et al 2009 in northern iran 0 1 and contradict the results of ghavam 2021 in sefidshahr iran 1 30 reduction or absence of different isomers of farnesol and rose oxide due to irrigation with treated wastewater indicates that the synthesis of these compounds in r damascena essential oil is strongly dependent on irrigation water and its various properties especially in terms of salinity phosphate and nitrate the synthesis of the compounds responsible for the odor and aroma of r damascena essential oil seems to be strongly dependent on the balance of high consumption elements np of irrigation water to have a high quality product in terms of essential oil in cultivating r damascena special attention should be paid to the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water the effect of increasing salinity on the synthesis of monoterpenes has been also confirmed chrysargyris et al 2019 3 4 analysis of antibacterial antifungal activity of essential oil anova results showed that there was a significant difference between the diameter of the inhibition zone of the studied essential oils and positive control antibiotics against gram positives s aureus s epidermidis and s pyogenes gram negative k pneumoniae as well as a brasiliensis p 0 01 table 3 the largest diameter of the inhibition zone belonged to the essential oil of r damascena under well water irrigation against a brasiliensis 15 mm which in comparison with the antibiotic nystatin 30 mm had good inhibitory power and these results were consistent with the findings of ghavam 2021 the difference in the effect of essential oil on different fungi depends on the structure of the cell wall and its constituents and consequently the degree of penetration of the essential oil and its effect on the cell wall and intracellular organs khajehie et al 2017 on the other hand the presence of different chemical compounds in essential oils has caused them to have different biological effects sadeghi et al 2015 it seems that the predominance of non terpenoid compounds such as nonadecane heptadecane and 1 nonadecene the predominance of monoterpene compounds such as geraniol and citronellal and the predominance of sesquiterpene compounds such as germacrene d and trans farnesol in r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water can be the cause of its significant antifungal activity the antifungal effects of citronellal and germacron d in r damascena essential oil have been confirmed mimica dukic et al 2004 başer 1992 studies have shown that the biological activity of essential oil can be due to minor compounds and with small amounts which have a synergistic effect with dominant compounds younessi et al 2019 hence the significant difference in the amount of many terpene compounds eg α pinene β pinene β myrcene α terpinolene d limonene β ocimene caryophyllene oxide cis farnesol etc in r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water compared to this essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater can be among the other possible factors affecting this antifungal activity other antibacterial activities of r damascena essential oil in a well water irrigated sample were against the gram negative k pneumoniae with an inhibition zone diameter of 8 50 0 50 it has created an inhibition zone equal to rifampin 8 mm and half of the gentamicin 17 mm however its minimum inhibitory and lethal concentration against k pneumoniae were not significant mbc and mic 500 μg ml similar results for r damascena essential oil against k pneumoniae have been reported by jirovetz et al 2006 in bulgaria inhibition zone diameter 10 mm and mic 600 μg ml and by ghavam et al 2021a 2021b in isfahan iran inhibition zone diameter 8 mm and mbc and mic 500 μg ml the reason for the strong antibacterial effect of essential oil in a well water irrigated sample in comparison with the lack of antibacterial effect of essential oil in a treated wastewater irrigated sample against k pneumoniae is related to the difference between the dominant and minor components of the essential oils the effect of pure geraniol and eugenol extracted from r damascena essential oil against k pneumoniae has been confirmed gochev et al 2008 on the other hand the results showed that the diameter of the inhibition zone of r damascena under irrigation with well water against gram positive s aureus was 11 33 0 58 which had good inhibitory activity against s aureus compared to rifampin 21 mm and gentamicin 27 mm and is consistent with the results of ghavam et al 2021a 2021b from the ghamsar region iran creating the growth inhibition zone diameter by geraniol citronellal and eugenol extracted from r damascena essential oil against s aureus has been confirmed jirovetz et al 2006 on the other hand the higher amount of some by products in the essential oil in the well water irrigated sample than the essential oil in the treated wastewater irrigated sample is another factor affecting its antibacterial activity against s aureus the effect of alpha pinene beta pinene linalool farnesol and limonene against s aureus has been confirmed mohammadi et al 2016 yi et al 2019 gilsic et al 2007 the highest inhibition zone diameter of r damascena essential oil against s aureus has been reported in bulgaria 18 3 0 4 mm gochev et al 2008 it should be noted that the minimum concentration required for inhibition and lethality of r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water against s aureus was 500 μg ml and 1000 μg ml respectively and was significantly different from the potency of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater mic and mbc 125 μg ml and the antibiotic rifampin mic 31 25 μg ml table 4 ataee bojd et al 2014 reported the mic value of r damascena essential oil 10 μg ml which contradicts the results of this study the increase of inhibitory and lethal power in r damascena essential oil irrigated by effluent can be related to the increase of trans rose oxide citronellol phenethyl alcohol and methyl eugenol which has also been reported by yi et al 2019 the diameter of the inhibition zone of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water against gram positive s pyogenes was 10 67 mm and 9 33 mm respectively which was relatively good compared to rifampin 21 mm and gentamicin 32 mm the present findings are following the results of ghavam et al 2021a 2021b in isfahan iran and ghavam 2021a 2021b in yazdel and sefidshahr iran gram positive bacteria are more sensitive to essential oils than gram negative bacteria ghavam 2021a 2021b kalemba and kunicka 2003 shohayeb et al 2014 reported more sensitivity of gram positive bacteria compared to gram negative bacteria to r damascena essential oil it seems that the common compounds such as citronellol geranic acid α guaiene δ guaiene eicosane and heneicosane in the two samples of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water which are mainly higher in the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater are the main guiding and effective factors on antibacterial activity the findings also indicated that the mic and mbc values of r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater and well water against s pyogenes were 31 25 μg ml and 250 μg ml respectively which were relatively weak compared to rifampin and gentamicin 0 975 μg ml another activity of r damascena essential oil was the inhibition zone against gram positive s epidermidis 11 mm which was relatively good in comparison with rifampin 27 mm and gentamicin 45 mm the highest area of inhibition against s epidermidis 21 5 1 0 mm was recorded from bulgaria gochev et al 2008 in iran a report of the creation of the inhibition zone against s epidermidis 9 mm has been recorded in the ghamsar region isfahan ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c studies have shown that the geraniol citronellal eugenol and linalool compounds have antibacterial effects against s epidermidis gochev et al 2008 although the studied essential oils did not create an inhibition zone against other bacterial and yeast strains with mic and mbc values from 15 63 to 1000 μg ml they inhibited or stopped the growth of different strains the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity of r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation was against gram negative p aeruginosa mic 15 63 μg ml which was very significant in comparison with rifampin 31 25 μg ml and gentamicin 7 81 μg ml ataee bojd et al 2014 reported the lack of inhibitory power against p aeruginosa for r damascena essential oil which is contrary to the results of this study another notable activity of essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater was against gram negative e coli mic 31 25 μg ml and mbc 250 μg ml which had an inhibitory power effect equal to gentamicin 31 25 μg ml and once weaker than rifampin 15 63 μg ml similarly the mic value for the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater against e coli was recorded at 10 μg ml ataee bojd et al 2014 and 512 μg ml gochev et al 2008 differences in antimicrobial activities of essential oils of a species in different regions can be due to differences in the type and amount of chemical compounds ghavam 2022 popović djordjević et al 2019 due to the decrease in inhibitory power of r damascena essential oil under well water irrigation against gram negatives p aeruginosa and e coli mic 250 μg ml it can be seen that this decreasing trend has been accompanied by a decrease in dominant and minor compounds such as citronellol β elemene geranic acid methyl eugenol δ guaiene eicosane heneicosane and docosane the effect of citronellol on the inhibition of these two bacteria has been confirmed gochev et al 2008 the strongest inhibitory and lethal activity of both studied essential oil samples was against candida albicans the mic and mbc values of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater were 62 50 μg ml which was twice as strong as that of r damascena essential oil irrigated with well water and the antibiotic nystatin mic and mbc 125 μg ml in sefidshahr javinan and isfahan iran similar results ghavam et al 2021a 2021b 2021c and in bulgaria opposite results gochev et al 2008 from the activity of r damascena essential oil against candida albicans have been reported the main reason for the strong anti yeast activity of r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation may be due to the predominance of oxygenated monoterpenes in it the effects of linalool trans rose oxide citronellol and geraniol against candida have been demonstrated kim and park 2012 zore et al 2011 kunduhoglu 2017 and jirovetz et al 2006 the decrease of anti yeast activity of essential oil under well water irrigation can be associated with the increase of alkanes compounds another relatively strong inhibitory activity of r damascena essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater was against gram positive b subtilis mic 62 50 μg ml which was once weaker than rifampin 31 25 μg ml ghavam et al 2021a 2021b recorded the inhibition zone diameter against b subtilis 0 58 10 67 mm for the essential oil in the kamoo region citronellol with the highest amount of essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater is the main cause of this activity the effect of citronellol against some strains of bacillus has been confirmed gochev et al 2008 4 conclusion based on the results of the present study it can be concluded that r damascena essential oil under irrigation with treated wastewater had a significant and valuable yield quantity and chemical compounds quality the predominant compounds of r damascena under irrigation with well water were geraniol citronellol nonadecane and heptadecane which were changed to citronellol geraniol nonadecane and heneicosane in the essential oil irrigated with treated wastewater differences in the chemical compounds of the studied essential oils caused various antibacterial antifungal properties against standard strains as a result the essential oil irrigated with well water had better antimicrobial activity than the other essential oil mainly by creating a significant inhibition zone against a brasiliensis and k pneumoniae in contrast r damascena essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation had the best performance in terms of mic value against p aeruginosa and c albicans with twice the potency of positive controls in general essential oil under treated wastewater irrigation can be a possible optionin terms of quantity and quality of flavor inhibitory and lethality against some microorganisms

9457,estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration et c using high resolution aerial remote sensing data is important to detect water stress map and manage water resources in precision agriculture high resolution et c can be estimated using land surface energy balance models and remotely sensed land surface temperatures lst obtained using manned or unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with thermal cameras in this study three remote sensing et c models were compared i e two source energy balance tseb model mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric and surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal models thermal images were obtained using an airplane flying daily over almond orchards in california during the 2020 growing season the lst images were obtained at 0 5 m spatial resolution model comparisons indicated that all three models produced latent heat fluxes and net radiation estimates that agreed with eddy covariance measurements in the order of tseb r2 of 0 89 for le and 0 88 for rn metric r2 of 0 81 for le and 0 86 for rn and sebal r2 of 0 81 for le and 0 83 for rn however metric and sebal overestimated the latent heat fluxes while underestimating the sensible heat fluxes as compared to the two source model tseb the root mean square error rmse of the instantaneous latent and sensible heat fluxes were less than 38 w m 2 for tseb and were within 58 w m 2 for metric and sebal models the tseb model s good performance can be attributed to its partitioning of surface temperature between soil crop cover in the inter rows and almond tree canopies overall the results suggest that both one and two source surface energy models originally developed for satellite imagery are able to estimate instantaneous turbulent fluxes and spatial variability in et c using high resolution imagery in addition systematic variations in lst due to variable rate irrigation scheduling as depicted in the high spatial resolution imagery provided confidence in the spatially distributed latent heat flux maps estimated by the energy balance models this study shows that high resolution aerial imagery combined with energy balance models originally developed for satellite remote sensing can be used to accurately estimate site specific etc that is critical to achieving precision irrigation management in almond orchards and other crops graphical abstract ga1 keywords land surface temperature tseb metric sebal evapotranspiration remote sensing 1 introduction almonds are an important specialty crop because of their health benefits and they are the most economically important crop in california thanks to its mediterranean climate and sophisticated water infrastructure california produces 81 of the world s almonds and 100 of the u s commercial supply almonds are also the largest irrigated crop in california with over 647 497 irrigated hectares of bearing and nonbearing trees the land area under almonds in california has increased significantly from 191 011 ha in 1997 647 497 ha in 2021 usda nass 2021 almonds are water intensive crops using 9 5 of state agricultural water zhao et al 2017 the almond board of california under their sustainability goals has committed to reducing the amount of water needed to grower a kg of almonds by 20 by the year 2025 to achieve this goal would require significant investments in research development and outreach california climate is also characterized by weather extremes ranging from floods to multiyear droughts with the 2011 2017 drought being the longest drought in california recorded history according to the us drought monitor as of june 26th 2021 the entire state of california was again under various levels of drought due to erratic weather patterns in the past many growers resorted to groundwater pumping for irrigation that resulted in several negative impacts including land subsidence drying out drinking water wells and deterioration in water quality to address these challenges california enacted the sustainable groundwater management act sgma in order to cope with changing climate and increased regulation of water supplies for irrigation there is an urgent need to develop precision water management practices and technologies that allow growers to achieve multiple objectives including enhanced productivity and reduced environmental impacts xue et al 2020a 2020b the ability to accurately estimate actual crop evapotranspiration et c is important to both water allocation and precision irrigation scheduling et c is a key flux of the hydrologic cycle and it s important for assessing terrestrial water availability and for understanding energy and biogeochemical processes martens et al 2018 the direct measurement of et c from ground based methods such as eddy covariance ec wilson et al 2002 bowen ratio br prueger et al 1997 and surface renewal sr shapland et al 2014 at large temporal scales is time consuming and expensive and et c estimates are confined within the footprint of the tower locations peddinti et al 2020 remote sensing is considered to be better suited for mapping and monitoring et c at the field to watershed to regional scales which is especially helpful in precision water management dile et al 2020 he et al 2019 peddinti et al 2020 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 xu et al 2018 spatial assessment of et c mainly depends on the land surface temperature lst and multispectral data which are provided by sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft platforms or more recently unmanned aerial vehicles uavs candiago et al 2015 turner et al 2014 over the past few decades satellites like moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat have provided lst data at a spatiotemporal resolution ranging from a few meters to km on a daily to weekly basis respectively brenner et al 2017 there are limitations to obtaining high spatio temporal resolution data with currently available satellites because they have a long revisit period especially when considering cloud cover cao et al 2019 gao et al 2015 only airborne platforms can provide the requisite data to estimate et at high spatiotemporal scales brenner et al 2017 hoffmann et al 2016 xia et al 2016 however airborne platforms have some limitations including limited spatial and temporal coverage as a result of the high cost of ground coverage per unit area additional factors to consider include the amount of time needed to set up the aerial platform in the targeted areas and also the necessity of acquainting oneself with all of the relevant regulations to obtain permissions from the relevant national aviation authorities in order to fly cotrufo et al 2018 recent developments in multispectral aerial imaging and uavs have gained attention in remote sensing particularly when the area of interest is relatively small sankaran et al 2015a 2015b zaman allah et al 2015 uav platforms are capable of collecting visible near infrared and thermal bands with high spatial and temporal resolution than satellites candiago et al 2015 turner et al 2014 zhang and kovacs 2012 expanding their use in agricultural applications including yield

climatic conditions high resolution aerial imagery have mainly been used to monitor crop water stress berni et al 2009 as air and soil water content actual transpiration and crop water stress are all directly related to canopy temperature fuentes et al 2012 a high resolution thermal imaging system can acquire canopy temperature thereby eliminating the effect of soil or other thermal sources on the background temperature xia et al 2016 therefore the temperature of the canopy is positively linked to crop water stress and negatively linked to soil moisture and transpiration hoffmann et al 2015 monitoring and quantifying the crop water stress at field scale allows growers to optimize precision irrigation management based on energy exchange with the land surface numerous energy balance schemes have been developed in past several decades with varying degrees of complexity and utility to estimate spatial et and to detect crop stress kustas and norman 1996 these models can be classified as one source or contextual allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 and two source or single pixel kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 based on the parameterizations one source models such as metric and sebal rely upon contextual lst data alone or in combination with the variability in vegetation properties and topography to model energy fluxes and make no attempt to differentiate soil and canopy chirouze et al 2014 french et al 2015 unlike the single source models two source models such as tseb are supported by parameterization based on biophysical processes wherein energy fluxes between the soil surface plant canopy and the overlying air are modeled such an estimation leads to a distinct amount of transpiration and evaporation pertaining to non plant surfaces french et al 2015 kustas and norman 1996 norman et al 1995 xia et al 2016 the two source model generally gives an accurate estimation of surface energy balance compared to the single source model over the major portion of land that is covered by vegetation timmermans et al 2007 one source models use the lst and vegetation index or fractional vegetation cover as proxy indicators for identification of extremely dry and or wet conditions within the scene allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 whereas the tseb model includes detailed information on the radiative and flux exchange between soil and vegetation components without requiring extreme hydrologic parameters kustas and norman 1999 xia et al 2016 as a result the tseb model remains effective in homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes xia et al 2016 however the tseb model requires more parameterization compared to single source models which can increase uncertainty both single and two source model performance have been evaluated over different land cover and crop types over the past several decades using high resolution imagery for example bellvert et al 2018 estimated et c over an almond orchard at madera county in the central valley of california for one crop season using a simple crop evapotranspiration model in conjunction with water stress coefficients collected from airborne imagery they identified that a combination of crop evapotranspiration models and aerial imagery data was effective for upscaling irrigation information from the plant to the field level also bellvert et al 2021 used airborne data and the tseb model in conjunction with other models for the first time to estimate actual and potential evapotranspiration of various almond rootstocks and to characterize crop et c behavior in almond rootstocks under various irrigation treatments a simplified version of the tseb model together with field observations of soil and canopy temperatures was used by sánchez et al 2021 to estimate the surface energy flux balance and partition et into soil and transpiration components in a young almond orchard in spain french et al 2015 compared the tseb and metric models over a cotton field in maricopa arizona using high resolution uav data on vineyards in california nieto et al 2019 were able to estimate soil and canopy temperatures without making assumptions about initial canopy transpiration timmermans et al 2007 evaluated tseb and sebal models over different land use types choi et al 2009 evaluated the tseb metric and trapezoid interpolation model tim models on corn and soybean crops in iowa montibeller 2017 modified the sebal model to estimate energy fluxes from uav high resolution imagery of different growing seasons of corn and soybean in ames iowa furthermore elarab 2016 modified the original metric model in order to predict energy fluxes in field crops and vineyards using high resolution uav data the current study on the other hand used the originally developed metric allen et al 2007 and sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 developed for course resolution pixels with minor adjustment in default pixel size from 30 m to higher resolutions and the tseb model norman et al 1995 most energy balance models such as metric and sebal are designed for landsat scale spatial resolutions and as a result require homogeneous conditions across a single pixel however remote sensing data particularly low resolution data sets contain mixed pixels many studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of spatial resolution of input satellite data on et c estimation using a variety of energy balance models with the goal of better understanding the relationship between spatial resolution and et c estimation allen et al 2007 hong et al 2009 niu et al 2020 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 sharma et al 2016 these studies revealed that a decrease in the number of pixels for a particular region resulted in a loss of information which changes with the spatial characteristics li et al 2021 but the ability to test these models with very high resolution imagery is still uncertain also the studies comparing tseb metric and sebal with high resolution imagery are very limited for almond crops therefore it is worthwhile to compare simple one source models with more sophisticated two source models using high resolution aerial imagery over a variety of landscapes and crop types to understand the modeling scheme s strengths and limitations timmermans et al 2007 in the current study aerial images 11 flights were taken before and after the hull split growth stage of almonds to better understand the effect of water stress on evapotranspiration during this critical period deficit irrigation was used prior to hull split to intentionally induce moderate water stress water stress around the hull split reduces the incidence of hull rot and improves harvestability the purpose of this study was to compare the turbulent flux energy estimates of one source models such as metric and sebal and a two source model tseb based on high resolution spatiotemporal aerial imagery around the hull split growth stage in almond orchards in california 2 methods 2 1 study site description experiments were conducted during june july 2020 in a 500 ha almond orchard farm owned by esteve ranch located near corning california usa 39 57 18 72 n 122 14 49 2 w at 114 m msl fig 1 as per köppen s climate classification the region has a warm mediterranean climate characterized by abundant sunshine with an annual average temperature of 16 6 c the majority of the rainfall occurs in winter with an annual rainfall of 548 mm with very little rain in the summer which makes it a suitable almond producing area the orchards were planted with three varieties to achieve affective pollination including nonpareil monterey and butte the almond trees were 12 years old with an average height of 6 5 m and were planted at a distance of 6 7 m between rows and 3 4 m between trees along the row the orchard was irrigated using a micro sprinkler irrigation system 45 l h 1 with sprinkler spacing of 6 7 m irrigation timing was triggered based on stem water potential considering 1 4 mpa as baseline measurements were made at solar noon using a pressure chamber based on uc recommendations at different growth states fulton et al 2014 the duration of each irrigation event was based on et c replacement and soil water holding characteristics light soils were irrigated for 10 15 h while heavy soils were irrigated for 14 20 h during each irrigation event the study area consists of two major types of soils within the orchards namely sandy clay loam 53 1 sand 27 6 clay and 19 3 silt and clay loam 42 8 sand 26 9 clay and 30 3 silt soils 2 2 micrometeorological data the eddy covariance system which included a 3d sonic anemometer gill r3 50 li cor usa to monitor orthogonal wind velocity components and an open path gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne to measure co2 and h2o fluxes was installed 10 m above the ground in the middle of the orchard fig 1 both the 3d wind components and concentrations of water vapor and co2 were measured at 10 hz frequency additionally a four component net radiometer sn 500 ss apogee instruments inc ut usa was used to measure net radiation three soil heat flux plates hft 3 radiation energy balance systems bellevue wa were placed at a depth of 8 cm and coupled to three soil thermocouples tcav l campbell scientific inc logan ut and soil moisture probes gs 1 meter group inc usa buried at 2 5 cm depth were used to correct for heat storage above the plates the flux data were post processed using the full standard corrections and adjustments including two dimensional rotation spectral corrections moncrieff et al 1997 2005 and correcting for the effects of heat and water vapor density fluctuations webb et al 1980 using eddy pro 7 0 6 software li cor usa the footprint and data quality analysis was performed using tovi software li cor usa in addition to the flux measurements biometeorological parameters including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation vapor pressure and precipitation were measured at 30 min intervals the data had no gaps during the experimental period considered in this study hence the gap filling was not performed fig s1 depicts the energy balance eb closure for two time periods august to december 2020 a and june to december 2020 b we observed that the energy balance ratio ebr for this flux site was 1 67 with an r2 of 0 88 fig s1a the flux tower was located in the center of the almond orchard which accounts for 80 of the footprint area inside the study region fig 1 the advection effects were negligible since the equilibrium boundary layer of air can be believed to be entirely adjusted above the flux tower the closure in both cases was strong lending credence to the flux tower data in this research location it was consistent with the eb regression values presented in wilson et al 2002 for several sites 2 3 aerial imagery data campaigns the aerial imagery acquisition and preprocessing were done by ceres imaging inc ceres imaging https www ceresimaging net the airborne campaign consisted of 11 flights on dates shown in table 1 as well as the flight height and resolutions for both thermal and multispectral images images were acquired between 11 00 16 00 pst with the thermal sensor flir a65 flir systems wilsonville or usa and a custom configuration by ceres imaging inc of a constellation of vnir ids camera systems https www ids imaging us contact html all the images were acquired using a 13 mm lens with a field of view fov of 45 x 37 and each image was composed of 1400 3000 pixels the spectral response was in the range of 7 5 13 µm the spatial resolution is almost similar for all the acquired images which ranged from 0 6 to 0 7 m for both thermal and multispectral images table 1 the images were then resampled to ensure that the resolutions in both were consistent to 0 5 m the flir a65 camera system is an uncooled microbolometer that is calibrated in the lab at ceres imaging against a calibrated black body thermal source that operates in the range of approximately 15 50 after that the temperatures measured at the sensors are converted to surface temperatures by using an emissivity factor for vegetation of 0 96 and adjusting for transmission via the surrounding atmosphere in order to account for the effect of the atmosphere the concentrations of water vapor and carbon dioxide at the flight time and location are derived from a local weather station cimis station 222 or if not available from dark sky and used as inputs to the simple model of the atmospheric radiative transfer of sunshine smarts following the acquisition of thermal images in a continuous stream of radiation the data is recorded in a raw radiometric format using flir proprietary software the data is then converted to apparent temperature by altering the outdoor temperature caused by the combined influences of air temperature relative humidity and wind speed table 2 2 4 footprint analysis the fluxes measured by the ec system between the ecosystem and atmosphere originate from an area useful to estimate the upwind area contribution to the measured fluxes arriga et al 2017 the flux footprint or source weight function is a mathematical expression that describes the spatial distribution of flux sources and the magnitude of the associated flux nicolini et al 2017 based on receptor height air stability and surface roughness the flux footprint functions are used to assess the position and relative relevance of passive scalar sources impacting flux measurements kljun et al 2004 for data interpretation and quality filtering estimating the flux footprint is important ec data obtained in heterogeneous ecosystem fields were of major importance not only for integrating ec and remote sensing data but also for interpreting ec data collected in heterogeneous ecosystem fields vesala et al 2008 the flux footprint is influenced by structural properties of the surface including roughness measurement height and micrometeorological conditions in order to compare the modeled fluxes from tseb metric and sebal with measurements obtained from the ec system a single representative value from each model output map was extracted in accordance with the coverage of the ec footprint the 11 footprint outputs from the ec tower were applied to corresponding maps of energy balance fluxes by averaging the pixel values surrounding the area 2 5 description and implementation of the pytseb pysebal and pymetric models in this study an open source version of sebal called pysebal https github com timhessels sebal developed by hessels et al 2017 pymetric an open source version of metric https github com hectornieto pymetric and pytseb an opensource version of tseb https github com hectornieto pytseb developed by héctor nieto were used for computation of both turbulent heat fluxes and net radiation throughout the manuscript the notations used for sebal are pysebal metric is pymetric and tseb is pytseb estimation of instant latent heat or et c with pymetric and pysebal is based on the residual term of the surface energy balance for the land surface as eq 1 1 le λ et r n g h where le is latent heat flux w m 2 at overpass time λ is the latent heat of vaporization r n is net radiation w m 2 at the surface g is soil heat flux w m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 of the air both pymetric and pysebal models use a similar procedure for estimating net radiation and soil heat flux allen et al 2007 net radiation expresses the available radiation at the surface which can be calculated as 2 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo dimensionless r s is incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 r l and r l are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 and ε 0 is broadband surface thermal emissivity dimensionless the rate of heat storage in the soil as a result of heat transmission is referred to as soil heat flux g while remote sensing methods do not allow for direct measurement of g it can be calculated as a ratio g rn using an empirical equation proposed by bastiaanssen 2000 3 g r n t s 273 15 0 0038 0 007 α 1 0 98 ndvi 4 where t s is the surface temperature k α is the surface albedo and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index in this study the ndvi is estimated by using the nir and red bands from the aerial imagery as follows 4 ndvi nir red nir red the following equation was used to define the albedo threshold in pymetric allen et al 2013 5 α pymetric 0 001343 β 0 3281 e 0 0188 β where β is solar elevation angle surface albedo is calculated in pysebal using the top of atmosphere reflectance ρ stoa b calculated within the model which is based on the following equation 6 α pysebal b 1 n ρ stoa b w b r p τ a 2 where w b are the coefficients for different bands suggested for landsat 8 that were used in this study olmedo et al 2016 r p is the path radiance and τ a is the atmospheric transmissivity both models use an iterative process to estimate h using the temperature difference dt between near surface and air temperatures at a reference height following eq 7 7 h ρ a c p dt r ah where ρ a is atmospheric air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of air at constant temperature 1004 j kg 1 k 1 r ah is aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer s m 1 estimated by following eq 8 8 r ah 1 k u ln z d 0 z oh ψ h z d 0 ψ h z 0 h where k is the von karman s constant 0 41 u is the friction velocity m s 1 z is reference height m z oh and d 0 are roughness length for heat transfer and zero displacement height m and ψ h is stability correction for momentum wagle et al 2017 further the friction velocity u can be estimated using the following equation 9 u k u b ln z b d 0 z 0 m ψ m z b where u b is wind speed m s 1 at blending height z b 200 m z 0 m is the roughness height for momentum transfer and ψ m is stability correction for heat transport the near surface temperature difference dt is estimated from radiometric surface temperature ts using a simple linear relationship from two anchor pixels viz hot and cold pixels in the remote sensing image 10 dt a b t s where a and b are regression coefficients for selecting cold and hot pixels within images pymetric provides two types of search methods the calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec developed by allen et al 2013 and the exhaustive search algorithm esa developed by bhattarai et al 2017 the esa method was used to select hot and cold pixels for airborne imagery in the current study the esa method begins with creating a binary map of the candidate and non candidate pixels in the processed image to represent the relationship between the ts and ndvi values of candidate pixels a histogram is constructed with bin sizes of 0 25 k and 0 01 respectively to eliminate the possibility of outliers the minimum and maximum bin values were determined based on the presence of at least 50 corresponding pixels in the histogram and any pixels with temperatures less than 273 k or greater than 343 k were excluded from consideration cold pixels are typically found at the bottom of the ts histogram and the top of the ndvi histogram whereas hot pixels are found at the top of the ts histogram and the bottom of the ndvi histogram bhattarai et al 2017 in pysebal the hot pixels were selected from a dry and barren soil with low ndvi high ts and zero et c rate while the cold pixels were selected from a well irrigated crop field with complete vegetation cover and maximum et c rate pysebal assumes that le at the cold pixel equals the amount of available energy i e h 0 and dt 0 more details on the selection process of hot and cold pixels for pysebal and pymetric models can be found in xue et al 2020a 2020b and bhattarai et al 2017 respectively the le can be estimated from eq 1 at satellite overpass time once the h rn and g were determined the major difference between sebal and metric is the method of converting instantaneous et c values to a daily basis sebal uses the evaporative fraction in order to estimate daily et c whereas metric utilizes reference et calculated from ground based data through the asce penman monteith method 2 6 two source energy balance tseb model the remotely sensed surface temperature is used in both one and two source schemes as a boundary condition to estimate the instantaneous energy balance fluxes gonzalez dugo et al 2009 the one and two source models give similar results for net radiation and are interchangeable without significant changes in model results french et al 2015 timmermans et al 2007 both sebal and metric algorithms estimate the soil heat flux g as a function of the net radiation in contrast tseb determines the soil heat flux g by modeling the divergence of net radiation within the canopy via a simplified two stream radiative transfer approach campbell and norman 1998 hence the g is determined as a fraction of the net radiation just above the soil surface the difference between one and two source models is mainly due to the mechanism by which sensible heat flux and turbulent exchange coefficients are estimated especially the way the land surface is treated whether as a single source i e sebal and metric or as two source i e tseb wherein the energy exchange processes between the soil and vegetative canopies and the atmosphere are explicitly parameterized timmermans et al 2007 the section below describes the formulations of the tseb model to estimate energy fluxes a detailed description of the tseb model is provided in norman et al 1995 and kustas and norman 1999 latent and sensible heat fluxes are defined into two sources namely soil and canopy and the relationship between these energy fluxes are as follows 11 r n s g h s le s 12 r n c h c le c 13 g γ r n s 14 h h s h c 15 le le s le c where r n s and r n c are the net radiation w m 2 penetrating to the soil surface and absorbed by the canopy respectively h s and h c are the sensible heat fluxes w m 2 from soil and vegetation respectively similarly le s and le c are the latent heat fluxes w m 2 over the soil surface and canopy respectively g is soil heat flux w m 2 expressed as a function of the net radiation at the soil surface and γ is an empirical coefficient set as 0 35 choudhury et al 1987 the tseb model uses a single time observation of radiometric surface temperature t rad from which t s and t c can be extracted based on the fraction of the radiometer view occupied by soil and canopy within the sensor field view as follows 16 t rad f c t c 4 1 f c t s 4 1 4 where t c and t s are the canopy and the soil temperatures respectively and f c is the fractional vegetation cover the net radiation is computed as follows 17 r n 1 α s d ε s lwr 1 f c θ σ t s 4 f c θ t c 4 where s d and s lwr are the short and longwave incident radiation w m 2 respectively ε is the land surface emissivity that was assumed equal to 0 98 α is the broadband albedo in the visible and near infrared bands evolves seasonally

the radiometric temperature from the soil surface and t a is the air temperature k measured at 2 m height t c is radiometric temperature from canopy component ρ c p is volumetric heat capacity j m 3 k

the soil surface zhuang et al 2020 the first estimation of canopy latent heat le c can be determined by using the priestley taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 20 le c α pt f g δ δ γ r n c where

observed fluxes the level of agreement between observed and modeled turbulent fluxes and net radiation was assessed using root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae index of agreement d

composite bio geophysical characteristic of the land surface and the factors that influence its energy balance liu et al 2019 each block of land has an independent energy balance budget and varies in response to vegetation present in that area the thermal images acquired from an airborne flight over the study region on various dates in june and july 2020 are shown in fig 2 and the flight time and heights are listed in table 1 the high resolution lst maps exhibited the field scale heterogeneity which was not evident in coarser satellite imagery the western part of the farm contained high voltage electrical power lines with bare soil underneath with the land surface having high lst values blue area in fig 2 during the experimental period the almond orchard was irrigated five times on 26 june 1 july 10 july 16 july and 24 july 2020 with irrigation amounts of 88 50 79 82 and 58 mm respectively precipitation did not occur during this period hence irrigation was applied to meet crop et c the cooling effect due to irrigation was evident in all the acquired images the almond orchards required more irrigation water in june and july making the surface temperature to decrease significantly due to high evapotranspiration the lst image from july 10 showed more uniformity in temperature values except for the right two orchards with the mean of 28 due to the applied irrigation on the same day the next day i e july 11 also showed uniform lst values throughout the farm in all the orchards because of plenty of available soil moisture on the surface later dates i e july 12 14 showed different patterns of lst values due to the variability in infiltration capacity of different soil types in each almond orchard due to the irrigation on july 24 the lst values were more uniform on july 24 and 25 2020 with means of 23 and 27 respectively frequent irrigation resulted in higher soil moisture in irrigated almond orchard blocks which in turn resulted in a significant increase in the latent heat flux between the land surface and the atmosphere resulting in a significant decrease in land surface temperature 3 2 selection of hot and cold pixels in pymetric and pysebal models both pymetric and pysebal have automatic search algorithms for finding hot and cold pixels in satellite images at any resolution based on the conditions described in the preceding sections table 3 shows the extreme temperatures and ndvi thresholds used for choosing hot and cold pixels for pymetric and pysebal for the 11 dates tested in this study the temperatures for hot pixels ranged from 50 77 to 65 62 c for pymetric and from 43 56 to 65 02 c for pysebal models the threshold temperature for cold pixels varied between 26 77 and 35 21 c for pymetric and 31 98 43 52 c for pysebal for pymetric and pysebal models the ndvi threshold values for finding the hot pixels were between 0 13 and 0 25 the ndvi thresholds for cold pixels for the pymetric and pysebal models were 0 83 0 88 and 0 85 0 89 respectively the left portion of the study area which contains homogeneous bare soil beneath the electrical power lines with high lst fig 2 is expected to have soil characteristics that differ from the surrounding field and these strips were useful for quickly selecting hot pixels for all flight overpass dates while in the research area most vegetation showed temperatures between 22 and 34 c fig 2 which were used to find cold pixels by using the approach outlined in section 2 5 for both pymetric and pysebal models 3 3 comparison of modeled and observed turbulent fluxes and evapotranspiration modeled fluxes obtained from pytseb pysebal and pymetric using aerial imagery and measured fluxes from an ec system are shown in table 2 to compare the performance of the models the spatially distributed flux estimates obtained from all three models were averaged within the footprint area for each date the flux footprint was estimated using tovi software from li cor inc these averaged values were further compared with the ec measurements fig 3a c shows the comparison of modeled fluxes with ec data for the turbulent fluxes and net radiation and the goodness of fit statistics are presented in table 4 the measured soil heat flux data was not available for this period from the ec tower hence it was not considered for comparative analysis in this study overall there was a high degree of agreement between estimated and measured instantaneous fluxes for all three models the three models reproduced measured latent heat fluxes le fairly well with r2 values of 0 89 0 81 and 0 81 the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were within 38 and 58 w m 2 and the index of agreement d was 0 95 0 92 and 0 89 for the tseb sebal and metric models respectively table 4 the tseb model predicted le very well with higher r2 d nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and low rmse followed by sebal and metric table 4 however both sebal and metric models significantly overestimated measured le values compared to the tseb model fig 3a sensible heat fluxes h were poorly estimated by all the three models with r2 values of 0 65 0 56 and 0 66 the rmse and mae were within 29 and 34 w m 2 and the index of agreement of 0 92 0 88 and 0 92 for the tseb sebal and mtric models respectively both metric and tseb models predicted similar observed h values with greater r2 d nse and with low rmse compared to sebal the h values from both sebal and metric models consistently underestimated measured h values net radiation rn estimates from the three models did not differ significantly i e within 39 w m 2 with the observations all three models predicted the same range of soil heat fluxes g values for each overflight date using airborne data collected on 11 dates the accuracy of estimated daily et c from pytseb pysebal and pymetric was compared to the accuracy of ec measured et c fig 4 illustrates the average daily et c values estimated from three models plotted against the ec measured et c values the airborne derived et c estimates were consistent with the ec observed values with an rmse of 0 64 mm day for pytseb 1 06 mm day for pysebal and 0 65 mm day for pymetric fig 4 the nrmse values for the three models range from 0 10 to 0 16 with all three models exhibited a positive bias in prediction the correlation between the three models and the ec data was strong with r2 values of 0 82 for pytseb 0 80 for pysebal and 0 84 for pymetric for the all airborne survey dates respectively fig 4 3 4 spatial variability in turbulent latent heat fluxes over almond orchards information from high resolution spatially distributed evapotranspiration or latent heat flux maps for each block is essential to understand the water use patterns over the whole orchard for supporting precision irrigation management the spatial distribution of 11 le maps at 0 5 m spatial resolution computed using pytseb pymetric and pysebal are shown in fig 4a c respectively the high resolution imagery reveals small scale variability of latent heat fluxes within each orchard all the plots exhibited similar spatial distribution patterns of le from the three models the lowest le values were observed from all three models over the non vegetated areas under the high voltage electrical lines as well as the small strips to the right of the study area while the rest of the orchard showed higher values along with variability in some orchards that could be attributed to soil heterogeneity and differences in water use of the various almond varieties due to differences in canopy size to protect the almonds from pests during hull split chemical sprays were applied between 14 july to 22 july 2020 the chemical application during hull split did not affect the le values for further dates i e from 22 to 25 july 2020 the low le values were predicted by all three models for the data obtained during the flight time of 15 44 on 22 july 2020 this might be due to lower evaporative demand on that day as a result the photosynthesis rate from the trees was minimal leading to less transpiration owing to less solar radiation and surface temperature due to the two irrigation events on 10 july and 24 july 2020 the le values exhibited much uniformity over the entire orchard during the days of 11 13 and 14 july and 25 july 2020 with the only exception of 12 july wherein unexpectedly all three models exhibited a different behavior compared to their performance during the aforementioned dates this might be due to flight or sensor error as the lst also showed the higher values on this day leading to erroneous results from all three models fig 2 4 discussion overall the three models produced similar performance when used with high spatial resolution imagery among these three models the pytseb incorporates the biophysical processes that most approximate to actual field conditions compared to pysebal and pymetric models while all three models provided good results in terms of estimating instantaneous energy fluxes the pytseb model slightly outperformed the two one source modeling techniques in general one source energy balance models combine the soil vegetation components into a single source french et al 2015 but for almonds orchards the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistances to energy exchange therefore in heterogenous vegetation surfaces such as almond orchards one source models might have uncertainty in their estimation of surface energy fluxes song et al 2015 it may be the reason the latent and sensible heat fluxes are somewhat over and underestimated by the single source models in this study some studies have attempted to address this issue by performing thermal sharpening using high resolution multispectral imagery bisquert et al 2016 xue et al 2020a 2020b the aerial lst images showed separately the bare soil and a canopy of almonds orchards the one source models treated these as single components while the pytseb model considered these components separately as evaporation from the soil row and transpiration from the tree canopies hence the le flux variability from the three models had some deviations under dry conditions the le values modeled by pytseb were low while they were higher for pymetric and pysebal models fig 5a c this shows that the crop height canopy cover and crop structure influenced the final energy balance components for the pysebal and pymetric models the pattern of agreement with the observations were very similar showing the same tendency for over or underestimation for the eleven dates this can be explained by the fact that pysebal and pymetric use a similar approach to estimate sensible heat flux component of the energy balance in form of a linear relation between near surface air temperature and land surface temperature using two cold and hot pixels zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 generally the tseb model was found to better reproduce the variability in observed le h and rn values compared to the one source models previous studies have shown that flux estimates from the tseb sebal and metric models have performed similarly to reproduce the measured fluxes from ec systems in different environments and crop types using a modified sebal montibeller 2017 estimated the le h and rn in corn and soybean with an rmse of 2 67 8 84 and 6 09 w m 2 in comparison to the current study pymetric rmse of 58 28 and 35 w m 2 these values are quite high this is probably due to the fact orchards have more heterogenous canopies compared the canopy of a field crop at full cover for the three year study period from 2017 to 2019 sánchez et al 2021 found average rmse for le h and rn in young almond orchards in spain using the tseb model were 44 32 and 35 w m 2 respectively in the case of pytseb model estimations these results are in close agreement with those of the current study the results of nieto et al 2019 showed that the rmse values for estimation of le h and rn in vineyards in california were 75 78 and 17 w m 2 respectively in these latent and sensible heat fluxes are slightly higher than the current study according to the results from a comparative study by brenner et al 2018 in which they compared tseb and dtd models utilizing high resolution images in grasslands the rmse for estimation of h and le was 49 w m 2 and for rn it was 17 w m 2 the current study on the other hand demonstrates that the rmse for rn was high at 34 w m 2 but lower for h and le at 29 and 38 w m 2 respectively using the tseb model hoffmann et al 2015 demonstrated that the rmse for le h and rn were 94 85 and 44 w m 2 for barley fields in comparison to the current study these results are considerably higher and also higher than those reported by sebal montibeller 2017 in field crops the fact that barley and grass fields are homogeneous crops with short canopies contrary to almonds in the current study would be expected to have smaller errors an intercomparison of output from eddy covariance and the three models reveals that lst meteorological and fraction cover are the main drivers influencing the performance from the pytseb model while pymetric and pysebal required representative hot and wet end member pixels within the scene to define model parameters the spatial variability within the rows of the almond orchards was very clear within the images from all three models each row had a different almond variety and a slight deviation in the canopy size the high resolution of 0 5 m maps in fig 5a b from the three models show similar spatial distribution of le in the entire orchard but the pytseb model produced different spatial variations in le especially when the soil was dry on 22 june 6 july and10 july 2020 compared to the one source models the results also indicate that although sebal and metric were originally developed to work with large satellite imagery they produce acceptable performance when used with high resolution imagery in this study we made a slight modification in the pysebal algorithm by changing default pixel size from 30 m to higher resolutions 5 conclusions one source pysebal and pymetric and two source pytseb energy balance models were compared to measured turbulent fluxes from eddy covariance over an almond orchard during the hull split period using high resolution imagery from an aircraft with the goal to determine their performance and accuracy the pytseb model produced satisfactory estimates of instantaneous latent and sensible heat fluxes for all the flight dates while pysebal and pymetric models output of le and h were over and underestimated for all the flight dates respectively the findings reveal that all three models are capable of accurately capturing the variation in observed daily et c with r2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 84 overall the pytseb model outperformed the pymetric and pysebal models in estimating instantaneous latent heat flux with an r2 of 0 89 and an rmse of 38 w m 2 whereas the pymetric has an r2 of 0 81 and an rmse of 58 w m 2 and the pysebal has an r2 of 0 81 and an rmse of 54 w m 2 the daily et c and latent heat flux values for all three models were substantially overestimated compared to observed values all three models were able to produce maps of high resolution spatial patterns of le in almond orchards that were mostly similar and showed systematic patterns due to irrigation no effect of hull split was observed on the daily variation in spatial le over the almond orchards demonstrating the suitability of using models in conjunction with high resolution aerial imagery for optimizing irrigation decision making as a result of this research it was demonstrated that it is possible to reliably map le using high spatial resolution aerial imagery using one and two source energy balance models originally developed for satellite remote sensing to support precision irrigation management in orchards nevertheless future research should be focused on validating the approach of using energy balance models originally developed for coarse resolution satellite imagery with high spatial resolution aerial imagery in various crops this would enhance our understanding of the implications of the assumptions in these models when used to estimate etc or le using high resolution aerial imagery in different crop canopy structures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9457,estimation of actual crop evapotranspiration et c using high resolution aerial remote sensing data is important to detect water stress map and manage water resources in precision agriculture high resolution et c can be estimated using land surface energy balance models and remotely sensed land surface temperatures lst obtained using manned or unmanned aerial vehicles equipped with thermal cameras in this study three remote sensing et c models were compared i e two source energy balance tseb model mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric and surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal models thermal images were obtained using an airplane flying daily over almond orchards in california during the 2020 growing season the lst images were obtained at 0 5 m spatial resolution model comparisons indicated that all three models produced latent heat fluxes and net radiation estimates that agreed with eddy covariance measurements in the order of tseb r2 of 0 89 for le and 0 88 for rn metric r2 of 0 81 for le and 0 86 for rn and sebal r2 of 0 81 for le and 0 83 for rn however metric and sebal overestimated the latent heat fluxes while underestimating the sensible heat fluxes as compared to the two source model tseb the root mean square error rmse of the instantaneous latent and sensible heat fluxes were less than 38 w m 2 for tseb and were within 58 w m 2 for metric and sebal models the tseb model s good performance can be attributed to its partitioning of surface temperature between soil crop cover in the inter rows and almond tree canopies overall the results suggest that both one and two source surface energy models originally developed for satellite imagery are able to estimate instantaneous turbulent fluxes and spatial variability in et c using high resolution imagery in addition systematic variations in lst due to variable rate irrigation scheduling as depicted in the high spatial resolution imagery provided confidence in the spatially distributed latent heat flux maps estimated by the energy balance models this study shows that high resolution aerial imagery combined with energy balance models originally developed for satellite remote sensing can be used to accurately estimate site specific etc that is critical to achieving precision irrigation management in almond orchards and other crops graphical abstract ga1 keywords land surface temperature tseb metric sebal evapotranspiration remote sensing 1 introduction almonds are an important specialty crop because of their health benefits and they are the most economically important crop in california thanks to its mediterranean climate and sophisticated water infrastructure california produces 81 of the world s almonds and 100 of the u s commercial supply almonds are also the largest irrigated crop in california with over 647 497 irrigated hectares of bearing and nonbearing trees the land area under almonds in california has increased significantly from 191 011 ha in 1997 647 497 ha in 2021 usda nass 2021 almonds are water intensive crops using 9 5 of state agricultural water zhao et al 2017 the almond board of california under their sustainability goals has committed to reducing the amount of water needed to grower a kg of almonds by 20 by the year 2025 to achieve this goal would require significant investments in research development and outreach california climate is also characterized by weather extremes ranging from floods to multiyear droughts with the 2011 2017 drought being the longest drought in california recorded history according to the us drought monitor as of june 26th 2021 the entire state of california was again under various levels of drought due to erratic weather patterns in the past many growers resorted to groundwater pumping for irrigation that resulted in several negative impacts including land subsidence drying out drinking water wells and deterioration in water quality to address these challenges california enacted the sustainable groundwater management act sgma in order to cope with changing climate and increased regulation of water supplies for irrigation there is an urgent need to develop precision water management practices and technologies that allow growers to achieve multiple objectives including enhanced productivity and reduced environmental impacts xue et al 2020a 2020b the ability to accurately estimate actual crop evapotranspiration et c is important to both water allocation and precision irrigation scheduling et c is a key flux of the hydrologic cycle and it s important for assessing terrestrial water availability and for understanding energy and biogeochemical processes martens et al 2018 the direct measurement of et c from ground based methods such as eddy covariance ec wilson et al 2002 bowen ratio br prueger et al 1997 and surface renewal sr shapland et al 2014 at large temporal scales is time consuming and expensive and et c estimates

scales which is especially helpful in precision water management dile et al 2020 he et al 2019 peddinti et al 2020 peddinti and kambhammettu 2019 xu et al 2018 spatial assessment of et c mainly depends on the land surface temperature lst and multispectral data which are provided by sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft platforms or more recently unmanned aerial vehicles uavs candiago et al 2015 turner et al 2014 over the past few decades satellites like moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat have provided lst data at a spatiotemporal resolution ranging from a few meters to km on a daily to weekly basis respectively brenner et al 2017 there are limitations to obtaining high spatio temporal resolution data with currently available satellites because they have a long revisit period especially when considering cloud cover cao et al 2019 gao et al 2015 only airborne platforms can provide the requisite data to estimate et at high spatiotemporal scales brenner et al 2017 hoffmann et al 2016 xia et al 2016 however airborne platforms have some limitations including limited spatial and temporal coverage as a result of the high cost of ground coverage per unit area additional factors to consider include the amount of time needed to set up the aerial platform in the targeted areas and also the necessity of acquainting oneself with all of the relevant regulations to obtain permissions from the relevant national aviation authorities in order to fly cotrufo et al 2018 recent developments in multispectral aerial imaging and uavs have gained attention in remote sensing particularly when the area of interest is relatively small sankaran et al 2015a 2015b zaman allah et al 2015 uav platforms are capable of collecting visible near infrared

climatic conditions high resolution aerial imagery have mainly been used to monitor crop water stress berni et al 2009 as air and soil water content actual transpiration and crop water stress are all directly related to canopy temperature fuentes et al 2012 a high resolution thermal imaging system can acquire canopy temperature thereby eliminating the effect of soil or other thermal sources on the background temperature xia et al 2016 therefore the temperature of the canopy is positively linked to crop water stress and negatively linked to soil moisture and transpiration hoffmann et al 2015 monitoring and quantifying the crop water stress at field scale allows growers to optimize precision irrigation management based on energy exchange with the land surface numerous energy balance schemes have been developed in past several decades with varying degrees of complexity and utility to estimate spatial et and to detect crop stress kustas and norman 1996 these models can be classified as one source or contextual allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 and two source or single pixel kustas and norman 1999 norman et al 1995 based on the parameterizations one source models such as metric and sebal rely upon contextual lst data alone or in combination with the variability in vegetation properties and topography to model energy fluxes and make no attempt to differentiate soil and canopy chirouze et al 2014 french et al 2015 unlike the single source models two source models such as tseb are supported by parameterization based on biophysical processes wherein energy fluxes between the soil surface plant canopy and the overlying air are modeled such an estimation leads to a distinct amount of transpiration and evaporation pertaining to non plant surfaces french et al 2015 kustas and norman 1996 norman et al 1995 xia et al 2016 the two source model generally gives an accurate estimation of surface energy balance compared to the single source model over the major portion of land that is covered by vegetation timmermans et al 2007 one source models use the lst and vegetation index or fractional vegetation cover as proxy indicators for identification of extremely dry and or wet conditions within the scene allen et al 2007 bastiaanssen et al 1998 whereas the tseb model includes detailed information on the radiative and flux exchange between soil and vegetation components without requiring extreme hydrologic parameters kustas and norman 1999 xia et al 2016 as a result the tseb model remains effective in homogeneous and heterogeneous landscapes xia et al 2016 however the tseb model requires more parameterization compared to single source models which can increase uncertainty both single and two source model performance have been evaluated over different land cover and crop types over the past several decades using high resolution imagery for example bellvert et al 2018 estimated et c over an almond orchard at madera county in the central valley of california for one crop season using a simple crop evapotranspiration model in conjunction with water stress coefficients collected from airborne imagery they identified that a combination of crop evapotranspiration models and aerial imagery data was effective for upscaling irrigation information from the plant to the field level also bellvert et al 2021 used airborne data and the tseb model in conjunction with other models for the first time to estimate actual and potential evapotranspiration of various almond rootstocks and to characterize crop et c behavior in almond rootstocks under various irrigation treatments a simplified version of the tseb model together with field observations of soil and canopy temperatures was used by sánchez et al 2021 to estimate the surface energy flux balance and partition et into soil and transpiration components in a young almond orchard in spain french et al 2015 compared the tseb and metric models over a cotton field in maricopa arizona using high resolution uav data on vineyards in california nieto et al 2019 were able to estimate soil and canopy temperatures without making assumptions about initial canopy transpiration timmermans et al 2007 evaluated tseb and sebal models over different land use types choi et al 2009 evaluated the tseb metric and trapezoid interpolation model tim models on corn and soybean crops in iowa montibeller 2017 modified the sebal model to estimate energy fluxes from uav high resolution imagery of different growing seasons of corn and soybean in ames iowa furthermore elarab 2016 modified the original metric model in order to predict energy fluxes in field crops and vineyards using high resolution uav data the current study on the other hand used the originally developed metric allen et al 2007 and sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 developed for course resolution pixels with minor adjustment in default pixel size from 30 m to higher resolutions and the tseb model norman et al 1995 most energy balance models such as metric and sebal are designed for landsat scale spatial resolutions and as a result require homogeneous conditions across a single pixel however remote sensing data particularly low resolution data sets contain mixed pixels many studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of spatial resolution of input satellite data on et c estimation using a variety of energy balance models with the goal of better understanding the relationship between spatial resolution and et c estimation allen et al 2007 hong et al 2009 niu et al 2020 ramírez cuesta et al 2019 sharma et al 2016 these studies revealed that a decrease in the number of pixels for a particular region resulted in a loss of information which changes with the spatial characteristics li et al 2021 but the ability to test these models with very high resolution imagery is still uncertain also the studies comparing tseb metric and sebal with high resolution imagery are very limited for almond crops therefore it is worthwhile to compare simple one source models with more sophisticated two source models using high resolution aerial imagery over a variety of landscapes and crop types to understand the modeling scheme s strengths and limitations timmermans et al 2007 in the current study aerial images 11 flights were taken before and after the hull split growth stage of almonds to better understand the effect of water stress on evapotranspiration during this critical period deficit irrigation was used prior to hull split to intentionally induce moderate water stress water stress around the hull split reduces the incidence of hull rot and improves harvestability the purpose of this study was to compare the turbulent flux energy estimates of one source models such as metric and sebal and a two source model tseb based on high resolution spatiotemporal aerial imagery around the hull split growth stage in almond orchards in california 2 methods 2 1 study site description experiments were conducted during june july 2020 in a 500 ha almond orchard farm owned by esteve ranch located near corning california usa 39 57 18 72 n 122 14 49 2 w at 114 m msl fig 1 as per köppen s climate classification the region has a warm mediterranean climate characterized by abundant sunshine with an annual average temperature of 16 6 c the majority of the rainfall occurs in winter with an annual rainfall of 548 mm with very little rain in the summer which makes it a suitable almond producing area the orchards were planted with three varieties to achieve affective pollination including nonpareil monterey and butte the almond trees were 12 years old with an average height of 6 5 m and were planted at a distance of 6 7 m between rows and 3 4 m between trees along the row the orchard was irrigated using a micro sprinkler irrigation system 45 l h 1 with sprinkler spacing of 6 7 m irrigation timing was triggered based on stem water potential considering 1 4 mpa as baseline measurements were made at solar noon using a pressure chamber based on uc recommendations at different growth states fulton et al 2014 the duration of each irrigation event was based on et c replacement and soil water holding characteristics light soils were irrigated for 10 15 h while heavy soils were irrigated for 14 20 h during each irrigation event the study area consists of two major types of soils within the orchards namely sandy clay loam 53 1 sand 27 6 clay and 19 3 silt and clay loam 42 8 sand 26 9 clay and 30 3 silt soils 2 2 micrometeorological data the eddy covariance system which included a 3d sonic anemometer gill r3 50 li cor usa to monitor orthogonal wind velocity components and an open path gas analyzer li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne to measure co2 and h2o fluxes was installed 10 m above the ground in the middle of the orchard fig 1 both the 3d wind components and concentrations of water vapor and co2 were measured at 10 hz frequency additionally a four component net radiometer sn 500 ss apogee instruments inc ut usa was used to measure net radiation three soil heat flux plates hft 3 radiation energy balance systems bellevue wa were placed at a depth of 8 cm and coupled to three soil thermocouples tcav l campbell scientific inc logan ut and soil moisture probes gs 1 meter group inc usa buried at 2 5 cm depth were used to correct for heat storage above the plates the flux data were post processed using the full standard corrections and adjustments including two dimensional rotation spectral corrections moncrieff et al 1997 2005 and correcting for the effects of heat and water vapor density fluctuations webb et al 1980 using eddy pro 7 0 6 software li cor usa the footprint and data quality analysis was performed using tovi software li cor usa in addition to the flux measurements biometeorological parameters including air temperature relative humidity solar radiation vapor pressure and precipitation were measured at 30 min intervals the data had no gaps during the experimental period considered in this study hence the gap filling was not performed fig s1 depicts the energy balance eb closure for two time periods august to december 2020 a and june to december 2020 b we observed that the energy balance ratio ebr for this flux site was 1 67 with an r2 of 0 88 fig s1a the flux tower was located in the center of the almond orchard which accounts for 80 of the footprint area inside the study region fig 1 the advection effects were negligible since the equilibrium boundary layer of air can be believed to be entirely adjusted above the flux tower the closure in both cases was strong lending credence to the flux tower data in this research location it was consistent with the eb regression values presented in wilson et al 2002 for several sites 2 3 aerial imagery data campaigns the aerial imagery acquisition and preprocessing were done by ceres imaging inc ceres imaging https www ceresimaging net the airborne campaign consisted of 11 flights on dates shown in table 1 as well as the flight height and resolutions for both thermal and multispectral images images were acquired between 11 00 16 00 pst with the thermal sensor flir a65 flir systems wilsonville or usa and a custom configuration by ceres imaging inc of a constellation of vnir ids camera systems https www ids imaging us contact html all the images were acquired using a 13 mm lens with a field of view fov of 45 x 37 and each image was composed of 1400 3000 pixels the spectral response was in the range of 7 5 13 µm the spatial resolution is almost similar for all the acquired images which ranged from 0 6 to 0 7 m for both thermal and multispectral images table 1 the images were then resampled to ensure that the resolutions in both were consistent to 0 5 m the flir a65 camera system is an uncooled microbolometer that is calibrated in the lab at ceres imaging against a calibrated black body thermal source that operates in the range of approximately 15 50 after that the temperatures measured at the sensors are converted to surface temperatures by using an emissivity factor for vegetation of 0 96 and adjusting for transmission via the surrounding atmosphere in order to account for the effect of the atmosphere the concentrations of water vapor and carbon dioxide at the flight time and location are derived from a local weather station cimis station 222 or if not available from dark sky and used as inputs to the simple model of the atmospheric radiative transfer of sunshine smarts following the acquisition of thermal images in a continuous stream of radiation the data is recorded in a raw radiometric format using flir proprietary software the data is then converted to apparent temperature by altering the outdoor temperature caused by the combined influences of air temperature relative humidity and wind speed table 2 2 4 footprint analysis the fluxes measured by the ec system between the ecosystem and atmosphere originate from an area useful to estimate the upwind area contribution to the measured fluxes arriga et al 2017 the flux footprint or source weight function is a mathematical expression that describes the spatial distribution of flux sources and the magnitude of the associated flux nicolini et al 2017 based on receptor height air stability and surface roughness the flux footprint functions are used to assess the position and relative relevance of passive scalar sources impacting flux measurements kljun et al 2004 for data interpretation and quality filtering estimating the flux footprint is important ec data obtained in heterogeneous ecosystem fields were of major importance not only for integrating ec and remote sensing data but also for interpreting ec data collected in heterogeneous ecosystem fields vesala et al 2008 the flux footprint is influenced by structural properties of the surface including roughness measurement height and micrometeorological conditions in order to compare the modeled fluxes from tseb metric and sebal with measurements obtained from the ec system a single representative value from each model output map was extracted in accordance with the coverage of the ec footprint the 11 footprint outputs from the ec tower were applied to corresponding maps of energy balance fluxes by averaging the pixel values surrounding the area 2 5 description and implementation of the pytseb pysebal and pymetric models in this study an open source version of sebal called pysebal https github com timhessels sebal developed by hessels et al 2017 pymetric an open source version of metric https github com hectornieto pymetric and pytseb an opensource version of tseb https github com hectornieto pytseb developed by héctor nieto were used for computation of both turbulent heat fluxes and net radiation throughout the manuscript the notations used for sebal are pysebal metric is pymetric and tseb is pytseb estimation of instant latent heat or et c with pymetric and pysebal is based on the residual term of the surface energy balance for the land surface as eq 1 1 le λ et r n g h where le is latent heat flux w m 2 at overpass time λ is the latent heat of vaporization r n is net radiation w m 2 at the surface g is soil heat flux w m 2 and h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 of the air both pymetric and pysebal models use a similar procedure for estimating net radiation and soil heat flux allen et al 2007 net radiation expresses the available radiation at the surface which can be calculated as 2 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo dimensionless r s is incoming shortwave radiation w m 2 r l and r l are the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation w m 2 and ε 0 is broadband surface thermal emissivity dimensionless the rate of heat storage in the soil as a result of heat transmission is referred to as soil heat flux g while remote sensing methods do not allow for direct measurement of g it can be calculated as a ratio g rn using an empirical equation proposed by bastiaanssen 2000 3 g r n t s 273 15 0 0038 0 007 α 1 0 98 ndvi 4 where t s is the surface temperature k α is the surface albedo and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index in this study the ndvi is estimated by using the nir and red bands from the aerial imagery as follows 4 ndvi nir red nir red the following equation was used to define the albedo threshold in pymetric allen et al 2013 5 α pymetric 0 001343 β 0 3281 e 0 0188 β where β is solar elevation angle surface albedo is calculated in pysebal using the top of atmosphere reflectance ρ stoa b calculated within the model which is based on the following equation 6 α pysebal b 1 n ρ stoa b w b r p τ a 2 where w b are the coefficients for different bands suggested for landsat 8 that were used in this study olmedo et al 2016 r p is the path radiance and τ a is the atmospheric transmissivity both models use an iterative process to estimate h using the temperature difference dt between near surface and air temperatures at a reference height following eq 7 7 h ρ a c p dt r ah where ρ a is atmospheric air density kg m 3 c p is the specific heat of air at constant temperature 1004 j kg 1 k 1 r ah is aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer s m 1 estimated by following eq 8 8 r ah 1 k u ln z d 0 z oh ψ h z d 0 ψ h z 0 h where k is the von karman s constant 0 41 u is the friction velocity m s 1 z is reference height m z oh and d 0 are roughness length for heat transfer and zero displacement height m and ψ h is stability correction for momentum wagle et al 2017 further the friction velocity u can be estimated using the following equation 9 u k u b ln z b d 0 z 0 m ψ m z b where u b is wind speed m s 1 at blending height z b 200 m z 0 m is the roughness height for momentum transfer and ψ m is stability correction for heat transport the near surface temperature difference dt is estimated from radiometric surface temperature ts using a simple linear relationship from two anchor pixels viz hot and cold pixels in the remote sensing image 10 dt a b t s where a and b are regression coefficients for selecting cold and hot pixels within images pymetric provides two types of search methods the calibration using inverse modeling at extreme conditions cimec developed by allen et al 2013 and the exhaustive search algorithm esa developed by bhattarai et al 2017 the esa method was used to select hot and cold pixels for airborne imagery in the current study the esa method begins with creating a binary map of the candidate and non candidate pixels in the processed image to represent the relationship between the ts and ndvi values of candidate pixels a histogram is constructed with bin sizes of 0 25 k and 0 01 respectively to eliminate the possibility of outliers the minimum and maximum bin values were determined based on the presence of at least 50 corresponding pixels in the histogram and any pixels with temperatures less than 273 k or greater than 343 k were excluded from consideration cold pixels are typically found at the bottom of the ts histogram and the top of the ndvi histogram whereas hot pixels are found at the top of the ts histogram and the bottom of the ndvi histogram bhattarai et al 2017 in pysebal the hot pixels were selected from a dry and barren soil with low ndvi high ts and zero et c rate while the cold pixels were selected from a well irrigated crop field with complete vegetation cover and maximum et c rate pysebal assumes that le at the cold pixel equals the amount of available energy i e h 0 and dt 0 more details on the selection process of hot and cold pixels for pysebal and pymetric models can be found in xue et al 2020a 2020b and bhattarai et al 2017 respectively the le can be estimated from eq 1 at satellite overpass time once the h rn and g were determined the major difference between sebal and metric is the method of converting instantaneous et c values to a daily basis sebal uses the evaporative fraction in order to estimate daily et c whereas metric utilizes reference et calculated from ground based data through the asce penman monteith method 2 6 two source energy balance tseb model the remotely sensed surface temperature is used in both one and two source schemes as a boundary condition to estimate the instantaneous energy balance fluxes gonzalez dugo et al 2009 the one and two source models give similar results for net radiation and are interchangeable without significant changes in model results french et al 2015 timmermans et al 2007 both sebal and metric algorithms estimate the soil heat flux g as a function of the net radiation in contrast tseb determines the soil heat flux g by modeling the divergence of net radiation within the canopy via a simplified two stream radiative transfer approach campbell and norman 1998 hence the g is determined as a fraction of the net radiation just above the soil surface the difference between one and two source models is mainly due to the mechanism by which sensible heat flux and turbulent exchange coefficients are estimated especially the way the land surface is treated whether as a single source i e sebal and metric or as two source i e tseb wherein the energy exchange processes between the soil and vegetative canopies and the atmosphere are explicitly parameterized timmermans et al 2007 the section below describes the formulations of the tseb model to estimate energy fluxes a detailed description of the tseb model is provided in norman et al 1995 and kustas and norman 1999 latent and sensible heat fluxes are defined into two sources namely soil and canopy and the relationship between these energy fluxes are as follows 11 r n s g h s le s 12 r n c h c le c 13 g γ r n s 14 h h s h c 15 le le s le c where r n s and r n c are the net radiation w m 2 penetrating to the soil surface and absorbed by the canopy respectively h s and h c are the sensible heat fluxes w m 2 from soil and vegetation respectively similarly le s and le c are the latent heat fluxes w m 2 over the soil surface and canopy respectively g is soil heat flux w m 2 expressed as a function of the net radiation at the soil surface and γ is an empirical coefficient set as 0 35 choudhury et al 1987 the tseb model uses a single time observation of radiometric surface temperature t rad from which t s and t c can be extracted based on the fraction of the radiometer view occupied by soil and canopy within the sensor field view as follows 16 t rad f c t c 4 1 f c t s 4 1 4 where t c and t s are the canopy and the soil temperatures respectively and f c is the fractional vegetation cover the net radiation is computed as follows 17 r n 1 α s d ε s lwr 1 f c θ σ t s 4 f c θ t c 4 where s d and s lwr are the short and longwave incident radiation w m 2 respectively ε is the land surface emissivity that was assumed equal to 0 98 α is the broadband albedo in the visible and near infrared bands evolves seasonally

soil and vegetation are considered in the parallel mode the sensible heat flux is expressed according to the following equations 18 h s ρ c p t s t a r ah r sh 19 h c ρ c p t c t a r ah where t s is the radiometric temperature from the soil surface and t a is the air temperature k measured at 2 m height t c is radiometric temperature from canopy component ρ c p is volumetric heat capacity j m 3 k

the soil surface zhuang et al 2020 the first estimation of canopy latent heat le c can be determined by using the priestley taylor approach priestley and taylor 1972 20 le c α pt f g δ δ γ r n c where r n c is the net radiation to the canopy w m2 α pt is the priestley taylor parameter equal to 1 26 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure temperature relation kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 and f g is the fraction of green vegetation 2 7 model performance evaluation different goodness of fit statistical indicators were used to assess the errors between modeled and observed fluxes the level of agreement between observed and modeled turbulent fluxes and net radiation was assessed using root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae index of agreement d coefficient of determination r2 bias and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse see eqs 21 26 the nse indicates how well the observed and simulated values fit the 1 1 line the nse value 1 denotes a perfect match between the model and the observed data while the nse value 0 denotes that the model predictions are as accurate as the observed data mean and if the nse value between infinity to zero range denotes that the observed mean is a good predictor than the model the index of agreement d is a standardized measure of model prediction error that ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 denoting perfect agreement with observed values and 0 denoting no agreement with observed values 21 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 1 2 22 mae 1 n i 1 n p i o i 23 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 0 d 1 24 r 2

composite bio geophysical characteristic of the land surface and the factors that influence its energy balance liu et al 2019 each block of land has an independent energy balance budget and varies in response to vegetation present in that area the thermal images acquired from an airborne flight over the study region on various dates in june and july 2020 are shown in fig 2 and the flight time and heights are listed in table 1 the high resolution lst maps exhibited the field scale heterogeneity which was not evident in coarser satellite imagery the western part of the farm contained high voltage electrical power lines with bare soil underneath with the land surface having high lst values blue area in fig 2 during the experimental period the almond orchard was irrigated five times on 26 june 1 july 10 july 16 july and 24 july 2020 with irrigation amounts of 88 50 79 82 and 58 mm respectively precipitation did not occur during this period hence irrigation was applied to meet crop et c the cooling effect due to irrigation was evident in all the acquired images the almond orchards required more irrigation water in june and july making the surface temperature to decrease significantly due to high evapotranspiration the lst image from july 10 showed more uniformity in temperature values except for the right two orchards with the mean of 28 due to the applied irrigation on the same day the next day i e july 11 also showed uniform lst values throughout the farm in all the orchards because of plenty of available soil moisture on the surface later dates i e july 12 14 showed different patterns of lst values due to the variability in infiltration capacity of different soil types in each almond orchard due to the irrigation on july 24 the lst values were more uniform on july 24 and 25 2020 with means of 23 and 27 respectively frequent irrigation resulted in higher soil moisture in irrigated almond orchard blocks which in turn resulted in a significant increase in the latent heat flux between the land surface and the atmosphere resulting in a significant decrease in land surface temperature 3 2 selection of hot and cold pixels in pymetric and pysebal models both pymetric and pysebal have automatic search algorithms for finding hot and cold pixels in satellite images at any resolution based on the conditions described in the preceding sections table 3 shows the extreme temperatures and ndvi thresholds used for choosing hot and cold pixels for pymetric and pysebal for the 11 dates tested in this study the temperatures for hot pixels ranged from 50 77 to 65 62 c for pymetric and from 43 56 to 65 02 c for pysebal models the threshold temperature for cold pixels varied between 26 77 and 35 21 c for pymetric and 31 98 43 52 c for pysebal for pymetric and pysebal models the ndvi threshold values for finding the hot pixels were between 0 13 and 0 25 the ndvi thresholds for cold pixels for the pymetric and pysebal models were 0 83 0 88 and 0 85 0 89 respectively the left portion of the study area which contains homogeneous bare soil beneath the electrical power lines with high lst fig 2 is expected to have soil characteristics that differ from the surrounding field and these strips were useful for quickly selecting hot pixels for all flight overpass dates while in the research area most vegetation showed temperatures between 22 and 34 c fig 2 which were used to find cold pixels by using the approach outlined in section 2 5 for both pymetric and pysebal models 3 3 comparison of modeled and observed turbulent fluxes and evapotranspiration modeled fluxes obtained from pytseb pysebal and pymetric using aerial imagery and measured fluxes from an ec system are shown in table 2 to compare the performance of the models the spatially distributed flux estimates obtained from all three models were averaged within the footprint area for each date the flux footprint was estimated using tovi software from li cor inc these averaged values were further compared with the ec measurements fig 3a c shows the comparison of modeled fluxes with ec data for the turbulent fluxes and net radiation and the goodness of fit statistics are presented in table 4 the measured soil heat flux data was not available for this period from the ec tower hence it was not considered for comparative analysis in this study overall there was a high degree of agreement between estimated and measured instantaneous fluxes for all three models the three models reproduced measured latent heat fluxes le fairly well with r2 values of 0 89 0 81 and 0 81 the root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were within 38 and 58 w m 2 and the index of agreement d was 0 95 0 92 and 0 89 for the tseb sebal and metric models respectively table 4 the tseb model predicted le very well with higher r2 d nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and low rmse followed by sebal and metric table 4 however both sebal and metric models significantly overestimated measured le values compared to the tseb model fig 3a sensible heat fluxes h were poorly estimated by all the three models with r2 values of 0 65 0 56 and 0 66 the rmse and mae were within 29 and 34 w m 2 and the index of agreement of 0 92 0 88 and 0 92 for the tseb sebal and mtric models respectively both metric and tseb models predicted similar observed h values with greater r2 d nse and with low rmse compared to sebal the h values from both sebal and metric models consistently underestimated measured h values net radiation rn estimates from the three models did not differ significantly i e within 39 w m 2 with the observations all three models predicted the same range of soil heat fluxes g values for each overflight date using airborne data collected on 11 dates the accuracy of estimated daily et c from pytseb pysebal and pymetric was compared to the accuracy of ec measured et c fig 4 illustrates the average daily et c values estimated from three models plotted against the ec measured et c values the airborne derived et c estimates were consistent with the ec observed values with an rmse of 0 64 mm day for pytseb 1 06 mm day for pysebal and 0 65 mm day for pymetric fig 4 the nrmse values for the three models range from 0 10 to 0 16 with all three models exhibited a positive bias in prediction the correlation between the three models and the ec data was strong with r2 values of 0 82 for pytseb 0 80 for pysebal and 0 84 for pymetric for the all airborne survey dates respectively fig 4 3 4 spatial variability in turbulent latent heat fluxes over almond orchards information from high resolution spatially distributed evapotranspiration or latent heat flux maps for each block is essential to understand the water use patterns over the whole orchard for supporting precision irrigation management the spatial distribution of 11 le maps at 0 5 m spatial resolution computed using pytseb pymetric and pysebal are shown in fig 4a c respectively the high resolution imagery reveals small scale variability of latent heat fluxes within each orchard all the plots exhibited similar spatial distribution patterns of le from the three models the lowest le values were observed from all three models over the non vegetated areas under the high voltage electrical lines as well as the small strips to the right of the study area while the rest of the orchard showed higher values along with variability in some orchards that could be attributed to soil heterogeneity and differences in water use of the various almond varieties due to differences in canopy size to protect the almonds from pests during hull split chemical sprays were applied between 14 july to 22 july 2020 the chemical application during hull split did not affect the le values for further dates i e from 22 to 25 july 2020 the low le values were predicted by all three models for the data obtained during the flight time of 15 44 on 22 july 2020 this might be due to lower evaporative demand on that day as a result the photosynthesis rate from the trees was minimal leading to less transpiration owing to less solar radiation and surface temperature due to the two irrigation events on 10 july and 24 july 2020 the le values exhibited much uniformity over the entire orchard during the days of 11 13 and 14 july and 25 july 2020 with the only exception of 12 july wherein unexpectedly all three models exhibited a different behavior compared to their performance during the aforementioned dates this might be due to flight or sensor error as the lst also showed the higher values on this day leading to erroneous results from all three models fig 2 4 discussion overall the three models produced similar performance when used with high spatial resolution imagery among these three models the pytseb incorporates the biophysical processes that most approximate to actual field conditions compared to pysebal and pymetric models while all three models provided good results in terms of estimating instantaneous energy fluxes the pytseb model slightly outperformed the two one source modeling techniques in general one source energy balance models combine the soil vegetation components into a single source french et al 2015 but for almonds orchards the surface is heterogeneous and contains a mixture of soil and vegetation having different temperatures and resistances to energy exchange therefore in heterogenous vegetation surfaces such as almond orchards one source models might have uncertainty in their estimation of surface energy fluxes song et al 2015 it may be the reason the latent and sensible heat fluxes are somewhat over and underestimated by the single source models in this study some studies have attempted to address this issue by performing thermal sharpening using high resolution multispectral imagery bisquert et al 2016 xue et al 2020a 2020b the aerial lst images showed separately the bare soil and a canopy of almonds orchards the one source models treated these as single components while the pytseb model considered these components separately as evaporation from the soil row and transpiration from the tree canopies hence the le flux variability from the three models had some deviations under dry conditions the le values modeled by pytseb were low while they were higher for pymetric and pysebal models fig 5a c this shows that the crop height canopy cover and crop structure influenced the final energy balance components for the pysebal and pymetric models the pattern of agreement with the observations were very similar showing the same tendency for over or underestimation for the eleven dates this can be explained by the fact that pysebal and pymetric use a similar approach to estimate sensible heat flux component of the energy balance in form of a linear relation between near surface air temperature and land surface temperature using two cold and hot pixels zamani losgedaragh and rahimzadegan 2018 generally the tseb model was found to better reproduce the variability in observed le h and rn values compared to the one source models previous studies have shown that flux estimates from the tseb sebal and metric models have performed similarly to reproduce the measured fluxes from ec systems in different environments and crop types using a modified sebal montibeller 2017 estimated the le h and rn in corn and soybean with an rmse of 2 67 8 84 and 6 09 w m 2 in comparison to the current study pymetric rmse of 58 28 and 35 w m 2 these values are quite high this is probably due to the fact orchards have more heterogenous canopies compared the canopy of a field crop at full cover for the three year study period from 2017 to 2019 sánchez et al 2021 found average rmse for le h and rn in young almond orchards in spain using the tseb model were 44 32 and 35 w m 2 respectively in the case of pytseb model estimations these results are in close agreement with those of the current study the results of nieto et al 2019 showed that the rmse values for estimation of le h and rn in vineyards in california were 75 78 and 17 w m 2 respectively in these latent and sensible heat fluxes are slightly higher than the current study according to the results from a comparative study by brenner et al 2018 in which they compared tseb and dtd models utilizing high resolution images in grasslands the rmse for estimation of h and le was 49 w m 2 and for rn it was 17 w m 2 the current study on the other hand demonstrates that the rmse for rn was high at 34 w m 2 but lower for h and le at 29 and 38 w m 2 respectively using the tseb model hoffmann et al 2015 demonstrated that the rmse for le h and rn were 94 85 and 44 w m 2 for barley fields in comparison to the current study these results are considerably higher and also higher than those reported by sebal montibeller 2017 in field crops the fact that barley and grass fields are homogeneous crops with short canopies contrary to almonds in the current study would be expected to have smaller errors an intercomparison of output from eddy covariance and the three models reveals that lst meteorological and fraction cover are the main drivers influencing the performance from the pytseb model while pymetric and pysebal required representative hot and wet end member pixels within the scene to define model parameters the spatial variability within the rows of the almond orchards was very clear within the images from all three models each row had a different almond variety and a slight deviation in the canopy size the high resolution of 0 5 m maps in fig 5a b from the three models show similar spatial distribution of le in the entire orchard but the pytseb model produced different spatial variations in le especially when the soil was dry on 22 june 6 july and10 july 2020 compared to the one source models the results also indicate that although sebal and metric were originally developed to work with large satellite imagery they produce acceptable performance when used with high resolution imagery in this study we made a slight modification in the pysebal algorithm by changing default pixel size from 30 m to higher resolutions 5 conclusions one source pysebal and pymetric and two source pytseb energy balance models were compared to measured turbulent fluxes from eddy covariance over an almond orchard during the hull split period using high resolution imagery from an aircraft with the goal to determine their performance and accuracy the pytseb model produced satisfactory estimates of instantaneous latent and sensible heat fluxes for all the flight dates while pysebal and pymetric models output of le and h were over and underestimated for all the flight dates respectively the findings reveal that all three models are capable of accurately capturing the variation in observed daily et c with r2 values ranging from 0 80 to 0 84 overall the pytseb model outperformed the pymetric and pysebal models in estimating instantaneous latent heat flux with an r2 of 0 89 and an rmse of 38 w m 2 whereas the pymetric has an r2 of 0 81 and an rmse of 58 w m 2 and the pysebal has an r2 of 0 81 and an rmse of 54 w m 2 the daily et c and latent heat flux values for all three models were substantially overestimated compared to observed values all three models were able to produce maps of high resolution spatial patterns of le in almond orchards that were mostly similar and showed systematic patterns due to irrigation no effect of hull split was observed on the daily variation in spatial le over the almond orchards demonstrating the suitability of using models in conjunction with high resolution aerial imagery for optimizing irrigation decision making as a result of this research it was demonstrated that it is possible to reliably map le using high spatial resolution aerial imagery using one and two source energy balance models originally developed for satellite remote sensing to support precision irrigation management in orchards nevertheless future research should be focused on validating the approach of using energy balance models originally developed for coarse resolution satellite imagery with high spatial resolution aerial imagery in various crops this would enhance our understanding of the implications of the assumptions in these

9458,declining water tables and shrinking irrigation supply are two major challenges for agricultural production that increase production costs of high delta crops in pakistan crop producers may tackle these threats by optimizing the use of available resources to devise policies for improved resource use and cost reduction assessing current efficiency levels and their determinants can provide useful information this research assessed the technical allocative and groundwater irrigation efficiency of smallholder sugarcane farms in faisalabad pakistan using primary data for 56 tubewell solo owners 37 tubewell shareholders and 47 water buyers and applying the data envelopment analysis technique the factor affecting the allocative efficiency were explored using the tobit regression we found that the groundwater irrigation efficiency ranged from 92 for the solo owners 92 for shareholders and to 83 for water buyers on average technical efficiency at sugarcane farms was more than 90 solo owners shareholders and water buyers achieved only 40 28 and 37 of allocative efficiency respectively by improving the allocative efficiency through optimal allocation of inputs farms can considerably decrease their costs for a given output level the allocative efficiency was negatively associated with farmers age farm size tubewell depth discharge rate and salinity in groundwater our findings imply that sugarcane farms can substantially reduce their production costs by installing smaller tubewells that match their crop irrigation requirement and groundwater depth further improving the allocative efficiency of relatively large sugarcane farms monitoring and regulating groundwater extraction to prevent further increase in groundwater and irrigation and soil management practices to reduce salinity can improve the efficiency keywords allocative efficiency sugarcane data envelopment analysis dea tubewell groundwater data availability the data and all materials used in this study will be available upon request to the corresponding author 1 introduction sugarcane is one of the world s most important crops which provides raw materials for sugar products and biofuels among other things ali and jan 2017 farooq and gheewala 2019 it is grown in 107 countries worldwide farooq and gheewala 2019 on 20 42 million hectares m ha of cropland and its total production is 1333 million tonnes chaibandit et al 2017 ruan et al 2018 the global demand for sugar and high fructose corn syrup is projected to grow from 33 million tonnes to 213 million tonnes in 2027 fao and oecd 2018 to fulfil the growing demand the area sown to the sugarcane crop is likely to expand escalating pressure on natural resources such as land and water united states department of agriculture 2020 without improving productivity and profitability such expansion and intensification of sugarcane production would threaten food security and the sustainability of natural resources in rural pakistan sugarcane is a lucrative income source for smallholder farmers in 2019 20 it had a 3 1 share in the agricultural value added and a 0 6 share in the gross domestic product government of pakistan 2020 it is a primary source of raw materials for the sugar industry rehman et al 2015 williams and shafiq ur rehman 2018 and its by products are used for chipboards and biofuels azam and khan 2010 despite its economic importance sugarcane is a high delta crop that consumes up to 10 3 of the total irrigation water supply from canal and groundwater sources government of pakistan 2017 accordingly to the world wildlife fund it takes 10 gallons of water to produce one pound of cane sugar wwf 2015 the growing scarcity of canal water in pakistan pushes farms to rely more and more on groundwater irrigation zhang et al 2021 access to groundwater significantly improved the yields and helped boost agricultural development for decades nonetheless pakistani farms consume larger amounts of water for sugarcane production than the global average i e 197 cubic meters per tonne m3 tonne 1 this is responsible for the greater water deprivation potential in the indus river basin farooq and gheewala 2019 this excessive use of irrigation reduces groundwater tables and limits access to groundwater resources williams and raza 2017 affecting crop yields in pakistan watto and mugera 2014a williams and shafiq ur rehman 2018 yaseen et al 2005 pakistani farms received approximately 64 tonnes ha 1 yield in 2019 20 lower than the world averages of 80 150 tonnes ha 1 government of pakistan 2020 water scarcity affects crop yields and the costs of groundwater irrigation because farmers have to drill deeper for the use of the tubewells and require more energy to withdraw water the profit margin for irrigated sugarcane production is lower in pakistan than in many other countries due to higher costs of groundwater irrigation iqbal and iqbal 2014 naeem et al 2007 and lower yields khan et al 2006 nazir et al 2013 williams and shafiq ur rehman 2018 as the prices change farms need to adjust their input allocation accordingly to remain competitive in markets and stabilize their profit margins the combination of the continuous shortage of water supply water demand in sugarcane production and lower productivity tonne ha 1 draw attention toward the need for efficient resource use and input allocation therefore improving allocative efficiency ae at irrigated farms is indispensable for economic development in pakistan technical efficiency te of sugarcane was studied in pakistan where the mean value of te was found to be 0 96 in punjab watto and mugera 2014a using the data envelopment analysis dea and 0 84 in dera ismail district of khyber pakhtunkhwa province using the stochastic frontier analysis sfa ali et al 2013 these studies further found that age farm size tenure status experience and contact with extension workers significantly influenced the te ali et al 2013 watto and mugera 2014a nazir et al 2013 found that the cost of groundwater irrigation significantly influenced the cost of sugarcane production although te offers a clue to managerial performance of farms as to the possible reduction in inputs while keeping outputs intact or possible expansion in outputs without increasing inputs te combination of inputs may not necessarily minimize the cost of production coelli et al 2005 tang et al 2015 ae helps judge whether the farms allocate inputs in such a way that minimizes the costs however studies on ae and the effects of groundwater extraction costs on the efficiency of sugarcane production are limited in pakistan making it difficult to provide appropriate interventions that would boost crop productivity while conserving groundwater this study aims to analyze the levels of ae and groundwater irrigation efficiency gie of sugarcane production at groundwater irrigated sugarcane farms ascertain the key aspects affecting the ae and propose policy recommendations for effective use of groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 tubewell ownership and its effect on efficiency the groundwater extraction setup involves the installation of a tubewell privately on a piece of land over an aquifer a farmer is allowed to install a tubewell on a rented or owned piece of land over the aquifer to mine groundwater without any check asghar et al 2021 the only barrier to installing a tubewell is a lack of financial resources farmers without resources to install a private tubewell share a tubewell by partially paying for the capital and operational costs malik et al 2008 meinzen dick 1996 those who can neither own nor share the tubewell purchase water from nearby tubewells through informal market transactions meinzen dick 1993 these groundwater access dynamics lead to three categories of farms exclusive owners of tubewells hereinafter referred to as solo owners shareholders of tubewell hereinafter referred to as shareholders and water buyers water buyers pay for higher costs of groundwater irrigation than solo owners and shareholders asghar et al 2018 ashfaq et al 2009 watto 2015 solo owners and shareholders pay for the cost of extraction and maintenance costs while water buyers pay for an hourly fixed price of groundwater which covers the costs of extraction maintenance and the rent of resources differences in irrigation costs can affect production costs and thus the efficiency of farms bashir and khan 2005 pearson education company 2005 watto and mugera watto and mugera 2014a assessed the irrigation water efficiency of solo owners and buyers they found that the mean efficiency of the owners was 0 86 while that of the buyers was 0 72 and that tubewell ownership was the most important factor affecting the irrigation water efficiency of sugarcane farms here we hypothesize that the lack of groundwater supplies and the rising groundwater irrigation costs undesirably affect the te and ae of sugarcane farms but the effects are not uniform across the solo owners shareholders and water buyers we treat the shareholders as a separate group from the solo owners and water buyers to gain empirical evidence and insight in assessing the validity and nature of this hypothesis 2 2 concept of efficiency crop scientists and irrigation engineers measure productivity using the ratio of crop output to land or water applied these indicators do not account for the yield differences across various farms because these measures focus on one production factor and disregard differences in other inputs e g labor fertilizer and seed coelli et al 2005 crop production is an intricate process that banks on the optimal combination and timely application of various inputs instead of the quantity of a single input in contrast to the productivity of a single input te is thus a more comprehensive and reliable valuation method where multiple inputs are considered concurrently to estimate productivity and efficiency frija et al 2009 production technology determines the crop output from a unique combination of multiple production factors ali et al 2013 when a farm uses the least possible quantity of inputs to achieve a certain output level using similar production technology it becomes technically efficient farrell 1957 on the other hand ae is realized when a farm assigns inputs such that the cost of production is at its minimum for a given level of output farrell 1957 in other words te evaluates the physical aspects of production without incorporating prices of inputs and outputs whereas ae measures take market prices into the analysis input efficiency measures are further utilized groundwater use efficiency in this case to appraise a probable decrease in the specific input use without disturbing other inputs or a crop output varghese et al 2011 watto and mugera 2014b besides technical and economic efficiency environmental efficiency of farm production is another key consideration which incorporates environmental interests into the conventional productivity measures coelli et al 2007 in irrigated agricultural production quantifying trade offs between economic gains from irrigation use and its environmental and ecological demand are crucial in developing policy mechanisms for sustainable management of water resources azad and ancev 2014 overuse of groundwater irrigation causes lowering of groundwater levels leading to soil salinity and poor soil quality latif and ahmad 2009 furthermore crop and dairy production results in nitrogen pollution in water bodies greenhouse gas ghgs emissions and heavy metal accumulation in the soil skevas et al 2018 the estimation of environmental efficiency aids in reduction of these negative externalities and quantification of abatement costs adenuga et al 2019 unfortunately data limitation hampered the incorporation of environmental efficiency in the current study 2 3 data envelopment analysis dea the dea is based on the concept of relative efficiency and production possibility frontier as initially proposed by farrell farrell 1957 each unit in the dea is an individual decision making unit dmu and thus evaluated separately it can be decided whether a dmu is dea efficient according to relative efficiency values the relative efficiency value ranges from zero to one ren et al 2016 the dmu with the relative efficiency of one is the most efficient relative efficiency is modelled and assessed using two approaches parametric and non parametric approaches the sfa anwar et al 2021 and dea zhang et al 2014 are the most commonly adopted parametric and non parametric approaches respectively the dea has been used in many fields to evaluate the efficiency of dmus such as energy consumption xu et al 2020 yang and li 2017 agricultural production manjunatha et al 2011 pang et al 2016 watto and mugera 2013 teacher evaluation popović et al 2020 tourism xia et al 2018 and banking sectors zhang et al 2018 among others it assesses the relative efficiency of a group of homogeneous dmus that employ multiple inputs to produce similar output s zhang et al 2014 using the dea method the efficiency level of each dmu is optimized discretely by mono objective linear programming where input and output levels of the particular dmu are compared with that of other dmus carlucci et al 2018 as a result an efficient frontier is formulated and the dmus appearing on the frontier achieve the efficiency score of one or 100 and are considered as relatively efficient those dmus that are below the frontier are referred to as inefficient to estimate the efficiency of sugarcane producers this study applied the dea for the following reasons a priori specification of a functional form between inputs and output or distributional assumptions about the data are not required making the analysis robust to specification bias and non normality latruffe et al 2012 working with multiple inputs and outputs does not lead to aggregation bias the analysis remains intact when the measurement unit is changed watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar et al 2017 it is suitable for estimating the total factor efficiency input output efficiency and comparison among farms the weights in the dea model are not influenced by subjective factors yang and li 2017 the dea allows estimation of efficiency from both the input oriented perspective and the output oriented perspective watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar datta and thapa 2017 since our study aimed to explore possible input reduction to maintain given output levels the input oriented approach was employed another important consideration was to underpin the scale assumptions in the model i e constant returns to scale crs or variable returns to scale vrs where the latter can be either increasing or decreasing returns to scale irs or drs watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar et al 2017 there are generally a priori reasons for supposing the vrs particularly drs latruffe et al 2012 tipi et al 2009 watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar et al 2017 and hence the vrs model was employed in this paper 2 3 1 allocative efficiency ae estimation estimation of ae requires the calculation of the te and cost efficiency ce as the ae is defined as the ratio of ce to te eq 1 1 ae ce te 2 3 2 technical efficiency te estimation te was modelled and assessed by the by eq 2 given by banker et al 1984 2 min λ θ θ subject to the below constraints j 1 n λ j z ij z ik 0 j 1 n λ j w qj w qk 0 j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 where n is the number of farms making w products using z inputs z is an input matrix with i rows and n columns w is a set of products with q rows and n columns in the case of a single output w would be a row vector θ denotes te λ j is a vector of weights given to each sugarcane farm while calculating the te of the k th farm z ik is an input vector and w qk is an output vector j 1 n λ j 1 imposes the restriction that the production frontier is convex implying that te is estimated under the vrs assumption 2 3 3 cost efficiency ce ce is obtained from eq 3 3 min λ z k c k z k subject to the constraints below j 1 n λ j z ij z k 0 j 1 n λ j w qj w k 0 j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 where z k indicates the cost minimizing set of inputs and vector c k denotes the prices of inputs and outputs ce for the k th farm is calculated by dividing the minimum possible cost of production w k x k by the actual cost of production of the k th farm w k x k eq 4 4 ce w k x k w k x k all the efficiency estimates were derived using the benchmarking package in r 2 3 4 groundwater irrigation efficiency gie estimation the slack based dea method calculated input efficiency based on non radial measures solving the slack based dea equations gives efficiency scores as well as slack values which are indicators of unjustified use of an input eq 5 shows the set of equations used to calculate slack values of groundwater irrigation use in sugarcane production 5 min λ θ s s θ ε i 1 m s i q 1 s s q subject to the constraints below j 1 n λ j z ij s i θ z ik j 1 n λ j w qj s q w qk j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 where s characterizes the unwarranted quantity of a specific input and s provides the assessment of additional production that could be attained ε is a non archimedean infinitesimal that is less than any positive real number the results of this equation would infer such that a sugarcane farm is strongly efficient if θ 1 all slacks are zero and weakly efficient if θ 1 all slacks are non zero gie is assessed as described in eq 6 6 gie te v et v ot where θ is the optimal efficiency score of the dmu farm under consideration v et is the slack value of the input t and v ot is the actual quantity of input t 2 4 estimating the factors affecting the allocative efficiency ae ae scores were regressed on a given set of explanatory factors to explore factors affecting the ae scores the upper bound of ae scores was one and the lower bound was zero these types of bounded variables are called censored variables the tobit regression method is widely used to estimate parameters in a censored variable model dhungana et al 2004 frija et al 2009 kounetas et al 2011 salaisook et al 2020 wadud and white 2000 watto and mugera 2016 using the maximum likelihood estimation verbeek 2008 the tobit regression application is underpinned by the fact that efficiency scores are censored at the boundary values of one and zero the tobit regression model is characterized by eq 7 7 θ k α j j 1 n β j z j ε j θ k θ k if 0 θ k 1 0 if θ k 0 1 if θ k 1 θ k indicates the efficiency score and zj is the set of exogenous variables for j 1 n and ε j is the error term vgam package in r was used to estimate parameters of the tobit regression model 2 5 study area and sampling this research was conducted in the faisalabad district of punjab province in pakistan fig 1 source abbasi 2020 faisalabad has alluvial soil suitable for producing various crops such as wheat maize sugarcane and vegetables sugarcane is cultivated over 238 000 ha of land in faisalabad the second major sugarcane growing area in pakistan after rahim yar khan crop reporting service punjab 2015 all crop cultivation in faisalabad is dependent on irrigation water out of which 60 area was under groundwater in the cropping year 2012 13 crop reporting service punjab 2015 approximately 52 of the groundwater fed area was irrigated by shared or exclusively owned tubewells while 48 used purchased groundwater through informal markets punjab bureau of statistics 2013 faisalabad is among the leading cities in pakistan in terms of groundwater development johnson 1989 where multiple groundwater development projects were undertaken chaudhry 1990 in 2011 12 the total number of tubewells was 31 190 punjab bureau of statistics 2013 farmers apply the conventional irrigation method of flood irrigation causing over exploitation of groundwater gradually resulting in the decline of groundwater levels khaliq 2014 watto and mugera 2014a as the water intensive crop sugarcane would be the most affected by the falling water tables and increases in extraction costs faisalabad district was selected for this research because of its large area under the sugarcane crop intensive irrigation use and declining groundwater levels figs 2 4 multistage sampling was employed for the selection of sample farms first punjab province was purposively selected because it has the largest area served by groundwater irrigation from punjab province faisalabad district was chosen in the second stage as this district has well developed groundwater markets allowing access to important crop inputs the district comprises 189 village councils 1 1 the area represented by a village council comprises a large village and surrounding areas often including nearby small villages each village council is governed by a union nazim similar to a mayor with 13 elected members known as councillors government of punjab 2013 at the third stage 15 village councils were selected to study their groundwater irrigation systems there are three major groundwater irrigation systems based on tubewell ownership in faisalabad district asghar et al 2021 1 villages dominated by solo owned tubewells with a small number of water buyers and shareholders 2 villages dominated by shared tubewells without solo owned tubewells and with a small number of water buyers and 3 villages having both solo owned tubewells and water buyers in equal proportions accordingly 15 villages 2 2 there are typically 60 70 households in one village watto 2015 were randomly selected from the three types of villages five from each group further 15 households were randomly selected from each village this gave a total of 224 farms consisting of 84 solo owners 65 shareholders and 75 water buyers the sample size of the three groups was proportionate to their populace in the selected villages out of the 224 farms 140 cultivated sugarcane consisting of 56 solo owners 37 shareholders and 47 water buyers 2 6 data and variable definition the primary data were collected from sugarcane farms through a semi structured questionnaire survey to calculate te ae and gie the information was gathered on the output of sugarcane the quantity of inputs seed irrigation chemical use fertilizer labor and machine use and their respective prices data were also collected on characteristics of the households farmers farms and tubewells to assess their effects on ae inputs and output quantities were measured and evaluated in per hectare units to compare efficiency among different farm sizes input costs and output values were calculated as pakistani rupees per ha pkr ha 1 3 3 1 usd was equal to 100 pkr at the time of the field survey table 1 the farm level volume of groundwater irrigation for the sugarcane crop was approximately estimated using the model given in eq 8 eyhorn et al 2005 srivastava et al 2009 watto and mugera 2016 8 q t 129574 1 bhp d 255 5998 bhp 2 d 2 d 4 1000 where q is the total volume of groundwater irrigation m3 t is total irrigation time hours d is the depth of the bore meters d is the diameter of the suction pipe inches and bhp is the power of the engine horsepower generally the time taken to irrigate one ha ranges from 8 to 10 h after sowing weeding and ridging the first irrigation takes additional time up to 25 extra aurangzeb 2007 sugarcane is grown as an annual crop requiring up to 15 000 m3 of water in irrigated areas watto and mugera 2014a however groundwater in salinity prone areas causes damage to the crop as sugarcane is moderately sensitive to salinity simões et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 therefore farmers in the study area used less groundwater than recommended and total groundwater irrigation volume may have been lower than sugarcane irrigation volume in areas with good quality groundwater irrigation costs for water buyers were calculated by eq 9 the unit cost of groundwater irrigation for water buyers did not include the fixed cost that water vendors shouldered only buyers paid for a fixed price for the hourly purchase of groundwater 9 unit cost of groundwater irrigation for water buyers price of purchased groundwater pkr per hour total irrigation volume in m 3 per hour on the other hand the costs for solo owners and shareholders had two components fixed cost and variable cost the fixed cost of groundwater included amortized cost of a pumping setup borewell conveyance structure pump set and electricity charges and annual operation and maintenance costs the amortized costs were calculated using the process adopted by diwakara and chandrakanth diwakara and chandrakanth 2007 and patil patil 2015 10 amortized cost amortized cost of borewell amortized cost of conveyance structure amortized cost of pump set amortized cost of over ground structure operations and maintenance cost the computation of compounded costs for each component bore well pump set and conveyance structure is explained in eq 11 11 compounded cost component cost 1 i aa which is amortized separately by employing eq 12 12 amortized cost compounded investment on a compon ent 1 i aa i 1 i aa 1 where aa denotes the average age of the pump set conveyance structure and borewell the average age of borewell was calculated as 2015 year of drilling and the average age of pump set and conveyance structure was assumed to be ten years i is the discount rate considered to be 2 to reflect growth in investment in groundwater irrigation diwakara and chandrakanth 2007 patil 2015 after calculating the annual amortized cost of groundwater irrigation the fixed cost of groundwater per m3 was calculated by dividing amortized costs by the total volume of water extracted in the crop year 2014 15 the variable cost was the unit cost of electricity or fuel to pump one m3 of groundwater as per eq 13 the costs of labor hours employed for irrigation were considered together with other labor costs 13 cost of irrigation per cubic meter fixed cost per cubic meter variable cost per cubic meter farms in the study area mostly applied two types of synthetic fertilizer urea and diammonium phosphate dap dap contains 46 phosphate and 18 nitrogen meaning that one kilogram of dap contains 0 46 kg of phosphate and 0 18 kg of nitrogen rose 2004 urea contains 46 of nitrogen and no other nutrient therefore one kilogram of urea contains 0 46 kg of nitrogen rose 2004 3 results this section comprises tables and figures showing summary statistics efficiency scores the frequency distribution of te ae and gie scores and key determinants influencing the efficiency of sugarcane farms 3 1 characteristics of sugarcane farms table 2 provides background about socio economic and farm related characteristics of sampled households the water buyers were the youngest while the shareholders were the oldest farmers water buyers were more educated than solo owners and shareholders table si3 shows the t test of age education household size farm area tubewell depth and tubewell capacity with various binary variables in the supplementary information shareholders operated larger farms 7 8 ha while solo owners operated at an average of 6 5 ha and water buyers at 3 1 ha like farm size shareholders also had larger household sizes than solo owners and water buyers the mean depth and tubewell discharge rate were highest at shareholders tubewells tubewells with greater depth and flow rate required larger capital for installation and incurred higher operating expenses to provide for energy requirements larger installation and operational costs may be a key driver for joint investment in tubewells asghar et al 2018 sharing of tubewells was significantly associated with electric type tubewells table si4 solo owners tended to use diesel tubewells or tractor operated tubewells for groundwater extraction albeit not shown water buyers bought larger groundwater volumes from diesel tubewells than electric or tractor operated tubewells a larger proportion of water buyers appeared to have off farm income sources than the two other groups however the difference was statistically insignificant table si4 forty five percent of the solo owners and shareholders and 43 of the water buyers perceived that their groundwater was saline though none of them had the groundwater quality tested for its fitness for irrigation 3 2 input and output statistics this section shows the differences in the quantity of inputs cost of production and value of sugarcane output among the solo owners shareholders and water buyers table 4 these differences are the key sources of disparity in te and ae among sugarcane farms the findings show that the water buyers cultivated sugarcane on a significantly smaller area than the solo owners and shareholders while there was no significant difference in sugarcane area between the solo owners and shareholders the shareholders also applied a higher seed rate and groundwater irrigation volume than the other groups a higher seed rate led to higher seed and labor costs than the two other groups as more labor was required to plant seeds table 3 as the study highlights the groundwater irrigation efficiency use of that input and difference in volume among the groups are presented here the results point out considerable differences in the volume of groundwater irrigation among the three groups the shareholders all of whom using electric tubewells applied 5345 m3ha 1 of groundwater to irrigate the sugarcane crop the highest application rate among the three groups the solo owners applied 4755 m3ha 1 and water buyers 4293 m3ha 1 on average the difference was statistically significant between the shareholders and the two other groups however the water buyers incurred larger unit costs than the solo owners and shareholders electric tubewells ran on subsidized electricity therefore their cost of groundwater extraction was lower than that of diesel engines and tractor operated tubewells the association between the crop inputs and the output shows that groundwater irrigation seed farmyard manure phosphate nitrogen and machine hours were significantly correlated with the output table 4 labor hours had a significant and positive relationship with other inputs indicating that sugarcane is a labor intensive crop in the study area this was intuitive as most of the farms in the study area applied all inputs manually groundwater irrigation was significantly related to labor and machinery hours the correlation between input costs and total cost of production was in line with the above explained associations of input quantities table si1 in supplementary information 3 3 technical efficiency te of sugarcane farms the average te score of the solo owners was 0 94 and both shareholders and water buyers had an average of 0 96 table 5 in the sample 61 of the solo owners 68 shareholders and 70 water buyers were fully efficient te 1 indicating that sugarcane farms were largely efficient in terms of te 3 4 groundwater irrigation efficiency gie of sugarcane farms the slack based model provided the estimates of slack variables showing groundwater irrigation efficiency the results show that the average gie score for both the solo owners and shareholders was 0 92 while the water buyers operated at 0 83 it is shown that 48 of the solo owners 40 shareholders and 53 water buyers applied groundwater irrigation inefficiently gie 1 table 6 3 5 allocative efficiency ae of sugarcane farms the ae analysis revealed that the solo owners had the average ae score of 0 40 the shareholders 0 28 and the water buyers 0 37 table 7 only 1 79 of the solo owners and 2 70 of the shareholders had the ae score of one the distribution was relatively unequal for the water buyers as all of the farms exhibited scores lower than 0 90 and none of the buyers reached the 100 efficiency level 3 6 determinants of allocative efficiency ae the ae of sugarcane farms was regressed on the set of farmer and farm characteristics age of the farmer farm size tubewell depth tubewell discharge rate and salinity in groundwater had significant and negative effects on farms ae on average a one year increase in farmers age reduced ae by 0 003 keeping other variables constant for a one ha increase in farm size the ae decreased by 0 005 on average holding other variables constant likewise as the tubewell capacity increased by one m3 hour the ae decreased by 0 002 with a one meter increase in tubewell depth the ae decreased by 0 01 for farms with saline groundwater the ae decreased by 0 076 as compared to those farms with non saline groundwater table 8 4 discussions the dea based efficiency analysis found that all three groups produced sugarcane with fairly high te with no marked difference in te across the groups implying that sugarcane farms in faisalabad applied similar production technologies and the efficiency in the use of the set of inputs had almost saturated resulting in insignificant differences our finding is consistent with that of watto and mugera 2014a who revealed that solo owners and water buyers operated with 96 and 94 te in pakistani punjab respectively in contrast in india khanna 2006 found that the mean te of exclusive owners of tubewells was the highest followed by that of shareholders and water buyers the gie analysis implied that without affecting other inputs and output of sugarcane the solo owners and shareholders could reduce their use of groundwater by 8 each and the water buyers by 17 the significant differences in gie indicated that the three groundwater user groups experienced heterogeneous qualities of irrigation services during the sugarcane growing season as sugarcane stays on the field for a longer period than other major crops farms face elevated irrigation demand during sugarcane production and water buyers are exposed to more competition than tubewell owners watto and mugera 2014a which might cause over purchase of water as opposed to formal contracts or agreements groundwater transactions are informal social contracts contingent upon social ties between buyers and sellers meinzen dick 1996 yielding inequities in water allocation and distribution among buyers during peak periods unreliable groundwater supply could lead to compromised gie in the water buyers compared to the solo owners and shareholders although te was above 90 most of the sugarcane farms were far less than efficient in the case of ae the solo owners shareholders and water buyers can potentially reduce their costs by 46 48 and 47 respectively the shareholders employed more groundwater labor and seed than the solo owners and water buyers see table 4 the solo owners and shareholders used larger quantities of all inputs than the water buyers contributing to higher production costs for the two former groups these increased costs might explain the lower ae scores of the solo owners and shareholders vs the water buyers the water buyers showed the highest ae implying they were more conservative in allocating their expensive inputs the regression analysis revealed that increases in age farm size tubewell depth and size and salinity decreased the ae wadud and white 2000 showed that older farmers tended to be less efficient due to lower education less reception to new technologies and more conservative production techniques furthermore in literature smaller farms are often more profitable per unit of land while the effects of land size on te are mixed coelli et al 2002 khanna 2006 laha and kuri 2011 watto and mugera 2014a negative effects on ae were reported by various studies in developing countries bravo ureta and pinheiro 1997 mburu et al 2014 drs renders smaller farms more efficient than larger ones gilligan 1998 common in low income countries takahashi et al 2020 deeper tubewells require larger investments in drilling casings and pump sets and variable costs fuel electricity to extract groundwater are higher decreasing their ce and lowering ae literature suggests that pakistani farms tend to use tubewells of larger than the optimal capacity to draw water from the given water depth qureshi et al 2003 tubewells of larger capacity tend to suffer more operational and management problems and higher extraction costs malik and strosser 1993 strosser and kuper 1994 it is likely that the use of larger capacity tubewells decreases ae by causing energy overuse and incurring higher costs of production salinity affects soil productivity crop outputs income risk and shadow prices of water haider and hossain 2013 malik et al 2021 keeping the resource base constant the gross margin of crops could decrease by up to 40 in saline areas due to changes in input use which will result in lower profits dhehibi et al 2013 and ae 5 conclusions improving irrigated farms efficiency is vital for the development of semi arid agrarian societies such as in pakistan this study assessed the te gie and ae of sugarcane farms in punjab pakistan and investigated determinants of the ae the sugarcane farms were categorized according to groundwater irrigation access as solo owners of tubewells shareholders of tubewells and water buyers the results indicate that irrespective of the groundwater user type all sugarcane farms operated at fairly high levels of te 94 96 in the case of gie efficiency the water buyers had lower levels of efficiency than the solo owners and shareholders despite the high levels of te the ae levels were below 55 on average at the sampled farms the solo owners tended to be more allocative efficient than the water buyers and shareholders the shareholders incurred higher costs of production which may have decreased their ae these findings assert that looking at te alone may be misleading as it does not provide adequate information on the other aspects of farm efficiency the differential ae across the water user groups suggests that policy interventions for improving the ae at sugarcane farms should pay attention to the differences in farm tubewell ownership and groundwater rights the regression results imply that farmers age farm size tubewell depth discharge rate and salinity negatively affected the ae therefore it is recommended that the on farm water management department and private drilling services provide farms with technical support and consultation on tubewell selection appropriate tubewell discharge size and economics of groundwater extraction to minimize the cost of groundwater irrigation policies for reducing land fragmentation and monitoring and regulating groundwater extraction to prevent further increases in groundwater depth would improve the ae of sugarcane production irrigation and soil management practices such as lime and gypsum conjunctive use of good quality canal irrigation with saline groundwater irrigation could also improve the ae the study has potential limitations first although the sample farms were carefully selected to capture variations in ownership of tubewells the efficiency analysis was conducted on the relatively small sample second although the study could have provided more insights into trends in efficiency time constraints presented a hurdle in collecting data across consecutive time periods third in assessing water efficiency the environmental component should also be incorporated into the calculation of allocative efficiency given potential negative environmental effects of water run off water wastage and pollution see the problem of salination mentioned earlier to study this the dea should be extended by incorporating environmental efficiency scores whereby the material balance condition should be respected see coelli et al 2007 however for such exercise data on water run off water wastage and eventually salination levels should be available which was not the case and thus disabled the incorporation of environmental efficiency into our ae estimation funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies

9458,declining water tables and shrinking irrigation supply are two major challenges for agricultural production that increase production costs of high delta crops in pakistan crop producers may tackle these threats by optimizing the use of available resources to devise policies for improved resource use and cost reduction assessing current efficiency levels and their determinants can provide useful information this research assessed the technical allocative and groundwater irrigation efficiency of smallholder sugarcane farms in faisalabad pakistan using primary data for 56 tubewell solo owners 37 tubewell shareholders and 47 water buyers and applying the data envelopment analysis technique the factor affecting the allocative efficiency were explored using the tobit regression we found that the groundwater irrigation efficiency ranged from 92 for the solo owners 92 for shareholders and to 83 for water buyers on average technical efficiency at sugarcane farms was more than 90 solo owners shareholders and water buyers achieved only 40 28 and 37 of allocative efficiency respectively by improving the allocative efficiency through optimal allocation of inputs farms can considerably decrease their costs for a given output level the allocative efficiency was negatively associated with farmers age farm size tubewell depth discharge rate and salinity in groundwater our findings imply that sugarcane farms can substantially reduce their production costs by installing smaller tubewells that match their crop irrigation requirement and groundwater depth further improving the allocative efficiency of relatively large sugarcane farms monitoring and regulating groundwater extraction to prevent further increase in groundwater and irrigation and soil management practices to reduce salinity can improve the efficiency keywords allocative efficiency sugarcane data envelopment analysis dea tubewell groundwater data availability the data and all materials used in this study will be available upon request to the corresponding author 1 introduction sugarcane is one of the world s most important crops which provides raw materials for sugar products and biofuels among other things ali and jan 2017 farooq and gheewala 2019 it is grown in 107 countries worldwide farooq and gheewala 2019 on 20 42 million hectares m ha of cropland and its total production is 1333 million tonnes chaibandit et al 2017 ruan et al 2018 the global demand for sugar and high fructose corn syrup is projected to grow from 33 million tonnes to 213 million tonnes in 2027 fao and oecd 2018 to fulfil the growing demand the area sown to the sugarcane crop is likely to expand escalating pressure on natural resources such as land and water united states department of agriculture 2020 without improving productivity and profitability such expansion and intensification of sugarcane production would threaten food security and the sustainability of natural resources in rural pakistan sugarcane is a lucrative income source for smallholder farmers in 2019 20 it had a 3 1 share in the agricultural value added and a 0 6 share in the gross domestic product government of pakistan 2020 it is a primary source of raw materials for the sugar industry rehman et al 2015 williams and shafiq ur rehman 2018 and its by products are used for chipboards and biofuels azam and khan 2010 despite its economic importance sugarcane is a high delta crop that consumes up to 10 3 of the total irrigation water supply from canal and groundwater sources government of pakistan 2017 accordingly to the world wildlife fund it takes 10 gallons of water to produce one pound of cane sugar wwf 2015 the growing scarcity of canal water in pakistan pushes farms to rely more and more on groundwater irrigation zhang et al 2021 access to groundwater significantly improved the yields and helped boost agricultural development for decades nonetheless pakistani farms consume larger amounts of water for sugarcane production than the global average i e 197 cubic meters per tonne m3 tonne 1 this is responsible for the greater water deprivation potential in the indus river basin farooq and gheewala 2019 this excessive use of irrigation reduces groundwater tables and limits access to groundwater resources williams and raza 2017 affecting crop yields in pakistan watto and mugera 2014a williams and shafiq ur rehman 2018 yaseen et al 2005 pakistani farms received approximately 64 tonnes ha 1 yield in 2019 20 lower than the world averages of 80 150 tonnes ha 1 government of pakistan 2020 water scarcity affects crop yields and the costs of groundwater irrigation because farmers have to drill deeper for the use of the tubewells and require more energy to withdraw water the profit margin for irrigated sugarcane production is lower in pakistan than in many other countries due to higher costs of groundwater irrigation iqbal and iqbal 2014 naeem et al 2007 and lower yields khan et al 2006 nazir et al 2013 williams and shafiq ur rehman 2018 as the prices change farms need to adjust their input allocation accordingly to remain competitive in markets and stabilize their profit margins the combination of the continuous shortage of water supply water demand in sugarcane production and lower productivity tonne ha 1 draw attention toward the need for efficient resource use and input allocation therefore improving allocative efficiency ae at irrigated farms is indispensable for economic development in pakistan technical efficiency te of sugarcane was studied in pakistan where the mean value of te was found to be 0 96 in punjab watto and mugera 2014a using the data envelopment analysis dea and 0 84 in dera ismail district of khyber pakhtunkhwa province using the stochastic frontier analysis sfa ali et al 2013 these studies further found that age farm size tenure status experience and contact with extension workers significantly influenced the te ali et al 2013 watto and mugera 2014a nazir et al 2013 found that the cost of groundwater irrigation significantly influenced the cost of sugarcane production although te offers a clue to managerial performance of farms as to the possible reduction in inputs while keeping outputs intact or possible expansion in outputs without increasing inputs te combination of inputs may not necessarily minimize the cost of production coelli et al 2005 tang et al 2015 ae helps judge whether the farms allocate inputs in such a way that minimizes the costs however studies on ae and the effects of groundwater extraction costs on the efficiency of sugarcane production are limited in pakistan making it difficult to provide appropriate interventions that would boost crop productivity while conserving groundwater this study aims to analyze the levels of ae and groundwater irrigation efficiency gie of sugarcane production at groundwater irrigated sugarcane farms ascertain the key aspects affecting the ae and propose policy recommendations for effective use of groundwater 2 methodology 2 1 tubewell ownership and its effect on efficiency the groundwater extraction setup involves the installation of a tubewell privately on a piece of land over an aquifer a farmer is allowed to install a tubewell on a rented or owned piece of land over the aquifer to mine groundwater without any check asghar et al 2021 the only barrier to installing a tubewell is a lack of financial resources farmers without resources to install a private tubewell share a tubewell by partially paying for the capital and operational costs malik et al 2008 meinzen dick 1996 those who can neither own nor share the tubewell purchase water from nearby tubewells through informal market transactions meinzen dick 1993 these groundwater access dynamics lead to three categories of farms exclusive owners of tubewells hereinafter referred to as solo owners shareholders of tubewell hereinafter referred to as shareholders and water buyers water buyers pay for higher costs of groundwater irrigation than solo owners and shareholders asghar et al 2018 ashfaq et al 2009 watto 2015 solo owners and shareholders pay for the cost of extraction and maintenance costs while water buyers pay for an hourly fixed price of groundwater which covers the costs of extraction maintenance and the rent of resources differences in irrigation costs can affect production costs and thus the efficiency of farms bashir and khan 2005 pearson education company 2005 watto and mugera watto and mugera 2014a assessed the irrigation water efficiency of solo owners and buyers they found that the mean efficiency of the owners was 0 86 while that of the buyers was 0 72 and that tubewell ownership was the most important factor affecting the irrigation water efficiency of sugarcane farms here we hypothesize that the lack of groundwater supplies and the rising groundwater irrigation costs undesirably affect the te and ae of sugarcane farms but the effects are not uniform across the solo owners shareholders and water buyers we treat the shareholders as a separate group from the solo owners and water buyers to gain empirical evidence and insight in assessing the validity and nature of this hypothesis 2 2 concept of efficiency crop scientists and irrigation engineers measure productivity using the ratio of crop output to land or water applied these indicators do not account for the yield differences across various farms because these measures focus on one production factor and disregard differences in other inputs e g labor fertilizer and seed coelli et al 2005 crop production is an intricate process that banks on the optimal combination and timely application of various inputs instead of the quantity of a single input in contrast to the productivity of a single input te is thus a more comprehensive and reliable valuation method where multiple inputs are considered concurrently to estimate productivity and efficiency frija et al 2009 production technology determines the crop output from a unique combination of multiple production factors ali et al 2013 when a farm uses the least possible quantity of inputs to achieve a certain output level using similar production technology it becomes technically efficient farrell 1957 on the other hand ae is realized when a farm assigns inputs such that the cost of production is at its minimum for a given level of output farrell 1957 in other words te evaluates the physical aspects of production without incorporating prices of inputs and outputs whereas ae measures take market prices into the analysis input efficiency measures are further utilized groundwater use efficiency in this case to appraise a probable decrease in the specific input use without disturbing other inputs or a crop output varghese et al 2011 watto and mugera 2014b besides technical and economic efficiency environmental efficiency of farm production is another key consideration which incorporates environmental interests into the conventional productivity measures coelli et al 2007 in irrigated agricultural production quantifying trade offs between economic gains from irrigation use and its environmental and ecological demand are crucial in developing policy mechanisms for sustainable management of water resources azad and ancev 2014 overuse of groundwater irrigation causes lowering of groundwater levels leading to soil salinity and poor soil quality latif and ahmad 2009 furthermore crop and dairy production results in nitrogen pollution in water bodies greenhouse gas ghgs emissions and heavy metal accumulation in the soil skevas et al 2018 the estimation of environmental efficiency aids in reduction of these negative externalities and quantification of abatement costs adenuga et al 2019 unfortunately data limitation hampered the incorporation of environmental efficiency in the current study 2 3 data envelopment analysis dea the dea is based on the concept of relative efficiency and production possibility frontier as initially proposed by farrell farrell 1957 each unit in the dea is an individual decision making unit dmu and thus evaluated separately it can be decided whether a dmu is dea efficient according to relative efficiency values the relative efficiency value ranges from zero to one ren et al 2016 the dmu with the relative efficiency of one is the most efficient relative efficiency is modelled and assessed using two approaches parametric and non parametric approaches the sfa anwar et al 2021 and dea zhang et al 2014 are the most commonly adopted parametric and non parametric approaches respectively the dea has been used in many fields to evaluate the efficiency of dmus such as energy consumption xu et al 2020 yang and li 2017 agricultural production manjunatha et al 2011 pang et al 2016 watto and mugera 2013 teacher evaluation popović et al 2020 tourism xia et al 2018 and banking sectors zhang et al 2018 among others it assesses the relative efficiency of a group of homogeneous dmus that employ multiple inputs to produce similar output s zhang et al 2014 using the dea method the efficiency level of each dmu is optimized discretely by mono objective linear programming where input and output levels of the particular dmu are compared with that of other dmus carlucci et al 2018 as a result an efficient frontier is formulated and the dmus appearing on the frontier achieve the efficiency score of one or 100 and are considered as relatively efficient those dmus that are below the frontier are referred to as inefficient to estimate the efficiency of sugarcane producers this study applied the dea for the following reasons a priori specification of a functional form between inputs and output or distributional assumptions about the data are not required making the analysis robust to specification bias and non normality latruffe et al 2012 working with multiple inputs and outputs does not lead to aggregation bias the analysis remains intact when the measurement unit is changed watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar et al 2017 it is suitable for estimating the total factor efficiency input output efficiency and comparison among farms the weights in the dea model are not influenced by subjective factors yang and li 2017 the dea allows estimation of efficiency from both the input oriented perspective and the output oriented perspective watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar datta and thapa 2017 since our study aimed to explore possible input reduction to maintain given output levels the input oriented approach was employed another important consideration was to underpin the scale assumptions in the model i e constant returns to scale crs or variable returns to scale vrs where the latter can be either increasing or decreasing returns to scale irs or drs watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar et al 2017 there are generally a priori reasons for supposing the vrs particularly drs latruffe et al 2012 tipi et al 2009 watto and mugera 2013 zulfiqar et al 2017 and hence the vrs model was employed in this paper 2 3 1 allocative efficiency ae estimation estimation of ae requires the calculation of the te and cost efficiency ce as the ae is defined as the ratio of ce to te eq 1 1 ae ce te 2 3 2 technical efficiency te estimation te was modelled and assessed by the by eq 2 given by banker et al 1984 2 min λ θ θ subject to the below constraints j 1 n λ j z ij z ik 0 j 1 n λ j w qj w qk 0 j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 where n is the number of farms making w products using z inputs z is an input matrix with i rows and n columns w is a set of products with q rows and n columns in the case of a single output w would be a row vector θ denotes te λ j is a vector of weights given to each sugarcane farm while calculating the te of the k th farm z ik is an input vector and w qk is an output vector j 1 n λ j 1 imposes the restriction that the production frontier is convex implying that te is estimated under the vrs assumption 2 3 3 cost efficiency ce ce is obtained from eq 3 3 min λ z k c k z k subject to the constraints below j 1 n λ j z ij z k 0 j 1 n λ j w qj w k 0 j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 where z k indicates the cost minimizing set of inputs and vector c k denotes the prices of inputs and outputs ce for the k th farm is calculated by dividing the minimum possible cost of production w k x k by the actual cost of production of the k th farm w k x k eq 4 4 ce w k x k w k x k all the efficiency estimates were derived using the benchmarking package in r 2 3 4 groundwater irrigation efficiency gie estimation the slack based dea method calculated input efficiency based on non radial measures solving the slack based dea equations gives efficiency scores as well as slack values which are indicators of unjustified use of an input eq 5 shows the set of equations used to calculate slack values of groundwater irrigation use in sugarcane production 5 min λ θ s s θ ε i 1 m s i q 1 s s q subject to the constraints below j 1 n λ j z ij s i θ z ik j 1 n λ j w qj s q w qk j 1 n λ j 1 λ j 0 where s characterizes the unwarranted quantity of a specific input and s provides the assessment of additional production that could be attained ε is a non archimedean infinitesimal that is less than any positive real number the results of this equation would infer such that a sugarcane farm is strongly efficient if θ 1 all slacks are zero and weakly efficient if θ 1 all slacks are non zero gie is assessed as described in eq 6 6 gie te v et v ot where θ is the optimal efficiency score of the dmu farm under consideration v et is the slack value of the input t and v ot is the actual quantity of input t 2 4 estimating the factors affecting the allocative efficiency ae ae scores were regressed on a given set of explanatory factors to explore factors affecting the ae scores the upper bound of ae scores was one and the lower bound was zero these types of bounded variables are called censored variables the tobit regression method is widely used to estimate parameters in a censored variable model dhungana et al 2004 frija et al 2009 kounetas et al 2011 salaisook et al 2020 wadud and white 2000 watto and mugera 2016 using the maximum likelihood estimation verbeek 2008 the tobit regression application is underpinned by the fact that efficiency scores are censored at the boundary values of one and zero the tobit regression model is characterized by eq 7 7 θ k α j j 1 n β j z j ε j θ k θ k if 0 θ k 1 0 if θ k 0 1 if θ k 1 θ k indicates the efficiency score and zj is the set of exogenous variables for j 1 n and ε j is the error term vgam package in r was used to estimate parameters of the tobit regression model 2 5 study area and sampling this research was conducted in the faisalabad district of punjab province in pakistan fig 1 source abbasi 2020 faisalabad has alluvial soil suitable for producing various crops such as wheat maize sugarcane and vegetables sugarcane is cultivated over 238 000 ha of land in faisalabad the second major sugarcane growing area in pakistan after rahim yar khan crop reporting service punjab 2015 all crop cultivation in faisalabad is dependent on irrigation water out of which 60 area was under groundwater in the cropping year 2012 13 crop reporting service punjab 2015 approximately 52 of the groundwater fed area was irrigated by shared or exclusively owned tubewells while 48 used purchased groundwater through informal markets punjab bureau of statistics 2013 faisalabad is among the leading cities in pakistan in terms of groundwater development johnson 1989 where multiple groundwater development projects were undertaken chaudhry 1990 in 2011 12 the total number of tubewells was 31 190 punjab bureau of statistics 2013 farmers apply the conventional irrigation method of flood irrigation causing over exploitation of groundwater gradually resulting in the decline of groundwater levels khaliq 2014 watto and mugera 2014a as the water intensive crop sugarcane would be the most affected by the falling water tables and increases in extraction costs faisalabad district was selected for this research because of its large area under the sugarcane crop intensive irrigation use and declining groundwater levels figs 2 4 multistage sampling was employed for the selection of sample farms first punjab province was purposively selected because it has the largest area served by groundwater irrigation from punjab province faisalabad district was chosen in the second stage as this district has well developed groundwater markets allowing access to important crop inputs the district comprises 189 village councils 1 1 the area represented by a village council comprises a large village and surrounding areas often including nearby small villages each village council is governed by a union nazim similar to a mayor with 13 elected members known as councillors government of punjab 2013 at the third stage 15 village councils were selected to study their groundwater irrigation systems there are three major groundwater irrigation systems based on tubewell ownership in faisalabad district asghar et al 2021 1 villages dominated by solo owned tubewells with a small number of water buyers and shareholders 2 villages dominated by shared tubewells without solo owned tubewells and with a small number of water buyers and 3 villages having both solo owned tubewells and water buyers in equal proportions accordingly 15 villages 2 2 there are typically 60 70 households in one village watto 2015 were randomly selected from the three types of villages five from each group further 15 households were randomly selected from each village this gave a total of 224 farms consisting of 84 solo owners 65 shareholders and 75 water buyers the sample size of the three groups was proportionate to their populace in the selected villages out of the 224 farms 140 cultivated sugarcane consisting of 56 solo owners 37 shareholders and 47 water buyers 2 6 data and variable definition the primary data were collected from sugarcane farms through a semi structured questionnaire survey to calculate te ae and gie the information was gathered on the output of sugarcane the quantity of inputs seed irrigation chemical use fertilizer labor and machine use and their respective prices data were also collected on characteristics of the households farmers farms and tubewells to assess their effects on ae inputs and output quantities were measured and evaluated in per hectare units to compare efficiency among different farm sizes input costs and output values were calculated as pakistani rupees per ha pkr ha 1 3 3 1 usd was equal to 100 pkr at the time of the field survey table 1 the farm level volume of groundwater irrigation for the sugarcane crop was approximately estimated using the model given in eq 8 eyhorn et al 2005 srivastava et al 2009 watto and mugera 2016 8 q t 129574 1 bhp d 255 5998 bhp 2 d 2 d 4 1000 where q is the total volume of groundwater irrigation m3 t is total irrigation time hours d is the depth of the bore meters d is the diameter of the suction pipe inches and bhp is the power of the engine horsepower generally the time taken to irrigate one ha ranges from 8 to 10 h after sowing weeding and ridging the first irrigation takes additional time up to 25 extra aurangzeb 2007 sugarcane is grown as an annual crop requiring up to 15 000 m3 of water in irrigated areas watto and mugera 2014a however groundwater in salinity prone areas causes damage to the crop as sugarcane is moderately sensitive to salinity simões et al 2016 zhao et al 2020 therefore farmers in the study area used less groundwater than recommended and total groundwater irrigation volume may have been lower than sugarcane irrigation volume in areas with good quality groundwater irrigation costs for water buyers were calculated by eq 9 the unit cost of groundwater irrigation for water buyers did not include the fixed cost that water vendors shouldered only buyers paid for a fixed price for the hourly purchase of groundwater 9 unit cost of groundwater irrigation for water buyers price of purchased groundwater pkr per hour total irrigation volume in m 3 per hour on the other hand the costs for solo owners and shareholders had two components fixed cost and variable cost the fixed cost of groundwater included amortized cost of a pumping setup borewell conveyance structure pump set and electricity charges and annual operation and maintenance costs the amortized costs were calculated using the process adopted by diwakara and chandrakanth diwakara and chandrakanth 2007 and patil patil 2015 10 amortized cost amortized cost of borewell amortized cost of conveyance structure amortized cost of pump set amortized cost of over ground structure operations and maintenance cost the computation of compounded costs for each component bore well pump set and conveyance structure is explained in eq 11 11 compounded cost component cost 1 i aa which is amortized separately by employing eq 12 12 amortized cost compounded investment on a compon ent 1 i aa i 1 i aa 1 where aa denotes the average age of the pump set conveyance structure and borewell the average age of borewell was calculated as 2015 year of drilling and the average age of pump set and conveyance structure was assumed to be ten years i is the discount rate considered to be 2 to reflect growth in investment in groundwater irrigation diwakara and chandrakanth 2007 patil 2015 after calculating the annual amortized cost of groundwater irrigation the fixed cost of groundwater per m3 was calculated by dividing amortized costs by the total volume of water extracted in the crop year 2014 15 the variable cost was the unit cost of electricity or fuel to pump one m3 of groundwater as per eq 13 the costs of labor hours employed for irrigation were considered together with other labor costs 13 cost of irrigation per cubic meter fixed cost per cubic meter variable cost per cubic meter farms in the study area mostly applied two types of synthetic fertilizer urea and diammonium phosphate dap dap contains 46 phosphate and 18 nitrogen meaning that one kilogram of dap contains 0 46 kg of phosphate and 0 18 kg of nitrogen rose 2004 urea contains 46 of nitrogen and no other nutrient therefore one kilogram of urea contains 0 46 kg of nitrogen rose 2004 3 results this section comprises tables and figures showing summary statistics efficiency scores the frequency distribution of te ae and gie scores and key determinants influencing the efficiency of sugarcane farms 3 1 characteristics of sugarcane farms table 2 provides background about socio economic and farm related characteristics of sampled households the water buyers were the youngest while the shareholders were the oldest farmers water buyers were more educated than solo owners and shareholders table si3 shows the t test of age education household size farm area tubewell depth and tubewell capacity with various binary variables in the supplementary information shareholders operated larger farms 7 8 ha while solo owners operated at an average of 6 5 ha and water buyers at 3 1 ha like farm size shareholders also had larger household sizes than solo owners and water buyers the mean depth and tubewell discharge rate were highest at shareholders tubewells tubewells with greater depth and flow rate required larger capital for installation and incurred higher operating expenses to provide for energy requirements larger installation and operational costs may be a key driver for joint investment in tubewells asghar et al 2018 sharing of tubewells was significantly associated with electric type tubewells table si4 solo owners tended to use diesel tubewells or tractor operated tubewells for groundwater extraction albeit not shown water buyers bought larger groundwater volumes from diesel tubewells than electric or tractor operated tubewells a larger proportion of water buyers appeared to have off farm income sources than the two other groups however the difference was statistically insignificant table si4 forty five percent of the solo owners and shareholders and 43 of the water buyers perceived that their groundwater was saline though none of them had the groundwater quality tested for its fitness for irrigation 3 2 input and output statistics this section shows the differences in the quantity of inputs cost of production and value of sugarcane output among the solo owners shareholders and water buyers table 4 these differences are the key sources of disparity in te and ae among sugarcane farms the findings show that the water buyers cultivated sugarcane on a significantly smaller area than the solo owners and shareholders while there was no significant difference in sugarcane area between the solo owners and shareholders the shareholders also applied a higher seed rate and groundwater irrigation volume than the other groups a higher seed rate led to higher seed and labor costs than the two other groups as more labor was required to plant seeds table 3 as the study highlights the groundwater irrigation efficiency use of that input and difference in volume among the groups are presented here the results point out considerable differences in the volume of groundwater irrigation among the three groups the shareholders all of whom using electric tubewells applied 5345 m3ha 1 of groundwater to irrigate the sugarcane crop the highest application rate among the three groups the solo owners applied 4755 m3ha 1 and water buyers 4293 m3ha 1 on average the difference was statistically significant between the shareholders and the two other groups however the water buyers incurred larger unit costs than the solo owners and shareholders electric tubewells ran on subsidized electricity therefore their cost of groundwater extraction was lower than that of diesel engines and tractor operated tubewells the association between the crop inputs and the output shows that groundwater irrigation seed farmyard manure phosphate nitrogen and machine hours were significantly correlated with the output table 4 labor hours had a significant and positive relationship with other inputs indicating that sugarcane is a labor intensive crop in the study area this was intuitive as most of the farms in the study area applied all inputs manually groundwater irrigation was significantly related to labor and machinery hours the correlation between input costs and total cost of production was in line with the above explained associations of input quantities table si1 in supplementary information 3 3 technical efficiency te of sugarcane farms the average te score of the solo owners was 0 94 and both shareholders and water buyers had an average of 0 96 table 5 in the sample 61 of the solo owners 68 shareholders and 70 water buyers were fully efficient te 1 indicating that sugarcane farms were largely efficient in terms of te 3 4 groundwater irrigation efficiency gie of sugarcane farms the slack based model provided the estimates of slack variables showing groundwater irrigation efficiency the results show that the average gie score for both the solo owners and shareholders was 0 92 while the water buyers operated at 0 83 it is shown that 48 of the solo owners 40 shareholders and 53 water buyers applied groundwater irrigation inefficiently gie 1 table 6 3 5 allocative efficiency ae of sugarcane farms the ae analysis revealed that the solo owners had the average ae score of 0 40 the shareholders 0 28 and the water buyers 0 37 table 7 only 1 79 of the solo owners and 2 70 of the shareholders had the ae score of one the distribution was relatively unequal for the water buyers as all of the farms exhibited scores lower than 0 90 and none of the buyers reached the 100 efficiency level 3 6 determinants of allocative efficiency ae the ae of sugarcane farms was regressed on the set of farmer and farm characteristics age of the farmer farm size tubewell depth tubewell discharge rate and salinity in groundwater had significant and negative effects on farms ae on average a one year increase in farmers age reduced ae by 0 003 keeping other variables constant for a one ha increase in farm size the ae decreased by 0 005 on average holding other variables constant likewise as the tubewell capacity increased by one m3 hour the ae decreased by 0 002 with a one meter increase in tubewell depth the ae decreased by 0 01 for farms with saline groundwater the ae decreased by 0 076 as compared to those farms with non saline groundwater table 8 4 discussions the dea based efficiency analysis found that all three groups produced sugarcane with fairly high te with no marked difference in te across the groups implying that sugarcane farms in faisalabad applied similar production technologies and the efficiency in the use of the set of inputs had almost saturated resulting in insignificant differences our finding is consistent with that of watto and mugera 2014a who revealed that solo owners and water buyers operated with 96 and 94 te in pakistani punjab respectively in contrast in india khanna 2006 found that the mean te of exclusive owners of tubewells was the highest followed by that of shareholders and water buyers the gie analysis implied that without affecting other inputs and output of sugarcane the solo owners and shareholders could reduce their use of groundwater by 8 each and the water buyers by 17 the significant differences in gie indicated that the three groundwater user groups experienced heterogeneous qualities of irrigation services during the sugarcane growing season as sugarcane stays on the field for a longer period than other major crops farms face elevated irrigation demand during sugarcane production and water buyers are exposed to more competition than tubewell owners watto and mugera 2014a which might cause over purchase of water as opposed to formal contracts or agreements groundwater transactions are informal social contracts contingent upon social ties between buyers and sellers meinzen dick 1996 yielding inequities in water allocation and distribution among buyers during peak periods unreliable groundwater supply could lead to compromised gie in the water buyers compared to the solo owners and shareholders although te was above 90 most of the sugarcane farms were far less than efficient in the case of ae the solo owners shareholders and water buyers can potentially reduce their costs by 46 48 and 47 respectively the shareholders employed more groundwater labor and seed than the solo owners and water buyers see table 4 the solo owners and shareholders used larger quantities of all inputs than the water buyers contributing to higher production costs for the two former groups these increased costs might explain the lower ae scores of the solo owners and shareholders vs the water buyers the water buyers showed the highest ae implying they were more conservative in allocating their expensive inputs the regression analysis revealed that increases in age farm size tubewell depth and size and salinity decreased the ae wadud and white 2000 showed that older farmers tended to be less efficient due to lower education less reception to new technologies and more conservative production techniques furthermore in literature smaller farms are often more profitable per unit of land while the effects of land size on te are mixed coelli et al 2002 khanna 2006 laha and kuri 2011 watto and mugera 2014a negative effects on ae were reported by various studies in developing countries bravo ureta and pinheiro 1997 mburu et al 2014 drs renders smaller farms more efficient than larger ones gilligan 1998 common in low income countries takahashi et al 2020 deeper tubewells require larger investments in drilling casings and pump sets and variable costs fuel electricity to extract groundwater are higher decreasing their ce and lowering ae literature suggests that pakistani farms tend to use tubewells of larger than the optimal capacity to draw water from the given water depth qureshi et al 2003 tubewells of larger capacity tend to suffer more operational and management problems and higher extraction costs malik and strosser 1993 strosser and kuper 1994 it is likely that the use of larger capacity tubewells decreases ae by causing energy overuse and incurring higher costs of production salinity affects soil productivity crop outputs income risk and shadow prices of water haider and hossain 2013 malik et al 2021 keeping the resource base constant the gross margin of crops could decrease by up to 40 in saline areas due to changes in input use which will result in lower profits dhehibi et al 2013 and ae 5 conclusions improving irrigated farms efficiency is vital for the development of semi arid agrarian societies such as in pakistan this study assessed the te gie and ae of sugarcane farms in punjab pakistan and investigated determinants of the ae the sugarcane farms were categorized according to groundwater irrigation access as solo owners of tubewells shareholders of tubewells and water buyers the results indicate that irrespective of the groundwater user type all sugarcane farms operated at fairly high levels of te 94 96 in the case of gie efficiency the water buyers had lower levels of efficiency than the solo owners and shareholders despite the high levels of te the ae levels were below 55 on average at the sampled farms the solo owners tended to be more allocative efficient than the water buyers and shareholders the shareholders incurred higher costs of production which may have decreased their ae these findings assert that looking at te alone may be misleading as it does not provide adequate information on the other aspects of farm efficiency the differential ae across the water user groups suggests that policy interventions for improving the ae at sugarcane farms should pay attention to the differences in farm tubewell ownership and groundwater rights the regression results imply that farmers age farm size tubewell depth discharge rate and salinity negatively affected the ae therefore it is recommended that the on farm water management department and private drilling services provide farms with technical support and consultation on tubewell selection appropriate tubewell discharge size and economics of groundwater extraction to minimize the cost of groundwater irrigation policies for reducing land fragmentation and monitoring and regulating groundwater extraction to prevent further increases in groundwater depth would improve the ae of sugarcane production irrigation and soil management practices such as lime and gypsum conjunctive use of good quality canal irrigation with saline groundwater irrigation could also improve the ae the study has potential limitations first although the sample farms were carefully selected to capture variations in ownership of tubewells the efficiency analysis was conducted on the relatively small sample second although the study could have provided more insights into trends in efficiency time constraints presented a hurdle in collecting data across consecutive time periods third in assessing water efficiency the environmental component should also be incorporated into the calculation of allocative efficiency given potential negative environmental effects of water run off water wastage and pollution see the problem of salination mentioned earlier to study this the dea should be extended by incorporating environmental efficiency scores whereby the material balance condition should be respected see coelli et al 2007 however for such exercise data on water run off water wastage and eventually salination levels should be available which was not the case and thus disabled the incorporation of environmental efficiency into our ae estimation funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies

9459,a shortcoming of the rz shaw model a hybrid version of root zone water quality model and the simultaneous heat and water model is that it cannot simulate the plastic mulching technology which is widely used in arid areas our objectives in this study were to develop rz shaw to include a new plastic module and to evaluate the model s performance over three years of maize zea mays l production in china a new plastic module was added to compute changes in the shortwave and longwave radiation transfer turbulent heat and vapor transfer from the surface and the energy and water balances in the system associated with a plastic mulch layer the modified rz shaw model can adequately simulate soil water 0 017 cm3 cm 3 rmse 0 030 cm3 cm 3 and capture the evaporation reduction and transpiration increase under plastic mulch the model overestimated the increased soil temperatures under plastic mulch 2 3 over the 100 cm profile compared to the measured data 1 4 overall the revised rz shaw model

1 introduction china supports 22 of the world s population with 7 of the world s arable land loro 2014 therefore improving food production is a major goal for china the most challenging issues occur in dryland production regions which have fewer water resources and occupy about 50 of the cultivated land addressing the shortage of water resources that restrict agricultural development in dryland regions is essential for ensuring food security many agricultural management practices to improve crop production while using less water have been tested in dryland regions over the past few decades one of the most effective measures is the use of plastic mulching pm the use of pm has become a major management practice for rainfed farming in china zhang et al 2018a mainly due to its effects on improving moisture retention and crop yield zhang et al 2018a reported that pm increased maize yield by 4 245 compared with non mulched management across the loess plateau in china at the same time pm can reduce soil evaporation gong et al 2017 li et al 2013b and improve soil water storage and water use efficiency furthermore pm increased soil temperature in the early growing seasons and improved seedling emergence cavero et al 1996 huang et al 2008 however many problems need to be addressed such as early maturity increased water consumption and crop failure bu et al 2013 li et al 1999 steinmetz et al 2016 due to questions regarding the effects of pm a great deal of research has been conducted to understand the mechanisms that affect the biophysical processes mahrer et al 1984 established energy balance equations of a mulched soil to describe the heat exchange process in the soil mulch atmosphere system which improved the prediction of soil moisture and temperature of a mulched soil chung and horton 1987 developed a computer model which used a finite difference method to study two dimensional coupled soil water and heat flow with a partial surface mulch wang and deng 1991 analyzed the dynamics of soil energy balance components that were responsible for soil temperature increase under pm wu et al 2007 built a physically based model coupling water and heat transport in a soil mulch plant atmosphere continuum these models partly explain the effects of mulch on soil moisture temperature and surface energy balance in the pm system however these simple models usually do not consider the impact of crops or set crop parameters to fixed values during the simulation to quantify the effect of pm on crop growth many researchers have used the aquacrop model to simulate yield biomass and canopy cover ratios of different crops maize millet setaria italica l cotton gossypium spp sweet pepper capsicumannuum l with pm cosic et al 2017 guo et al 2018 ran et al 2017 tan et al 2018 however the aquacrop model does not consider the impact of pm on soil temperature which an important factor affecting crop growth han et al 2014 modified the temperature module of the dndc denitrification decomposition model to analyze how soil moisture soil temperature and corn yield were influenced by pm liang et al 2017 improved the soil water and heat modules of whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator using the simple empirical approach of han et al 2014 to identify optimal management practices among different water and n treatments in gcrps ground cover rice production system however this approach was not applicable when surface soil temperature was greater than the air temperature as often occurs in dry areas liang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to study the effects of pm on soil water soil heat and crop growth from other perspectives such as energy balance in a complete crop model such as rz shaw the rz shaw model was developed by coupling the rzwqm root zone water quality model ahuja et al 2000 and the shaw models simultaneous heat and water model flerchinger and saxton 1989 the rzwqm model has been fully verified and applied to farmland ecosystems fang et al 2014b and can simulate soil moisture soil temperature and evapotranspiration of the soil crop system fang et al 2010b ma et al 2012a the shaw model has a very comprehensive energy balance system that performs well in simulating soil moisture soil temperature and the energy balance of the soil crop system flerchinger 2017 ma et al 2012b the coupled rz shaw model brings together the advantages and capabilities of both rzwqm and shaw which has been successfully tested using field data fang et al 2014a li et al 2012 yu et al 2007 the objectives of this study were to 1 add a plastic mulch submodule to rz shaw based on energy balance and water balance equations 2 test the performance of the modified rz shaw model for simulating soil temperature and water content using three years of data 2014 2016 from a maize field and 3 explore differences between simulated evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes between a plastic mulch and control treatment to ensure that simulations are reasonable and to gain a better understanding of the processes influencing observed soil temperature and moisture 2 model descriptions 2 1 brief description of the rz shaw model in the rz shaw model the shaw model was linked to rzwqm to simulate surface energy balance to overcome the shortcomings of assuming surface soil temperature equal to air temperature in the original rzwqm and the inability of shaw to simulate crop growth li et al 2012 ma et al 2012b yu et al 2007 a simplified representation of the execution sequence for rz shaw is shown in fig 1 at the beginning of each day the model reads the input daily or hourly meteorological data and then checks all of the management practices and creates the management queue if there is a rainfall or irrigation event the model executes the green ampt equation to calculate infiltration between rainfall or irrigation events the soil water is redistributed by using the richards equation 1 θ t z k h z h z k h z s z t where θ is volumetric soil water content cm3 cm 3 t is the time at an hourly time step z is soil depth cm assumed positive downward h is soil water pressure head cm k is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm h 1 a function of h and z and s z t is a sink term for root water uptake rwu and tile drainage rates hr 1 rwu in the sink term is from shaw and described later the surface boundary condition is an evaporative flux until the soil surface water potential falls below a minimum value set at 20 000 cm at which time a constant head condition is used 2 k h z k e where e is the evaporation rate at the soil surface cm hr 1 soil evaporation e from shaw was used in this study when the surface water potential was above the minimum value when surface water potential falls below the minimum water potential or if the e exceeds the capability of the soil to deliver water to the surface based on the richards equation fang et al 2014a actual evaporation ae is limited by the rzwqm routines the richards eqn 1 and its boundary eqn 2 are solved by a mass conservative mixed form iterative finite difference numerical solution celia et al 1987 1990 the shaw routines are called at the same time step hourly or sub hourly as the richards equation to simulate heat transfer and energy balance in the system the input parameters required to run the shaw module soil water content leaf area index lai plant height crop biomass and root distributions are provided by rzwqm shaw routines first determine the liquid and ice water content of the soil for temperatures less than 0 c and then update the matric potential and solute concentration in the soil fuchs et al 1978 li et al 2012 the surface energy balance described in shaw may be written as fig 2 3 r n h l v e t g where r n is net

2007 direct and upward and downward diffuse radiation being transmitted reflected and absorbed are considered when calculating the energy exchange among canopy snow residue or soil layers the upward flux of diffuse shortwave radiation s u i and longwave radiation l u i above canopy layer i are determined by 5 s u i τ d i α l d i f d i τ l d i f d i 1 τ d i s u i 1 α l d i f d i τ l d i f d i 1 τ

downward diffuse and direct radiation entering canopy layer i ε c is the emissivity of the canopy elements τ d i j is the diffuse transmissivity for plant j and of layer i and t l i j is the leaf temperature of plant j in canopy layer i the radiation exchange equations for the crop residue layer are similar to that for the crop canopy and a similar expression can be written for downward radiation at any layer after computing net radiation fluxes the turbulent transfer coefficients for both h and et fluxes from the surface are calculated h is calculated from temperature gradients between the exchange surface and the atmosphere campbell and norman 1998 7 h ρ a c a t c s n r s s t a r h where ρ a c a and t a are the density kg m 3 specific heat j kg 1 1 and temperature of air at the measurement reference height tc sn r ss is the temperature of the canopy snow residue or soil surface and r h is the resistance to the surface heat transfer s m 1 corrected for atmospheric

the rwu needed in the richards equation and equal to actual transpiration at is calculated by a difference in water potential between soil and plant xylem flerchinger and pierson 1991 9 a t r w u i 1

roots of layer i r r i is calculated by dividing total root resistance for the plant by its fraction of roots within the soil layer leaf temperature for each plant species within each canopy layer is calculated with a leaf energy balance equation described by flerchinger 2017 the energy balance equation for temperature distribution in the soil matrix considering convective heat transfer by liquid

with the surface energy balance equations eqns 3 4 7 and 8 or the energy balance of the overlying material canopy snow or residue surface temperature and humidity must be solved iteratively to balance all components of the surface energy balance at the soil surface rn lvet h and g energy balance equations for all layers canopy snow residue and soil throughout the profile are solved simultaneously using the newton raphson method for temperature change at each node in the current time step after a solution is obtained for a time step the computed soil surface temperature water and ice content can be used to calculate soil heat flux g directly from the terms in eqn 10 for the surface soil layer fig 2 11 g k s t δ z s c l q l t ss t t z t δ z s 2 δ t c s t ss t t ss t δ t ρ i l f θ i t θ i t

the time step t δ t t z t is soil temperature of the second soil layer the water balance equations established for the canopy and residue layers are solved simultaneously for vapor density change at each node flerchinger 2017 the water balance for the soil layers of shaw was not used in rz shaw and the mass balance of snowpack was calculated after solving the energy and water balance equations latent heat flux lvet is the sum of the heat exchanges caused by transpiration and evaporation at the end of the hourly time step shaw outputs shortwave and longwave radiation absorbed by each layer and energy balance components h lvet g and rn shaw then provides liquid and ice water content and soil temperature to rzwqm for the next hourly step when all hourly steps are finished for a day the daily soil water content and soil temperature are input to the crop growth module in rz shaw to update crop parameters such as lai biomass root distribution plant height and yield the ceres maize growth module was used in this study and the theory for that module can be found in jones et al 2003 and ma et al 2006 new crop parameters are then used for the next day s loop 2 2 description of the plastic mulch layer submodule the plastic mulch layer submodule was developed based on shaw in rz shaw by adding a plastic layer into the original atmosphere canopy snowpack residue soil layered system the new plastic mulch layer is between the snowpack and residue layers this layer changes the shortwave and longwave radiation transfer turbulent heat and vapor transfer from the surface and the energy and water balances in the system assumptions for this submodule are as follows 1 vapor cannot pass through the plastic material so that evaporation only occurs from uncovered areas 2 the difference in soil temperature in the horizontal direction caused by partial mulching is ignored because rz shaw is a vertical one dimensional model and 3 heat transfer that occurs by evaporation or condensation between the mulch and the soil surface can be ignored in comparison with the latent heat transfer between the soil and the atmosphere yang et al 2012 2 2 1 shortwave radiation through plastic layer shortwave radiation exchange in the plastic layer is simulated using similar equations as the canopy layers eqn 5 shortwave radiation exchange in the plastic layer is computed by considering downward direct or beam s b p and upward s u p 1 and downward s d p diffuse radiation being transmitted reflected and absorbed by the plastic layer the upward s u p flux of diffuse

the expression for upward l u p and downward l d p 1 longwave radiation through the plastic layer is similar to that for shortwave radiation but longwave emittance replaces the term for direct

is calculated as follows with an assumption that longwave radiation cannot be transmitted through plastic 22 τ d p l 1 f p the model assumes no longwave radiation transfer through the plastic layer when it is covered by snow alternatively the thermal conductivity of the snow is used for heat transfer through the plastic layer voids 2 2 3 turbulent vapor transfer through plastic layer we assumed that vapor cannot pass through plastic material so the vapor transfer through the non plastic covered surface is calculated as 23 e p ρ v r s s ρ v a c s n r v 1 f p where e p is the vapor transfer

block design was used for this field experiment plots were planted with the summer maize variety qinlong 14 the experiment included two treatments 1 a traditional planting system without mulching ck fig 4a and 2 a planting system with full transparent plastic mulching tpm fig 4b each treatment was replicated three times using plots that were 5 m long and 2 m wide there was a 0 5 m width guard row around each plot both treatments with and without plastic mulch used consistent management techniques such as variety irrigation and fertilizer applied maize was planted with 60 cm row spacing and plant spacing within rows of 40 cm in june of each year during the study period there were 52 plants 4 rows and 13 plants within row in each plot nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers were surface broadcast as base fertilizer and incorporated 5 cm deep by manual tillage before planting the types of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers were urea and diammonium phosphate respectively the total amounts of pure nitrogen n and phosphorus p2o5 were 225 kg ha 1 and 90 kg ha 1 at each application drip irrigation was used in the experiment and irrigated at least once during a growing season with 30 mm for each irrigation besides 30 mm of water was supplied by flooding on 12 june 2015 because of extremely dry conditions at planting dates of planting harvest irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 2 for the tpm treatment a transparent plastic film 0 008 mm thick was laid over the soil surface within the plot and holes were made in the film where seeds were planted the plastic mulching film was removed after harvest and reestablished at the next planting date other field management operations such as pest and weed control were implemented based on local farming practices 3 2 sampling and measurements the meteorological variables included daily average wind speed minimum and maximum air temperature relative humidity rainfall and sunshine duration data were obtained from the yangling meteorological station located next to the experimental field the soil temperature was automatically recorded every hour 24 data points per day using a datalogger em50 datalogger decagon devices wa usa for each treatment during the investigation period the thermal resistance temperature sensors 5tm were located 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm below the soil surface the sensors specifications

the three maize growing seasons and the measurements were taken from the soil surface to a 100 cm depth at 10 cm intervals the instrument s specifications can be found at http imko de en products soilmoisture soil moisture sensors trimepicoipht3 maize growth variables such as lai plant height and aboveground biomass were obtained at seven different phenological stages according to hanway 1966 for plant height and lai we selected two marked maize plants in each plot and observed them throughout the growing season plant height for each plant refers to the vertical distance from the top of the plant to the soil surface lai was determined by summing the lamina length maximum width of each plant multiplied by an empirical factor of 0 75 eldoma et al 2016 and then divided by the soil surface area per plant 0 192 m2 plant 1 was adopted in this study based on 52 plants in a 10 m2 plot average plant height and lai for each treatment were calculated as the average of three replicate plots maize plant samples were randomly selected from the middle of each plot and cut at ground level to determine aboveground biomass the plant sample should be representative of an average growth level in each plot the selected maize plant sample was dried in an oven at 105 for 1 h and then at 75 for a minimum of 72 h until a constant weight was attained finally the average aboveground biomass for each treatment was determined as the average of three replicate plots 3 3 data analysis method a one way analysis of variance anova using the statsmodels statistics in python http www statsmodels org was performed to test the differences between the two treatments multiple comparisons were made using the tukey hsd with statistical significance denoted at the 5 level 3 4 model calibration and evaluation we first calibrated the primary soil hydraulic parameters and crop cultivar parameters against the observed data of daily soil water content soil temperature plant height and aboveground biomass of the ck treatment from 2014 to 2016 initial values used were soil hydraulic parameters based on the field measurements table 1 and model default crop cultivar parameters the parameter estimation software pest doherty 2004 malone et al 2010 was used to calibrate these parameters during the process of parameter estimation bd soil bulk density and θ 1 3 soil water content at 1 3 bar or 33 kpa were limited to 15 of measured values other soil parameters were a function of calibrated parameters θ 15 soil water content at 15 bar or 1500 kpa was set as half of θ 1 3 θ s saturated water content was calculated from bd using a particle density of 2 65 g m 3 and k sat was calculated from θ s and θ 1 3 with the equation k sat 764 5 θ s θ 1 3 3 29 ahuja 1986 ahuja et al 2010 other detailed descriptions of rzwqm optimizations with pest can be found in fang et al 2010a these initial and calibrated soil hydraulic and crop genetic parameters used as inputs to the rz shaw model are presented in tables 3 and 4 the optimized soil hydraulic and crop cultivar parameters determined for ck were also used for the tpm treatment observed variables for plastic mulch submodule evaluation were soil water content and temperature at the measured depths and plant growth variables aboveground biomass plant height grain yield of tpm the lai required to run the model was obtained by linear interpolation of the measured values during model calibration and evaluation as shown in thorp et al 2010 the reason for this was to eliminate error in lai simulation on plastic mulch effects the statistical indicators of root mean squared error rmse mean difference md and coefficient of determination r2 were used to evaluate model performance 32 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 33 m d 1 n 1 n s i

and n is the number of data pairs 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration with ck treatment the simulated daily soil temperature at 15 cm depth showed similar trends to the measured values with 3 yr average rmse of 1 7 1 5 in 2014 1 5 in 2015 and 2 1 in 2016 fig 5a table 5 soil temperature was underestimated from june to july but overestimated towards the end of the growing season in 2014 2016 better soil water storage simulations were obtained for 2016 than for 2014 and 2015 with the rmse being 1 88 1 30 and 1 25 mm for years 2014 2016 respectively fig 5b table 5 soil water storage was overestimated from september to october in 2014 and underestimated in october 2015 the r2 values for soil water storage were above 0 70 for all three years overall rz shaw simulated soil water dynamics well r2 values for plant height during the three years were greater than 0 9 indicating that the model reasonably simulated plant height table 5 fig 5c the simulated aboveground biomass was close to the measured data from 2014 to 2016 but better in 2016 than in 2014 and 2015 fig 5d simulated biomass was also in good agreement with the measured values in 2014 2016 table 5 r2 0 9 with somewhat overestimation in 2014 and 2015 in general rz shaw produced better simulations of soil water storage soil temperature and plant height than of biomass during the three years of the study the simulation results of the calibrated rz shaw model were considered acceptable 4 2 simulated and observed effects of plastic mulch on soil water content the field measured soil water contents at each depth were similar between the ck and tpm treatments fig 6a e the mean observed volumetric soil moisture in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the maize growing seasons for the ck and tpm treatments were the same values 0 26 cm3 cm 3 in 2014 0 27 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 0 25 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 respectively this was mainly due to a large amount of rainfall and irrigation fig 6g in the experimental area such that the evaporation suppression effect of the plastic mulch was not obvious the soil water content and soil water storage were overestimated for both ck and tpm treatments during the later part of the 2014 growing season but were underestimated in 2015 and 2016 however the model did capture the differences in soil moisture content between ck and tpm early in 2014 and early 2015 fig 6a e similarly simulated soil profile water contents followed measured values closely for both tpm and ck treatments and correctly reflect plastic mulching effects the rmse between simulated and observed soil water content for tpm ranged from 0 017 to 0 030 cm3 cm 3 with a mean value of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 in all soil layers the r2 values coefficients of determination for tpm were greater than 0 70 in most soil layers 4 3 simulated and observed effects of plastic mulch on soil temperature the observed soil temperature for tpm was higher than for ck at each soil depth in all three years fig 7b f fig 8a e the 3 yr average soil temperatures for tpm and ck were 27 4 and 25 3 at 15 cm 27 1 and 25 4 at 30 cm 26 2 and 25 0 at 50 cm 25 0 and 24 0 at 70 cm and 24 1 and 23 1 at 100 cm respectively soil temperatures decreased with increasing soil depth for both ck and tpm treatments and the temperature differences between the ck and tpm treatments for the 15 and 100 cm depths were 2 3 and 3 3 respectively thus plastic mulch increased soil temperature at all depths and increased the temperature gradient between the soil surface and deeper soil layers during each of the three growing seasons the observed temperature differences between tpm and ck was greater in the early growth stages than that in the later period and reached a maximum on 20 july 2014 31 days after planting 9 july 2015 28 days after planting and 26 june 2016 17 days after planting at the 15 cm depth fig 8a this was a result of the greater soil heat flux for tpm than for ck in the early growth stages and less plastic mulch treatment effect in the middle and later growth stages the average temperature differences between the two treatments generally decreased with increasing soil depth the 3 yr average differences at 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm were 2 1 1 7 1 2 1 0 and 1 0 respectively the revised rz shaw model simulated soil temperature for tpm better during early growth stages for all three years and overestimated soil temperature during the later stages this pattern became more apparent at deeper soil depths compare fig 7b to 7f however rz shaw underestimated the decline in soil temperature for both ck and tpm treatments when air temperature decreased for example see the large air temperature drops on 5 august 2014 5 august 2015 and 15 july 2015 in fig 7 especially at 70 and 100 cm depths the simulated 3 yr average soil temperatures for tpm and ck were 27 9 and 25 2 at 15 cm 27 4 and 24 9 at 30 cm 26 9 and 24 6 at 50 cm 26 5 and 24 3 at 70 cm and 26 1 and 24 1 at 100 cm respectively therefore the rz shaw model correctly simulated the warming effect of plastic mulch fig 8 and the pattern of soil temperature decreasing with increasing soil depth however the simulated average soil temperatures for tpm were slightly higher than the observed values in each soil depth the observed and simulated 3 yr average soil temperatures for tpm were 27 4 and 27 9 difference of 0 5 at 15 cm 27 1 and 27 4 difference of 0 3 at 30 cm 26 2 and 26 9 difference of 0 7 at 50 cm 25 0 and 26 5 difference of 1 5 at 70 cm and 24 1 and 26 1 difference of 2 0 at 100 cm respectively the average rmse value between simulated and observed soil temperatures for tpm was 2 3 and r2 values were greater than 0 70 at most soil depths which indicates that rz shaw acceptably simulated soil temperatures under plastic mulch the simulated temperature increase caused by plastic mulch was similar to observed increases during early growth stages but the simulated increase was greater than observed during the middle and later periods fig 8 the 3 yr average simulated increases were 2 7 2 5 2 3 2 2 and 2 0 at the 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm soil depths respectively with a mean value was 2 3 over the entire 100 cm profile the 3 yr average observed soil temperature increases were 2 1 1 7 1 2 1 0 and 1 0 at 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm respectively with a mean value was 1 4 for the soil profile the decreased effectiveness in warming of the observed temperatures at depth may be due to the edge effects of the plot the revised rz shaw model therefore was able to capture the warming effect of the tpm treatment particularly at the surface but did overestimate the warming effect by a mean value of 0 9 greater simulated soil temperature differences between the treatments than observed during the later period is probably due to overestimating g under plastic mulch conditions 4 4 simulated effects of plastic mulch on evapotranspiration plastic mulch affects the actual evaporation ae by reducing potential evaporation pe because the plastic mulch provides a physical barrier to water vapor transfer eqn 23 simulated daily pe with the tpm treatment was lower than for ck during the entire growing period in all three years fig 9a simulated pe differences between ck and tpm occurred in the early growth stages due to the greater canopy coverage in the later growth stages resulting in less radiation penetrating the maize canopy to the soil surface for evaporating soil water cumulative pe for tpm over the three years was 158 111 and 128 mm which was 44 56 and 47 lower than ck 284 254 and 241 mm soil water storage was insufficient to meet pe demand leading to lower ae than pe for both ck and tpm treatments fig 9a simulated ae of tpm was lower than ck for most of the growing season during all three years however ae of tpm was higher than that of ck when the surface soil moisture content of ck was lower than that of tpm although there was a high pe capacity with ck during these times there was not enough water for evaporation cumulative ae for tpm was 86 66 and 61 mm which decreased by 28 42 and 31 respectively compared with ck 120 113 and 88 mm during the three growing seasons 2014 2016 gong et al 2017 also concluded that plastic mulch reduced total growing season evaporation compared with no mulched treatment differences in the effect of plastic mulching on ae over the three years indicate that the plastic mulch s effects on evaporation vary with soil moisture conditions affected by rainfall irrigation etc and climatic conditions interannual regional differences there was little difference between potential transpiration pt and actual transpiration at for both treatments fig 9b indicating that soil moisture was not a limiting factor for transpiration the average daily at values for tpm were 91 94 and 94 of pt for tpm for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the corresponding average daily at values for ck were 91 92 and 94 of pt for ck pt for tpm was nearly identical to that for ck in 2014 and higher than ck in 2015 and 2016 the pt difference between the two mulch treatments was related to measured differences in lai with greater lai in the tpm treatment resulting in greater pt in 2015 and 2016 cumulative pt of tpm was 153 279 and 232 mm which was 1 35 and 9 greater than simulated pt of ck 152 206 and 212 mm for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively similarly cumulative at of tpm was 139 261 and 219 mm which was 1 37 and 10 greater than ck 138 190 and 199 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively cumulative aet with tpm was 225 327 and 280 mm which was 13 less 8 greater and 2 less than the cumulative aet with ck 258 303 and 287 mm for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 9c gong et al 2017 and fan et al 2017 reported that plastic mulch decreased aet due to the shortened growth period while wu et al 2017 reported that plastic mulch increased aet due to better soil water conditions and improved maize growth their results indicated that the higher aet values for tpm compared to ck were reasonable many production systems in china use plastic mulch to reduce evaporation and it has been proven to be effective gong et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b simulations with the rz shaw model can better reflect the decrease in soil evaporation that occurs with the use of plastic mulch both the simulated evaporation rate and the seasonal evaporation total were seen to be lower with the plastic mulch treatment than with the non mulched treatment during the three years fig 9 however some studies have shown that plastic mulch can improve lai and increase transpiration zhang et al 2018b thus total seasonal et may be larger or smaller with plastic mulch compared to that without mulch depending on the reduction in surface evaporation and the change in the fraction of total et that is transpiration in this study the simulated seasonal transpiration with plastic mulch was similar 2014 or larger 2015 and 2016 than with the ck treatment which was commensurate with measured lai and soil water content conditions in all three years of the study some previous studies have shown that plastic mulch can reduce total evapotranspiration compared with a non mulched treatment gong et al 2017 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b the reasons for that result were either that plastic mulch can accelerate the growth process and shorten the growth period or that evaporation reduction is greater than transpiration increase however some studies have shown that evapotranspiration with plastic mulch was greater than with non mulched conditions chen et al 2015 li et al 2013a these different results among previous studies may be caused by local differences in precipitation timing and amount during the growing season 4 5 simulated effects of plastic mulch on surface energy fluxes plastic mulch can increase substrate albedo resulting in less simulated shortwave and longwave radiation being received by the soil surface under tpm treatment than under ck fig 10c f which agrees with results of chung and horton 1987 li et al 2016 and liakatas et al 1986 simulated soil rn for tpm was about 78 of rn for ck over the growing season fig 11a which is similar to the measured 80 as reported by li et al 2016 for plastic mulching in a cotton field simulated soil rs for tpm was about 75 of rs for ck fig 11b which is lower than the value of 84 measured by li et al 2016 li et al 2016 reported that measured soil rl under plastic mulch were nearly the same as ck in contrast our simulated values of soil rl for tpm were about 30 of rl for ck fig 11c suggesting that the model may have underestimated the soil rl for tpm however since soil rl was small this underestimation of soil rl under plastic mulch should not have a big impact on soil rn fig 11a the difference in soil rn between tpm and ck treatments decreased as lai and canopy coverage increased because more radiation was intercepted by the canopy so differences in substrate albedo were less influential for the canopy plastic soil system plastic mulch reduced simulated net radiation in the soil layer but it also absorbed shortwave radiation fig 10b and emitted longwave radiation fig 10e meanwhile the denser maize canopy for tpm compared to ck intercepted more shortwave radiation fig 10a overall the slightly lower total seasonal rn received by tpm 101 w m 2 compared to ck 104 w m 2 agrees with other previously reported results fan et al 2017 li et al 2016 the slope of the regression between total rn in the ck and tpm treatments was 1 0 fig 13a which compares with a smaller regression slope 0 9 between rn in a maize field with and without plastic mulch reported by fan et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018b we suspect therefore that this means rz shaw may overestimate the total rn differences between ck and tpm simulated sensible heat h for tpm was lower than for ck fig 12b f especially before canopy closure which occurred on 15 august h between substrate beneath the plastic and the atmosphere first passes through the layer of still air beneath the plastic by molecular diffusion and is then transmitted above the plastic by turbulent transfer processes the plastic mulch acts as a barrier to the direct turbulent exchange of the heated air under the mulch with air above it the molecular diffusion coefficient is much smaller than the turbulent diffusion coefficient during energy transfer so the sensible heat exchange of the soil under the plastic mulch is inhibited rz shaw was able to simulate this barrier effect and the slope of the regression between h for ck and tpm was 0 7 fig 13b indicating that h for tpm was about 70 of ck during the entire growing season lvet for both ck and tpm treatments showed typical seasonal variation increasing from june to august and then decreasing slowly to harvest fig 12c g in response to lai this result is likely because the lvet for tpm mainly comes from plant transpiration in the early growing stages from sowing to mid july when plant transpiration is low the barrier effect of the plastic mulch on evaporation leads to a lower lvet under tpm than under ck when the maize canopy was completely closed the contribution of evaporation to lvet was reduced and the effect of plastic mulch on lvet was lessened therefore the difference in lvet between ck and tpm became less obvious during later growth stages the average lvet for tpm during the entire growing season was 74 w m 2 which is higher than for ck 69 w m 2 and fig 13c shows that lvet for tpm was about 115 of lvet for ck in 2015 simulated soil heat flux g under tpm was higher than under ck during the growing season especially in the early part of the growing season fig 12d h which agrees with the results of fan et al 2017 the average g for tpm was 4 0 w m 2 with a standard deviation of 56 3 w m 2 while the average g for ck was 2 2 w m 2 with a standard deviation of 44 6 w m 2 which means that the plastic mulch increased soil heat flux into deeper soil layers the slope of the regression between g for ck and tpm treatments was 1 22 fig 13d indicating that g for tpm was about 122 of g for ck over the entire growing season accumulated g positive and negative values will offset for tpm and ck during the growing season was 12 2 kj m 2 and 6 7 kj m 2 respectively however accumulated g before 15 august for tpm and ck were 18 0 kj m 2 and 12 3 kj m 2 and were 5 9 mj m 2 and 5 7 mj m 2 respectively after 15 august these results indicate that the soil mainly receives heat before canopy closure and mainly releases heat after canopy closure also the increased g for tpm compared with ck was mainly due to the greater amount of heat received during the early growth stages as g was not much different between the two treatments in the later growth stages after canopy closure 5 conclusions the modified rz shaw model produced reasonable simulation trends for soil water soil temperature evapotranspiration and energy fluxes for the plastic mulch treatment from 2014 2016 plastic mulch increased soil temperature about 1 0 2 1 in 0 100 cm especially in surface soil layer during early growing season the model was able to mimic the increased soil temperatures under the mulch treatment compared to the non mulched treatment very little difference in water content was found between the treatments for either the simulated or measured values based on comparisons between simulated and observed values the model was able to adequately simulate soil water content under plastic mulch at different soil depths during the three years of the study with a mean root mean square error rmse value of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 in all soil layers the model did however simulate the reduced evaporation due to mulch and the consequent transpiration increase although measurements are not available to confirm this model observation when simulating the use of plastic mulch the model may overestimate rn and g and underestimate h and lvet resulting in an overestimation of soil temperature the current modified rz shaw model can be used as a decision tool for irrigation water management and automatic irrigation under plastic mulch plastic cover ratio adjustment optimize the

9459,a shortcoming of the rz shaw model a hybrid version of root zone water quality model and the simultaneous heat and water model is that it cannot simulate the plastic mulching technology which is widely used in arid areas our objectives in this study were to develop rz shaw to include a new plastic module and to evaluate the model s performance over three years of maize zea mays l production

1 introduction china supports 22 of the world s population with 7 of the world s arable land loro 2014 therefore improving food production is a major goal for china the most challenging issues occur in dryland production regions which have fewer water resources and occupy about 50 of the cultivated land addressing the shortage of water resources that restrict agricultural development in dryland regions is essential for ensuring food security many agricultural management practices to improve crop production while using less water have been tested in dryland regions over the past few decades one of the most effective measures is the use of plastic mulching pm the use of pm has become a major management practice for rainfed farming in china zhang et al 2018a mainly due to its effects on improving moisture retention and crop yield zhang et al 2018a reported that pm increased maize yield by 4 245 compared with non mulched management across the loess plateau in china at the same time pm can reduce soil evaporation gong et al 2017 li et al 2013b and improve soil water storage and water use efficiency furthermore pm increased soil temperature in the early growing seasons and improved seedling emergence cavero et al 1996 huang et al 2008 however many problems need to be addressed such as early maturity increased water consumption and crop failure bu et al 2013 li et al 1999 steinmetz et al 2016 due to questions regarding the effects of pm a great deal of research has been conducted to understand the mechanisms that affect the biophysical processes mahrer et al 1984 established energy balance equations of a mulched soil to describe the heat exchange process in the soil mulch atmosphere system which improved the prediction of soil moisture and temperature of a mulched soil chung and horton 1987 developed a computer model which used a finite difference method to study two dimensional coupled soil water and heat flow with a partial surface mulch wang and deng 1991 analyzed the dynamics of soil energy balance components that were responsible for soil temperature increase under pm wu et al 2007 built a physically based model coupling water and heat transport in a soil mulch plant atmosphere continuum these models partly explain the effects of mulch on soil moisture temperature and surface energy balance in the pm system however these simple models usually do not consider the impact of crops or set crop parameters to fixed values during the simulation to quantify the effect of pm on crop growth many researchers have used the aquacrop model to simulate yield biomass and canopy cover ratios of different crops maize millet setaria italica l cotton gossypium spp sweet pepper capsicumannuum l with pm cosic et al 2017 guo et al 2018 ran et al 2017 tan et al 2018 however the aquacrop model does not consider the impact of pm on soil temperature which an important factor affecting crop growth han et al 2014 modified the temperature module of the dndc denitrification decomposition model to analyze how soil moisture soil temperature and corn yield were influenced by pm liang et al 2017 improved the soil water and heat modules of whcns soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulator using the simple empirical approach of han et al 2014 to identify optimal management practices among different water and n treatments in gcrps ground cover rice production system however this approach was not applicable when surface soil temperature was greater than the air temperature as often occurs in dry areas liang et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to study the effects of pm on soil water soil heat and crop growth from other perspectives such as energy balance in a complete crop model such as rz shaw the rz shaw model was developed by coupling the rzwqm root zone water quality model ahuja et al 2000 and the shaw models simultaneous heat and water model flerchinger and saxton 1989 the rzwqm model has been fully verified and applied to farmland ecosystems fang et al 2014b and can simulate soil moisture soil temperature and evapotranspiration of the soil crop system fang et al 2010b ma et al 2012a the shaw model has a very comprehensive energy balance system that performs well in simulating soil moisture soil temperature and the energy balance of the soil crop system flerchinger 2017 ma et al 2012b the coupled rz shaw model brings together the advantages and capabilities of both rzwqm and shaw which has been successfully tested using field data fang et al 2014a li et al 2012 yu et al 2007 the objectives of this study were to 1 add a plastic mulch submodule to rz shaw based on energy balance and water balance equations 2 test the performance of the modified rz shaw model for simulating soil temperature and water content using three years of data 2014 2016 from a maize field and 3 explore differences between simulated evapotranspiration and surface energy fluxes between a plastic mulch and control treatment to ensure that simulations are reasonable and to gain a better understanding of the processes influencing observed soil temperature and moisture 2 model descriptions 2 1 brief description of the rz shaw model in the rz shaw model the shaw model was linked to rzwqm to simulate surface energy balance to overcome the shortcomings of assuming surface soil temperature equal to air temperature in the original rzwqm and the inability of shaw to simulate crop growth li et al 2012 ma et al 2012b yu et al 2007 a simplified representation of the execution sequence for rz shaw is shown in fig 1 at the beginning of each day the model reads the input daily or hourly meteorological data and then checks all of the management practices and creates the management queue if there is a rainfall or irrigation event the model executes the green ampt equation to calculate infiltration between rainfall or irrigation events the soil water is redistributed by using the richards equation 1 θ t z k h z h z k h z s z t

plastic mulch layer submodule the plastic mulch layer submodule was developed based on shaw in rz shaw by adding a plastic layer into the original atmosphere canopy snowpack residue soil layered system the new plastic mulch layer is between the snowpack and residue layers this layer changes the shortwave and longwave radiation transfer turbulent heat and vapor transfer from the surface and the energy and water balances in the system assumptions for this submodule are as follows 1 vapor cannot pass through the plastic material so that evaporation only occurs from uncovered areas 2 the difference in soil temperature in the horizontal direction caused by partial mulching is ignored because rz shaw is a vertical one dimensional model and 3 heat transfer that occurs by evaporation or condensation between the mulch and the soil surface can be ignored in comparison with the latent heat transfer between the soil and the atmosphere yang et al 2012 2 2 1 shortwave radiation through

when it is covered by snow alternatively the thermal conductivity of the snow is used for heat transfer through the plastic layer voids 2 2 3 turbulent vapor transfer through plastic layer we assumed that vapor cannot pass through plastic material so the vapor transfer through the non plastic covered surface is calculated as 23 e p ρ v r s s ρ v a c s n r v 1 f p where e p is the vapor transfer

block design was used for this field experiment plots were planted with the summer maize variety qinlong 14 the experiment included two treatments 1 a traditional planting system without mulching ck fig 4a and 2 a planting system with full transparent plastic mulching tpm fig 4b each treatment was replicated three times using plots that were 5 m long and 2 m wide there was a 0 5 m width guard row around each plot both treatments with and without plastic mulch used consistent management techniques such as variety irrigation and fertilizer applied maize was planted with 60 cm row spacing and plant spacing within rows of 40 cm in june of each year during the study period there were 52 plants 4 rows and 13 plants within row in each plot nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers were surface broadcast as base fertilizer and incorporated 5 cm deep by manual tillage before planting the types of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers were urea and diammonium phosphate respectively the total amounts of pure nitrogen n and phosphorus p2o5 were 225 kg ha 1 and 90 kg ha 1 at each application drip irrigation was used in the experiment and irrigated at least once during a growing season with 30 mm for each irrigation besides 30 mm of water was supplied by flooding on 12 june 2015 because of extremely dry conditions at planting dates of planting harvest irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 2 for the tpm treatment a transparent plastic film 0 008 mm thick was laid over the soil surface within the plot and holes were made in the film where seeds were planted the plastic mulching film was removed after harvest and reestablished at the next planting date other field management operations such as pest and weed control were implemented based on local farming practices 3 2 sampling and measurements the meteorological variables included daily average wind speed minimum and maximum air temperature relative humidity rainfall and sunshine duration data were obtained from the yangling meteorological station located next to the experimental field the soil temperature was automatically recorded every hour 24 data points per day using a datalogger em50 datalogger decagon

the three maize growing seasons and the measurements were taken from the soil surface to a 100 cm depth at 10 cm intervals the instrument s specifications can be found at http imko de en products soilmoisture soil moisture sensors trimepicoipht3 maize growth variables such as lai plant height and aboveground biomass were obtained at seven different phenological stages according to hanway 1966 for plant height and lai we selected two marked maize plants in each plot and observed them throughout the growing season plant height for each plant refers to the vertical distance from the top of the plant to the soil surface lai was determined by summing the lamina length maximum width of each plant multiplied by an empirical factor of 0 75 eldoma et al 2016 and then divided by the soil surface area per plant 0 192 m2 plant 1 was adopted in this study based on 52 plants in a 10 m2 plot average plant height and lai for each treatment were calculated as the average of three replicate plots maize plant samples were randomly selected from the middle of each plot and cut at ground level to determine aboveground biomass the plant sample should be representative of an average growth level in each plot the selected maize plant sample was dried in an oven at 105 for 1 h and then at 75 for a minimum of 72 h until a constant weight was attained finally the average aboveground biomass for each treatment was determined as the average of three replicate plots 3 3 data analysis method a one way analysis of variance anova using the statsmodels statistics in python http www statsmodels org was performed to test the differences between the two treatments multiple comparisons were made using the tukey hsd with statistical significance denoted at the 5 level 3 4 model calibration and evaluation we first calibrated the primary soil hydraulic parameters and crop cultivar parameters against the observed data of daily soil water content soil temperature plant height and aboveground biomass of the ck treatment from 2014 to 2016 initial values used were soil hydraulic parameters based on the field measurements table 1 and model default crop cultivar parameters the parameter estimation software pest doherty 2004 malone et al 2010 was used to calibrate these parameters during the process of parameter estimation bd soil bulk density and θ 1 3 soil water content at 1 3 bar or 33 kpa were limited to 15 of measured values other soil parameters were a function of calibrated parameters θ 15 soil water content at 15 bar or 1500 kpa was set as half of θ 1 3 θ s saturated water content was calculated from bd using a particle density of 2 65 g m 3 and k sat was calculated from θ s and θ 1 3 with the equation k sat 764 5 θ s θ 1 3 3 29 ahuja 1986 ahuja et al 2010 other detailed descriptions of rzwqm optimizations with pest can be found in fang et al 2010a these initial and calibrated soil hydraulic and crop genetic parameters used as inputs to the rz shaw model are presented in tables 3 and 4 the optimized soil hydraulic and crop cultivar parameters determined for ck were also used for the tpm treatment observed variables for plastic mulch submodule evaluation were soil water content and temperature at the measured depths and plant growth variables aboveground biomass plant height grain yield of tpm the lai required to run the model was obtained by linear interpolation of the measured values during model calibration and evaluation as shown in thorp et al 2010 the reason for this was to eliminate error in lai simulation on plastic mulch effects the

and n is the number of data pairs 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration with ck treatment the simulated daily soil temperature at 15 cm depth showed similar trends to the measured values with 3 yr average rmse of 1 7 1 5 in 2014 1 5 in 2015 and 2 1 in 2016 fig 5a table 5 soil temperature was underestimated from june to july but overestimated towards the end of the growing season in 2014 2016 better soil water storage simulations were obtained for 2016 than for 2014 and 2015 with the rmse being 1 88 1 30 and 1 25 mm for years 2014 2016 respectively fig 5b table 5 soil water storage was overestimated from september to october in 2014 and underestimated in october 2015 the r2 values for soil water storage were above 0 70 for all three years overall rz shaw simulated soil water dynamics well r2 values for plant height during the three years were greater than 0 9 indicating that the model reasonably simulated plant height table 5 fig 5c the simulated aboveground biomass was close to the measured data from 2014 to 2016 but better in 2016 than in 2014 and 2015 fig 5d simulated biomass was also in good agreement with the measured values in 2014 2016 table 5 r2 0 9 with somewhat overestimation in 2014 and 2015 in general rz shaw produced better simulations of soil water storage soil temperature and plant height than of biomass during the three years of the study the simulation results of the calibrated rz shaw model were considered acceptable 4 2 simulated and observed effects of plastic mulch on soil water content the field measured soil water contents at each depth were similar between the ck and tpm treatments fig 6a e the mean observed volumetric soil moisture in the 0 100 cm soil layer during the maize growing seasons for the ck and tpm treatments were the same values 0 26 cm3 cm 3 in 2014 0 27 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 0 25 cm3 cm 3 in 2016 respectively this was mainly due to a large amount of rainfall and irrigation fig 6g in the experimental area such that the evaporation suppression effect of the plastic mulch was not obvious the soil water content and soil water storage were overestimated for both ck and tpm treatments during the later part of the 2014 growing season but were underestimated in 2015 and 2016 however the model did capture the differences in soil moisture content between ck and tpm early in 2014 and early 2015 fig 6a e similarly simulated soil profile water contents followed measured values closely for both tpm and ck treatments and correctly reflect plastic mulching effects the rmse between simulated and observed soil water content for tpm ranged from 0 017 to 0 030 cm3 cm 3 with a mean value of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 in all soil layers the r2 values coefficients of determination for tpm were greater than 0 70 in most soil layers 4 3 simulated and observed effects of plastic mulch on soil temperature the observed soil temperature for tpm was higher than for ck at each soil depth in all three years fig 7b f fig 8a e the 3 yr average soil temperatures for tpm and ck were 27 4 and 25 3 at 15 cm 27 1 and 25 4 at 30 cm 26 2 and 25 0 at 50 cm 25 0 and 24 0 at 70 cm and 24 1 and 23 1 at 100 cm respectively soil temperatures decreased with increasing soil depth for both ck and tpm treatments and the temperature differences between the ck and tpm treatments for the 15 and 100 cm depths were 2 3 and 3 3 respectively thus plastic mulch increased soil temperature at all depths and increased the temperature gradient between the soil surface and deeper soil layers during each of the three growing seasons the observed temperature differences between tpm and ck was greater in the early growth stages than that in the later period and reached a maximum on 20 july 2014 31 days after planting 9 july 2015 28 days after planting and 26 june 2016 17 days after planting at the 15 cm depth fig 8a this was a result of the greater soil heat flux for tpm than for ck in the early growth stages and less plastic mulch treatment effect in the middle and later growth stages the average temperature differences between the two treatments generally decreased with increasing soil depth the 3 yr average differences at 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm were 2 1 1 7 1 2 1 0 and 1 0 respectively the revised rz shaw model simulated soil temperature for tpm better during early growth stages for all three years and overestimated soil temperature during the later stages this pattern became more apparent at deeper soil depths compare fig 7b to 7f however rz shaw underestimated the decline in soil temperature for both ck and tpm treatments when air temperature decreased for example see the large air temperature drops on 5 august 2014 5 august 2015 and 15 july 2015 in fig 7 especially at 70 and 100 cm depths the simulated 3 yr average soil temperatures for tpm and ck were 27 9 and 25 2 at 15 cm 27 4 and 24 9 at 30 cm 26 9 and 24 6 at 50 cm 26 5 and 24 3 at 70 cm and 26 1 and 24 1 at 100 cm respectively therefore the rz shaw model correctly simulated the warming effect of plastic mulch fig 8 and the pattern of soil temperature decreasing with increasing soil depth however the simulated average soil temperatures for tpm were slightly higher than the observed values in each soil depth the observed and simulated 3 yr average soil temperatures for tpm were 27 4 and 27 9 difference of 0 5 at 15 cm 27 1 and 27 4 difference of 0 3 at 30 cm 26 2 and 26 9 difference of 0 7 at 50 cm 25 0 and 26 5 difference of 1 5 at 70 cm and 24 1 and 26 1 difference of 2 0 at 100 cm respectively the average rmse value between simulated and observed soil temperatures for tpm was 2 3 and r2 values were greater than 0 70 at most soil depths which indicates that rz shaw acceptably simulated soil temperatures under plastic mulch the simulated temperature increase caused by plastic mulch was similar to observed increases during early growth stages but the simulated increase was greater than observed during the middle and later periods fig 8 the 3 yr average simulated increases were 2 7 2 5 2 3 2 2 and 2 0 at the 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm soil depths respectively with a mean value was 2 3 over the entire 100 cm profile the 3 yr average observed soil temperature increases were 2 1 1 7 1 2 1 0 and 1 0 at 15 30 50 70 and 100 cm respectively with a mean value was 1 4 for the soil profile the decreased effectiveness in warming of the observed temperatures at depth may be due to the edge effects of the plot the revised rz shaw model therefore was able to capture the warming effect of the tpm treatment particularly at the surface but did overestimate the warming effect by a mean value of 0 9 greater simulated soil temperature differences between the treatments than observed during the later period is probably due to overestimating g under plastic mulch conditions 4 4 simulated effects of plastic mulch on evapotranspiration plastic mulch affects the actual evaporation ae by reducing potential evaporation pe because the plastic mulch provides a physical barrier to water vapor transfer eqn 23 simulated daily pe with the tpm treatment was lower than for ck during the entire growing period in all three years fig 9a simulated pe differences between ck and tpm occurred in the early growth stages due to the greater canopy coverage in the later growth stages resulting in less radiation penetrating the maize canopy to the soil surface for evaporating soil water cumulative pe for tpm over the three years was 158 111 and 128 mm which was 44 56 and 47 lower than ck 284 254 and 241 mm soil water storage was insufficient to meet pe demand leading to lower ae than pe for both ck and tpm treatments fig 9a simulated ae of tpm was lower than ck for most of the growing season during all three years however ae of tpm was higher than that of ck when the surface soil moisture content of ck was lower than that of tpm although there was a high pe capacity with ck during these times there was not enough water for evaporation cumulative ae for tpm was 86 66 and 61 mm which decreased by 28 42 and 31 respectively compared with ck 120 113 and 88 mm during the three growing seasons 2014 2016 gong et al 2017 also concluded that plastic mulch reduced total growing season evaporation compared with no mulched treatment differences in the effect of plastic mulching on ae over the three years indicate that the plastic mulch s effects on evaporation vary with soil moisture conditions affected by rainfall irrigation etc and climatic conditions interannual regional differences there was little difference between potential transpiration pt and actual transpiration at for both treatments fig 9b indicating that soil moisture was not a limiting factor for transpiration the average daily at values for tpm were 91 94 and 94 of pt for tpm for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively the corresponding average daily at values for ck were 91 92 and 94 of pt for ck pt for tpm was nearly identical to that for ck in 2014 and higher than ck in 2015 and 2016 the pt difference between the two mulch treatments was related to measured differences in lai with greater lai in the tpm treatment resulting in greater pt in 2015 and 2016 cumulative pt of tpm was 153 279 and 232 mm which was 1 35 and 9 greater than simulated pt of ck 152 206 and 212 mm for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively similarly cumulative at of tpm was 139 261 and 219 mm which was 1 37 and 10 greater than ck 138 190 and 199 mm in 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively cumulative aet with tpm was 225 327 and 280 mm which was 13 less 8 greater and 2 less than the cumulative aet with ck 258 303 and 287 mm for 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively fig 9c gong et al 2017 and fan et al 2017 reported that plastic mulch decreased aet due to the shortened growth period while wu et al 2017 reported that plastic mulch increased aet due to better soil water conditions and improved maize growth their results indicated that the higher aet values for tpm compared to ck were reasonable many production systems in china use plastic mulch to reduce evaporation and it has been proven to be effective gong et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b simulations with the rz shaw model can better reflect the decrease in soil evaporation that occurs with the use of plastic mulch both the simulated evaporation rate and the seasonal evaporation total were seen to be lower with the plastic mulch treatment than with the non mulched treatment during the three years fig 9 however some studies have shown that plastic mulch can improve lai and increase transpiration zhang et al 2018b thus total seasonal et may be larger or smaller with plastic mulch compared to that without mulch depending on the reduction in surface evaporation and the change in the fraction of total et that is transpiration in this study the simulated seasonal transpiration with plastic mulch was similar 2014 or larger 2015 and 2016 than with the ck treatment which was commensurate with measured lai and soil water content conditions in all three years of the study some previous studies have shown that plastic mulch can reduce total evapotranspiration compared with a non mulched treatment gong et al 2017 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b the reasons for that result were either that plastic mulch can accelerate the growth process and shorten the growth period or that evaporation reduction is greater than transpiration increase however some studies have shown that evapotranspiration with plastic mulch was greater than with non mulched conditions chen et al 2015 li et al 2013a these different results among previous studies may be caused by local differences in precipitation timing and amount during the growing season 4 5 simulated effects of plastic mulch on surface energy fluxes plastic mulch can increase substrate albedo resulting in less simulated shortwave and longwave radiation being received by the soil surface under tpm treatment than under ck fig 10c f which agrees with results of chung and horton 1987 li et al 2016 and liakatas et al 1986 simulated soil rn for tpm was about 78 of rn for ck over the growing season fig 11a which is similar to the measured 80 as reported by li et al 2016 for plastic mulching in a cotton field simulated soil rs for tpm was about 75 of rs for ck fig 11b which is lower than the value of 84 measured by li et al 2016 li et al 2016 reported that measured soil rl under plastic mulch were nearly the same as ck in contrast our simulated values of soil rl for tpm were about 30 of rl for ck fig 11c suggesting that the model may have underestimated the soil rl for tpm however since soil rl was small this underestimation of soil rl under plastic mulch should not have a big impact on soil rn fig 11a the difference in soil rn between tpm and ck treatments decreased as lai and canopy coverage increased because more radiation was intercepted by the canopy so differences in substrate albedo were less influential for the canopy plastic soil system plastic mulch reduced simulated net radiation in the soil layer but it also absorbed shortwave radiation fig 10b and emitted longwave radiation fig 10e meanwhile the denser maize canopy for tpm compared to ck intercepted more shortwave radiation fig 10a overall the slightly lower total seasonal rn received by tpm 101 w m 2 compared to ck 104 w m 2 agrees with other previously reported results fan et al 2017 li et al 2016 the slope of the regression between total rn in the ck and tpm treatments was 1 0 fig 13a which compares with a smaller regression slope 0 9 between rn in a maize field with and without plastic mulch reported by fan et al 2017 and zhang et al 2018b we suspect therefore that this means rz shaw may overestimate the total rn differences between ck and tpm simulated sensible heat h for tpm was lower than for ck fig 12b f especially before canopy closure which occurred on 15 august h between substrate beneath the plastic and the atmosphere first passes through the layer of still air beneath the plastic by molecular diffusion and is then transmitted above the plastic by turbulent transfer processes the plastic mulch acts as a barrier to the direct turbulent exchange of the heated air under the mulch with air above it the molecular diffusion coefficient is much smaller than the turbulent diffusion coefficient during energy transfer so the sensible heat exchange of the soil under the plastic mulch is inhibited rz shaw was able to simulate this barrier effect and the slope of the regression between h for ck and tpm was 0 7 fig 13b indicating that h for tpm was about 70 of ck during the entire growing season lvet for both ck and tpm treatments showed typical seasonal variation increasing from june to august and then decreasing slowly to harvest fig 12c g in response to lai this result is likely because the lvet for tpm mainly comes from plant transpiration in the early growing stages from sowing to mid july when plant transpiration is low the barrier effect of the plastic mulch on evaporation leads to a lower lvet under tpm than under ck when the maize canopy was completely closed the contribution of evaporation to lvet was reduced and the effect of plastic mulch on lvet was lessened therefore the difference in lvet between ck and tpm became less obvious during later growth stages the average lvet for tpm during the entire growing season was 74 w m 2 which is higher than for ck 69 w m 2 and fig 13c shows that lvet for tpm was about 115 of lvet for ck in 2015 simulated soil heat flux g under tpm was higher than under ck during the growing season especially in the early part of the growing season fig 12d h which agrees with the results of fan et al 2017 the average g for tpm was 4 0 w m 2 with a standard deviation of 56 3 w m 2 while the average g for ck was 2 2 w m 2 with a standard deviation of 44 6 w m 2 which means that the plastic mulch increased soil heat flux into deeper soil layers the slope of the regression between g for ck and tpm treatments was 1 22 fig 13d indicating that g for tpm was about 122 of g for ck over the entire growing season accumulated g positive and negative values will offset for tpm and ck during the growing season was 12 2 kj m 2 and 6 7 kj m 2 respectively however accumulated g before 15 august for tpm and ck were 18 0 kj m 2 and 12 3 kj m 2 and were 5 9 mj m 2 and 5 7 mj m 2 respectively after 15 august these results indicate that the soil mainly receives heat before canopy closure and mainly releases heat after canopy closure also the increased g for tpm compared with ck was mainly due to the greater amount of heat received during the early growth stages as g was not much different between the two treatments in the later growth stages after canopy closure 5 conclusions the modified rz shaw model produced reasonable simulation trends for soil water soil temperature evapotranspiration and energy fluxes for the plastic mulch treatment from 2014 2016 plastic mulch increased soil temperature about 1 0 2 1 in 0 100 cm especially in surface soil layer during early growing season the model was able to mimic the increased soil temperatures under the mulch treatment compared to the non mulched treatment very little difference in water content was found between the treatments for either the simulated or measured values based on comparisons between simulated and observed values the model was able to adequately simulate soil water content under plastic mulch at different soil depths during the three years of the study with a mean root mean square error rmse value of 0 024 cm3 cm 3 in all soil layers the model did however simulate the reduced evaporation due to mulch and the consequent transpiration increase although measurements are not available to confirm this model observation when simulating the use of plastic mulch the model may overestimate rn and g and underestimate h and lvet resulting in an overestimation of soil temperature the current modified rz shaw model can be used as a decision tool for irrigation water management and automatic irrigation under plastic mulch plastic cover ratio adjustment optimize the parameters of the mulching film and even explore the feasibility of maize planting in areas limited by cold temperatures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
