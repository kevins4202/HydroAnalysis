10170,combining an olive growth simulation model with a specific module for economic components namely net margin nm and irrigation water productivity iwp resulted in the adaptaolive v2 0 model this model used with perturbed climate pc and impact response surfaces irs provided a tool that enabled the assessment of the impact of climate change on economic components of mediterranean olive groves in southern spain under future mild winter conditions reductions in nm and iwp are expected negative nm values may even be registered with water availability having a relatively small effect on the results in the opposite case under future cool winter conditions nm and iwp will increase except for rainfed olive groves under low rainfall conditions with water availability playing a major role in addition the distance in terms of changes in temperature and rainfall compared to baseline conditions to critical thresholds such as negative nm or iwp lower than irrigation water cost was assessed identifying changes depending on weather conditions water cost and olive oil price thus future temperature increases of around 3 ºc under mild winter conditions could generate negative values of nm these economic results impact the performance of adaptation strategies for olive groves even ruling out some strategies that were previously recommended when only agronomic components were taken into account e g deficit irrigation under mild winter conditions there is thus a need for site specific recommendations related to the use of irrigation and olive orchard management to maintain or increase the sustainability of these cropping systems despite the utility of using pc and irs to achieve a scientifically sound evaluation of mediterranean olive groves under future weather conditions the approach presents some limitations that can be overcome using climate model outputs keywords net margin irrigation water productivity crop simulation model adaptation measures impact response surfaces 1 introduction olive groves are cultivated in approximately 10 0 mha of the mediterranean basin representing around 95 of the total cultivated area with olive trees in the world eurostat 2019 faostat 2020 and andalusia the southernmost region of spain is the main olive oil producing region with around 35 of the world s total production in recent years and with about 1 61 mha of olive groves cagpds 2019 2020 ioc 2020 the olive grove constitutes a critical component of the economy of many regions in the mediterranean basin loumou and giourga 2003 however these agricultural systems are currently negatively affected by various critical factors many of which are related to economic components such as the high olive oil production costs and low prices of olive oil cicek 2011 gómez limón et al 2012 ponti et al 2014 mairech et al 2020 moreover the lack of alternatives to olive groves is threatening the economic and social sustainability of the traditional mediterranean agricultural areas and is even exacerbating rural depopulation processes battino and lampreu 2019 in addition the impacts of climate change on olive cultivation gabaldón leal et al 2017 lorite et al 2018 fraga et al 2019 could accelerate the manifestation of these threats in some of these areas tanasijevic et al 2014 cabezas et al 2020 recent studies have evaluated the impact of climate change on mediterranean olive orchards focusing on the balance between positive and negative effects on agronomic components such as olive yield or irrigation requirements valverde et al 2015 morales et al 2016 lorite et al 2018 for example the lack of chilling de melo abreu et al 2004 gabaldón leal et al 2017 or the increase in atmospheric co2 morales et al 2016 have a contrasting effect on olive tree production in this context strategies for adaptation to climate change such as selection of the olive cultivars gabaldón leal et al 2017 or deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 egea et al 2017 constitute essential tools to ensure the sustainability of many olive growing areas however an economic evaluation of these systems is required before promoting specific recommendations rodríguez sousa et al 2019 although there are numerous studies analyzing irrigation water productivity iwp and net margin nm separately very few integrate both components specifically for olive orchards e g lorite et al 2007 exposito and berbel 2017 fernández et al 2020 nor have they been incorporated into any analyses of climate change adaptation in addition the spatial component is key especially in mediterranean regions such as andalusia where there is very high spatial heterogeneity in olive farm characteristics and management lorite et al 2004 and topographical and weather conditions ramírez cuesta et al 2017 traditionally studies on the impact of climate change on agriculture have used climate model projections webber et al 2018 regional climate models rcms are especially useful for large scale studies and when high resolution is required for instance due to complex topography as is the case of the andalusian region however in spite of the continuous improvement of the rcms giorgi and gutowski 2015 their outputs still present biases dosio 2016 moreover although the impact of weather conditions on crop yield usually follows a smooth response function steduto et al 2009 heat events garcía lopez et al 2014 or failure to fulfill chill requirements lorite et al 2020 have a non smooth response with large changes from a fixed temperature related threshold an alternative approach is the use of perturbed climate pc and impact response surfaces irs which provide a detailed characterization of crop behavior under a wide range of weather conditions including those representing heat and water stresses pirttioja et al 2015 2019 ruiz ramos et al 2018 fronzek et al 2018a 2019 however most of these studies primarily focus on cereals only a few have addressed the impact of climate change on the agronomic components of the olive grove cabezas et al 2020 and none have explored its economic components the objective of this study was to assess the impact of climate change on economic components nm and iwp of irrigated mediterranean olive orchards by considering a specific simulation model for olive orchards adaptaolive v2 0 lorite et al 2018 cabezas et al 2020 and using pc in combination with the irs approach 2 material and methods 2 1 approach the adaptaolive v2 0 model integrates key crop production functions for simulating critical processes that affect olive crop yield and irrigation requirements the model considers an olive oil production function depending on crop transpiration orgaz et al 2006 the increase in transpiration efficiency caused by crop water stress bacelar et al 2007 and by the increase in atmospheric co2 tognetti et al 2001 the impact of heat stress during flowering koubouris et al 2009 lopez bernal et al 2018 and the flowering failure caused by unfulfilled chilling requirements de melo abreu et al 2004 gabaldón leal et al 2017 a full description of the adaptaolive model can be found in lorite et al 2018 and in cabezas et al 2020 for the effects of lack of chilling and heat stress included in the improved version adaptaolive v2 0 in this study an economic module has been added to adaptaolive v2 0 it provides values for net margin nm and irrigation water productivity iwp based on mesa jurado et al 2010 nm was defined as 1 nm y p k h k w w fic fc avc where nm is the net margin ha 1 y the simulated olive oil production kg ha 1 p the olive oil price kg 1 k h the harvesting cost kg 1 k w the variable cost of irrigation m 3 w the amount of irrigation water used m3 ha 1 fic and fc the fixed costs of irrigation and other fixed costs ha 1 respectively and avc the average of variable costs except harvesting costs ha 1 in addition nm stability was analyzed by calculating the interannual nm variability with standard deviation sd as the coefficient of variation cv cannot be used due to the occurrence of negative values irrigation water productivity iwp considers the income associated with irrigation supply and was calculated as 2 iwp y y rainfed p w where iwp is the irrigation water productivity m 3 y and y rainfed are the simulated olive oil production kg ha 1 under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively 2 2 scenarios adaptaolive v2 0 requires a setup of the simulation experiment where the olive orchard and soil features are defined the reference scenario s0 which represents the new intensive olive orchards in andalusia southern spain had the following characteristics picual cultivar the most cultivated variety in the region with high chilling requirements de melo abreu et al 2004 soil with an effective depth of 1 2 m and plant density of 250 trees per ha with average tree crown diameter of 5 m water cost was estimated at 0 26 m 3 and olive oil price at 2 36 kg 1 table 1 both values based on mesa jurado et al 2010 having defined the reference scenario s0 five additional economic scenarios were analyzed table 1 these scenarios were based on increases in water costs s1 and s2 decreases in olive oil price s3 and s4 and combined water cost increase and oil price reduction s5 for each scenario three irrigation strategies rainfed r0 deficit irrigation di and full irrigation fi were considered seasonal irrigation water supply for fi under baseline conditions was around 4360 m3 ha 1 with this volume reduced by around two thirds for di about 1420 m3 ha 1 under future weather conditions the irrigation water supply will be increased by up to 17 cabezas et al 2020 2 3 weather conditions daily weather data solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and reference evapotranspiration from the weather stations belonging to the spanish state meteorology agency aemet at four locations representative of the olive growing areas cordoba granada jaen and seville and in alternative future area jerez in andalusia for the period 1981 2010 were considered baseline b table 2 in cordoba jerez and seville the average annual rainfall values were similar 590 570 and 540 mm respectively jaen had lower average rainfall 475 mm while granada was the driest location 365 mm seville and jerez had mild winter temperatures resulting in the earliest flowering date and the lowest average maximum temperatures during flowering tmf at around 30 0 ºc cordoba and jaen had colder winter temperatures and thus later flowering with tmf around 31 6 ºc finally granada had the latest flowering date due to having the coldest winter temperatures with tmf equal to 34 8 ºc table 2 perturbed climate pc datasets were built based on the methodology described in pirttioja et al 2015 thus all the daily observed temperature t and precipitation p values of the baseline period 1981 2010 were modified using a constant incremental factor 1 c and 5 respectively from 1 c to 8 c for t and from 60 to 10 for p to obtain 149 pc datasets composed of pairs of δt and δp for each location the perturbation range was taken from pirttioja et al 2015 and ruiz ramos el al 2018 which in turn had been set to encompass projected climate changes in spain by the mid 21st century for the sres a1b emissions scenario in harris et al 2010 and in projections from an ensemble of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 ipcc 2013 for each pc dataset all the economic scenarios and irrigation strategies were evaluated under three atmospheric co2 concentrations i 380 ppm for baseline b 1981 2010 conditions ii 529 ppm for representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 in the near future nf 2040 2069 and far future ff 2070 2099 and for rcp 8 5 in the nf and iii 622 ppm for rcp 8 5 in the ff table 2 van vuuren et al 2001 the results of adaptaolive v2 0 considering these datasets scenarios and strategies were used to build impact response surfaces irs describing the olive orchard response to combined changes in t and p impact response surfaces irs make it possible to carry out advanced analyses of the crop response to a wide range of systematic changes in weather conditions thus irs enabled the identification of the changes in t and p from b 0 c 0 that allow the cropping system to remain below the critical biophysical and economic thresholds such as nm equal to or lower than zero or irrigation water costs higher than iwp finally daily time step observed and scenario climate data on a grid with 25 km 25 km spatial resolution was considered the dataset covers the period 1981 2010 for observations and the periods 2040 2069 nf and 2070 2099 ff for 5 gcms gfdl cm3 giss e2 r hadgem2 es miroc5 and mpi esm mr 2 forcing scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 van vuuren et al 2001 the joint research centre s jrc agri4cast gridded dataset was used for the baseline and the climate models were selected following webber et al 2018 the climate projections were calculated using an enhanced delta change method that involves applying a delta change factor to baseline observations considering temperature and precipitation variability and changes in mean climate fronzek et al 2018b the overlap between the climate projections provided by climate models and the irs plots enables the probabilistic assessment of climate change impact on economic components nm and iwp of the analyzed olive orchards to determine this overlap the average range of climate projections for each rcp and period was represented by a triangle with the vertices indicating the average extreme δt and δp values of the five climate models considered in each rcp 3 results 3 1 impact of climate change on net margin considering the s0 scenario and rainfed conditions r0 for the baseline b period net margin nm ranged from 925 ha 1 under dry conditions in granada to 2856 ha 1 under humid conditions in jerez table 3 under future weather conditions compared to b nm increased under cold winter conditions such as those identified in granada jaen and cordoba under rcp4 5 nf and decreased under mild winter conditions such as those identified in jerez and seville under rcp4 5 nf figs 1 and 2 and table 3 for the b period the introduction of di or fi strategies compared to r0 generated small increases in nm under humid conditions 9 6 and 8 9 for di and 14 9 and 11 6 for fi in jerez and cordoba respectively but large increases under very dry conditions 135 1 and 138 1 for di and fi respectively in granada table 3 comparing fi and di strategies for the b period fi provided higher nm values than di in all the analyzed locations table 3 however under future weather conditions nm with fi was smaller than with di in locations with mild winter conditions but greater under cold winter conditions fig 1 and table 3 analyzing irs to assess future climate perturbations for which nm would be negative under rainfed conditions r0 provided the following combinations of t and p changes 3 ºc 45 0 ºc 38 and 6 8 ºc 0 in locations with cold winters granada and 3 2 ºc 0 or 1 6 ºc 60 in locations with mild winters seville fig 1 with irrigation changes in p had a very limited effect on the isoline corresponding to nm 0 as nm isolines were near vertical the combinations for di were 6 8 ºc 0 and 3 2 0 and for fi were 6 5 ºc 0 and 3 ºc 0 for granada and seville respectively fig 1 analyzing the probability of occurrence of nm 0 under b and r0 the driest analyzed location granada showed the highest values 37 with very low probability in the rest of the analyzed locations fig 3 however under future weather conditions the probability of nm 0 fell in locations periods under cold winter conditions such as granada and increased in locations periods under mild winter conditions fig 3 with irrigation the probability of nm 0 was lower compared to r0 showing values close to zero in those locations periods under cold winter conditions such as granada and jaen and values around 80 under mild winter conditions such as in seville fig 3 the irrigation water cost threshold iwct the point from which nm was negative under b conditions ranged between 0 73 and 1 14 m 3 and between 1 52 and 3 57 m 3 with fi and di respectively with the lowest values in dry locations such as granada and the highest in the humid ones such as jerez fig 4 under future weather conditions iwct increased in locations under cold winter conditions such as granada or jaen and was lower in locations under mild winter conditions such as seville and jerez remaining higher with di than with fi fig 4 comparing the averaged water cost in the guadalquivir basin around 0 15 m 3 with iwct the probability of occurrence of the economic unsustainability of irrigation irrigation water costs higher than the generated profit under b conditions was null for both fi and di strategies except in the driest location granada with probabilities of 3 3 and 10 for di and fi respectively under future weather conditions the probability of occurrence remained close to zero under cold winter conditions in jaen and granada but increased to values higher than 60 under mild winter conditions in jerez and seville fig 4 interannual nm variability under cold and dry conditions such as in granada was relatively high and similar under all the climate scenarios and irrigation strategies with sd values around 1000 1500 ha 1 fig 5 under moderate weather conditions very low variability with fi and di was registered with the highest under r0 finally nm variability increased with the emergence of weather components that cause severe yield damage such as mild winter temperatures and fi strategies as high nm under favorable winter conditions alternates with negative nm under mild winter conditions fig 5 however under extreme weather conditions the nm variability was very low in most of the simulated years due to zero yield fig 5 3 2 irrigation water productivity iwp considering s0 under b conditions iwp ranged from 0 53 to 0 96 m 3 with di and from 0 39 to 0 59 m 3 with fi with the lowest values recorded in cordoba and the highest in granada table 4 under future weather conditions iwp decreased under mild winter conditions such as in seville and jerez and increased under cold winter conditions such as in granada figs 6 and 7 and table 4 considering the irrigation water cost k w equal to 0 26 m 3 di and fi were profitable iwp k w under dry and cold winter conditions such as in granada fig 6 and table 4 but under specific mild winter conditions such as in seville under rcp4 5 ff irrigation was unsustainable iwp k w fig 6 and table 4 similarly for increases in t relative to b of around 3 5 2 and 7 1 ºc in seville jaen and granada respectively the economic sustainability of irrigation would be compromised fig 6 3 3 identifying adaptation strategies combining nm and iwp when the irrigated system is economically sustainable nm 0 and iwp k w efforts should be focused on increasing efficiency and promoting good environmental practices this was the case with both di and fi strategies in all the locations under b and rcp4 5 nf with the performance worsening under mild winter conditions figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 when nm 0 and iwp k w the reduction or elimination of irrigation and or the selection of cultivars with lower chilling requirements should be considered this only occurred in jerez with fi under rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 nf figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 when nm 0 and iwp k w the recommended strategy is an increase in irrigation water supply and efficiency and the use of cultivars with lower chilling requirements this situation was found in seville with di under rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 nf figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 finally when nm 0 and iwp k w the olive production is not sustainable requiring changes in cultivar and or irrigation method in order to increase yield or the planting of alternative crops this situation was found in seville and jerez with fi under future climate projections figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 under rainfed conditions nm 0 indicates the need to implement management improvements to increase yield such as the introduction of supplementary or deficit irrigation enhanced soil management etc whether or not the introduction of irrigation would be recommended would depend on k w and the estimated value of iwp as described above nm 0 under r0 was found in seville under rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 and cordoba and jerez under rcp8 5 ff figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 3 4 economic sustainability of olive orchards under future oil price water cost scenarios increases in water costs generated reductions in nm with the largest nm decreases detected under dry conditions under future weather conditions smaller nm reductions were found under cold conditions in granada and larger ones under mild winter conditions in jerez and seville fig 8 similarly olive oil price decreases led to reductions in nm with the largest nm reduction under cold weather conditions in granada under future weather conditions smaller reductions were found in all the locations except under mild winter conditions such as in jerez and seville fig 8 finally increases in water costs combined with olive oil price reductions generated large nm reductions with granada showing the largest under future climate projections nm reductions were smaller under cold winter conditions and larger under mild winter conditions fig 8 iwp was not affected by changes in water costs changing by the same percentage as the olive oil price fig 8 water cost increases and olive oil price reductions affected the irs for nm reducing the distance in terms of t and p perturbations to the economic sustainability thresholds nm 0 for rainfed and irrigated strategies figs 1 9 1s 2s and 3s similarly olive oil price reductions affected the irs for iwp reducing the distance to the economic sustainability thresholds iwp k w for example considering k w 0 26 m 3 in granada when oil olive prices increased scenario s4 the changes in t from b conditions at which iwp k w with di moved from 7 1 to 6 7 ºc and with fi from 6 6 to 6 0 ºc figs 6 and 10 similar results were obtained for the rest of the locations and scenarios figs 6 and 4s 4 discussion the use of a crop simulation model specific to mediterranean olive orchards adaptaolive v2 0 including functions for evaluating net margin nm and irrigation water productivity iwp in combination with perturbed climate pc and impact response surfaces irs has proven to be a valuable complementary tool for assessing the economic impact of climate change on olive orchards the economic performance of mediterranean olive groves for the future climate scenarios is affected by flowering failure associated with the lack of chill accumulation and by crop water stress linked to low precipitation thus average impacts of climate change on nm and iwp for olive orchards in southern spain are moderate coinciding with results obtained in previous studies for olive in sicily migliore et al 2019 however under specific weather conditions especially those related with mild temperatures during winter severe nm and iwp reductions were identified moreover the present study identified a higher vulnerability of the olive groves to t increase and p decrease when the olive oil price falls than when water costs rise given the substantial benefits of irrigation in terms of olive yield gains nm became much more sensitive to olive oil prices this relevance of olive oil price was previously reported by çetin et al 2004 de gennaro et al 2012 gómez limón et al 2012 or dag et al 2014 the role played by water costs in nm varied between locations as areas with high irrigation requirements such as granada were the most vulnerable to increases in water costs moreover in addition to water availability water costs influenced the recommendations related to irrigation strategy thus the most suitable irrigation strategy was driven mainly by water costs and weather conditions when water costs increased di was a better option than fi once the main impacts of climate change on mediterranean olive orchards have been assessed the appropriate adaptation and sustainable intensification strategies can be identified and selected for irrigated orchards strategies based on improvements in water management and efficiency such as di were identified as suitable adaptation strategies when considering economic components this is in line with previous studies where di strategies fereres and soriano 2007 were found to be key for achieving sustainable water use fernández 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 exposito and berbel 2017 however these adaptation strategies require in addition to water availability specific t conditions related to chill accumulation such as those identified in granada and jaen in locations with mild winter conditions such as jerez and seville irrigation was less relevant the improvement achieved by irrigation was minimized and di did not generate positive nm and or high iwp values the failure to fulfill chilling requirements had a decisive effect on the economic results due to the high correlation between winter t and olive yield de melo abreu et al 2004 thus irrigation should be reconsidered and the correct selection of cultivars crops adapted to mild winter weather conditions promoted moreover adaptation strategies could have collateral effects which should be considered from an economic point of view in those locations periods with adverse weather conditions that cannot be compensated through irrigation supply such as lack of chilling irrigation generated high levels of instability in nm although fi could currently help to stabilize nm as is observed under b future weather conditions led to alternating high and limited zero yields generating large fluctuations in yield these fluctuations could overlap with those generated by the alternate bearing that typically occurs in olive bustan et al 2011 exacerbating the negative economic impacts for farmers conversely under dry and cold winter conditions low nm variability was found especially under fi these findings underscore the uncertainty involved in identifying adaptation strategies as ronchail et al 2014 and fereres and villalobos 2016 described even when widely accepted strategies such as di are considered the use of pc and irs is an alternative tool for managing the uncertainty from average climate projections and for assessing the changes in weather conditions that surpass critical thresholds of economic components such as negative nm or iwp lower than irrigation water costs thus pc and irs allow the identification of those changes in t and p for each location beyond which irrigation is economically unsustainable despite the utility of these applications the pc approach presents some limitations daily temperature and precipitation time series change only in their central tendency measures and variance in the case of precipitation therefore the occurrence of weather extremes is not properly represented this could be problematic in regions such as the mediterranean basin where climate model projections point to the relevance of changes in the future seasonality of t and p as well as in the number and intensity of rainfall events ipcc 2013 pirttioja et al 2015 leolini et al 2019 further studies are planned to examine this seasonality by constructing the pc with the seasonal pattern change following fronzek et al 2010 or ruiz ramos et al 2018 an alternative approach would be to use direct outputs from climate models as inputs for crop models as in the studies on olive carried out by de melo abreu et al 2004 tanasijevic et al 2014 ben zaied and zouabi 2016 morales et al 2016 and lorite et al 2018 in addition despite the advances in the knowledge about the behavior of olive groves under future weather conditions there are still limitations related to crop modeling our model adaptaolive v2 0 includes relevant functions for assessing olive yield and irrigation requirements but does not account for pests diseases alternate bearing nutrient deficiencies and incorrect irrigation management this means that nm and iwp values could be overestimated compared with real field observations and must be considered as potential values the improvement of crop models to account for all these factors and to consider the interactions between them remains an outstanding challenge 5 conclusions the combination of crop modeling integrating agronomic and economic factors perturbed climate impact response surfaces and climate change projections has proven to be an effective methodology for assessing the impact of climate change and for developing and evaluating site specific adaptation measures for the mediterranean olive grove the impact of climate change on the economic sustainability of mediterranean olive orchards differs depending on the future weather conditions in specific locations thus under mild winter conditions a clear reduction in net margin nm and irrigation water productivity iwp was forecasted for both irrigated and rainfed orchards conversely under cold winter conditions increases in nm and iwp were projected with decreases only found under extreme climate projections based on these impacts and depending on the site specific values of nm and iwp i e surpassing relevant thresholds such as nm 0 and iwp irrigation water costs recommendations for increasing the economic sustainability of mediterranean olive groves include changing to olive cultivars with lower chilling requirements introducing irrigation and increasing irrigation supply and irrigation efficiency the approach used here enabled the identification of average future weather conditions that could jeopardize the sustainability of olive cultivation in southern spain however complementary analysis should be undertaken to assess the effects of the extreme events on this cropping system by jointly considering improved crop models and climate models

yield and irrigation requirements the model considers an olive oil production function depending on crop transpiration orgaz et al 2006 the increase in transpiration efficiency caused by crop water stress bacelar et al 2007 and by the increase in atmospheric co2 tognetti et al 2001 the impact of heat stress during flowering koubouris et al 2009 lopez bernal et al 2018 and the flowering failure caused by unfulfilled chilling requirements de melo abreu et al 2004 gabaldón leal et al 2017 a full description of the adaptaolive model can be found in lorite et al 2018 and in cabezas et al 2020 for the effects of lack of chilling and heat stress included in the improved version adaptaolive v2 0 in this study an economic module has been added to adaptaolive v2 0 it provides values for net margin nm and irrigation water productivity iwp based on mesa jurado et al 2010 nm was defined as 1 nm y p k h k w w fic fc avc where nm is the net margin ha 1 y the simulated olive oil production kg ha 1 p the olive oil price kg 1 k h the harvesting cost kg 1 k w the variable cost of irrigation m 3 w the amount of irrigation water used m3 ha 1 fic and fc the fixed costs of irrigation and other fixed costs ha 1 respectively and avc the average of variable costs except harvesting costs ha 1 in addition nm stability was analyzed by calculating the interannual nm variability with standard deviation sd as the coefficient of variation cv cannot be used due to the occurrence of negative values irrigation water productivity iwp considers the income associated with irrigation supply and was calculated as 2 iwp y y rainfed p w where iwp is the irrigation water productivity m 3 y and y rainfed are the simulated olive oil production kg ha 1 under irrigated and rainfed conditions respectively 2 2 scenarios adaptaolive v2 0 requires a setup of the simulation experiment where the olive orchard and soil features are defined the reference scenario s0 which represents the new intensive olive orchards in andalusia southern spain had the following characteristics picual cultivar the most cultivated variety in the region with high chilling requirements de melo abreu et al 2004 soil with an effective depth of 1 2 m and plant density of 250 trees per ha with average tree crown diameter of 5 m water cost was estimated at 0 26 m 3 and olive oil price at 2 36 kg 1 table 1 both values based on mesa jurado et al 2010 having defined the reference scenario s0 five additional economic scenarios were analyzed table 1 these scenarios were based on increases in water costs s1 and s2 decreases in olive oil price s3 and s4 and combined water cost increase and oil price reduction s5 for each scenario three irrigation strategies rainfed r0 deficit irrigation di and full irrigation fi were considered seasonal irrigation water supply for fi under baseline conditions was around 4360 m3 ha 1 with this volume reduced by around two thirds for di about 1420 m3 ha 1 under future weather conditions the irrigation water supply will be increased by up to 17 cabezas et al 2020 2 3 weather conditions daily weather data solar radiation maximum and minimum temperatures precipitation and reference evapotranspiration from the weather stations belonging to the spanish state meteorology agency aemet at four locations representative of the olive growing areas cordoba granada jaen and seville and in alternative future area jerez in andalusia for the period 1981 2010 were considered baseline b table 2 in cordoba jerez and seville the average annual rainfall values were similar 590 570 and 540 mm respectively jaen had lower average rainfall 475 mm while granada was the driest location 365 mm seville and jerez had mild winter temperatures resulting in the earliest flowering date and the lowest average maximum temperatures during flowering tmf at around 30 0 ºc cordoba and jaen had colder winter temperatures and thus later flowering with tmf around 31 6 ºc finally granada had the latest flowering date due to having the coldest winter temperatures with tmf equal to 34 8 ºc table 2 perturbed climate pc datasets were built based on the methodology described in pirttioja et al 2015 thus all the daily observed temperature t and precipitation p values of the baseline period 1981 2010 were modified using a constant incremental factor 1 c and 5 respectively from 1 c to 8 c for t and from 60 to 10 for p to obtain 149 pc datasets composed of pairs of δt and δp for each location the perturbation range was taken from pirttioja et al 2015 and ruiz ramos el al 2018 which in turn had been set to encompass projected climate changes in spain by the mid 21st century for the sres a1b emissions scenario in harris et al 2010 and in projections from an ensemble of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 ipcc 2013 for each pc dataset all the economic scenarios and irrigation strategies were evaluated under three atmospheric co2 concentrations i 380 ppm for baseline b 1981 2010 conditions ii 529 ppm for representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 in the near future nf 2040 2069 and far future ff 2070 2099 and for rcp 8 5 in the nf and iii 622 ppm for rcp 8 5 in the ff table 2 van vuuren et al 2001 the results of adaptaolive v2 0 considering these datasets scenarios and strategies were used to build impact response surfaces irs describing the olive orchard response to combined changes in t and p impact response surfaces irs make it possible to carry out advanced analyses of the crop response to a wide range of systematic changes in weather conditions thus irs enabled the identification of the changes in t and p from b 0 c 0 that allow the cropping system to remain below the critical biophysical and economic thresholds such as nm equal to or lower than zero or irrigation water costs higher than iwp finally daily time step observed and scenario climate data on a grid with 25 km 25 km spatial resolution was considered the dataset covers the period 1981 2010 for observations and the periods 2040 2069 nf and 2070 2099 ff for 5 gcms gfdl cm3 giss e2 r hadgem2 es miroc5 and mpi esm mr 2 forcing scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 van vuuren et al 2001 the joint research centre s jrc agri4cast gridded dataset was used for the baseline and the climate models were selected following webber et al 2018 the climate projections were calculated using an enhanced delta change method that involves applying a delta change factor to baseline observations considering temperature and precipitation variability and changes in mean climate fronzek et al 2018b the overlap between the climate projections provided by climate models and the irs plots enables the probabilistic assessment of climate change impact on economic components nm and iwp of the analyzed olive orchards to determine this overlap the average range of climate projections for each rcp and period was represented by a triangle with the vertices indicating the average extreme δt and δp values of the five climate models considered in each rcp 3 results 3 1 impact of climate change on net margin considering the s0 scenario and rainfed conditions r0 for the baseline b period net margin nm ranged from 925 ha 1 under dry conditions in granada to 2856 ha 1 under humid conditions in jerez table 3 under future weather conditions compared to b nm increased under cold winter conditions such as those identified in granada jaen and cordoba under rcp4 5 nf and decreased under mild winter conditions such as those identified in jerez and seville under rcp4 5 nf figs 1 and 2 and table 3 for the b period the introduction of di or fi strategies compared to r0 generated small increases in nm under humid conditions 9 6 and 8 9 for di and 14 9 and 11 6 for fi in jerez and cordoba respectively but large increases under very dry conditions 135 1 and 138 1 for di and fi respectively in granada table 3 comparing fi and di strategies for the b period fi provided higher nm values than di in all the analyzed locations table 3 however under future weather conditions nm with fi was smaller than with di in locations with mild winter conditions but greater under cold winter conditions fig 1 and table 3 analyzing irs to assess future climate perturbations for which nm would be negative under rainfed conditions r0 provided the following combinations of t and p changes 3 ºc 45 0 ºc 38 and 6 8 ºc 0 in locations with cold winters granada and 3 2 ºc 0 or 1 6 ºc 60 in locations with mild winters seville fig 1 with irrigation changes in p had a very limited effect on the isoline corresponding to nm 0 as nm isolines were near vertical the combinations for di were 6 8 ºc 0 and 3 2 0 and for fi were 6 5 ºc 0 and 3 ºc 0 for granada and seville respectively fig 1 analyzing the probability of occurrence of nm 0 under b and r0 the driest analyzed location granada showed the highest values 37 with very low probability in the rest of the analyzed locations fig 3 however under future weather conditions the probability of nm 0 fell in locations periods under cold winter conditions such as granada and increased in locations periods under mild winter conditions fig 3 with irrigation the probability of nm 0 was lower compared to r0 showing values close to zero in those locations periods under cold winter conditions such as granada and jaen and values around 80 under mild winter conditions such as in seville fig 3 the irrigation water cost threshold iwct the point from which nm was negative under b conditions ranged between 0 73 and 1 14 m 3 and between 1 52 and 3 57 m 3 with fi and di respectively with the lowest values in dry locations such as granada and the highest in the humid ones such as jerez fig 4 under future weather conditions iwct increased in locations under cold winter conditions such as granada or jaen and was lower in locations under mild winter conditions such as seville and jerez remaining higher with di than with fi fig 4 comparing the averaged water cost in the guadalquivir basin around 0 15 m 3 with iwct the probability of occurrence of the economic unsustainability of irrigation irrigation water costs higher than the generated profit under b conditions was null for both fi and di strategies except in the driest location granada with probabilities of 3 3 and 10 for di and fi respectively under future weather conditions the probability of occurrence remained close to zero under cold winter conditions in jaen and granada but increased to values higher than 60 under mild winter conditions in jerez and seville fig 4 interannual nm variability under cold and dry conditions such as in granada was relatively high and similar under all the climate scenarios and irrigation strategies with sd values around 1000 1500 ha 1 fig 5 under moderate weather conditions very low variability with fi and di was registered with the highest under r0 finally nm variability increased with the emergence of weather components that cause severe yield damage such as mild winter temperatures and fi strategies as high nm under favorable winter conditions alternates with negative nm under mild winter conditions fig 5 however under extreme weather conditions the nm variability was very low in most of the simulated years due to zero yield fig 5 3 2 irrigation water productivity iwp considering s0 under b conditions iwp ranged from 0 53 to 0 96 m 3 with di and from 0 39 to 0 59 m 3 with fi with the lowest values recorded in cordoba and the highest in granada table 4 under future weather conditions iwp decreased under mild winter conditions such as in seville and jerez and increased under cold winter conditions such as in granada figs 6 and 7 and table 4 considering the irrigation water cost k w equal to 0 26 m 3 di and fi were profitable iwp k w under dry and cold winter conditions such as in granada fig 6 and table 4 but under specific mild winter conditions such as in seville under rcp4 5 ff irrigation was unsustainable iwp k w fig 6 and table 4 similarly for increases in t relative to b of around 3 5 2 and 7 1 ºc in seville jaen and granada respectively the economic sustainability of irrigation would be compromised fig 6 3 3 identifying adaptation strategies combining nm and iwp when the irrigated system is economically sustainable nm 0 and iwp k w efforts should be focused on increasing efficiency and promoting good environmental practices this was the case with both di and fi strategies in all the locations under b and rcp4 5 nf with the performance worsening under mild winter conditions figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 when nm 0 and iwp k w the reduction or elimination of irrigation and or the selection of cultivars with lower chilling requirements should be considered this only occurred in jerez with fi under rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 nf figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 when nm 0 and iwp k w the recommended strategy is an increase in irrigation water supply and efficiency and the use of cultivars with lower chilling requirements this situation was found in seville with di under rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 nf figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 finally when nm 0 and iwp k w the olive production is not sustainable requiring changes in cultivar and or irrigation method in order to increase yield or the planting of alternative crops this situation was found in seville and jerez with fi under future climate projections figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 under rainfed conditions nm 0 indicates the need to implement management improvements to increase yield such as the introduction of supplementary or deficit irrigation enhanced soil management etc whether or not the introduction of irrigation would be recommended would depend on k w and the estimated value of iwp as described above nm 0 under r0 was found in seville under rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 and cordoba and jerez under rcp8 5 ff figs 1 and 6 and tables 3 and 4 3 4 economic sustainability of olive orchards under future oil price water cost scenarios increases in water costs generated reductions in nm with the largest nm decreases detected under dry conditions under future weather conditions smaller nm reductions were found under cold conditions in granada and larger ones under mild winter conditions in jerez and seville fig 8 similarly olive oil price decreases led to reductions in nm with the largest nm reduction under cold weather conditions in granada under future weather conditions smaller reductions were found in all the locations except under mild winter conditions such as in jerez and seville fig 8 finally increases in water costs combined with olive oil price reductions generated large nm reductions with granada showing the largest under future climate projections nm reductions were smaller under cold winter conditions and larger under mild winter conditions fig 8 iwp was not affected by changes in water costs changing by the same percentage as the olive oil price fig 8 water cost increases and olive oil price reductions affected the irs for nm reducing the distance in terms of t and p perturbations to the economic sustainability thresholds nm 0 for rainfed and irrigated strategies figs 1 9 1s 2s and 3s similarly olive oil price reductions affected the irs for iwp reducing the distance to the economic sustainability thresholds iwp k w for example considering k w 0 26 m 3 in granada when oil olive prices increased scenario s4 the changes in t from b conditions at which iwp k w with di moved from 7 1 to 6 7 ºc and with fi from 6 6 to 6 0 ºc figs 6 and 10 similar results were obtained for the rest of the locations and scenarios figs 6 and 4s 4 discussion the use of a crop simulation model specific to mediterranean olive orchards adaptaolive v2 0 including functions for evaluating net margin nm and irrigation water productivity iwp in combination with perturbed climate pc and impact response surfaces irs has proven to be a valuable complementary tool for assessing the economic impact of climate change on olive orchards the economic performance of mediterranean olive groves for the future climate scenarios is affected by flowering failure associated with the lack of chill accumulation and by crop water stress linked to low precipitation thus average impacts of climate change on nm and iwp for olive orchards in southern spain are moderate coinciding with results obtained in previous studies for olive in sicily migliore et al 2019 however under specific weather conditions especially those related with mild temperatures during winter severe nm and iwp reductions were identified moreover the present study identified a higher vulnerability of the olive groves to t increase and p decrease when the olive oil price falls than when water costs rise given the substantial benefits of irrigation in terms of olive yield gains nm became much more sensitive to olive oil prices this relevance of olive oil price was previously reported by çetin et al 2004 de gennaro et al 2012 gómez limón et al 2012 or dag et al 2014 the role played by water costs in nm varied between locations as areas with high irrigation requirements such as granada were the most vulnerable to increases in water costs moreover in addition to water availability water costs influenced the recommendations related to irrigation strategy thus the most suitable irrigation strategy was driven mainly by water costs and weather conditions when water costs increased di was a better option than fi once the main impacts of climate change on mediterranean olive orchards have been assessed the appropriate adaptation and sustainable intensification strategies can be identified and selected for irrigated orchards strategies based on improvements in water management and efficiency such as di were identified as suitable adaptation strategies when considering economic components this is in line with previous studies where di strategies fereres and soriano 2007 were found to be key for achieving sustainable water use fernández 2013 ahumada orellana et al 2017 exposito and berbel 2017 however these adaptation strategies require in addition to water availability specific t conditions related to chill accumulation such as those identified in granada and jaen in locations with mild winter conditions such as jerez and seville irrigation was less relevant the improvement achieved by irrigation was minimized and di did not generate positive nm and or high iwp values the failure to fulfill chilling requirements had a decisive effect on the economic results due to the high correlation between winter t and olive yield de melo abreu et al 2004 thus irrigation should be reconsidered and the correct selection of cultivars crops adapted to mild winter weather conditions promoted moreover adaptation strategies could have collateral effects which should be considered from an economic point of view in those locations periods with adverse weather conditions that cannot be compensated through irrigation supply such as lack of chilling irrigation generated high levels of instability in nm although fi could currently help to stabilize nm as is observed under b future weather conditions led to alternating high and limited zero yields generating large fluctuations in yield these fluctuations could overlap with those generated by the alternate bearing that typically occurs in olive bustan et al 2011 exacerbating the negative economic impacts for farmers conversely under dry and cold winter conditions low nm variability was found especially under fi these findings underscore the uncertainty involved in identifying adaptation strategies as ronchail et al 2014 and fereres and villalobos 2016 described even when widely accepted strategies such as di are considered the use of pc and irs is an alternative tool for managing the uncertainty from average climate projections and for assessing the changes in weather conditions that surpass critical thresholds of economic components such as negative nm or iwp lower than irrigation water costs thus pc and irs allow the identification of those changes in t and p for each location beyond which irrigation is economically unsustainable despite the utility of these applications the pc approach presents some limitations daily temperature and precipitation time series change only in their central tendency measures and variance in the case of precipitation therefore the occurrence of weather extremes is not properly represented this could be problematic in regions such as the mediterranean basin where climate model projections point to the relevance of changes in the future seasonality of t and p as well as in the number and intensity of rainfall events ipcc 2013 pirttioja et al 2015 leolini et al 2019 further studies are planned to examine this seasonality by constructing the pc with the seasonal pattern change following fronzek et al 2010 or ruiz ramos et al 2018 an alternative approach would be to use direct outputs from climate models as inputs for crop models as in the studies on olive carried out by de melo abreu et al 2004 tanasijevic et al 2014 ben zaied and zouabi 2016 morales et al 2016 and lorite et al 2018 in addition despite the advances in the knowledge about the behavior of olive groves under future weather conditions there are still limitations related to crop modeling our model adaptaolive v2 0 includes relevant functions for assessing olive yield and irrigation requirements but does not account for pests diseases alternate bearing nutrient deficiencies and incorrect irrigation management this means that nm and iwp values could be overestimated compared with real field observations and must be considered as potential values the improvement of crop models to account for all these factors and to consider the interactions between them remains an outstanding challenge 5 conclusions the combination of crop modeling integrating agronomic and economic factors perturbed climate impact response surfaces and climate change projections has proven to be an effective methodology for assessing the impact of climate change and for developing and evaluating site specific adaptation measures for the mediterranean olive grove the impact of climate change on the economic sustainability of mediterranean olive orchards differs depending on the future weather conditions in specific locations thus under mild winter conditions a clear reduction in net margin nm and irrigation water productivity iwp was forecasted for both irrigated and rainfed orchards conversely under cold winter conditions increases in nm and iwp were projected with decreases only found under extreme climate projections based on these impacts and depending on the site specific values of nm and iwp i e surpassing relevant thresholds such as nm 0 and iwp irrigation water costs recommendations for increasing the economic sustainability of mediterranean olive groves include changing to olive cultivars with lower chilling requirements introducing irrigation and increasing irrigation supply and irrigation efficiency the approach used here enabled the identification of average future weather conditions that could jeopardize the sustainability of olive cultivation in southern spain however complementary analysis should be undertaken to assess the effects of the extreme events on this cropping system by jointly considering improved crop models and climate models

10171,to improve the performance of border irrigation this study analyzed the spatial variability characteristics of the soil particle content and bulk density based on soil physical parameters measured at 86 sampling points in the hetao irrigation district hid the soil hydraulic parameters were determined using the retc and hydrus 1d was then adopted to estimate infiltration parameters of the kostiakov equation at different locations the optimal layout patterns of border size were proposed under the consideration of various combinations of different typical soil textures and field slopes by winsrfr the results indicated that the spatial distributions of clay and silt particle contents were generally high in the middle and low at both sides of the hid while the sand was the opposite the results proved that the soil physical parameters are only to be measured at depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to meet the needs of infiltration parameter estimation which can significantly reduce the workload of soil sample collection moreover two types of optimal border layouts of different combinations of the soil textures silt loam and silt clay loam and field slopes no more than 1 1 3 and 3 5 were proposed which can guarantee the application efficiency and distribution uniformity no less than 85 and be the guidance for practical field irrigation in the hid keywords border size infiltration parameters numerical simulation spatial distribution characteristics soil hydraulic parameters 1 introduction border irrigation a method of crop irrigation is widely used because of its low cost and energy requirement however border irrigation systems are often inefficient due to over irrigation and poor application uniformity gillies and smith 2015 morris et al 2015 chari et al 2019 advanced simulation models of surface irrigation have been proven to be effective for evaluating system design and management and for improving irrigation performance infiltration parameters are essential input parameters for surface irrigation simulation models bautista et al 2009 salahou et al 2018 smith et al 2018 therefore obtaining realistic estimates for infiltration parameters is vital soil infiltration parameters are usually determined by direct or indirect methods the direct method often uses single ring or double ring experimental data to determine the infiltration parameters gillies 2008 duan et al 2011 and the indirect method such as the one point or two point method applies data regarding the water movement of surface irrigation to invert the infiltration parameters elliott and walker 1982 valiantzas et al 2001 however both direct and indirect methods are very time consuming moreover those methods are difficult to use for the estimation of infiltration parameters at the scale of an irrigation district due to the large area of an irrigation district soil physical parameters i e soil texture bulk density soil water content etc may have significant variations these factors then may lead to variability of infiltration how to determine the infiltration parameters of an irrigation district is a crucial problem wosten and van genuchten 1988 argued that acquiring infiltration parameters for an irrigation district is difficult or unnecessary however these parameters can be estimated by some simple methods because soil properties determine the infiltration capacity the pedotransfer function ptf can be established the ptf relates the estimated infiltration parameters to easily measured soil properties botula et al 2012 nguyen et al 2015 nie et al 2017 liao et al 2020 retc software proposed by the usda agricultural research service is a software package that estimates the soil hydraulic parameters on the basis of easily measured soil physical parameters e g soil particle content and bulk density many studies have proven that retc software estimates of soil hydraulic parameters are reliable wei et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 for parameters such as saturated water conductivity the maximum relative error between the estimated and measured values is approximately 30 however the soil water diffusion error is relatively small in low suction sections which are required for the design of field irrigation systems wei et al 2004 therefore estimating soil hydraulic parameters by using retc software is of practical value with the estimated soil hydraulic parameters input into the hydrus software simunek et al 2016 the infiltration process under different soil initial conditions can be simulated and the corresponding infiltration parameters obtained hydrus software is one of the most user friendly models that can be used in the ms windows environment it is a software package for simulating water heat and solute movement in a variably saturated media and the reliability of the simulation results are proven by many studies kandelous and simunek 2010 honari et al 2017 tu et al 2021 er raki et al 2021 therefore retc and hydrus softwares can provide rapid and accurate estimates of infiltration parameters for an irrigation district numerous factors can affect the performance of border irrigation including natural factors i e soil texture and infiltration characteristics and irrigation technology elements e g border size discharge and cutoff time natural factors are not easy to change therefore researchers seek to improve the performance of border irrigation by optimizing the combination of irrigation technology elements playan et al 1996 showed that the performance of border irrigation could be improved using laser leveling techniques to reduce the impact of the field micro topography sanchez et al 2009 analyzed the effects of different irrigation techniques on the performance of furrow irrigation and the results proved that the irrigation performance could be significantly improved by selecting reasonable values for the discharge and cutoff time gillies et al 2011 improved the performance of furrow irrigation by optimizing the cutoff time according to the soil infiltration variability reddy et al 2013 analyzed the effects of discharge changes on irrigation performance and the results indicated that the performance of furrow irrigation could be significantly improved by selecting a reasonable discharge chen et al 2013 improved the performance of border irrigation by optimizing the length and width of the field and the results indicated that the irrigation performance of the optimized border size average increased by 26 7 compared with that before optimization akbari et al 2018 improved the performance of irrigation by optimizing the field size by using a metaheuristic algorithm smith et al 2018 used the maximum application efficiency as an objective and a tail water rate less than 5 as a constraint the results proved that the irrigation performance could be significantly improved by selecting a reasonable cutoff time salahou et al 2018 analyzed the influences of discharges per unit width and the cutoff time on the performance of border irrigation and optimized the cutoff times of different discharges per unit width on the basis of field experiments xu et al 2019 proposed an optimal combination of the cutoff time and discharges per unit width in their study area through irrigation experiments of different crop growth stages the aforementioned research results have improved the design and management of border irrigation systems and have contributed to the improvement of irrigation performance however these studies have mainly focused on field scales resulting in limitations on the applications of these research results at an irrigation district scale the reasons are the large area of the irrigation district and the soil physical parameters may have significant variations making the determination of infiltration parameters on irrigation district scale more difficult than that on field scales therefore the hetao irrigation district hid was selected as a typical research area in this study on the basis of soil physical parameters soil particle content and bulk density measured at 86 sampling points the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the spatial variability characteristics of the soil particle content and bulk density in the hid 2 to estimate the soil infiltration parameters of the kostiakov equation at different sampling points with hydrus 1d and 3 to propose the optimal layout patterns of border size under various combinations of different typical soil textures and field slopes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments of closed end border irrigation the hid located in inner mongolia is one of the largest irrigation districts in china with 570 000 ha of irrigated land which is mainly distributed in dengkou hanggin rear banner linhe wuyuan and urad front banner fig 1 the hid is mainly planted with spring wheat corn and sunflowers the average annual rainfall is near 200 mm and the evaporation is 2000 2400 mm which means only irrigated agriculture is feasible miao et al 2015 the hid is an alluvial plain of the yellow river and the overall topography is flat with an elevation of 1007 1050 m high in the southwest and low in the northeast and a slope of 0 13 0 20 the canal network is supplied directly from the yellow river and the sublateral canal flow is generally 0 015 0 030 m3 s 1 zheng et al 2009 in practical the field length is approximately 50 m and the width is 10 30 m in the hid and border irrigation is the most commonly used irrigation method by the farmers however very often unreasonable field sizes and poor management lead to poor irrigation performance miao et al 2015 bai 2016 fan et al 2019 eighty six sampling points were set these points were approximately divided into a 10 10 km square grid pattern according to the objectives of this study the latitude and longitude of each sampling point were determined by gps the specific distribution of sampling points is displayed in fig 1 because the roots of wheat corn and sunflowers are mainly distributed no more than 60 cm below the surface soil samples were collected at three depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm with a soil auger soil particle content was determined with a mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer on the basis of the usa reclassified standard the soil particle fractionation of clay is 0 002 mm that of silt is 0 002 0 05 mm and that of sand is 0 05 2 mm and the soil water contents were measured using the weighing method the bulk density was also measured using weighing method which sampled by undisturbed soil cores with a metal cylinders of 100 cm3 volume from a digged profile with the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm while on one hand it is difficult to dig the soil profile at the depth below 40 cm to obtain the undisturbed soil core then the bulk density of 40 60 cm were not measured on the other hand the main influence of field tillage is on the depth of 0 20 cm and for the bulk density of depth below 20 cm are though variant the variations could be relatively small abbasi et al 2003 ebrahimian et al 2013 salahou et al 2018 therefore the bulk density for 40 60 cm was substituted by 20 40 cm in the following sections around each sampling point 3 4 lines were selected along the planting direction for a length not less than 30 m to determine the field slope and the average value was taken as the field slope of the sampling point 2 2 spatial variability analysis of soil physical parameters the descriptive statistics of the soil physical parameters including the minimum maximum mean x m standard deviation σ coefficient of variation c v baskan et al 2009 x m σ and c v can be calculated using the following equations 1 σ i 1 n x i x m 2 n 1 1 2 2 x m 1 n i 1 n x i 3 c v σ x where σ is the standard deviation x i is the measured soil physical parameters of the ith sampling point x m is the mean value n is the number of samples n 86 in this study and c v is the coefficient of variation which reflects the variation degree of the soil physical parameters i e c v 0 1 represents weak variability 0 1 c v 1 0 represents moderate variability and c v 1 0 represents strong variability hillel 1980 because the statistical method do not consider the correlation between sampling points when analyzing the variation of soil physical parameters which is different from the practical situation therefore the geostatistical method are applied to analyze the spatial structure and distribution characteristics of soil physical parameters the semivariance γ h is the basis for geostatistics method to explain the spatial structure of soil physical parameters which can be calculated by the following equation moustafa 2000 4 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where h is the lag distance n h is the number of pairs separated by lag distance z x i and z x i h are the measured values at locations x i and x i h respectively if the γ h increases with distance and stabilizes at the a priori variance value it means that the variable under study is spatially correlated and all neighbors within the correlation range can be used to interpolate values where they were not measured the γ h of the soil physical parameters were calculated by geostatistical software gs gamma design software llc michigan usa based on the selection of the minimum residual sums of squares rss and the maximum determinate coefficient r 2 different theoretical models exponential gaussian spherical and linear model are selected to fit the γ h to obtain the optimal model according to the optimal semivariance model the spatial variability characteristics of the soil physical parameters can be obtained that is the nugget value c 0 the sill value c 0 c and the range among them c 0 c 0 c represents the degree of spatial dependent of regional variables the proportion of the spatial variation caused by the random part to the total variation of the system if the value of c 0 c 0 c is no more than 0 25 the variable was considered strongly spatial dependent if it varies from 0 25 to 0 75 the variable was considered moderately spatial dependent and with above 0 75 means that the spatial dependent of variables is weakly cambardella et al 1994 on the basis of the above analysis the kriging method in arcgis environmental systems research institute california usa is used to draw the spatial distribution map of soil physical parameters in the hid 2 3 method of estimating the soil infiltration parameters the determination of soil infiltration parameters is vital for the design of any border irrigation system because of the large area of the hid it would be difficult to estimate the infiltration parameters through direct measurement or indirect inversion by using the water movement of border irrigation therefore in this study the infiltration parameters were estimated as follows 1 soil hydraulic parameters were estimated on the basis of the measured soil physical parameters specifically the measured soil particle content and bulk density of each sampling point were entered as input into retc software then the soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten mualem vgm model were estimated because the vgm model is widely adopted for the construction of soil water retention curves through the retc van genuchten et al 1991 the vgm model can be written as follows van genuchten 1980 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e l m m 2 6 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 β h n m where k h represents the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm min 1 s e is the effective saturation of water in soil k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm min 1 θ is the volumetric moisture content cm3 cm 3 θ r is the residual soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 θ s is the saturated moisture content cm3 cm 3 l is usually equal to 0 5 m n β and l are empirical parameters of the soil water characteristic curve m 1 1 n and l is usually equal to 0 5 2 the soil infiltration process was simulated using hydrus 1d and the equation of soil water movement during vertical infiltration can be expressed as follows nie et al 2018a 7 θ t z k h h z 1 where z is the vertical coordinate for which the downward direction is considered as positive h is the soil water pressure head cm t is the time min and t 1000 min the initial and boundary conditions for the simulation of vertical infiltration can be expressed as follows 8 h z t h n 0 z z t 0 h h 0 t 0 z 0 h h n t 0 z z where h n is the pressure head corresponding to the measured soil initial water content condition cm h0 is the water depth h0 5 cm in this study and z is the maximum vertical depth of the simulated domain z 100 cm was adopted in this study the soil hydraulic parameters were entered as input into hydrus 1d in two simulation scenarios henceforth referred to as sim 1 and sim 2 for sim 1 the soil was divided into two layers specifically 0 20 and 20 100 cm the estimated soil hydraulic parameters for 20 40 cm represented the values for 20 100 cm for sim 2 the soil was divided into three layers specifically 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm the estimated soil hydraulic parameters for 40 60 cm represented the values for 40 100 cm 3 the kostiakov equation was used to fit the soil infiltration parameters the soil infiltration process can be described by the kostiakov equation for border irrigation alvarez 2003 playan et al 2004 holzapfel et al 2004 burguete et al 2009 which can be written as follows 9 i k t α where i is the cumulative infiltration cm k is the infiltration coefficient cm min a and a is the infiltration index 2 4 optimization method for the border size winsrfr 4 1 which was proposed by the usda agricultural research service is an integrated software package for analyzing surface irrigation systems it consists of two models the zero inertia zi and kinematic wave models chen et al 2013 in this study the zi model was selected to simulate the performance of border irrigation the zi model used in the simulation can be represented as follows 10 h 0 t q x i t 0 11 h x s 0 s f where q is the discharge per unit width m3 m 1 min 1 x is the distance from the field inlet m and s 0 and s f are the field slope and friction slope respectively three categories of parameters were entered as input into winsrfr 4 1 namely soil parameters geometric parameters and management parameters katopodes et al 1990 the first category of parameters represented infiltration and roughness the roughness of border irrigation ranged from 0 08 to 0 16 in the hid bai 2016 however it is insensitive of roughness variations on the advance trajectory and irrigation performance basen on many studies nie et al 2014 salahou et al 2018 smith et al 2018 therefore the roughness was selected as a typical representative value i e 0 12 in this study and the infiltration parameters were determined according to the estimation results of the proposed method in this study the second category consisted of geometrical parameters including the field slope length and width the field slope was determined according to the measured values in this study the field length was approximately 50 m and the width was 10 30 m according to the objectives of this study and the actual situation of the irrigation district the field length range was determined to be 50 150 m the width was calculated according to the optimized discharge per unit width the third category represented the management alternatives available to the irrigator these included the required water depth discharge and cutoff time the required water depth was 100 mm in this study which is a common value for the border irrigation system design in the hid zheng et al 2009 bai 2016 miao et al 2018 the sublateral canal flow was generally 0 015 0 030 m3 s 1 in the hid zheng et al 2009 and the average value of 0 023 m3 s 1 was used in this study the farmers in northern china typically set the cutoff time at the moment the water reaches the downstream end pereira et al 2007 chen et al 2013 nie et al 2018b therefore for practical purposes the cutoff time in this study was defined as the time at which the water reached the downstream end the application efficiency e a and distribution uniformity d u are often used as the design criteria for the border irrigation system horst et al 2005 zheng et al 2009 chen et al 2013 miao et al 2015 and they can be calculated as follows 12 e a w s w f 100 13 d u z l q z a v 100 where w s is the average depth of infiltrated water stored in the root zone mm w f is the average depth of applied water mm z lq is the low quarter average infiltrated depth mm and z av is the average depth of infiltration water mm the border layout patterns for the hid under various combinations of different typical soil textures and field slopes were optimized with winsrfr 4 1 by using e a and d u no less than 85 as constraints 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variability of soil physical parameters statistical analysis was conducted on the measured soil physical parameters at three depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm of 86 sampling points fig 1 the highest mean values of the silt particle content at the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were 58 12 55 47 and 59 32 respectively table 1 the c v values were within the medium variation interval 0 1 c v 1 0 however the values were only 0 17 0 18 and 0 17 for the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively which indicated that the variability of the silt particle content was relatively low moreover the mean clay particle were 22 43 22 14 and 20 96 respectively and the c v were 0 29 0 36 and 0 31 respectively for the aforementioned three depths thus the clay content variability was moderate and higher than the silt particle content variability the mean contents of sand particles were the lowest which were 19 45 22 39 and 19 72 however the degree of variation was the highest and the c v were 0 72 0 57 and 0 57 these results may have been obtained because the hid is the alluvial plain of the yellow river and the soil parent material is mainly sediments which leads to variability in the soil particle distribution in particular the variability of the sand particles was more significant than the other variability values the variation of the soil bulk density was small at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm the mean soil bulk density values were 1 54 and 1 53 g cm 3 and the c v were 0 07 and 0 08 which indicated weak variability c v 0 1 the results proved that the variability of the soil bulk density was relatively uniform in the hid the reason for these results may be that the farming methods crop planting structure and irrigation methods have basically remained unchanged for many years considering that the hid is an alluvial plain of the yellow river the variation in the soil bulk density is expected to be weak the optimal semivariance models of soil physical parameters were all the exponential models except for the clay at the depth of 40 60 cm was gaussian model in the hid table 1 the c 0 of soil particle content and bulk density were nearly close to 0 with the maximum was only 1 81 indicating that the variation caused by measurement errors and the spatial sources of variation at distances smaller than the sampling point interval were all small mubarak et al 2010 the c 0 c 0 c of the soil particle content changed to a range of 0 27 0 48 indicating that the soil particle content have moderately spatial dependent the c 0 c 0 c of soil bulk density at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm were 0 11 and 0 18 respectively which indicated soil bulk density had a strongly spatial dependent meanwhile the range of the soil physical parameters varied from 17 7 to 36 9 km table 1 which were larger than the sampling point interval approximately 10 km indicating that the sampling point interval in this study can better reflect the spatial structure of soil physical parameters in the hid the kriging method in arcgis was used to draw the spatial distribution map of soil particle content in the hid the spatial distributions of soil particle content exhibited regularity for the 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm layers fig 2 the clay particle content values were 5 86 44 87 at depths of 0 20 cm the areas with low clay content were mainly distributed in dengkou and urat front banner and the areas with high clay content were mainly distributed in the hanggin rear banner and the northern part of linhe the clay particle content values were 7 75 46 73 and 7 98 39 44 at depths of 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively and the spatial distributions were similar for the clay particle content at 0 20 cm depth the soil silt particle contents were 20 74 74 71 21 40 72 62 and 23 24 79 84 at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively the spatial distributions of silt particle content values were similar at the three depths the high value areas were mainly located in linhe and hanggin rear banner and the low value areas were distributed in dengkou and urat front banner the sand particle content values were 0 21 73 25 2 13 55 72 and 3 16 62 73 at the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively the spatial distributions of the sand particle content values were similar at the three depths the high value areas were mainly located in the southeast of dengkou and urat front banner and the low value areas were distributed in hanggin rear banner and linhe in general the clay and silt particle contents were high in the middle and low on both sides of the hid whereas the spatial distribution of sand particle content was low in the middle and high on both sides of the district the reason for this result may be that the soil sandification of dengkou and urat front banner is severe at both sides of the hid long term desertification erosion tends to change the distributions of soil particles resulting in increased sand particle content on both sides of the irrigation district alluvial soil is mainly distributed in the middle of the irrigation district which tends to increase the clay and silt particle content in this area the particle content in each vertical profile 0 60 cm was averaged to determine the soil texture at each sampling point the results proved that the soil texture was mainly silt loam which accounted for 55 81 of all sampling points this finding is consistent with the soil texture classification results of zhang et al 2015 the next most common component was silt clay loam with a proportion of 29 07 in addition the hid contains small amounts of loam sandy loam clay loam silt clay sand and other materials these materials accounted for only 15 12 of the measured materials in this study therefore the silt loam and silt clay loam were selected as typical soil textures and optimized for the border size 3 2 determination of soil infiltration parameters the measured soil particle content and bulk density were input into the retc software and the soil hydraulic parameters in the vgm model were estimated the soil bulk density for 40 60 cm was substituted by the measured values for 20 40 cm statistical analysis was performed on the estimated parameters and the results are listed in table 2 significant differences were calculated for the distribution characteristics of soil hydraulic parameters at three depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm the spatial distributions of θ r θ s and n were relatively uniform and the maximum values of c v were 0 285 0 117 and 0 076 respectively the reason for this result may be that the spatial distributions of the soil bulk density clay and silt particle contents were relatively uniform table 1 and fig 2 the results also indicated that the variation of the sand particle content had little effect on the estimation results of θ r θ s and n the variations of β and k s obtained from different depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were significant and the minimum values of c v were 0 726 and 0 402 the results indicated that the variation of soil particle content and the bulk density had significant effects on β and k s in particular the variation of sand particle content had notably significant effects on β and k s which is consistent with the results of liu et al 2010 the estimated soil hydraulic parameters were input into hydrus 1d and the infiltration processes of randomly selected sampling points in the two simulation scenarios were simulated and compared the infiltration simulation results were similar in the two simulation scenarios fig 3 the soil hydraulic parameters of the two simulation scenarios were the same at the soil depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm a notable difference was that the soil hydraulic parameters used for the depth of 40 100 cm were the same as the values estimated of 20 40 cm in sim 1 while 40 60 cm depth in sim 2 miyazaki 1988 and wu et al 2015 have proven that the infiltration capacity is mainly controlled by the soil layers with weak infiltration capacity thus the soil infiltration process depended on the infiltration characteristics of the soil for a depth of 0 20 or 20 40 cm at most sampling points the kostiakov equation eq 9 was used to fit the infiltration parameters simulated by each sampling point and the k and a determined in the two simulation scenarios were compared the results indicated that the k and a determined in the two simulation scenarios were evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line fig 4 significance testing revealed that no significant difference existed p 0 05 in the values of k and a in the two simulation scenarios which indicated that the difference in the infiltration parameters estimated under the two simulation scenarios was small the results also indicated that dividing the soil profile into two layers 0 20 and below 20 cm depth can meet the requirements of infiltration parameter determination the k and a were 28 69 89 44 mm hr a and 0 308 0 649 respectively at all sampling points in the hid under sim 1 fig 4 the practical significance of this result is that in the process of soil sample collection the soil physical parameters e g soil particle content and bulk density only need to be measured for the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to determine the infiltration parameters of the hid which can significantly reduce the workload of soil sample collection 3 3 optimization of the border size in the hetao irrigation district according to the aforementioned analysis the ratio of silt loam and silt clay loam for all sampling points was 84 88 therefore silt loam and silt clay loam were selected as typical soil textures for simulation analysis with winsrfr 4 1 and the irrigation performance indicators e a and d u under different factors such as the soil texture field slope border length and discharge per unit width were obtained the infiltration parameters were set to the mean value of the soil texture thus for silt loam k 65 84 mm hr a and a 0 477 whereas for silt clay loam k 60 81 mm hr a and a 0 462 the statistical software analyzed the measured field slopes of all sampling points in the hid and the field slopes were mainly distributed below 5 the field slopes of less than 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and 4 5 were accounted for 5 81 11 63 26 74 19 77 and 20 93 of all sampling points respectively therefore the field slopes were selected as 1 2 3 4 and 5 in the process of border size optimization in the simulations the discharge per unit width were 1 2 3 4 and 5 l s m 1 while the length of the field were 50 70 90 110 130 and 150 m the cutoff time was set according to the irrigation practices of the local farmers i e the moment water reaches the downstream end in total both silt loam and silt clay loam were conducted 150 groups of simulation combinations respectively then the contours of e a and d u with the border length and the discharge per unit width were plotted in matlab the silt loam texture of fig 5 is one example considering the actual situation of border irrigation both e a and d u were constrained at no less than 85 thus the reasonable border sizes can be obtained under different field slope conditions of silt loam texture fig 5 and the same research method was adopted for the silt clay loam note that the confirmation of the scopes of border length and the discharge per unit width are the intersection for both e a and d u that all no less than 85 the results are listed in table 3 when the slope of the field is 1 a high e a and d u can be obtained using a short border length and large discharge per unit width table 3 because the silt loam and the silt clay loam in the hid tend to demonstrate low infiltration capacity fig 4 irrigation under a field slope of 1 is similar to level border irrigation any large discharge per unit width enables the water flow to spread through the field quickly resulting in high values of e a and d u fig 5 whenever the slope of the field is larger than 1 a long border length and a small discharge per unit width may be used to obtain high irrigation performance fig 5 because the flow velocity increases as the field slope increases a small discharge per unit width can be adopted to avoid the accumulation of water in the downstream area and insufficient water in the upstream area therefore according to the optimization results in table 3 and the actual situation of the existing border size in the hid two types of optimal layout patterns for the border size are proposed in this study layout pattern 1 retains the existing field length 50 m and reduces the border width to 6 10 m when the field slope is more than 1 if the length of the field 50 m is to be maintained constant the laser land leveling technique should be used to reduce the field slope to 1 and below and the border width should be reduced to 6 10 m layout pattern 2 is intended for usage in areas where laser leveling techniques are relatively difficult to perform when the field slope of the silt loam and the silt clay loam is 1 3 the fields can be merged along their longest sides the length of a field can be 100 m and the width can be 10 12 m when the field slope is 3 5 the length of a field is 150 m and the width is 16 20 m because of the large optimized width 2 3 inlets are recommended to be set along the width to avoid excessive lateral flow during the irrigation process which affects the consistency of the simulation results the water advancement along the border length and the actual water advancement process bai 2016 3 4 the verify of the border irrigation experiments the border irrigation experiments were conducted in tabu village of dengkou the upstream of the hid jinbu village of linhe the midstream of the hid and the yifeng village of wuyuan the middle and lower reaches of the hid on august 2020 with the soil texture of silt loam silt clay loam and silt clay loam respectively the selected typical borders were leveled by laser land leveling technology before the corn planting the soil water contents were measured before and after 1 day of the border irrigation of 8 measuring points in each typical border with a total measured depth of 1 m 5 layers with each layer depth of 0 2 m the time of water advance and recession to each observation point were measured every 5 m set an observation point the discharge was measured by the triangular weir and the parameters of the border irrigation are shown in table 4 the irrigation performance indicators as shown in table 4 can be obtained according to the measured soil water contents fig 6 the cutoff time and the discharge based on the optimized border size combined with laser land leveling technology the e a varies from 95 5 to 98 1 with a mean value of 97 0 and the d u varies from 93 7 to 98 1 with a mean value of 95 1 indicating that the high irrigation performance of the border irrigation experiments the reason is that most of the soil in the hid has low infiltration capacity fig 4 when the field slope is less than 1 it is similar to level border irrigation any large discharge enables the water flow to spread through the field quickly resulting in high values of e a and d u therefore it shows that the optimized border layout pattern 1 is reasonable in hid and for the optimized layout pattern 2 it has not been verified due to the limitation of experimental conditions 3 5 discussion the results of geostatistical analysis showed that the ratio of the c 0 c 0 c of the soil physical parameters varied from 0 11 to 0 48 in the hid table 1 indicating that they have strongly or moderately spatial dependent and the spatial variability was mainly caused by structural factors such as the soil parent material topography etc because the hid is an alluvial plain of the yellow river which flows from the west to the east such that the coarse grained sediment carried in the irrigation water is deposited in the western zone and the fine grained sediment is deposited in the central and eastern zones of the hid this observation is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2015 the random factors such as the soil cultivation irrigation and other human activities factors though have relatively weak influence on the spatial structure of soil physical parameters in the hid however the planting area and irrigated area have expanded by nearly 3 times in the past 70 years which has also affected the spatial structure of soil physical parameters for example dengkou is located on the eastern edge of ulanbuh desert and urat front banner is located downstream of the hid the soil sandification in dengkou and urat front banner is severe because of human activities long term desertification has also changed the soil particle content distribution which has led to increased sand particle content on both sides of the irrigation district and increased clay and silt particle content in the middle of the irrigation district fig 2 russo and jury 1987 pointed out that when using geostatistics method to analyze the spatial variation of regional variables the minimum sampling grid interval should be less than 1 2 of the range to accurately reflect the spatial structure of variables and distribution characteristics consequently the sampling point interval was about 10 km in this study fig 1 and the ranges of soil physical parameters were 17 7 36 9 km table 3 which approximately satisfies the requirements that the grid interval less than half of the range although the sampling point interval used can better reflect the spatial structure and distribution characteristics of soil physical parameters in the hid it is necessary to note that using a large sampling point interval may have a problem of distortion in the description of the spatial structure of the semivariance model for the soil physical parameters moreover the soil physical parameters at all sampling points do not strictly satisfy the second order stability assumption so that the use of kriging method to draw the spatial distribution map may also be distorted locally and cannot reflect the local variation of soil physical parameters because of the variability of soil physical parameters zeleke and si 2005 mubarak et al 2010 some differences can be observed in the soil particle content and bulk density even for the same soil texture these differences affect the infiltration characteristics thus the estimated results affect the infiltration parameters zheng et al 2009 estimated the infiltration parameters of silt loam by using the border irrigation data for the linhe the midstream of the hid the k and a in their studies ranged from 43 79 to 46 62 mm hr a and 0 57 0 58 respectively miao et al 2015 estimated that the k and a were 30 11 66 01 mm hr a and 0 49 0 62 in dengkou the upstream of the hid respectively bai 2016 estimated that the k and a of the silt loam were 37 12 40 84 mm hr a and 0 39 0 45 in the linhe the midstream of the hid respectively fan et al 2019 estimated the infiltration parameters by using the border irrigation data for linhe the midstream of the hid in their study the k and a were 24 79 76 35 mm hr a and 0 32 0 61 respectively in the results of aforementioned research the k and a ranged from 24 79 to 76 35 mm hr a and 0 32 0 65 respectively in this study the k and a were estimated to be 28 69 89 44 mm hr a and 0 308 0 649 respectively fig 4 these results are consistent with the aforementioned research which indicates that the proposed method is reliable for estimating infiltration parameters in this study the results revealed that the soil physical parameters only need to be measured at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to meet the requirements of infiltration parameter determination in the hid according to eqs 12 and 13 in this study it can be known that the z r has no effect on d u while there are two cases on e a when the depth of applied water at some certain position of the field is not greater than z r and there is no effect on e a otherwise when it is greater than z r the e a increases with z r and eventually stabilizes i e e a 100 meanwhile the optimal layout pattern of border size was obtained under different soil textures and field slopes in hid as the constraints of both e a and d u are no smaller than 85 fig 5 and table 3 however the optimize results mainly depend on the applicable for border length and the discharge per unit width when d u is no less than 85 fig 5 in addition simth et al 2018 pointed out that complete replenishment of the soil content deficit over the entire length of the field is not a valid strategy which lead to the inevitably results in substantial deep percolation losses and reduced e a when water is limiting therefore although z r was set as 100 mm in this study the optimization results of the border size in hid mainly depend on the d u that is the optimization results should also be applicable when z r was set as other values numerous factors can affect the performance of border irrigation and this study mainly sought to improve the irrigation performance by optimizing the border size zheng et al 2009 analyzed the irrigation performance for different border sizes in the linhe the midstream of the hid and their results indicated that the field slope was approximately 1 when the border length of the silt loam texture was 45 m they recommended a width range from 5 0 to 7 5 m for high irrigation performance xu 2012 optimized the border size in dengkou the upstream of the hid and if the border length was unchanged 50 m they recommended that the width should be between 10 and 15 m and the field slope should be controlled at 0 5 1 xu and zheng 2018 determined suitable border size by using the laser land leveling technique in the linhe the midstream of the hid they suggested that the border length be 45 60 m and the width be no more than 10 m fan et al 2019 optimized the border size in linhe the midstream of the hid and their results indicated that when the border length was 50 m and the width was 10 15 m a high irrigation performance can be obtained the optimized layout pattern 1 proposed in this study for the border size is consistent with the aforementioned research results in layout pattern 1 the border length was proposed to be retained 50 m and the border width was proposed to be decreased to 6 10 m moreover the use of laser land leveling technology is proposed to reduce the field slope to no more than 1 this is consistent with the laser land leveling technology widely used in the hid the optimized layout pattern 2 proposed in this study is mainly used for the area where applying the laser land leveling technology is relatively difficult and because most of the soil in the hid has low infiltration capacity fig 4 considering the current situation of the border length two or three fields are recommended to be combined along the length for practical application however the effects of the cutoff time and mechanical efficiency on the border size optimization results were not considered these factors should be comprehensively studied in the future to propose a more adaptable layout pattern of border size meanwhile this study ignored the effects of manning s roughness on optimization results of border size which may have affected the study results these effects require further investigation 4 conclusions the optimization of border sizes to improve the irrigation performance is required with sustainable utilization of limited water resources taken the hetao irrigation district hid as the typical research area the infiltration parameters of the kostiakov equation were estimated through the analysis of the spatial variation characteristics of soil physical parameters then two types of optimal layout patterns were proposed for the border size the results revealed that the predominance of the mean soil particle contents was silt followed by clay and sand in the hid the optimal semivariance models of soil physical parameters were all exponential models except for the clay particle content at the depth of 40 60 cm was gaussian model and the spatial variability was mainly caused by structural factors the spatial distribution of clay and silt particle content were high in the middle and low at both sides of the irrigation district while the sand particle content was opposite the soil texture mainly comprised silt loam and silt clay loam which accounted for 84 88 of all sampling points the estimated infiltration coefficient and index of the kostiakov equation were 28 69 89 44 mm hr a and 0 308 0 649 at all sampling points respectively meanwhile the soil physical parameters are only to be measured at depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to meet the needs of infiltration parameter estimation which can considerably reduce the workload of soil sample collection furthermore the layout pattern 1 of the border size was proposed and verified i e the existing field length is retained as 50 m and the width reduced to 6 10 m moreover the use of laser land leveling technology can reduce the field slope to no more than 1 the border irrigation experiments revealed that the usage of the layout pattern 1 can achieve high irrigation performance with the mean values of application efficiency e a and distribution uniformity d u were 97 0 and 95 1 respectively for layout pattern 2 when the field slope of the silt loam and the silt clay loam texture was 1 3 the fields can be merged along the length and the length of a field can be as long as 100 m and the width was 10 12 m when the field slope was 3 5 the length of a field was 150 m and the width was 16 20 m moreover 2 3 inlets were recommended to be set along the width the proposed two types of layout patterns can achieve high performance of border irrigation and be the guidance for practical field irrigation however the recommendations made in this study are of a very general nature in this way any analysis made in a specific area of the hid can be based on this general work that should be particularized for its specific soil climate and irrigation conditions declaration

measured at 86 sampling points in the hetao irrigation district hid the soil hydraulic parameters were determined using the retc and hydrus 1d was then adopted to estimate infiltration parameters of the kostiakov equation at different locations the optimal layout patterns of border size were proposed under the consideration of various combinations of different typical soil textures and field slopes by winsrfr the results indicated that the spatial distributions of clay and silt particle contents were generally high in the middle and low at both sides of the hid while the sand was the opposite the results proved that the soil physical parameters are only to be measured at depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to meet the needs of infiltration parameter estimation which can significantly reduce the workload of soil sample collection moreover two types of optimal border layouts of different combinations of the soil textures silt loam and silt clay loam and field slopes no more than 1 1 3 and 3 5 were proposed which can guarantee the application efficiency and distribution uniformity no less than 85 and be the guidance for practical field irrigation in the hid keywords border size infiltration parameters numerical simulation spatial distribution characteristics soil hydraulic parameters 1 introduction border irrigation a method of crop irrigation is widely used because of its low cost and energy requirement however border irrigation systems are often inefficient due to over irrigation and poor application uniformity gillies and smith 2015 morris et al 2015 chari et al 2019 advanced simulation models of surface irrigation have been proven to be effective for evaluating system design and management and for improving irrigation performance infiltration parameters are essential input parameters for surface irrigation simulation models bautista et al 2009 salahou et al 2018 smith et al 2018 therefore obtaining realistic estimates for infiltration parameters is vital soil infiltration parameters are usually determined by direct or indirect methods the direct method often uses single ring or double ring experimental data to determine the infiltration parameters gillies 2008 duan et al 2011 and the indirect method such as the one point or two point method applies data regarding the water movement of surface irrigation to invert the infiltration parameters elliott and walker 1982 valiantzas et al 2001 however both direct and indirect methods are very time consuming moreover those methods are difficult to use for the estimation of infiltration parameters at the scale of an irrigation district due to the large area of an irrigation district soil physical parameters i e soil texture bulk density soil water content etc may have significant variations these factors then may lead to variability of infiltration how to determine the infiltration parameters of an irrigation district is a crucial problem wosten and van genuchten 1988 argued that acquiring infiltration parameters for an irrigation district is difficult or unnecessary however these parameters can be estimated by some simple methods because soil properties determine the infiltration capacity the pedotransfer function ptf can be established the ptf relates the estimated infiltration parameters to easily measured soil properties botula et al 2012 nguyen et al 2015 nie et al 2017 liao et al 2020 retc software proposed by the usda agricultural research service is a software package that estimates the soil hydraulic parameters on the basis of easily measured soil physical parameters e g soil particle content and bulk density many studies have proven that retc software estimates of soil hydraulic parameters are reliable wei et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 for parameters such as saturated water conductivity the maximum relative error between the estimated and measured values is approximately 30 however the soil water diffusion error is relatively small in low suction sections which are required for the design of field irrigation systems wei et al 2004 therefore estimating soil hydraulic parameters by using retc software is of practical value with the estimated soil hydraulic parameters input into the hydrus software simunek et al 2016 the infiltration process under different soil initial conditions can be simulated and the corresponding infiltration parameters obtained hydrus software is one of the most user friendly models that can be used in the ms windows environment it is a software package for simulating water heat and solute movement in a variably saturated media and the reliability of the simulation results are proven by many studies kandelous and simunek 2010 honari et al 2017 tu et al 2021 er raki et al 2021 therefore retc and hydrus softwares can provide rapid and accurate estimates of infiltration parameters for an irrigation district numerous factors can affect the performance of border irrigation including natural factors i e soil texture and infiltration characteristics and irrigation technology elements e g border size discharge and cutoff time natural factors are not easy to change therefore researchers seek to improve the performance of border irrigation by optimizing the combination of irrigation technology elements playan et al 1996 showed that the performance of border irrigation could be improved using laser leveling techniques to reduce the impact of the field micro topography sanchez et al 2009 analyzed the effects of different irrigation techniques on the performance of furrow irrigation and the results proved that the irrigation performance could be significantly improved by selecting reasonable values for the discharge and cutoff time gillies et al 2011 improved the performance of furrow irrigation by optimizing the cutoff time according to the soil infiltration variability reddy et al 2013 analyzed the effects of discharge changes on irrigation performance and the results indicated that the performance of furrow irrigation could be significantly improved by selecting a reasonable discharge chen et al 2013 improved the performance of border irrigation by optimizing the length and width of the field and the results indicated that the irrigation performance of the optimized border size average increased by 26 7 compared with that before optimization akbari et al 2018 improved the performance of irrigation by optimizing the field size by using a metaheuristic algorithm smith et al 2018 used the maximum application efficiency as an objective and a tail water rate less than 5 as a constraint the results proved that the irrigation performance could be significantly improved by selecting a reasonable cutoff time salahou et al 2018 analyzed the influences of discharges per unit width and the cutoff time on the performance of border irrigation and optimized the cutoff times of different discharges per unit width on the basis of field experiments xu et al 2019 proposed an optimal combination of the cutoff time and discharges per unit width in their study area through irrigation experiments of different crop growth stages the aforementioned research results have improved the design and management of border irrigation systems and have contributed to the improvement of irrigation performance however these studies have mainly focused on field scales resulting in limitations on the applications of these research results at an irrigation district scale the reasons are the large area of the irrigation district and the soil physical parameters may have significant variations making the determination of infiltration parameters on irrigation district scale more difficult than that on field scales therefore the hetao irrigation district hid was selected as a typical research area in this study on the basis of soil physical parameters soil particle content and bulk density measured at 86 sampling points the objectives of this study are 1 to analyze the spatial variability characteristics of the soil particle content and bulk density in the hid 2 to estimate the soil infiltration parameters of the kostiakov equation at different sampling points with hydrus 1d and 3 to propose the optimal layout patterns of border size under various combinations of different typical soil textures and field slopes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiments of closed end border irrigation the hid located in inner mongolia is one of the largest irrigation districts in china with 570 000 ha of irrigated land which is mainly distributed in dengkou hanggin rear banner linhe wuyuan and urad front banner fig 1 the hid is mainly planted with spring wheat corn and sunflowers the average annual rainfall is near 200 mm and the evaporation is 2000 2400 mm which means only irrigated agriculture is feasible miao et al 2015 the hid is an alluvial plain of the yellow river and the overall topography is flat with an elevation of 1007 1050 m high in the southwest and low in the northeast and a slope of 0 13 0 20 the canal network is supplied directly from the yellow river and the sublateral canal flow is generally 0 015 0 030 m3 s 1 zheng et al 2009 in practical the field length is approximately 50 m and the width is 10 30 m in the hid and border irrigation is the most commonly used irrigation method by the farmers however very often unreasonable field sizes and poor management lead to poor irrigation performance miao et al 2015 bai 2016 fan et al 2019 eighty six sampling points were set these points were approximately divided into a 10 10 km square grid pattern according to the objectives of this study the latitude and longitude of each sampling point were determined by gps the specific distribution of sampling points is displayed in fig 1 because the roots of wheat corn and sunflowers are mainly distributed no more than 60 cm below the surface soil samples were collected at three depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm with a soil auger soil particle content was determined with a mastersizer 2000 particle size analyzer on the basis of the usa reclassified standard the soil particle fractionation of clay is 0 002 mm that of silt is 0 002 0 05 mm and that of sand is 0 05 2 mm and the soil water contents were measured using the weighing method the bulk density was also measured using weighing method which sampled by undisturbed soil cores with a metal cylinders of 100 cm3 volume from a digged profile with the depths of 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm while on one hand it is difficult to dig the soil profile at the depth below 40 cm to obtain the undisturbed soil core then the bulk density of 40 60 cm were not measured on the other hand the main influence of field tillage is on the depth of 0 20 cm and for the bulk density of depth below 20 cm are though variant the variations could be relatively small abbasi et al 2003 ebrahimian et al 2013 salahou et al 2018 therefore the bulk density for 40 60 cm was substituted by 20 40 cm in the following sections around each sampling point 3 4 lines were selected along the planting direction for a length not less than 30 m to determine the field slope and the average value was taken as the field slope of the sampling point 2 2 spatial variability analysis of soil physical parameters the descriptive statistics of the soil physical parameters including the minimum maximum mean x m standard deviation σ coefficient of variation c v baskan et al 2009 x m σ and c v can be calculated using the following equations 1 σ i 1 n x i x m 2 n 1 1 2 2 x m 1 n i 1 n x i 3 c v σ x where σ is the standard deviation x i is the measured soil physical parameters of the ith sampling point x m is the mean value n is the number of samples n 86 in this study and c v is the coefficient of variation which reflects the variation degree of the soil physical parameters i e c v 0 1 represents weak variability 0 1 c v 1 0 represents moderate variability and c v 1 0 represents strong variability hillel 1980 because the statistical method do not consider the correlation between sampling points when analyzing the variation of soil physical parameters which is different from the practical situation therefore the geostatistical method are applied to analyze the spatial structure and distribution characteristics of soil physical parameters the semivariance γ h is the basis for geostatistics method to explain the spatial structure of soil physical parameters which can be calculated by the following equation moustafa 2000 4 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where h is the lag distance n h is the number of pairs separated by lag distance z x i and z x i h are the measured values at locations x i and x i h respectively if the γ h increases with distance and stabilizes at the a priori variance value it means that the variable under study is spatially correlated and all neighbors within the correlation range can be used to interpolate values where they were not measured the γ h of the soil physical parameters were calculated by geostatistical software gs gamma design software llc michigan usa based on the selection of the minimum residual sums of squares rss and the maximum determinate coefficient r 2 different theoretical models exponential gaussian spherical and linear model are selected to fit the γ h to obtain the optimal model according to the optimal semivariance model the spatial variability characteristics of the soil physical parameters can be obtained that is the nugget value c 0 the sill value c 0 c and the range among them c 0 c 0 c represents the degree of spatial dependent of regional variables the proportion of the spatial variation caused by the random part to the total variation of the system if the value of c 0 c 0 c is no more than 0 25 the variable was considered strongly spatial dependent if it varies from 0 25 to 0 75 the variable was considered moderately spatial dependent and with above 0 75 means that the spatial dependent of variables is weakly cambardella et al 1994 on the basis of the above analysis the kriging method in arcgis environmental systems research institute california usa is used to draw the spatial distribution map of soil physical parameters in the hid 2 3 method of estimating the soil infiltration parameters the determination of soil infiltration parameters is vital for the design of any border irrigation system because of the large area of the hid it would be difficult to estimate the infiltration parameters through direct measurement or indirect inversion by using the water movement of border irrigation therefore in this study the infiltration parameters were estimated as follows 1 soil hydraulic parameters were estimated on the basis of the measured soil physical parameters specifically the measured soil particle content and bulk density of each sampling point were entered as input into retc software then the soil hydraulic parameters of the van genuchten mualem vgm model were estimated because the vgm model is widely adopted for the construction of soil water retention curves through the retc van genuchten et al 1991 the vgm model can be written as follows van genuchten 1980 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e l m m 2 6 s e θ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 β h n m where k h represents the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm min 1 s e is the effective saturation of water in soil k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm min 1 θ is the volumetric moisture content cm3 cm 3 θ r is the residual soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 θ s is the saturated moisture content cm3 cm 3 l is usually equal to 0 5 m n β and l are empirical parameters of the soil water characteristic curve m 1 1 n and l is usually equal to 0 5 2 the soil infiltration process was simulated using hydrus 1d and the equation of soil water movement during vertical infiltration can be expressed as follows nie et al 2018a 7 θ t z k h h z 1 where z is the vertical coordinate for which the downward direction is considered as positive h is the soil water pressure head cm t is the time min and t 1000 min the initial and boundary conditions for the simulation of vertical infiltration can be expressed as follows 8 h z t h n 0 z z t 0 h h 0 t 0 z 0 h h n t 0 z z where h n is the pressure head corresponding to the measured soil initial water content condition cm h0 is the water depth h0 5 cm in this study and z is the maximum vertical depth of the simulated domain z 100 cm was adopted in this study the soil hydraulic parameters were entered as input into hydrus 1d in two simulation scenarios henceforth referred to as sim 1 and sim 2 for sim 1 the soil was divided into two layers specifically 0 20 and 20 100 cm the estimated soil hydraulic parameters for 20 40 cm represented the values for 20 100 cm for sim 2 the soil was divided into three layers specifically 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm the estimated soil hydraulic parameters for 40 60 cm represented the values for 40 100 cm 3 the kostiakov equation was used to fit the soil infiltration parameters the soil infiltration process can be described by the kostiakov equation for border irrigation alvarez 2003 playan et al 2004 holzapfel et al 2004 burguete et al 2009 which can be written as follows 9 i k t α where i is the cumulative infiltration cm k is the infiltration coefficient cm min a and a is the infiltration index 2 4 optimization method for the border size winsrfr 4 1 which was proposed by the usda agricultural research service is an integrated software package for analyzing surface irrigation systems it consists of two models the zero inertia zi and kinematic wave models chen et al 2013 in this study the zi model was selected to simulate the performance of border irrigation the zi model used in the simulation can be represented as follows 10 h 0 t q x i t 0 11 h x s 0 s f where q is the discharge per unit width m3 m 1 min 1 x is the distance from the field inlet m and s 0 and s f are the field slope and friction slope respectively three categories of parameters were entered as input into winsrfr 4 1 namely soil parameters geometric parameters and management parameters katopodes et al 1990 the first category of parameters represented infiltration and roughness the roughness of border irrigation ranged from 0 08 to 0 16 in the hid bai 2016 however it is insensitive of roughness variations on the advance trajectory and irrigation performance basen on many studies nie et al 2014 salahou et al 2018 smith et al 2018 therefore the roughness was selected as a typical representative value i e 0 12 in this study and the infiltration parameters were determined according to the estimation results of the proposed method in this study the second category consisted of geometrical parameters including the field slope length and width the field slope was determined according to the measured values in this study the field length was approximately 50 m and the width was 10 30 m according to the objectives of this study and the actual situation of the irrigation district the field length range was determined to be 50 150 m the width was calculated according to the optimized discharge per unit width the third category represented the management alternatives available to the irrigator these included the required water depth discharge and cutoff time the required water depth was 100 mm in this study which is a common value for the border irrigation system design in the hid zheng et al 2009 bai 2016 miao et al 2018 the sublateral canal flow was generally 0 015 0 030 m3 s 1 in the hid zheng et al 2009 and the average value of 0 023 m3 s 1 was used in this study the farmers in northern china typically set the cutoff time at the moment the water reaches the downstream end pereira et al 2007 chen et al 2013 nie et al 2018b therefore for practical purposes the cutoff time in this study was defined as the time at which the water reached the downstream end the application efficiency e a and distribution uniformity d u are often used as the design criteria for the border irrigation system horst et al 2005 zheng et al 2009 chen et al 2013 miao et al 2015 and they can be calculated as follows 12 e a w s w f 100 13 d u z l q z a v 100 where w s is the average depth of infiltrated water stored in the root zone mm w f is the average depth of applied water mm z lq is the low quarter average infiltrated depth mm and z av is the average depth of infiltration water mm the border layout patterns for the hid under various combinations of different typical soil textures and field slopes were optimized with winsrfr 4 1 by using e a and d u no less than 85 as constraints 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variability of soil physical parameters statistical analysis was conducted on the measured soil physical parameters at three depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm of 86 sampling points fig 1 the highest mean values of the silt particle content at the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were 58 12 55 47 and 59 32 respectively table 1 the c v values were within the medium variation interval 0 1 c v 1 0 however the values were only 0 17 0 18 and 0 17 for the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively which indicated that the variability of the silt particle content was relatively low moreover the mean clay particle were 22 43 22 14 and 20 96 respectively and the c v were 0 29 0 36 and 0 31 respectively for the aforementioned three depths thus the clay content variability was moderate and higher than the silt particle content variability the mean contents of sand particles were the lowest which were 19 45 22 39 and 19 72 however the degree of variation was the highest and the c v were 0 72 0 57 and 0 57 these results may have been obtained because the hid is the alluvial plain of the yellow river and the soil parent material is mainly sediments which leads to variability in the soil particle distribution in particular the variability of the sand particles was more significant than the other variability values the variation of the soil bulk density was small at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm the mean soil bulk density values were 1 54 and 1 53 g cm 3 and the c v were 0 07 and 0 08 which indicated weak variability c v 0 1 the results proved that the variability of the soil bulk density was relatively uniform in the hid the reason for these results may be that the farming methods crop planting structure and irrigation methods have basically remained unchanged for many years considering that the hid is an alluvial plain of the yellow river the variation in the soil bulk density is expected to be weak the optimal semivariance models of soil physical parameters were all the exponential models except for the clay at the depth of 40 60 cm was gaussian model in the hid table 1 the c 0 of soil particle content and bulk density were nearly close to 0 with the maximum was only 1 81 indicating that the variation caused by measurement errors and the spatial sources of variation at distances smaller than the sampling point interval were all small mubarak et al 2010 the c 0 c 0 c of the soil particle content changed to a range of 0 27 0 48 indicating that the soil particle content have moderately spatial dependent the c 0 c 0 c of soil bulk density at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm were 0 11 and 0 18 respectively which indicated soil bulk density had a strongly spatial dependent meanwhile the range of the soil physical parameters varied from 17 7 to 36 9 km table 1 which were larger than the sampling point interval approximately 10 km indicating that the sampling point interval in this study can better reflect the spatial structure of soil physical parameters in the hid the kriging method in arcgis was used to draw the spatial distribution map of soil particle content in the hid the spatial distributions of soil particle content exhibited regularity for the 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm layers fig 2 the clay particle content values were 5 86 44 87 at depths of 0 20 cm the areas with low clay content were mainly distributed in dengkou and urat front banner and the areas with high clay content were mainly distributed in the hanggin rear banner and the northern part of linhe the clay particle content values were 7 75 46 73 and 7 98 39 44 at depths of 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively and the spatial distributions were similar for the clay particle content at 0 20 cm depth the soil silt particle contents were 20 74 74 71 21 40 72 62 and 23 24 79 84 at depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively the spatial distributions of silt particle content values were similar at the three depths the high value areas were mainly located in linhe and hanggin rear banner and the low value areas were distributed in dengkou and urat front banner the sand particle content values were 0 21 73 25 2 13 55 72 and 3 16 62 73 at the depths of 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm respectively the spatial distributions of the sand particle content values were similar at the three depths the high value areas were mainly located in the southeast of dengkou and urat front banner and the low value areas were distributed in hanggin rear banner and linhe in general the clay and silt particle contents were high in the middle and low on both sides of the hid whereas the spatial distribution of sand particle content was low in the middle and high on both sides of the district the reason for this result may be that the soil sandification of dengkou and urat front banner is severe at both sides of the hid long term desertification erosion tends to change the distributions of soil particles resulting in increased sand particle content on both sides of the irrigation district alluvial soil is mainly distributed in the middle of the irrigation district which tends to increase the clay and silt particle content in this area the particle content in each vertical profile 0 60 cm was averaged to determine the soil texture at each sampling point the results proved that the soil texture was mainly silt loam which accounted for 55 81 of all sampling points this finding is consistent with the soil texture classification results of zhang et al 2015 the next most common component was silt clay loam with a proportion of 29 07 in addition the hid contains small amounts of loam sandy loam clay loam silt clay sand and other materials these materials accounted for only 15 12 of the measured materials in this study therefore the silt loam and silt clay loam were selected as typical soil textures and optimized for the border size 3 2 determination of soil infiltration parameters the measured soil particle content and bulk density were input into the retc software and the soil hydraulic parameters in the vgm model were estimated the soil bulk density for 40 60 cm was substituted by the measured values for 20 40 cm statistical analysis was performed on the estimated parameters and the results are listed in table 2 significant differences were calculated for the distribution characteristics of soil hydraulic parameters at three depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm the spatial distributions of θ r θ s and n were relatively uniform and the maximum values of c v were 0 285 0 117 and 0 076 respectively the reason for this result may be that the spatial distributions of the soil bulk density clay and silt particle contents were relatively uniform table 1 and fig 2 the results also indicated that the variation of the sand particle content had little effect on the estimation results of θ r θ s and n the variations of β and k s obtained from different depths 0 20 20 40 and 40 60 cm were significant and the minimum values of c v were 0 726 and 0 402 the results indicated that the variation of soil particle content and the bulk density had significant effects on β and k s in particular the variation of sand particle content had notably significant effects on β and k s which is consistent with the results of liu et al 2010 the estimated soil hydraulic parameters were input into hydrus 1d and the infiltration processes of randomly selected sampling points in the two simulation scenarios were simulated and compared the infiltration simulation results were similar in the two simulation scenarios fig 3 the soil hydraulic parameters of the two simulation scenarios were the same at the soil depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm a notable difference was that the soil hydraulic parameters used for the depth of 40 100 cm were the same as the values estimated of 20 40 cm in sim 1 while 40 60 cm depth in sim 2 miyazaki 1988 and wu et al 2015 have proven that the infiltration capacity is mainly controlled by the soil layers with weak infiltration capacity thus the soil infiltration process depended on the infiltration characteristics of the soil for a depth of 0 20 or 20 40 cm at most sampling points the kostiakov equation eq 9 was used to fit the infiltration parameters simulated by each sampling point and the k and a determined in the two simulation scenarios were compared the results indicated that the k and a determined in the two simulation scenarios were evenly distributed on both sides of the 1 1 line fig 4 significance testing revealed that no significant difference existed p 0 05 in the values of k and a in the two simulation scenarios which indicated that the difference in the infiltration parameters estimated under the two simulation scenarios was small the results also indicated that dividing the soil profile into two layers 0 20 and below 20 cm depth can meet the requirements of infiltration parameter determination the k and a were 28 69 89 44 mm hr a and 0 308 0 649 respectively at all sampling points in the hid under sim 1 fig 4 the practical significance of this result is that in the process of soil sample collection the soil physical parameters e g soil particle content and bulk density only need to be measured for the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to determine the infiltration parameters of the hid which can significantly reduce the workload of soil sample collection 3 3 optimization of the border size in the hetao irrigation district according to the aforementioned analysis the ratio of silt loam and silt clay loam for all sampling points was 84 88 therefore silt loam and silt clay loam were selected as typical soil textures for simulation analysis with winsrfr 4 1 and the irrigation performance indicators e a and d u under different factors such as the soil texture field slope border length and discharge per unit width were obtained the infiltration parameters were set to the mean value of the soil texture thus for silt loam k 65 84 mm hr a and a 0 477 whereas for silt clay loam k 60 81 mm hr a and a 0 462 the statistical software analyzed the measured field slopes of all sampling points in the hid and the field slopes were mainly distributed below 5 the field slopes of less than 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 and 4 5 were accounted for 5 81 11 63 26 74 19 77 and 20 93 of all sampling points respectively therefore the field slopes were selected as 1 2 3 4 and 5 in the process of border size optimization in the simulations the discharge per unit width were 1 2 3 4 and 5 l s m 1 while the length of the field were 50 70 90 110 130 and 150 m the cutoff time was set according to the irrigation practices of the local farmers i e the moment water reaches the downstream end in total both silt loam and silt clay loam were conducted 150 groups of simulation combinations respectively then the contours of e a and d u with the border length and the discharge per unit width were plotted in matlab the silt loam texture of fig 5 is one example considering the actual situation of border irrigation both e a and d u were constrained at no less than 85 thus the reasonable border sizes can be obtained under different field slope conditions of silt loam texture fig 5 and the same research method was adopted for the silt clay loam note that the confirmation of the scopes of border length and the discharge per unit width are the intersection for both e a and d u that all no less than 85 the results are listed in table 3 when the slope of the field is 1 a high e a and d u can be obtained using a short border length and large discharge per unit width table 3 because the silt loam and the silt clay loam in the hid tend to demonstrate low infiltration capacity fig 4 irrigation under a field slope of 1 is similar to level border irrigation any large discharge per unit width enables the water flow to spread through the field quickly resulting in high values of e a and d u fig 5 whenever the slope of the field is larger than 1 a long border length and a small discharge per unit width may be used to obtain high irrigation performance fig 5 because the flow velocity increases as the field slope increases a small discharge per unit width can be adopted to avoid the accumulation of water in the downstream area and insufficient water in the upstream area therefore according to the optimization results in table 3 and the actual situation of the existing border size in the hid two types of optimal layout patterns for the border size are proposed in this study layout pattern 1 retains the existing field length 50 m and reduces the border width to 6 10 m when the field slope is more than 1 if the length of the field 50 m is to be maintained constant the laser land leveling technique should be used to reduce the field slope to 1 and below and the border width should be reduced to 6 10 m layout pattern 2 is intended for usage in areas where laser leveling techniques are relatively difficult to perform when the field slope of the silt loam and the silt clay loam is 1 3 the fields can be merged along their longest sides the length of a field can be 100 m and the width can be 10 12 m when the field slope is 3 5 the length of a field is 150 m and the width is 16 20 m because of the large optimized width 2 3 inlets are recommended to be set along the width to avoid excessive lateral flow during the irrigation process which affects the consistency of the simulation results the water advancement along the border length and the actual water advancement process bai 2016 3 4 the verify of the border irrigation experiments the border irrigation experiments were conducted in tabu village of dengkou the upstream of the hid jinbu village of linhe the midstream of the hid and the yifeng village of wuyuan the middle and lower reaches of the hid on august 2020 with the soil texture of silt loam silt clay loam and silt clay loam respectively the selected typical borders were leveled by laser land leveling technology before the corn planting the soil water contents were measured before and after 1 day of the border irrigation of 8 measuring points in each typical border with a total measured depth of 1 m 5 layers with each layer depth of 0 2 m the time of water advance and recession to each observation point were measured every 5 m set an observation point the discharge was measured by the triangular weir and the parameters of the border irrigation are shown in table 4 the irrigation performance indicators as shown in table 4 can be obtained according to the measured soil water contents fig 6 the cutoff time and the discharge based on the optimized border size combined with laser land leveling technology the e a varies from 95 5 to 98 1 with a mean value of 97 0 and the d u varies from 93 7 to 98 1 with a mean value of 95 1 indicating that the high irrigation performance of the border irrigation experiments the reason is that most of the soil in the hid has low infiltration capacity fig 4 when the field slope is less than 1 it is similar to level border irrigation any large discharge enables the water flow to spread through the field quickly resulting in high values of e a and d u therefore it shows that the optimized border layout pattern 1 is reasonable in hid and for the optimized layout pattern 2 it has not been verified due to the limitation of experimental conditions 3 5 discussion the results of geostatistical analysis showed that the ratio of the c 0 c 0 c of the soil physical parameters varied from 0 11 to 0 48 in the hid table 1 indicating that they have strongly or moderately spatial dependent and the spatial variability was mainly caused by structural factors such as the soil parent material topography etc because the hid is an alluvial plain of the yellow river which flows from the west to the east such that the coarse grained sediment carried in the irrigation water is deposited in the western zone and the fine grained sediment is deposited in the central and eastern zones of the hid this observation is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2015 the random factors such as the soil cultivation irrigation and other human activities factors though have relatively weak influence on the spatial structure of soil physical parameters in the hid however the planting area and irrigated area have expanded by nearly 3 times in the past 70 years which has also affected the spatial structure of soil physical parameters for example dengkou is located on the eastern edge of ulanbuh desert and urat front banner is located downstream of the hid the soil sandification in dengkou and urat front banner is severe because of human activities long term desertification has also changed the soil particle content distribution which has led to increased sand particle content on both sides of the irrigation district and increased clay and silt particle content in the middle of the irrigation district fig 2 russo and jury 1987 pointed out that when using geostatistics method to analyze the spatial variation of regional variables the minimum sampling grid interval should be less than 1 2 of the range to accurately reflect the spatial structure of variables and distribution characteristics consequently the sampling point interval was about 10 km in this study fig 1 and the ranges of soil physical parameters were 17 7 36 9 km table 3 which approximately satisfies the requirements that the grid interval less than half of the range although the sampling point interval used can better reflect the spatial structure and distribution characteristics of soil physical parameters in the hid it is necessary to note that using a large sampling point interval may have a problem of distortion in the description of the spatial structure of the semivariance model for the soil physical parameters moreover the soil physical parameters at all sampling points do not strictly satisfy the second order stability assumption so that the use of kriging method to draw the spatial distribution map may also be distorted locally and cannot reflect the local variation of soil physical parameters because of the variability of soil physical parameters zeleke and si 2005 mubarak et al 2010 some differences can be observed in the soil particle content and bulk density even for the same soil texture these differences affect the infiltration characteristics thus the estimated results affect the infiltration parameters zheng et al 2009 estimated the infiltration parameters of silt loam by using the border irrigation data for the linhe the midstream of the hid the k and a in their studies ranged from 43 79 to 46 62 mm hr a and 0 57 0 58 respectively miao et al 2015 estimated that the k and a were 30 11 66 01 mm hr a and 0 49 0 62 in dengkou the upstream of the hid respectively bai 2016 estimated that the k and a of the silt loam were 37 12 40 84 mm hr a and 0 39 0 45 in the linhe the midstream of the hid respectively fan et al 2019 estimated the infiltration parameters by using the border irrigation data for linhe the midstream of the hid in their study the k and a were 24 79 76 35 mm hr a and 0 32 0 61 respectively in the results of aforementioned research the k and a ranged from 24 79 to 76 35 mm hr a and 0 32 0 65 respectively in this study the k and a were estimated to be 28 69 89 44 mm hr a and 0 308 0 649 respectively fig 4 these results are consistent with the aforementioned research which indicates that the proposed method is reliable for estimating infiltration parameters in this study the results revealed that the soil physical parameters only need to be measured at the depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to meet the requirements of infiltration parameter determination in the hid according to eqs 12 and 13 in this study it can be known that the z r has no effect on d u while there are two cases on e a when the depth of applied water at some certain position of the field is not greater than z r and there is no effect on e a otherwise when it is greater than z r the e a increases with z r and eventually stabilizes i e e a 100 meanwhile the optimal layout pattern of border size was obtained under different soil textures and field slopes in hid as the constraints of both e a and d u are no smaller than 85 fig 5 and table 3 however the optimize results mainly depend on the applicable for border length and the discharge per unit width when d u is no less than 85 fig 5 in addition simth et al 2018 pointed out that complete replenishment of the soil content deficit over the entire length of the field is not a valid strategy which lead to the inevitably results in substantial deep percolation losses and reduced e a when water is limiting therefore although z r was set as 100 mm in this study the optimization results of the border size in hid mainly depend on the d u that is the optimization results should also be applicable when z r was set as other values numerous factors can affect the performance of border irrigation and this study mainly sought to improve the irrigation performance by optimizing the border size zheng et al 2009 analyzed the irrigation performance for different border sizes in the linhe the midstream of the hid and their results indicated that the field slope was approximately 1 when the border length of the silt loam texture was 45 m they recommended a width range from 5 0 to 7 5 m for high irrigation performance xu 2012 optimized the border size in dengkou the upstream of the hid and if the border length was unchanged 50 m they recommended that the width should be between 10 and 15 m and the field slope should be controlled at 0 5 1 xu and zheng 2018 determined suitable border size by using the laser land leveling technique in the linhe the midstream of the hid they suggested that the border length be 45 60 m and the width be no more than 10 m fan et al 2019 optimized the border size in linhe the midstream of the hid and their results indicated that when the border length was 50 m and the width was 10 15 m a high irrigation performance can be obtained the optimized layout pattern 1 proposed in this study for the border size is consistent with the aforementioned research results in layout pattern 1 the border length was proposed to be retained 50 m and the border width was proposed to be decreased to 6 10 m moreover the use of laser land leveling technology is proposed to reduce the field slope to no more than 1 this is consistent with the laser land leveling technology widely used in the hid the optimized layout pattern 2 proposed in this study is mainly used for the area where applying the laser land leveling technology is relatively difficult and because most of the soil in the hid has low infiltration capacity fig 4 considering the current situation of the border length two or three fields are recommended to be combined along the length for practical application however the effects of the cutoff time and mechanical efficiency on the border size optimization results were not considered these factors should be comprehensively studied in the future to propose a more adaptable layout pattern of border size meanwhile this study ignored the effects of manning s roughness on optimization results of border size which may have affected the study results these effects require further investigation 4 conclusions the optimization of border sizes to improve the irrigation performance is required with sustainable utilization of limited water resources taken the hetao irrigation district hid as the typical research area the infiltration parameters of the kostiakov equation were estimated through the analysis of the spatial variation characteristics of soil physical parameters then two types of optimal layout patterns were proposed for the border size the results revealed that the predominance of the mean soil particle contents was silt followed by clay and sand in the hid the optimal semivariance models of soil physical parameters were all exponential models except for the clay particle content at the depth of 40 60 cm was gaussian model and the spatial variability was mainly caused by structural factors the spatial distribution of clay and silt particle content were high in the middle and low at both sides of the irrigation district while the sand particle content was opposite the soil texture mainly comprised silt loam and silt clay loam which accounted for 84 88 of all sampling points the estimated infiltration coefficient and index of the kostiakov equation were 28 69 89 44 mm hr a and 0 308 0 649 at all sampling points respectively meanwhile the soil physical parameters are only to be measured at depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm to meet the needs of infiltration parameter estimation which can considerably reduce the workload of soil sample collection furthermore the layout pattern 1 of the border size was proposed and verified i e the existing field length is retained as 50 m and the width reduced to 6 10 m moreover the use of laser land leveling technology can reduce the field slope to no more than 1 the border irrigation experiments revealed that the usage of the layout pattern 1 can achieve high irrigation performance with the mean values of application efficiency e a and distribution uniformity d u were 97 0 and 95 1 respectively for layout pattern 2 when the field slope of the silt loam and the silt clay loam texture was 1 3 the fields can be merged along the length and the length of a field can be as long as 100 m and the width was 10 12 m when the field slope was 3 5 the length of a field was 150 m and the width was 16 20 m moreover 2 3 inlets were recommended to be set along the width the proposed two types of layout patterns can achieve high performance of border irrigation and be the guidance for practical field irrigation however the recommendations made in this study are of a very general nature in this way any analysis made in a specific area of the hid can be based on this general work that should be particularized for its specific soil climate and irrigation conditions declaration

10172,the knowledge of the crop response to soil water deficit is essential to predict the actual crop water requirements under limited soil water conditions the mathematical schematization of the crop response under rdi can allow identifying the exact irrigation timing the threshold of soil water status below which crop transpiration decreases represents a key parameter for the water stress functions the main objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of several rdi treatments applied during the three stages of fruit growth on soil plant water relations of drip irrigated mandarin trees experiments were carried out in seven irrigation treatments a control irrigated at 125 of potential evapotranspiration measured in weighting lysimeters etlys during the whole year and six rdi treatments in which 25 and 50 of etlys were applied during each of the three stages of fruit growth the critical threshold of soil water status expressed in terms of soil water depletion below which predawn plwp and midday mswp leaf water potential is affected by decreasing soil water content were identified the dependency of crop water status from the climate forcing occurring under soil water contents higher than the critical threshold was also demonstrated moreover a strong relationship between water stress integral s mswp evaluated during the three stages of fruit growth and the corresponding amount of water applied irrigation and precipitation was observed after normalizing the variables the robust relationship between these two variables r2 0 83 confirmed that the water stress integral represents a good indicator of the plant water relationship and allows the prediction of the total irrigation depth to be applied to achieve a desired stress level during the fruit growth moreover this relationship depends on the irrigation schedule adopted to regulate the deficit which includes the irrigation variables such as irrigation dose and its variability keywords deficit irrigation depletion factor irrigation dose water stress integral 1 introduction in the mediterranean basin approximately 30 of the cultivated area is under irrigation which represents the biggest consumer of freshwater from the region harmanny and malek 2019 specifically the irrigated land in spain accounts for 80 of global water consumption mapa 2019 citrus spp is the crop most cultivated fruit tree in spain with a surface extended 307 560 ha in 2019 of which 93 is irrigated represents the crop with the highest irrigated area mapa 2019 moreover spain is one of the main producing countries worldwide of citrus spp with an average annual production of around 6 3 mt in 2019 more than a third of this production comes from the mandarin group being clementina de nules one of the most common cultivars mapa 2019 thus it is important to determinate the citrus water requirements by designing simple practical and precise methods to optimize irrigation and to adopt precise irrigation scheduling and management techniques gasque et al 2016 water saving strategies such as deficit irrigation di have been studied as a promising alternative for growers of citrus spp mainly in areas characterized by water shortcomings and increasing frequency of drought phenomena ferreres and soriano 2007 carr 2012 rocamora et al 2013 under regulated deficit irrigation water is generally supplied at levels below full crop transpiration during specific periods of the fruit growing season operating in this way it is possible to balance the plant vigor with the potential production by limiting the irrigation volumes costa et al 2007 rallo et al 2017 therefore deficit irrigation has been considered as a strategy to save water and to increase water productivity besides this strategy may have positive impacts on fruit quality and composition parameters that contrast the possible side effects on fruit size and weight due to water stress ballester et al 2011 with the consequent upgrade of yield values garcía tejero et al 2010 carr 2012 consoli et al 2014 nonetheless the application of di requires monitoring in real time the crop water status and soil water content to control the level of water stress reached by the crop and hence to prevent crop damage and yield losses rallo et al 2017 in this direction plant based indicators of water status have been widely used namely predawn or midday stem water potential jones 2004 these indicators are discrete measurements that represent a snapshot in time of the crop water status and their measurement require expert knowledge moreover plant based indicators integrate the effects of soil water availability and the atmospheric evaporative demand thus it could be complicated to establish irrigation thresholds only considering measurements of tree water status ortuño et al 2006 ortuño et al 2009 a b to complement them another index the water stress integral calculated as the summation of pre dawn or midday leaf water potential measurements over a chosen period summarizes the cumulative stress reached by the crop throughout a certain period myers 1988 besides that soil moisture sensors such as neutron probes frequency domain reflectometry fdr or capacitance probe time domain reflectometry tdr and fiber optic sensors provide feedback on the soil moisture and can be acquired automatically fares and alva 2000 evett et al 2008 gil rodríguez et al 2013 for these reasons soil water contents have been frequently used in precise irrigation scheduling and as a tool for efficient irrigation evett et al 2008 vera et al 2019 however diverse studies have highlighted the spatial heterogeneity of soil water content and the inaccuracies derived on scheduling irrigation only based on soil moisture measurements intrigiolo and castel 2004 agüero alcaras et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 domínguez niño et al 2020 the heterogeneous patterns of soil moisture depend on many factors such as irrigation depth quantity and frequency of irrigation the type of water distribution system and the relative design plan grant et al 2009 domínguez niño et al 2020 specifically guswa et al 2004 highlighted the impact that the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the root volume has on the total root water uptake the crop water stress response to soil water status is in fact not linear and not uniquely associated but rather depend on a large extent on the degree of wetting uniformity of the root zone therefore besides the agronomic related results derived from the application of water saving strategies is essential to study the hydraulic and hydrologic parameters that could affect the crop functioning and performance however most studies on the effects of water saving strategies on the crop system are focused on agronomic methods and less emphasis has been placed on agro hydrological approaches in this sense further studying of the ecophysiological relationships according to different levels of water stress imposed could provide knowledge on the crop water dynamics and thus on adequate irrigation management techniques ginestar and castel 1996 agüero alcaras et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 understanding these relationships could help to identify the maximum allowable depletion mad which represents a basic knowledge for irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 the depletion coefficient p generally used to identify the mad provides information about the crop resistance to water stress for citrus spp table 22 of fao56 paper indicates to assume a value of p 0 50 allen et al 1998 however the value of this coefficient could vary with the different citrus spp canopy architecture plant density fraction of ground cover and training system thus local calibration of the p coefficient could represent more accurately the crop response to water stress in this study a robust database of soil and crop data collected in previous research conducted by gonzález altozano and castel 1999 was used to i study the eco physiological response of a citrus crop citrus clementina hort ex tan to different timing and magnitude of deficit irrigation ii identify the threshold of soil water status to implement water saving strategies in citrus orchards iii assess the effect of irrigation management variables on the cumulated water stress and crop yield response 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the experimental field field data were collected in a citrus orchard during two consecutive years 1995 from june to december and 1996 from january to december in the experimental farm of instituto valenciano de investigaciones agrarias located in moncada spain 39 35 17 5 n 0 23 59 7 w 68 m a s l the orchard was extended 2 ha and planted with the variety clementina de nules citrus clementina hort ex tan grafted on citrange carrizo citrus sinensis l osb x poncirus trifoliata l raf with plants spaced 3 85 m along the row and 6 0 m between rows density of 433 trees ha the trees were ten years old at the time of field experiments gonzález altozano and castel 1999 formerly described the orchard which was pruned annually and with phytosanitary treatments performed according to the usual practices of the area the soil was calcareous with an effective depth of 0 5 0 6 m limited by a petrocalcic horizon and soil texture ranging from sandy loam to sandy clay loam usda 2017 the average field capacity and the soil wilting point resulted in 0 27 m3 m 3 and 0 15 m3 m 3 respectively the soil was poor in organic matter 0 7 and without salinity limitations 0 5 ds m 1 irrigation water coming from a well located on the farm had an electrical conductivity of 1 2 ds m 1 at 25 c gonzález altozano and castel 1999 the climate of the area is the mediterranean with mild winters and scarce precipitations during the growth season climatic parameters were recorded by an automated meteorological station installed in the eastern corner of the plot reference evapotranspiration et0 mm d 1 was calculated with the fao56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 the trees were irrigated with a drip irrigation system with two lateral pipes placed in parallel to the plant rows at a distance of 0 75 m from each side of the trunk and four 4 l h 1 emitters per tree spaced 1 25 m 2 2 irrigation treatments irrigation was scheduled based on the daily evapotranspiration measured in a weighing lysimeter etlys installed in the orchard the weighing lysimeter with dimensions of 4 0 4 0 1 5 m and precision of 0 25 mm of daily et was installed in 1989 and planted with a single tree similar to the rest of the orchard castel 1991 the tree in the lysimeter was irrigated with the same drip irrigation system as the rest of the plot and with doses corresponding to 125 of the measured etlys this percentage allowed accounting for the possible inefficiency of the irrigation plant the volumes applied with irrigation and the weight of the lysimeter were automatically recorded hourly with a datalogger cr10 campbell inc the experimental design consisted of a control treatment ctrl irrigated at 125 of etlys during the whole year and the following six irrigation treatments under regulated deficit irrigation rdi in which 25 25 i 25 ii 25 iii and 50 50 i 50 ii 50 iii of etlys were applied during each of the three stages of fruit growth i cell division ii cell elongation iii fruit maturation as indicated in fig 1 the duration of each period of deficit irrigation fig 1 was based on phenological observations and measurements of pre dawn leaf water potential plwp the phenological stages were defined after direct observations following the classification proposed for citrus by limón de la oliva et al 1972 the periods of the phenological phases and thus the timing of the irrigation treatments were phase i of fruit growth corresponding to flowering fruit set from march 20 to july 3 in 1995 and from april 1 to july 1 in 1996 phase ii of fruit growth corresponding to the initial fruit enlargement phase from july 4 to august 7 in 1995 and from july 2 to 28 in 1996 phase iii of fruit growth corresponding to the final growth and maturation from august 8 in 1995 and from july 29 in 1996 until harvesting all the treatments were irrigated every five four and two days per week in winter spring autumn and summer respectively the experimental design included randomized blocks with three replications per treatment further details about the distribution and the replicates of the applied treatments can be found in ginestar and castel 1996 gonzález altozano and castel 1999 2000 2 3 measurements of soil and tree water status the soil water content was monitored with a trase tdr system soil moisture equipment corp and probes installed at distances of 0 2 m and 0 4 m from the emitters tdr stainless steel rods 0 47 m length were installed in one tree per each plot thus three trees per treatment were monitored measurements of soil water content and leaf water potential were contextually acquired in days without irrigation every 7 days in 1995 and every 1 or 2 weeks in 1996 the tree water status was quantified by pre dawn leaf plwp mpa and midday stem mswp mpa water potential measured with a scholander chamber soil moisture equip corp following the recommendations of turner 1981 for each determination five mature leaves on two representative trees per treatment were used leaves exposed to north west were used for the pre dawn measurements and to south for the midday measurements two hours before the measurement of mswp the leaves were covered with silver foils and inserted in plastic bags for each treatment the water stress integral smswp mpa per day in each period of deficit irrigation and for the whole year were calculated by using the measurements of mswp the water stress integral was computed from the midday stem water potential as myers 1988 1 s mswp i 0 i i mswp i i 1 c n where mswpi i 1 is the average midday water potential measured in the time interval i i 1 c is the maximum predawn leaf water potential measured during the study period in the control treatment which resulted of 0 8 mpa and n is the number of days of the period 2 4 yield determination the yield was determined at the time of commercial harvest at the end of each season which took place around mid december the average fruit weight was obtained by counting the number of fruits in 15 boxes per each experimental plot about 20 kg box which were randomly selected and previously weighed with a resolution of 20 g fruit of low commercial value e g off season and fruit with creasing were left on the trees and picked and counted later 3 results 3 1 agrometeorological characteristics and lysimeter based crop evapotranspiration the dynamic of daily standard meteorological variables during the two experimental years is presented in fig 2 during the fruit growth stage i flowering and fruit set phases precipitation and crop water evapotranspiration etlys in 1995 resulted lower than in 1996 during the phenological stage ii initial phases of fruit enlargement there were more scarce precipitations and greater evaporative demand et0 compared to the phase i the stage iii final phases of fruit enlargement and maturation occurring in both years at the end of summer in 1995 was characterized by higher precipitations and lower et0 the maximum daily evapotranspiration in the lysimeter etlys was registered around the beginning of stage iii the cumulated precipitation during the fruit growth cycle in 1996 was higher of about 130 mm compared to 1995 the rainfall events were rare in stage ii and mainly concentrated during stage iii 3 2 eco physiological crop response to soil water deficit fig 3 shows the average soil water content swc as a function of the indicators of plant water status represented by the pre dawn leaf plwp and midday steam mswp water potentials for the control ctrl and the deficit irrigation di treatments for the higher values of soil water content both the indicators resulted around a constant value corresponding to about 0 4 mpa and 1 0 mpa in terms of plwp and mswp respectively for soil water content below a certain threshold the values of leaf stem water potential started to sharply decrease similarly to what observed by ballester et al 2011 for the same citrus spp this pattern was more accentuated in the 25 di than in the 50 di treatments despite the dispersion of data makes difficult to identify a clear threshold of swc it is plausible to assume a value of swc around 20 below which both the plwp and mswp decline at decreasing swc whose lower limit resulted of about 10 according to pellegrino et al 2006 this lower limit of soil water status can be considered close to the wilting point therefore assuming these thresholds of swc and a soil field capacity of 0 27 cm3 cm 3 the investigated soil is characterized by a depletion of 70 mm m 1 and a depletion factor p value of 0 41 as expected the lowest plwp and mswp values were reached in the 25 treatments due to the lower amount of water applied with irrigation regarding the 25 di the lowest values of swc plwp and mswp were registered when the timing stress was applied in the stages ii and iii of fruit growth therefore the intensity and timing of di treatments affected the crop water status which was well represented by the plant and soil water status indicators and their relationship the different crop response particularly evident when considering the dispersion of mswp fig 3c d for any fixed swc could be associated to the quite high spatial variability of soil water content associated to the microirrigation system as well as to the different evaporative demand the largest dispersion of the measured variables was observed during the periods of water deficit application this dispersion could be due to the partial wetting of the root system with the wetted volume becoming smaller at decreasing water doses increasing water stress levels as well as to the three dimensional soil moisture gradients around the water emission points characterizing the localized irrigation system to support these hypotheses guswa et al 2004 observed that for similar values of average soil water contents in the treatments characterized by higher water stress levels lower irrigation doses for a fixed frequency the root volume in which the water is readily available is more limited and consequently root water uptake is lower 3 3 water stress integral and effects due to irrigation variables the water stress integral s mswp approach is used to assess the relationship between crop water status and the total water supplied by precipitation and or irrigation at the same time s mswp was related to the average irrigation dose id supplied in each watering event the s mswp was calculated based on the values of mswp potential measured during the three fruit growth stages as discussed above the computation of s mswp started on the first of june because no data were available before that date the c value in eq 1 which was assumed as the maximum leaf water potential measured in the control treatment was 0 8 mpa for all the treatments table 1 shows the cumulated water stress integral during each of the three fruit growth stages in which the different irrigation treatments were applied in 1995 and 1996 as expected the cumulated water stress integral was higher for the 25 di treatments in both the experimental years due to the lower amount of water supplied the 25 iii treatment presented the highest s mswp value which was higher in 1996 compared to 1995 this confirms the sensitivity of clementina de nules variety to water deficit applied during the stage iii of crop growth as previously observed by gonzález altozano and castel 1999 and ballester et al 2011 in both the experimental years the second highest s mswp was observed in the 25 ii treatment due to the scarce precipitation and high atmospheric evaporative demand characterizing both the summer periods as expected the control treatment was associated with the smallest s mswp when considering the 50 di treatments slight differences with the ctrl were recognized in terms of smswp especially in 1995 as a result the application of 50 di treatments is likely to cause significant crop water stress only during irrigation seasons with low rainfall and high evaporative demand even for the 50 di treatments stage iii of crop growth was the most sensitive to water stress fig 4a b shows the s mswp mpa per day of the di treatments during the three fruit growth stages versus the total amount of water applied e g precipitation and irrigation mm both in absolute fig 4a and normalized fig 4b terms the normalization was obtained as the ratio between the variable obtained in di treatment and the corresponding associated to the ctrl the normalization procedure allowed excluding the effects deriving from the different atmospheric conditions registered in the two experimental years there is a trend between the s mswp for all stages and the total amount of water applied p i in absolute terms for each experimental year the values of s mswp decreased at increasing the amount of water applied moreover a robust r2 0 83 relationship between the normalized water stress integral n s mswp and the corresponding normalized water supplied n p i can be observed fig 4b the decreasing regression curve shows how the crop water stress becomes smaller as the water supplied regime of the di treatments tend to the ctrl one as observed in previous studies garcía tejero et al 2010 goldhamer 2012 rallo et al 2017 the s mswp can be used as an indicator to predict the seasonal amount of water necessary to accomplish a desired level of stress fig 5a b illustrates the relationship between s mswp cumulated during the whole season fig 5a and stage ii fig 5b of fruit growth and the corresponding amount of irrigation applied during the same periods in both the experimental years the relationships in fig 5b was compared with the relationship identified by rallo et al 2017 for an orange citrus orchard under di applied during only the phase ii fruit growth stage the value of s mswp decreased at increasing of the total irrigation i supplied being the lowest values obtained for the control treatment ctrl moreover the 50 i and 50 ii treatments showed values closed to the ctrl one as shown in fig 5b the s mswp and the i obtained for the 25 ii and 50 ii are very close to the empirical relationship proposed by rallo et al 2017 confirming that during stage ii of citrus fruit growth it is feasible to predict the amount of irrigation necessary to achieve the desired level of crop water stress fig 6a b shows the effects of the average irrigation doses applied in each watering id on the s mswp observed during the whole period of water deficit application fig 6a and during the phase ii of fruit growth fig 6b the analysis of the relationship in fig 6a shows that s mswp also depends on the quantity of water applied in each watering which could suggest the relevance of this irrigation management variable in the designing of the water saving strategies the relationship found between s mswp and id under water deficit in the stage ii of fruit growth fig 6b evidences a different regression curve that the one observed in rallo et al 2017 the different shape of the curves is probably due to the different methods used to determine the irrigation doses id which were the lysimeter based in this experiment and according to the weather based method in rallo et al 2017 3 4 effect of irrigation depth variability on crop water stress and crop yield fig 7a shows the relationship r2 0 71 between the cumulated water stress integral s mswp in all the stages of fruit growth and the coefficient of variation of irrigation doses applied in each watering cv id the relationship confirms that the level of water stress increased with the irrigation doses variability the most severe di treatment di 25 iii was characterized by the highest variability of cv id whereas the control treatment was characterized by the lowest cv id as referred the irrigation depth was calculated based on the etlys and thus the id depends on the atmospheric demand of the days included among consecutive watering two three or five days respectively for summer spring and autumn periods therefore the irrigation volumes supplied during each irrigation event were different being based on the et demand and the imposed reductions of irrigation volumes as stated in section 3 2 the effect of id variability on the cumulated water stress integral could be explained following the consideration of guswa et al 2004 as shown in fig 7a the lowest variability of the supplied irrigation volume was associated to the control treatment in which the highest irrigation doses 125 et lys allowed to wet more homogeneously the crop root volume thus crop water uptake was not affected by the soil water deficit conditions because a higher fraction of roots was moistened at soil water content close to the soil field capacity swcfc before starting the drying process on the other hand in the di treatments the plant started to increase the cumulated stress originated from lower and more time variable irrigation doses supplied in each event the root system could have experimented soil water content quite lower than that corresponding to the field capacity even after irrigation events when part of the root system was differently moistened the reasons behind this behavior are mainly due to the smaller water doses and the localized irrigation system which generates high three dimensional soil moisture gradients around the water emission points the crop water stress was consequent to the root water uptake lower than the maximum in a bigger fraction of the root volume in which water was not readily available hence the plant needed to extract water from further wet regions to compensate for the limitations occurring in the dry root volume therefore the cv id depended on the magnitude of irrigation doses because the higher quantity of water supply allowed moistening more uniformly wider fraction of the root zone with more readily water available for the crop as observed the cv id would influence the variability of the available soil water content swc fc swc i in the root volume for the different treatments fig 7b shows the correlation between the coefficient of variation of the available soil water content cv swc fc swc i and the cv id measured during all the fruit growth stages the variability of the difference between the field capacity and the actual soil water content cv swc fc swc i becomes higher as the cv id increases thus this difference would become wider under the most severe treatment in which the actual soil water contents are quite lower than the soil field capacity swc fc the effect of irrigation depth variability and consequently with the available water variability on crop water stress could justify the yield decrease showed in fig 8 there is in fact a high correlation r2 0 74 between the crop yield and the observed cv swc fc swc i 4 discussion the effects of deficit irrigation treatments on the woody perennial crops have been mainly studied by following the agronomic approach chai et al 2016 however investigating the impact of soil water deficit from an agro hydrological point of view could help to deepen the understanding of the crop ecophysiological relationships with hydraulic and hydrological parameters of the agro ecosystem in this work the relationships between the crop water status and soil water content under deficit irrigation treatments characterized by different timing and intensity have been investigated in a citrus orchard the cumulated water stress in each of the three fruit growth stage was correlated to parameters of irrigation management such as the amount of water applied and the variability of the irrigation doses the relationship between measured predawn leaf and midday stem water potential with soil water content allowed identifying a threshold in terms of depletion factor p representing a basic parameter for a feed back control soil moisture based of irrigation scheduling the depletion factor obtained in this study p 0 41 was lower than that tabulated for citrus spp in the fao56 paper allen et al 1998 in this sense compared to other citrus spp clementina de nules is characterized by a lower resistance to water stress as stated in previous studies gonzález altozano and castel 1999 ballester et al 2011 similar thresholds of soil moisture content have been reported for citrus spp and woody perennial crops in mediterranean areas by plotting leaf water potential with measurements of soil water content ginestar and castel 1996 rallo and provenzano 2013 agüero alcaras et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 in the same line a previous study by rallo et al 2017 carried out in an orange orchard reported a threshold of soil depletion when mswp started to decrease corresponding to a p factor equal to 0 20 this value lower than that obtained in this study could have been due to the different soil texture citrus spp age crop practices and irrigation management continuous and automatic measurements of soil water content have been suggested as accurate methods for the feedback control of irrigation in fruit trees agüero alcaras et al 2016 gasque et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 vera et al 2013 2019 domínguez niño et al 2020 therefore the identified threshold of soil water status is useful to design accurate and easy site specific irrigation scheduling protocol in clementina de nules the cumulated water stress index s mswp was used to assess the link between the crop water status in the three fruit growth stages and the total water supplied precipitation plus irrigation in the field it was observed that the s mswp is an useful indicator for scheduling irrigation in citrus trees when a degree of soil water deficit is imposed and for evaluating the effects of soil water deficit on the crop water status literature for citrus and woody perennial crops has reported strong correlations between indicators of crop water stress with actual evapotranspiration trunk growth volumetric soil water content irrigation depth and crop yield ginestar and castel 1996 gasque et al 2016 de la rosa et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 gonzalez benecke and dinger 2018 martínez gimeno et al 2020 specifically rallo et al 2017 observed a robust relationship between the s mswp and irrigation depth in an orange orchard under deficit irrigation applied during stage ii of crop growth overall the response of the citrus crop to the imposed stress conditions varied in terms of timing and intensity magnitude of the imposed deficit confirming what already stated in previous studies on citrus orchards glodhammer 2012 ballester et al 2014 moreover in line with the conclusions of treeby et al 2007 the crop response to the lower water supply depends on the timing and severity of the treatments as well as on the species soil type and other site specific factors even the dispersion characterizing the soil moisture measurements and commonly associated to the drip irrigated orchards which was higher in the most severe di treatments has been observed in previous studies intrigliolo and castel 2004 rallo et al 2017 nonetheless to our knowledge there are no studies that have related the effects produced on crop yield by the magnitude and variation of irrigation doses id as evidenced by guswa et al 2004 higher the variability of soil water content wider the fraction of the root zone not wetted up to the soil field capacity this lag determines the lowering of the plateau of the water stress function and hence the increase of the crop stress level this assumption was confirmed by the fact that the coefficient of variation of the irrigation doses cv id affects the crop stress level and at the same time influences the variability of the difference between the field capacity and the actual soil water content cv swc fc swc i hence the variability of the available water cv swc fc swc i due to the combined effect of the micro irrigation system its management and the adopted water saving protocol can have effects on crop yield 5 conclusions the results achieved in this study reinforce the importance to consider in woody perennial crops the relationships between hydrological and hydraulic variables as indicators of irrigation management the ecophysiological relationships evidence the significance of monitoring the soil plant atmosphere continuum to define accurate thresholds of allowable soil depletion for precise irrigation scheduling a threshold in terms of depletion factor p 0 41 was recognized for clementina de nules to design location specific irrigation scheduling protocol large dispersion of mswp measurements for any fixed swc data was observed in the most severe deficit irrigation treatments e g 25 di as a consequence of the localized irrigation system and the variability of the applied irrigation doses at the same time the tree water status was differently affected by the timing and the severity of applied stress conditions the cumulated water stress integral s mswp has been validated as an appropriate crop water status indicator for irrigation scheduling to predict specific levels of crop water stress the s mswp was well correlated to the total amount of water supplied by precipitation and irrigation and the average irrigation doses applied on each watering event confirming the significance of these hydraulic variables to design appropriate water saving strategies the normalized s mswp index whose calculation allows accounting for the different atmospheric conditions observed during the two experimental years was highly correlated to the normalized total amount of water supplied the variability of the irrigation doses cv id produced effects either on the crop water status and yield production the relationship between the s mswp and the cv id showed that the deficit irrigation treatments characterized by the relatively higher variability of irrigation doses are associated with the higher crop stress levels observed on the crop the lower and more time variable irrigation doses in deficit treatments moistened wider fractions of the root zone with water not readily available for the crop thus cv id influences the variability of the available soil water content in the root volume cv swc fc swc i which affects the final performance in terms of crop yield therefore the accurate assessment of the impact of deficit irrigation on crop water status and agronomic performance has to consider variables of irrigation management such as the irrigation amount and the variability of irrigation doses when designing a drip irrigation system it is also necessary to consider the fraction of the root volume to wet credit authorship contribution statement angela puig sirera conceptualization

10172,the knowledge of the crop response to soil water deficit is essential to predict the actual crop water requirements under limited soil water conditions the mathematical schematization of the crop response under rdi can allow identifying the exact irrigation timing the threshold of soil water status below which crop transpiration decreases represents a key parameter for the water stress functions the main objective of this paper was to investigate the effects of several rdi treatments applied during the three stages of fruit growth on soil plant water relations of drip irrigated mandarin trees experiments were carried out in seven irrigation treatments a control irrigated at 125 of potential evapotranspiration measured in weighting lysimeters etlys during the whole year and six rdi treatments in which 25 and 50 of etlys were applied during each of the three stages of fruit growth the critical threshold of soil water status expressed in terms of soil water depletion below which predawn plwp and midday mswp leaf water potential is affected by decreasing soil water content were identified the dependency of crop water status from the climate forcing occurring under soil water contents higher than the critical threshold was also demonstrated moreover a strong relationship between water stress integral s mswp evaluated during the three stages of fruit growth and the corresponding amount of water applied irrigation and precipitation was observed after normalizing the variables the robust relationship between these two variables r2 0 83 confirmed that the water stress integral represents a good indicator of the plant water relationship and allows the prediction of the total irrigation depth to be applied to achieve a desired stress level during the fruit growth moreover this relationship depends on the irrigation schedule adopted to regulate the deficit which includes the irrigation variables such as irrigation dose and its variability keywords deficit irrigation depletion factor irrigation dose water stress integral 1 introduction in the mediterranean basin approximately 30 of the cultivated area is under irrigation which represents the biggest consumer of freshwater from the region harmanny and malek 2019 specifically the irrigated land in spain accounts for 80 of global water consumption mapa 2019 citrus spp is the crop most cultivated fruit tree in spain with a surface extended 307 560 ha in 2019 of which 93 is irrigated represents the crop with the highest irrigated area mapa 2019 moreover spain is one of the main producing countries worldwide of citrus spp with an average annual production of around 6 3 mt in 2019 more than a third of this production comes from the mandarin group being clementina de nules one of the most common cultivars mapa 2019 thus it is important to determinate the citrus water requirements by designing simple practical and precise methods to optimize irrigation and to adopt precise irrigation scheduling and management techniques gasque et al 2016 water saving strategies such as deficit irrigation di have been studied as a promising alternative for growers of citrus spp mainly in areas characterized by water shortcomings and increasing frequency of drought phenomena ferreres and soriano 2007 carr 2012 rocamora et al 2013 under regulated deficit irrigation water is generally supplied at levels below full crop transpiration during specific periods of the fruit growing season operating in this way it is possible to balance the plant vigor with the potential production by limiting the irrigation volumes costa et al 2007 rallo et al 2017 therefore deficit irrigation has been considered as a strategy to save water and to increase water productivity besides this strategy may have positive impacts on fruit quality and composition parameters that contrast the possible side effects on fruit size and weight due to water stress ballester et al 2011 with the consequent upgrade of yield values garcía tejero et al 2010 carr 2012 consoli et al 2014 nonetheless the application of di requires monitoring in real time the crop water status and soil water content to control the level of water stress reached by the crop and hence to prevent crop damage and yield losses rallo et al 2017 in this direction plant based indicators of water status have been widely used namely predawn or midday stem water potential jones 2004 these indicators are discrete measurements that represent a snapshot in time of the crop water status and their measurement require expert knowledge moreover plant based indicators integrate the effects of soil water availability and the atmospheric evaporative demand thus it could be complicated to establish irrigation thresholds only considering measurements of tree water status ortuño et al 2006 ortuño et al 2009 a b to complement them another index the water stress integral calculated as the summation of pre dawn or midday leaf water potential measurements over a chosen period summarizes the cumulative stress reached by the crop throughout a certain period myers 1988 besides that soil moisture sensors such as neutron probes frequency domain reflectometry fdr or capacitance probe time domain reflectometry tdr and fiber optic sensors provide feedback on the soil moisture and can be acquired automatically fares and alva 2000 evett et al 2008 gil rodríguez et al 2013 for these reasons soil water contents have been frequently used in precise irrigation scheduling and as a tool for efficient irrigation evett et al 2008 vera et al 2019 however diverse studies have highlighted the spatial heterogeneity of soil water content and the inaccuracies derived on scheduling irrigation only based on soil moisture measurements intrigiolo and castel 2004 agüero alcaras et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 domínguez niño et al 2020 the heterogeneous patterns of soil moisture depend on many factors such as irrigation depth quantity and frequency of irrigation the type of water distribution system and the relative design plan grant et al 2009 domínguez niño et al 2020 specifically guswa et al 2004 highlighted the impact that the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the root volume has on the total root water uptake the crop water stress response to soil water status is in fact not linear and not uniquely associated but rather depend on a large extent on the degree of wetting uniformity of the root zone therefore besides the agronomic related results derived from the application of water saving strategies is essential to study the hydraulic and hydrologic parameters that could affect the crop functioning and performance however most studies on the effects of water saving strategies on the crop system are focused on agronomic methods and less emphasis has been placed on agro hydrological approaches in this sense further studying of the ecophysiological relationships according to different levels of water stress imposed could provide knowledge on the crop water dynamics and thus on adequate irrigation management techniques ginestar and castel 1996 agüero alcaras et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 understanding these relationships could help to identify the maximum allowable depletion mad which represents a basic knowledge for irrigation scheduling allen et al 1998 the depletion coefficient p generally used to identify the mad provides information about the crop resistance to water stress for citrus spp table 22 of fao56 paper indicates to assume a value of p 0 50 allen et al 1998 however the value of this coefficient could vary with the different citrus spp canopy architecture plant density fraction of ground cover and training system thus local calibration of the p coefficient could represent more accurately the crop response to water stress in this study a robust database of soil and crop data collected in previous research conducted by gonzález altozano and castel 1999 was used to i study the eco physiological response of a citrus crop citrus clementina hort ex tan to different timing and magnitude of deficit irrigation ii identify the threshold of soil water status to implement water saving strategies in citrus orchards iii assess the effect of irrigation management variables on the cumulated water stress and crop yield response 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the experimental field field data were collected in a citrus orchard during two consecutive years 1995 from june to december and 1996 from january to december in the experimental farm of instituto valenciano de investigaciones agrarias located in moncada spain 39 35 17 5 n 0 23 59 7 w 68 m a s l the orchard was extended 2 ha and planted with the variety clementina de nules citrus clementina hort ex tan grafted on citrange carrizo citrus sinensis l osb x poncirus trifoliata l raf with plants spaced 3 85 m along the row and 6 0 m between rows density of 433 trees ha the trees were ten years old at the time of field experiments gonzález altozano and castel 1999 formerly described the orchard which was pruned annually and with phytosanitary treatments performed according to the usual practices of the area the soil was calcareous with an effective depth of 0 5 0 6 m limited by a petrocalcic horizon and soil texture ranging from sandy loam to sandy clay loam usda 2017 the average field capacity and the soil wilting point resulted in 0 27 m3 m 3 and 0 15 m3 m 3 respectively the soil was poor in organic matter 0 7 and without salinity limitations 0 5 ds m 1 irrigation water coming from a well located on the farm had an electrical conductivity of 1 2 ds m 1 at 25 c gonzález altozano and castel 1999 the climate of the area is the mediterranean with mild winters and scarce precipitations during the growth season climatic parameters were recorded by an automated meteorological station installed in the eastern corner of the plot reference evapotranspiration et0 mm d 1 was calculated with the fao56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 the trees were irrigated with a drip irrigation system with two lateral pipes placed in parallel to the plant rows at a distance of 0 75 m from each side of the trunk and four 4 l h 1 emitters per tree spaced 1 25 m 2 2 irrigation treatments irrigation was scheduled based on the daily evapotranspiration measured in a weighing lysimeter etlys installed in the orchard the weighing lysimeter with dimensions of 4 0 4 0 1 5 m and precision of 0 25 mm of daily et was installed in 1989 and planted with a single tree similar to the rest of the orchard castel 1991 the tree in the lysimeter was irrigated with the same drip irrigation system as the rest of the plot and with doses corresponding to 125 of the measured etlys this percentage allowed accounting for the possible inefficiency of the irrigation plant the volumes applied with irrigation and the weight of the lysimeter were automatically recorded hourly with a datalogger cr10 campbell inc the experimental design consisted of a control treatment ctrl irrigated at 125 of etlys during the whole year and the following six irrigation treatments under regulated deficit irrigation rdi in which 25 25 i 25 ii 25 iii and 50 50 i 50 ii 50 iii of etlys were applied during each of the three stages of fruit growth i cell division ii cell elongation iii fruit maturation as indicated in fig 1 the duration of each period of deficit irrigation fig 1 was based on phenological observations and measurements of pre dawn leaf water potential plwp the phenological stages were defined after direct observations following the classification proposed for citrus by limón de la oliva et al 1972 the periods of the phenological phases and thus the timing of the irrigation treatments were phase i of fruit growth corresponding to flowering fruit set from march 20 to july 3 in 1995 and from april 1 to july 1 in 1996 phase ii of fruit growth corresponding to the initial fruit enlargement phase from july 4 to august 7 in 1995 and from july 2 to 28 in 1996 phase iii of fruit growth corresponding to the final growth and maturation from august 8 in 1995 and from july 29 in 1996 until harvesting all the treatments were irrigated every five four and two days per week in winter spring autumn and summer respectively the experimental design included randomized blocks with three replications per treatment further details about the distribution and the replicates of the applied treatments can be found in ginestar and castel 1996 gonzález altozano and castel 1999 2000 2 3 measurements of soil and tree water status the soil water content was monitored with a trase tdr system soil moisture equipment corp and probes installed at distances of 0 2 m and 0 4 m from the emitters tdr stainless steel rods 0 47 m length were installed in one tree per each plot thus three trees per treatment were monitored measurements of soil water content and leaf water potential were contextually acquired in days without irrigation every 7 days in 1995 and every 1 or 2 weeks in 1996 the tree water status was quantified by pre dawn leaf plwp mpa and midday stem mswp mpa water potential measured with a scholander chamber soil moisture equip corp following the recommendations of turner 1981 for each determination five mature leaves on two representative trees per treatment were used leaves exposed to north west were used for the pre dawn measurements and to south for the midday measurements two hours before the measurement of mswp the leaves were covered with silver foils and inserted in plastic bags for each treatment the water stress integral smswp mpa per day in each period of deficit irrigation and for the whole year were calculated by using the measurements of mswp the water stress integral was computed from the midday stem water potential as myers 1988 1 s mswp i 0 i i mswp i i 1 c n where mswpi i 1 is the average midday water potential measured in the time interval i i 1 c is the maximum predawn leaf water potential measured during the study period in the control treatment which resulted of 0 8 mpa and n is the number of days of the period 2 4 yield determination the yield was determined at the time of commercial harvest at the end of each season which took place around mid december the average fruit weight was obtained by counting the number of fruits in 15 boxes per each experimental plot about 20 kg box which were randomly selected and previously weighed with a resolution of 20 g fruit of low commercial value e g off season and fruit with creasing were left on the trees and picked and counted later 3 results 3 1 agrometeorological characteristics and lysimeter based crop evapotranspiration the dynamic of daily standard meteorological variables during the two experimental years is presented in fig 2 during the fruit growth stage i flowering and fruit set phases precipitation and crop water evapotranspiration etlys in 1995 resulted lower than in 1996 during the phenological stage ii initial phases of fruit enlargement there were more scarce precipitations and greater evaporative demand et0 compared to the phase i the stage iii final phases of fruit enlargement and maturation occurring in both years at the end of summer in 1995 was characterized by higher precipitations and lower et0 the maximum daily evapotranspiration in the lysimeter etlys was registered around the beginning of stage iii the cumulated precipitation during the fruit growth cycle in 1996 was higher of about 130 mm compared to 1995 the rainfall events were rare in stage ii and mainly concentrated during stage iii 3 2 eco physiological crop response to soil water deficit fig 3 shows the average soil water content swc as a function of the indicators of plant water status represented by the pre dawn leaf plwp and midday steam mswp water potentials for the control ctrl and the deficit irrigation di treatments for the higher values of soil water content both the indicators resulted around a constant value corresponding to about 0 4 mpa and 1 0 mpa in terms of plwp and mswp respectively for soil water content below a certain threshold the values of leaf stem water potential started to sharply decrease similarly to what observed by ballester et al 2011 for the same citrus spp this pattern was more accentuated in the 25 di than in the 50 di treatments despite the dispersion of data makes difficult to identify a clear threshold of swc it is plausible to assume a value of swc around 20 below which both the plwp and mswp decline at decreasing swc whose lower limit resulted of about 10 according to pellegrino et al 2006 this lower limit of soil water status can be considered close to the wilting point therefore assuming these thresholds of swc and a soil field capacity of 0 27 cm3 cm 3 the investigated soil is characterized by a depletion of 70 mm m 1 and a depletion factor p value of 0 41 as expected the lowest plwp and mswp values were reached in the 25 treatments due to the lower amount of water applied with irrigation regarding the 25 di the lowest values of swc plwp and mswp were registered when the timing stress was applied in the stages ii and iii of fruit growth therefore the intensity and timing of di treatments affected the crop water status which was well represented by the plant and soil water status indicators and their relationship the different crop response particularly evident when considering the dispersion of mswp fig 3c d for any fixed swc could be associated to the quite high spatial variability of soil water content associated to the microirrigation system as well as to the different evaporative demand the largest dispersion of the measured variables was observed during the periods of water deficit application this dispersion could be due to the partial wetting of the root system with the wetted volume becoming smaller at decreasing water doses increasing water stress levels as well as to the three dimensional soil moisture gradients around the water emission points characterizing the localized irrigation system to support these hypotheses guswa et al 2004 observed that for similar values of average soil water contents in the treatments characterized by higher water stress levels lower irrigation doses for a fixed frequency the root volume in which the water is readily available is more limited and consequently root water uptake is lower 3 3 water stress integral and effects due to irrigation variables the water stress integral s mswp approach is used to assess the relationship between crop water status and the total water supplied by precipitation and or irrigation at the same time s mswp was related to the average irrigation dose id supplied in each watering event the s mswp was calculated based on the values of mswp potential measured during the three fruit growth stages as discussed above the computation of s mswp started on the first of june because no data were available before that date the c value in eq 1 which was assumed as the maximum leaf water potential measured in the control treatment was 0 8 mpa for all the treatments table 1 shows the cumulated water stress integral during each of the three fruit growth stages in which the different irrigation treatments were applied in 1995 and 1996 as expected the cumulated water stress integral was higher for the 25 di treatments in both the experimental years due to the lower amount of water supplied the 25 iii treatment presented the highest s mswp value which was higher in 1996 compared to 1995 this confirms the sensitivity of clementina de nules variety to water deficit applied during the stage iii of crop growth as previously observed by gonzález altozano and castel 1999 and ballester et al 2011 in both the experimental years the second highest s mswp was observed in the 25 ii treatment due to the scarce precipitation and high atmospheric evaporative demand characterizing both the summer periods as expected the control treatment was associated with the smallest s mswp when considering the 50 di treatments slight differences with the ctrl were recognized in terms of smswp especially in 1995 as a result the application of 50 di treatments is likely to cause significant crop water stress only during irrigation seasons with low rainfall and high evaporative demand even for the 50 di treatments stage iii of crop growth was the most sensitive to water stress fig 4a b shows the s mswp mpa per day of the di treatments during the three fruit growth stages versus the total amount of water applied e g precipitation and irrigation mm both in absolute fig 4a and normalized fig 4b terms the normalization was obtained as the ratio between the variable obtained in di treatment and the corresponding associated to the ctrl the normalization procedure allowed excluding the effects deriving from the different atmospheric conditions registered in the two experimental years there is a trend between the s mswp for all stages and the total amount of water applied p i in absolute terms for each experimental year the values of s mswp decreased at increasing the amount of water applied moreover a robust r2 0 83 relationship between the normalized water stress integral n s mswp and the corresponding normalized water supplied n p i can be observed fig 4b the decreasing regression curve shows how the crop water stress becomes smaller as the water supplied regime of the di treatments tend to the ctrl one as observed in previous studies garcía tejero et al 2010 goldhamer 2012 rallo et al 2017 the s mswp can be used as an indicator to predict the seasonal amount of water necessary to accomplish a desired level of stress fig 5a b illustrates the relationship between s mswp cumulated during the whole season fig 5a and stage ii fig 5b of fruit growth and the corresponding amount of irrigation applied during the same periods in both the experimental years the relationships in fig 5b was compared with the relationship identified by rallo et al 2017 for an orange citrus orchard under di applied during only the phase ii fruit growth stage the value of s mswp decreased at increasing of the total irrigation i supplied being the lowest values obtained for the control treatment ctrl moreover the 50 i and 50 ii treatments showed values closed to the ctrl one as shown in fig 5b the s mswp and the i obtained for the 25 ii and 50 ii are very close to the empirical relationship proposed by rallo et al 2017 confirming that during stage ii of citrus fruit growth it is feasible to predict the amount of irrigation necessary to achieve the desired level of crop water stress fig 6a b shows the effects of the average irrigation doses applied in each watering id on the s mswp observed during the whole period of water deficit application fig 6a and during the phase ii of fruit growth fig 6b the analysis of the relationship in fig 6a shows that s mswp also depends on the quantity of water applied in each watering which could suggest the relevance of this irrigation management variable in the designing of the water saving strategies the relationship found between s mswp and id under water deficit in the stage ii of fruit growth fig 6b evidences a different regression curve that the one observed in rallo et al 2017 the different shape of the curves is probably due to the different methods used to determine the irrigation doses id which were the lysimeter based in this experiment and according to the weather based method in rallo et al 2017 3 4 effect of irrigation depth variability on crop water stress and crop yield fig 7a shows the relationship r2 0 71 between the cumulated water stress integral s mswp in all the stages of fruit growth and the coefficient of variation of irrigation doses applied in each watering cv id the relationship confirms that the level of water stress increased with the irrigation doses variability the most severe di treatment di 25 iii was characterized by the highest variability of cv id whereas the control treatment was characterized by the lowest cv id as referred the irrigation depth was calculated based on the etlys and thus the id depends on the atmospheric demand of the days included among consecutive watering two three or five days respectively for summer spring and autumn periods therefore the irrigation volumes supplied during each irrigation event were different being based on the et demand and the imposed reductions of irrigation volumes as stated in section 3 2 the effect of id variability on the cumulated water stress integral could be explained following the consideration of guswa et al 2004 as shown in fig 7a the lowest variability of the supplied irrigation volume was associated to the control treatment in which the highest irrigation doses 125 et lys allowed to wet more homogeneously the crop root volume thus crop water uptake was not affected by the soil water deficit conditions because a higher fraction of roots was moistened at soil water content close to the soil field capacity swcfc before starting the drying process on the other hand in the di treatments the plant started to increase the cumulated stress originated from lower and more time variable irrigation doses supplied in each event the root system could have experimented soil water content quite lower than that corresponding to the field capacity even after irrigation events when part of the root system was differently moistened the reasons behind this behavior are mainly due to the smaller water doses and the localized irrigation system which generates high three dimensional soil moisture gradients around the water emission points the crop water stress was consequent to the root water uptake lower than the maximum in a bigger fraction of the root volume in which water was not readily available hence the plant needed to extract water from further wet regions to compensate for the limitations occurring in the dry root volume therefore the cv id depended on the magnitude of irrigation doses because the higher quantity of water supply allowed moistening more uniformly wider fraction of the root zone with more readily water available for the crop as observed the cv id would influence the variability of the available soil water content swc fc swc i in the root volume for the different treatments fig 7b shows the correlation between the coefficient of variation of the available soil water content cv swc fc swc i and the cv id measured during all the fruit growth stages the variability of the difference between the field capacity and the actual soil water content cv swc fc swc i becomes higher as the cv id increases thus this difference would become wider under the most severe treatment in which the actual soil water contents are quite lower than the soil field capacity swc fc the effect of irrigation depth variability and consequently with the available water variability on crop water stress could justify the yield decrease showed in fig 8 there is in fact a high correlation r2 0 74 between the crop yield and the observed cv swc fc swc i 4 discussion the effects of deficit irrigation treatments on the woody perennial crops have been mainly studied by following the agronomic approach chai et al 2016 however investigating the impact of soil water deficit from an agro hydrological point of view could help to deepen the understanding of the crop ecophysiological relationships with hydraulic and hydrological parameters of the agro ecosystem in this work the relationships between the crop water status and soil water content under deficit irrigation treatments characterized by different timing and intensity have been investigated in a citrus orchard the cumulated water stress in each of the three fruit growth stage was correlated to parameters of irrigation management such as the amount of water applied and the variability of the irrigation doses the relationship between measured predawn leaf and midday stem water potential with soil water content allowed identifying a threshold in terms of depletion factor p representing a basic parameter for a feed back control soil moisture based of irrigation scheduling the depletion factor obtained in this study p 0 41 was lower than that tabulated for citrus spp in the fao56 paper allen et al 1998 in this sense compared to other citrus spp clementina de nules is characterized by a lower resistance to water stress as stated in previous studies gonzález altozano and castel 1999 ballester et al 2011 similar thresholds of soil moisture content have been reported for citrus spp and woody perennial crops in mediterranean areas by plotting leaf water potential with measurements of soil water content ginestar and castel 1996 rallo and provenzano 2013 agüero alcaras et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 in the same line a previous study by rallo et al 2017 carried out in an orange orchard reported a threshold of soil depletion when mswp started to decrease corresponding to a p factor equal to 0 20 this value lower than that obtained in this study could have been due to the different soil texture citrus spp age crop practices and irrigation management continuous and automatic measurements of soil water content have been suggested as accurate methods for the feedback control of irrigation in fruit trees agüero alcaras et al 2016 gasque et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 vera et al 2013 2019 domínguez niño et al 2020 therefore the identified threshold of soil water status is useful to design accurate and easy site specific irrigation scheduling protocol in clementina de nules the cumulated water stress index s mswp was used to assess the link between the crop water status in the three fruit growth stages and the total water supplied precipitation plus irrigation in the field it was observed that the s mswp is an useful indicator for scheduling irrigation in citrus trees when a degree of soil water deficit is imposed and for evaluating the effects of soil water deficit on the crop water status literature for citrus and woody perennial crops has reported strong correlations between indicators of crop water stress with actual evapotranspiration trunk growth volumetric soil water content irrigation depth and crop yield ginestar and castel 1996 gasque et al 2016 de la rosa et al 2016 rallo et al 2017 gonzalez benecke and dinger 2018 martínez gimeno et al 2020 specifically rallo et al 2017 observed a robust relationship between the s mswp and irrigation depth in an orange orchard under deficit irrigation applied during stage ii of crop growth overall the response of the citrus crop to the imposed stress conditions varied in terms of timing and intensity magnitude of the imposed deficit confirming what already stated in previous studies on citrus orchards glodhammer 2012 ballester et al 2014 moreover in line with the conclusions of treeby et al 2007 the crop response to the lower water supply depends on the timing and severity of the treatments as well as on the species soil type and other site specific factors even the dispersion characterizing the soil moisture measurements and commonly associated to the drip irrigated orchards which was higher in the most severe di treatments has been observed in previous studies intrigliolo and castel 2004 rallo et al 2017 nonetheless to our knowledge there are no studies that have related the effects produced on crop yield by the magnitude and variation of irrigation doses id as evidenced by guswa et al 2004 higher the variability of soil water content wider the fraction of the root zone not wetted up to the soil field capacity this lag determines the lowering of the plateau of the water stress function and hence the increase of the crop stress level this assumption was confirmed by the fact that the coefficient of variation of the irrigation doses cv id affects the crop stress level and at the same time influences the variability of the difference between the field capacity and the actual soil water content cv swc fc swc i hence the variability of the available water cv swc fc swc i due to the combined effect of the micro irrigation system its management and the adopted water saving protocol can have effects on crop yield 5 conclusions the results achieved in this study reinforce the importance to consider in woody perennial crops the relationships between hydrological and hydraulic variables as indicators of irrigation management the ecophysiological relationships evidence the significance of monitoring the soil plant atmosphere continuum to define accurate thresholds of allowable soil depletion for precise irrigation scheduling a threshold in terms of depletion factor p 0 41 was recognized for clementina de nules to design location specific irrigation scheduling protocol large dispersion of mswp measurements for any fixed swc data was observed in the most severe deficit irrigation treatments e g 25 di as a consequence of the localized irrigation system and the variability of the applied irrigation doses at the same time the tree water status was differently affected by the timing and the severity of applied stress conditions the cumulated water stress integral s mswp has been validated as an appropriate crop water status indicator for irrigation scheduling to predict specific levels of crop water stress the s mswp was well correlated to the total amount of water supplied by precipitation and irrigation and the average irrigation doses applied on each watering event confirming the significance of these hydraulic variables to design appropriate water saving strategies the normalized s mswp index whose calculation allows accounting for the different atmospheric conditions observed during the two experimental years was highly correlated to the normalized total amount of water supplied the variability of the irrigation doses cv id produced effects either on the crop water status and yield production the relationship between the s mswp and the cv id showed that the deficit irrigation treatments characterized by the relatively higher variability of irrigation doses are associated with the higher crop stress levels observed on the crop the lower and more time variable irrigation doses in deficit treatments moistened wider fractions of the root zone with water not readily available for the crop thus cv id influences the variability of the available soil water content in the root volume cv swc fc swc i which affects the final performance in terms of crop yield therefore the accurate assessment of the impact of deficit irrigation on crop water status and agronomic performance has to consider variables of irrigation management such as the irrigation amount and the variability of irrigation doses when designing a drip irrigation system it is also necessary to consider the fraction of the root volume to wet credit authorship contribution statement angela puig sirera conceptualization

the management of water resources in irrigation schemes however little is known about them in south africa this study documents institutional innovations by 28 farmer groups located on four irrigation schemes in kwazulu natal and eastern cape provinces south africa induced institutional innovation theory ostrom s eight design principles and thematic analysis of interview transcripts were used to analyse the data the study results show that 21 groups engaged in institutional innovations indicating high levels of farmer led innovative activity among these irrigators examples of innovations include among others the introduction of a secret voting system to improve participation of marginalised people in decision making processes designing daily rotation rosters to reduce conflicts as well as using an attendance register for participation in group activities and rewarding members according to their participation levels the majority of these innovations were designed to improve the graduated sanction mechanism 22 2 enhancing the penalty system for non compliance improving collective action arrangements 27 8 monitoring attendance of group meetings 18 5 democratising decision making and ensuring equitable water distribution these innovations focused mainly on addressing challenges rather than exploiting opportunities and were mostly incremental 94 involving an adjustment or reinterpretation of rules and regulations radical institutional innovations constituted only 6 the innovative groups were smaller in size and experienced less conflict than the non innovative groups both groups had low levels of education and were mostly dominated by female farmers the study recommends that the government should build on the agency of the irrigators to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of institutional arrangements in irrigation schemes the study s findings suggest that small groups should be actively promoted while tailored training should be offered based on the groups specific needs to improve institutional innovations in the smallholder irrigation sector in south africa keywords smallholder irrigation induced institutional innovation farmer led institutions ostrom s eight design principles 1 introduction the performance of smallholder irrigation schemes in south africa and in other developing countries has been below expectations a growing body of literature reports that weak institutions among other reasons is a major bottleneck in the performance of these smallholder irrigation schemes across the developing countries including south africa dirwai et al 2019 mnkeni et al 2010 muchara et al 2014 vandersypen et al 2006 according to van averbeke et al 2011 of the 302 smallholder irrigation schemes in south africa in 2010 164 54 were underperforming because of poor managerial capabilities among farmers and weak or poor institutions institutions refer to humanly designed rules norms and regulations to facilitate the coordination among people and reduce uncertainty transactional costs and free riding north 1993 ostrom 2008 they are crucial in the establishment of individual rights over resources and providing mandates and steadiness in a complex and ambiguous world of economic relations menard and shirley 2005 among others studies have identified two main reasons behind poor institutions in smallholder irrigation schemes firstly that the agency of the irrigators themselves were ignored during their design and secondly that institutions have failed to evolve to cope with the dynamic nature of challenges and opportunities in the sector muchara et al 2014 mnkeni et al 2010 van averbeke et al 2011 yokwe 2009 according to these studies the irrigators were treated as passive recipients not active partners during the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes through programs such as irrigation management transfer participatory irrigation management and support to farmer managed irrigation systems the focus was on top down command and control type interventions characterised by limited farmer participation muchara et al 2014 shiferaw et al 2009 treating farmers as passive rather than active agents resulted in institutional arrangements that were not context specific as well as weak farmer commitment in the ownership and management of the schemes leading to system breakdown as raffaelli and glynn 2015 observed institutions designed by outsiders often fail due to lack of legitimacy despite being noble in intention or design institutions perform better when designed and implemented in a socially and politically acceptable manner with the involvement of all in the process to enhance legitimacy raffaelli and glynn 2015 institutions should be stable over a reasonable period to be effective in performing their crucial role of establishing reasonable expectations in dealings among people ruttan 2005 however institutional innovations are required to keep up with the changing nature of development gatzweiler and von braun 2016 ruttan 2005 spielman et al 2011 institutional innovation refers to the design and implementation of new or significantly improved rules norms processes and procedures that differ significantly from an organisation s previous ones they should be led by the actors to create an enabling societal environment that motivates people to use their capabilities fully gatzweiler and von braun 2016 raffaelli and glynn 2015 farmer led institutional innovation refers to a process in which farmers themselves initiate establish and improve institutions based on their context specific challenges or opportunities de bont and veldwisch 2020 farmers are rational agents who understand their local context and are capable of negotiating designing adapting and implementing innovations that relate to their local realities which can positively contribute to better adaptations to rapidly changing environments ostrom 2008 reij and waters bayer 2001 tambo 2018 tran et al 2019 current literature focusing on inclusive innovation cozzens and sutz 2014 fressoli et al 2014 gupta 2012 has highlighted the importance of not only ensuring that marginalised or poor people benefit from outcomes of innovation but also ensuring their participation in the innovation processes that is it is not just about innovations for the poor but innovations with the poor gupta 2012 it is vital to highlight that even though farmer led institutional innovations are touted as the key to improving water resources management because of farmers capabilities to implement context specific solutions de bont and veldwisch 2020 mdee and harrison 2019 farmer led irrigation must occur within a regulated context to avoid externalities and improve their long term sustainability lefore et al 2019 woodhouse et al 2017 noted that in sub saharan africa irrigated hectares in most farmer led irrigation schemes were greater than the official government assessments resulting in over exploitation of water resources therefore the government s role is to regulate and support farmers to govern water resources within the wider landscape supportive legislation and regulations the government should control and mitigate negative externalities such as over exploitation of water resources contamination of soil and water with agrochemicals to avoid environmental degradation lefore et al 2019 and allow farmers to play a prominent role in the management of irrigation schemes documenting farmer led institutional innovations is an important step toward recognising farmers as major producers and users of innovations however in the agricultural sector information about institutional innovations that are led by farmers is scarce the focus of a growing strand of literature documenting farmer led innovations has been more on technological oriented innovations new crops varieties soil conservation practices new planting methods and irrigation and drainage technologies tran et al 2019 jouni et al 2018 tambo 2018 levidow et al 2014 while there have been some studies on institutional innovations mose et al 2015 muchara and mbatha 2016 tambo 2018 vandersypen et al 2006 most of these studies have overlooked the importance of legitimacy in institutional innovations focusing more on usefulness and novelty raffaelli and glynn 2015 for example mose et al 2015 reported institutional innovations around improving access to information and market through the establishment of private extension officers and the implementation of a computerised program to manage production operations tambo 2018 in a study seeking to highlight farmer generated innovations reported mainly technically oriented innovations and very few institutional innovations vandersypen et al 2006 reported the implementation of a rotation roster for irrigation access and canal cleaning as an example of institutional innovations in niger irrigation schemes their study findings revealed farmers inabilities to monitor and enforce rules thus their institutions remained immature in south africa muchara and mbatha 2016 showed how farmers through small informal groups were able to improve input procurement market access and information flow in the mooi river irrigation scheme their study indicated a need for strong institutions to enforce rules regulations and incentives for motivating more farmers to participate in reducing transactional costs and that farmers should lead in crafting their institutions managing drainage network is vital for reducing excessive salinity in irrigation schemes minhas et al 2020 jouni et al 2018 however according to minhas et al 2006 p 476 managing drainage networks requires techno economic water conveyance which is too costly for farmers to maintain hence government support is still required to maintain hydrological infrastructure farmers in india adopted a less costly strategy bio drainage to control channel seepage by implementing canal side plantation and block plantation to protect the canal from sand drifts singh and lal 2018 moreover in australia farmers controlled a shallow groundwater table by planting deep rooted permanent pastures trees and crops singh and lal 2018 even though bio drainage reduces land size it is a viable innovation for controlling excessive salinity moreover studies on water governance in smallholder irrigation schemes such as those by dirwai et al 2019 and muchara et al 2014 have mainly focused on broad issues such as how governance affects infrastructure paying limited attention on how farmers have solved their institutional challenges therefore this paper seeks to contribute to the literature by conceptualising and operationalising institutional innovation in the context of smallholder irrigation schemes to the best our knowledge few studies if any have contextualised institutional innovations with an emphasis on legitimacy raffaelli and glynn 2015 institutional innovations were investigated at the farmer group level because nearly all institutional innovations in the smallholder sector are group based tambo 2018 farmer groups are important in south africa because the government and other development agencies prefer working with groups in their interventions in the sector sinyolo and mudhara 2018 understanding why and how a group of farmers collectively choose to make changes in their everyday operational and constitutional rules is imperative for policymakers to know where interventions can be best made ostrom and benjamin 1993 while there is a plethora of literature investigating collective action among farmer groups barham and chitemi 2009 gezahegn et al 2019 muchara et al 2014 sinyolo and mudhara 2018 these studies rarely ask questions on the internal dynamics of the groups with the exception of that of barham and chitemi 2009 this study focused on documenting institutional innovations in four irrigation schemes in the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces of south africa the four schemes were chosen because they have existed for a longer period at least 29 years long enough for us to understand the dynamics of institutional innovations since the management of schemes was transferred to farmers moreover these schemes have been identified as major hotspots for irrigation management failure dirwai et al 2019 muchara et al 2014 van averbeke et al 2011 yokwe 2009 the paper is organised as follows section 2 provides a brief conceptualisation of institutional innovation and the theoretical framework focusing on how institutions change as well as explaining ostrom s eight design principles section 3 presents the research methodology while section 4 presents the results and discussions on the nature of institutional innovations identified and the group characteristics lastly conclusions and policy recommendations are presented 2 theoretical framework 2 1 definition of institutional innovation there are various interpretations of the term institution edquist 2005 north 1990 the widely cited definition refers to institutions as a set of common habits norms routines practices or laws that govern the behaviour of participants or members of a community edquist 2005 north 1990 they are designed to cope with uncertainty reduce transactional costs and free riding issues following north 1990 and many studies in innovation literature e g edquist 2005 we differentiate between the rules of the game i e institutions and the players of the game i e actors or organisations institutions are shared concepts that exist in the minds of the actors as mostly implicit norms rather than explicit rules ostrom 1990 these shared concepts can be categorised as rules in use and rules in form north 1993 ostrom 2008 quinn et al 2007 wilson et al 2013 the rules in use are informal rules that an individual farmer learns on the ground while rules in form are formal rules that are documented in an explicit form ostrom 1990 according to ostrom and benjamin 1993 researchers should focus more on rules in use rather than focusing on rules in form because rules in use help in identifying shared norms relations and the building of trust among a group of farmers or a society these will eventually lead to strengthening collective action spielman et al 2011 raffaelli and glynn 2015 p 2 define institutional innovation as novel useful and legitimate change that disrupts to varying degrees the cognitive normative or regulative mainstays of an organisational field while most innovation definitions emphasise newness and usefulness muchara and mbatha 2016 oecd 2018 spielman et al 2011 raffaelli and glynn 2015 argue for the inclusion of legitimacy as a key dimension when dealing with institutional innovation that is an institutional change should be novel unique useful solve a problem or add value and be legitimate be accepted by the users for it to be considered an innovation raffaelli and glynn 2015 this study expands the concept of legitimate to further include the concept of environmental and ecological sustainability this means that since the sources of irrigation water which are the rivers are shared by multiple actors institutional innovation implemented by farmers should not have an adverse negative impact on the end users and the environment innovations can be incremental less disruptive changes comprising of the modification of existing institutions or radical more disruptive change involving the creation of new institutions leading to significantly different ways of doing things raffaelli and glynn 2015 rogers 2010 following hargrave and van de ven 2006 and raffaelli and glynn 2015 institutional innovation in this study includes both the creation of new institutions and change in existing institutions legitimate institutional innovations are often path dependent involving incremental changes from previous institutions which actors can easily comprehend and accept as desirable raffaelli and glynn 2015 usefulness and novelty should be judged or defined within the context of the adopting group because innovation does not stop being an innovation just because it already exists elsewhere oecd 2018 however raffaelli and glynn 2015 argue that the novelty of institutional innovation should be less localised and be perceived in terms of the broader community in which innovations arises this means novelty must be perceived by relevant audiences or users such as farmers or the community as legitimate credible and appropriate legitimacy is crucial when dealing with institutional innovations because for institutions to be stable over time this requires the creation of credible and appropriate transformation processes which are socially constructed and culturally embedded to ensure inclusiveness of all actors and sustainability libecap 1993 ostrom and benjamin 1993 raffaelli and glynn 2015 however usefulness is more important than novelty when dealing with innovations in developing countries in general and in the smallholder sector in particular because the important aspect of innovation is that it should be value laden or solve challenges that induce groups to innovate 2 2 how do institutional innovations emerge two main bodies of theories have emerged in studying induced institutional innovation particularly in agriculture i e neoclassical and new institutional economics nie the neoclassical model mainly considers three variables price consumer preferences and technology that affect relative factor endowments and lead to induced change menard and shirley 2005 neoclassical is criticised for being too narrow as it ignores the importance of variables such as power culture and ideology in institutional change grabowski 1988 ruttan and hayami 1984 the nie approach gives a more comprehensive overview of institutional change as it extends neoclassical theory and considers these additional variables menard and shirley 2005 ruttan and hayami 1984 north 1990 argues that continuous interaction between actors in an organisation given scarce resources increases competition competition leads groups to observe learn and innovate to survive and remain stable however existing internal institutions determine innovations that can be accepted by members based on the maximum payoff because of factors such as culture ideology and power which determine the speed and supply cost of initiating of institutional innovation particular ideologies and traditional cultures can make certain institutional innovations more easily established and accepted by the actors if they share the same systems of values and norms this means that institutional innovation may not occur at a socially optimum level because power dynamics play a crucial role in determining the demand and supply of institutional innovation in society actors who have power may design and implement institutions that redistribute returns in their favour the role of collective action in changing the supply of institutional innovation encompasses struggles to eliminate power disparities and this depends on the cost of achieving a social consensus mahoney and thelen 2009 north 1990 1993 ruttan and hayami 1984 however if collective action fails government can play a regulative role and enforce rules in order to eliminate power disparities in the management of common pool resources libecap 1993 and raffaelli and glynn 2015 further note that institutional innovations are generally an incremental modification of existing institutions path dependent process because organisations learn and develop their ideologies in the context of already existing formal and informal rules incremental innovations arise purposefully to solve problems or add value while radical innovations creation of new institutions usually result due to significant shocks that can disrupt the status quo cleaver 2012 mahoney and thelen 2009 note that incremental innovations come when a group adjusts its situational processes and regularisation over time situational adjustment allows actors to create or disentangle confusing situations by reinterpreting or redefining rules and relationships farmers may gradually or incrementally change their institutions to ensure that current institutions relate to current challenges with gradual institutional change a farmer group may apply displacement or layering to re design institutions mahoney and thelen 2009 displacement happens when the existing rules and procedures in an organisation are entirely substituted by new ones through progressive change while layering occurs when existing rules are significantly improved from the previous ones changes take place as actors re assign or reinterpret rules values and norms to have a new purpose and meaning in the context of smallholder irrigation schemes ostrom s eight design principles ostrom 2008 ostrom and benjamin 1993 wilson et al 2013 offer a guideline for designing efficient institutional conditions for their effective management a design principle refers to that condition which accounts for successfully designing irrigation institutions that are self governing and self managing over a period of time sarker and itoh 2001 the eight design principles include 1 clearly defined boundaries in which unentitled external parties are effectively excluded from using the resource 2 there must be congruence between the resource environment and its governing structures rules in place should fit local conditions 3 there must be collective choice arrangements participatory decision making among resource users 4 rules in place should be enforced through effective monitoring 5 there should be graduated sanctions for those who abuse the resources and for free riders 6 conflict resolution mechanisms should be easily available 7 there must be minimal recognition of rights to organise and 8 rules should be organised and enforced through nested enterprises ostrom 2008 ostrom and benjamin 1993 these principles can be adapted and applied to a diverse environment which requires cooperation among members to achieve shared objectives sarker and itoh 2001 wilson et al 2013 given the importance of these design principles in the management of irrigation schemes this study uses these design principles as the key themes across which the irrigators should innovate for example in most schemes routines when to access water and for how long are apparent however the challenge is on the enforcement monitoring and on penalising free riders phakathi and wale 2018 dirwai et al 2019 and muchara et al 2014 indicated that most farmers in the mooi river and tugela ferry schemes did not abide by irrigation routines as they irrigated more days than allocated exposing other farmers to water insecurities moreover muchara et al 2014 reported that there is weak or a lack of collective action in the management of the schemes as few farmers participate in decision making canal cleaning and scheme maintenance it is therefore expected that irrigators would be induced to continually design re assign or reinterpret rules values and norms around water access and the eight design principles for scheme management hargrave and van de ven 2006 however because smallholder farming is highly unequal in terms of assets ownership and is dominated by a patriarchal system sinyolo and mudhara 2018 phakathi and wale 2018 certain farmers based on their power and status may influence decisions which may exclude the much marginalised farmers for example those who are water secure may resist new institutions and may deliberately close any room for innovation or only accommodate innovations that bolster their status quo cleaver and de koning 2015 variables such as group size education levels of group members gender composition of members and leaders etc either inhibit or enhance the speed of designing and implementation of institutional change it becomes difficult to monitor and enforce rules in bigger groups because of increasing transactional costs for rule enforcement due to free riding among members gezahegn et al 2019 in addition studies have indicated that groups dominated by males tend to be more successful because male farmers have better access to resources in rural areas which are dominated by the patriarchal systems barham and chitemi 2009 sinyolo and mudhara 2018 therefore regulated farmer led institutional innovations are vital for eliminating power disparities within schemes 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling procedure and study area description a sample of 28 groups across four irrigation schemes in the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces in south africa were selected using a multi stage purposive sampling approach the first stage involved the purposive selection of the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces the two provinces were selected because they have the second and third largest number of irrigation schemes in south africa and irrigated agriculture is the primary source of livelihood among rural farmers due to high level of temperature and low precipitation rate mnkeni et al 2010 muchara et al 2014 van averbeke et al 2011 yokwe 2009 in stage two four irrigation schemes were purposively selected from a list of irrigation schemes in the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces the lists were obtained from the provincial departments of agriculture the selection criteria included the number of years the scheme had been in operation numbers of beneficiaries land size and occurrence of water management challenges such as free riding issues weak penalty systems and weak monitoring mechanisms after field visits to most of the schemes and informal discussions with farmers on scheme management and challenges the qamata and zanyokwe irrigation schemes of the eastern cape and tugela and mooi river irrigation schemes of the kwazulu natal were selected the last sampling stage involved the selection of irrigation groups or blocks in the four chosen irrigation schemes the study targeted groups instead of individual farmers because as tambo 2018 reported institutional innovations in the smallholder sector are mainly implemented at the group level the contact details of a group or block chairperson were obtained from the local extension officers in the provincial departments of agriculture and appointments were made with them with the assistance of the extension officers the total number of groups selected was 28 tugela ferry 7 mooi river 9 and qamata 6 zanyokwe 6 the data was collected between january and march 2018 table 1 shows the key features of the selected irrigation schemes and the number of blocks groups selected these irrigation groups share water from the same secondary canal hence they have to work together on devising institutions for water management and distribution the aim was to select groups blocks located in the upper middle and lower end of the participating irrigation schemes however most groups were selected in tugela ferry and zanyokwe while only one did form part of the sample in qamata in mooi river irrigation schemes nine of the 15 groups were selected representing three locations upper middle and lower end several studies have reported challenges in water access management and distribution among the irrigators in these irrigation schemes dirwai et al 2019 mnkeni et al 2010 sharaunga and mudhara 2016 yokwe 2009 table 1 shows that all four schemes have been in operation for about 60 years on average with mooi river having been in existence for the longest duration 116 years with tugela ferry the shortest 29 years the tugela ferry and mooi river irrigation schemes fall under umzinyathi district in the umsinga local municipality in kwazulu natal these schemes were established to improve rural livelihoods in 2013 rehabilitation took place in tugela ferry while in mooi river the rehabilitation process is ongoing both tugela and mooi river went through irrigation management transfer in 1997 where the management of the scheme was given over to farmers dirwai et al 2019 in the tugela irrigation scheme water is diverted from the tugela river using a 34 km long canal under gravity feed for block 1 2 3 4 and 5 however due to geographical locations other blocks draw water using either electric 4a and 7 or diesel pump 4b because of broken canals resulting in water shortages particularly on the tail end position the zanyokwe irrigation scheme falls under the amathole municipality in the eastern cape the scheme was established in 1983 by the israeli government after democracy in 1994 the limocor co operative a government parastatal took up management of the scheme in 1997 limocor left and the management of the scheme was transferred to farmers due to challenges in managing the scheme the zanyokwe scheme was vandalised but in 2004 co operatives were formed and the government revitalised the irrigation system the qamata irrigation scheme falls under the intsika yethu municipality in the eastern cape and it was established in the late 1960 s by the former transkei government it receives water from the lubisi dam diverted from the indwe river through a 28 km canal these schemes use a short furrow irrigation system but zanyokwe uses sprinklers 3 2 approach to identify farmer led institutional innovations institutional changes were considered innovations when they met five criteria a they should have been new or significantly improved rules norms processes and procedures b they should add value c they should have been legitimate d they should have been implemented within three years e they should have been initiated and led by the farmers with no or very limited external help newness was measured at the community level which meant that an institutional change had to differ significantly from the group s previous ones and be new to their community for it to be considered an innovation while innovation literature generally uses the lower standard of new to the innovator raffaelli and glynn 2015 argue that institutional innovations should be new at least to the innovator s community however farmer led innovation may be perceived as problematic for environmental sustainability in terms of exploiting water resources and water shortages downstream de bont and veldwisch 2020 in this study value and legitimacy were defined and measured in a broader way to encompass sustainability to the community and other users of the irrigation water source value addition was according to the perceptions of the groups while legitimacy was according to both group members and external actors such as officials from the provincial departments of agriculture rural development water affairs as well as other local development agencies who evaluated the sustainability the period of three years was considered long enough to capture innovation activities and reduce recall problem armbruster et al 2008 highlight that for institutional innovation activities the period to categorise innovators should be longer because shorter periods may categorise the imitators as innovators and the inventors as non innovators the study implemented various steps to identify and document institutional innovation among the selected irrigating groups the approach used adapted the steps that were used by tambo 2018 with some variations for example the study did not use contests as this was considered ill suited for the identification of institutional innovations firstly focus group discussions were conducted involving between 10 and 15 participants including irrigators extension officers and ngo representatives at least one focus group discussion was done with each selected group focusing on broad water management access challenges the farmers were facing some of the initiative s irrigators had implemented to deal with the challenges as well as examples of institutional innovations the groups had implemented extension officers and other development officials participated in some of these focus group discussions and assisted in giving further information on some of the innovations implemented by the irrigators over the years particularly on sustainability to ensure that water resources were not exploited the discussions were around the eight design principles on water management covering norms processes and regulations about equitable distribution of water conflict resolutions sanctions mechanisms participation and transparent decision making on the scheme secondly interviews were done at the group level with either a group chairperson treasurer or secretary insights from field observations and focus group discussions were used to design the questionnaire that was used in the second round to collect information about specific examples of institutional innovations these group leaders were asked to provide specific information on some of the innovations that were identified during focus group discussions as well as identify others that might have been omitted the questionnaire also asked questions about group characteristics such as group size education levels gender composition etc thirdly key informant interviews were done with mainly extension officers who confirmed the extent to which the examples of institutional innovations were new to the community or were initiated and led by the farmer and they further evaluated the social and environmental sustainability of the reported innovations following tambo s 2018 study the verification process resulted in some institutional changes being rejected because they were not new to the community or were not sufficiently led by the farmers 3 3 data analysis the data were analysed using thematic analysis based on the eight design principles to give a narrative analysis for the nature of institutional innovations implemented by farmer groups thematic analysis is a qualitative analysis that is suitable when the researcher s objectives are to understand the current practices of groups or individuals and to present and interpret themes that relate to the data braun et al 2014 since this study aimed to identify institutional innovations implemented in the last three years this first required the historical narrative that elaborated how and why institutions change and innovate through these narratives the study identified groups that implemented incremental or radical innovations the data on group dynamics in terms of the number of innovations implemented group age size and education level were presented using descriptive statistics 4 results and discussions 4 1 characteristics and examples of institutional innovations focus group discussions with the irrigators and interviews with group leaders generated a total of 86 institutional changes that they considered potentially innovative the verification step which included key informants mainly extension officers who confirmed the extent of the institutional changes identified by the irrigators led to 32 institutional changes being rejected these changes were considered to be not new to the community 26 or not sufficiently led by the farmers 8 table 2 shows that a total of 54 institutional changes met all the criteria out of the 28 groups 21 groups 75 reported at least one institutional innovation that met the criteria and thus were considered innovators only 7 groups 25 had not implemented any institutional innovation this suggests that most of the irrigation groups in irrigation schemes are engaged in innovative activities to improve their institutions almost all innovations reported were incremental 94 involving adjustment or reinterpretation of rules and regulations as per previous literature libecap 1993 north 1993 raffaelli and glynn 2015 as expected radical institutional innovations which involved implementation of new institutions leading to significantly different ways of doing things were very rare across all the schemes with only three examples identified table 2 shows that 98 of the institutional innovations were in response to challenges or problems and rarely did the irrigators innovate to exploit opportunities table 3 summarises some of the examples of institutional innovations implemented by farmer groups farmers in the irrigation schemes are interdependent as they share the same water distribution system and they have to cooperate regarding routine canal maintenance and payment for energy where pumping is involved to ensure equal distribution muchara et al 2014 however due to the sharing of irrigation systems many groups reported free riding issues and that rule violations are rampant as reported by other studies dirwai et al 2019 muchara et al 2014 due to this challenge a group in qamata which has been using a progressive financial penalty system as a graduated sanction to disincentive free riding and rule violation indicated that this mechanism did not achieve the desirable results the majority did not pay the penalty because the monetary value was not high enough to disincentivise free riding to improve design principle 8 they implemented a new penalty system where free riders would forfeit certain group benefits depending on the seriousness of the offence for example some had been deprived of using the group s tractor during planting and of buying inputs with the group to reduce transactional costs this form of penalty system was legitimate as the group s members negotiated and implemented this procedure collectively moreover as farmers are rational agents the majority valued this sanction to maximise the utility of being a group member because the cost of being caught outweighed the benefits that could be lost furthermore the chairperson indicated that this has been working and the incidences of free riding have been relatively reduced participation in a group comes with an opportunity cost for attending group meetings the time spent on meetings could be potentially used for other activities however meeting attendance still remains important for purposes of communication results showed that a group in the zanyokwe irrigation scheme was challenged by a high rate of absenteeism which hindered effective and efficient communication meeting spaces give an opportunity for groups to craft and implement new rules and regulations on water access however absenteeism resulted in poor implementation as most farmers were not aware of new changes as a result absenteeism made it difficult for committee leaders to hold farmers accountable for violating new rules as they could claim that they were not aware of them merely taking a register had not improved the situation for the past few years therefore to improve meeting participation among farmers they implemented an incentive mechanism where consistency in meeting attendance would be rewarded with an extra two hours to access irrigation water for the next full production season in general the group has a scheduled monthly meeting however special meetings are called when there are pressing issues the attendance register is used as a tool to identify the deserving farmers to be rewarded based on consistency in attendance and punctuality this innovation has been successful and useful in improving meeting attendance moreover during focus groups farmers indicated that two more hours to access water for irrigation makes a significant difference to their crops given high temperatures and persistent drought this is in line with muchara and mbatha 2016 who highlighted a need for robust institutional strategies that can be used to incentivise and motivate farmers to participate in canal maintenance this strategy used in zanyokwe was both useful novel and legitimate and improved meeting participation according to the farmers to ensure the sustainability of this innovation an irrigation week slot was adjusted to ensure that water resources were not depleted as the amathole water regulates the amount of irrigation water released from the dam to avoid over exploitation of water resources previously farmers had a privilege to irrigate during weekends but this privilege was now only for those who consistently attended meetings this meant that no extra water allocation had to be allocated by the department of water affairs since farmers re allocated the already available resources only attending meetings without any significant contributions however may undermine fair say on decision making in most irrigation schemes located in rural areas a patriarchal system dominates and it is regarded as a taboo when a female argues with a male sharaunga and mudhara 2016 a group in zanyokwe mitigated this challenge by replacing an open voting system with a secret voting system to address the challenge of inequality in decision making from which female or poor farmers were excluded this seemed to have improved transparency in the management of the scheme this was not expected given that the farmers are located in a space which embraces patriarchy but this is a critical component of transformation that is required in rural areas among many challenges water theft in the balancing dams has been reported to be a hinderance to equal water distribution among farmers sharaunga and mudhara 2016 a group in the qamata irrigation scheme was challenged by night water theft by farmers while some farmers cited this as being survival of the fittest this resulted in conflicts which undermined collective action as a result the group resorted to hiring canal rangers to guard the water in the overnight dam this was an effective institutional innovation until farmers were not financially stable to pay the canal rangers and they stopped hiring guards indeed financial capital is indeed the most critical factor that determines the success of innovations oecd 2018 water insecurity is a result of both physical and economic water scarcity however economic issues such as a lack of financial capital required to improve infrastructure and fuel procurement still exposes farmers to water insecurity the study found that in mooi river and tugela ferry about three groups were financially challenged with regard to procuring diesel and electricity this exposed the group to water insecurity as they could not pump sufficient water to irrigate their plots therefore to improve timely payment for water charges this group established a money collection fund called phosa esivivaneni throw a stone in a pile which means to come together as a group and commit to a common purpose farmers contribute a minimum of r5 a day for financial security for rainy days although one of the members of the committee elaborated paying r200 or r100 monthly is burdensome particularly in january where they have to take children back to school nevertheless this money collection scheme eased the financial burden moreover in tugela ferry as a result of the rehabilitation of the scheme in 2013 the sharing of a pipe system was designed for farmers to irrigate from their infield canals as a result of this change some groups in tugela ferry implemented a rule that states that farmers who participate consistently in canal cleaning are rewarded with a privilege to be the first ones to irrigate in a week as farmers use a rotation system where they share a pipe and in which they generally have access to irrigation water once or twice per week farmers implemented various institutional and water management strategies other groups implemented a diverse internal crops plantation calendar system based on crop water requirements for example while some members plant maize which requires much water others cultivated tomatoes moreover some groups bought a particular expensive seed variety which is highly resistant to drought to reduce irrigation water use other groups covered their crops with black plastic sheets to reduce evaporation in qamata all farmer groups rejected the government proposal to establish water user associations because it is perceived as being a tool the government wants to use to make them pay for irrigation water farmers should play a prominent role in the establishment of context specific solutions and government should regulate and support their interventions and ensure that institutions implemented are in the context of wider landscape in order to avoid capability trap andrews et al 2013 mdee and harrison 2019 some groups innovated technologically to address issues of unequal distribution of water due to their geographical location for instance one group in tugela bought a new mobile diesel pump with their capital to improve water security however other groups were not as creative as they just increased the monetary penalties and reported free riders to traditional authorities to enforce rule penalties for example in block 7b in tugela ferry free riders were only reported to traditional authorities to enforce penalties among members however the group felt a need for a nested collective organisation the group therefore innovated by introducing the traditional authorities in their steering committee as a form of nested collective organisation rather than just reporting free riders when challenges arose when traditional authorities are more involved in running the schemes as part of the community farmer led innovation stands to be supported legitimate and value laden most groups implemented innovations to improve collective choice arrangements monitoring graduated sanctions and conflict resolution as shown in table 4 this was to improve equal water distribution because of water shortages due to geographic plot location and theft and to reduce non compliance because of free riding issues among group members as explained above 4 2 institutional innovations and group characteristics table 5 presents the group characteristics according to their innovation status the table indicates that innovative groups were on average smaller than the non innovative groups this is in line with barham and chitemi 2009 and gezahegn et al 2019 who argue that bigger group size presents challenges in terms of enforcing rules and regulations because of increased monitoring and enforcement costs and given diverse ideologies and power dynamics within members which lowers the speed of institutional innovations north 1993 during the focus group discussions some chairpersons indicated that big group size was posing significant challenges in terms of monitoring and ensuring that each member abides by the rules and regulations in one of the groups in tugela ferry the chairperson proposed sub dividing the farmers into smaller groups to improve management because bigger groups exclude most of the more impoverished farmers in decision making which tends to be concentrated on the management committee females and older farmers who have low or no education level generally dominate smallholder farming and both groups in the study had almost the same level of education and were both dominated by female members males tend to migrate to urban areas for greener pastures while women are left in rural areas taking care of their children cousins 2013 dirwai et al 2019 yokwe 2009 youth participation in farming is still relatively low 19 in innovative groups and 17 non innovative groups this was expected because most studies conducted in south africa in the smallholder sector see sharaunga and mudhara 2016 sinyolo and mudhara 2018 yokwe 2009 found that older farmers mainly dominate smallholder agriculture as the youth do not perceive agriculture as an appealing career as it takes time to reap the harvest and earn cash furthermore there was low attendance of meetings in both groups however non innovative groups on average had the highest percentage of conflicts 71 compared to 43 of innovative groups this may be related to relatively bigger group size for non innovative groups due to diverse ideologies in total only three groups one non innovative and two innovative were led by a female chairperson this was expected because these schemes are located in rural areas dominated by the patriarchal system which recognise males as capable and suitable leaders and discourages leadership by women cousins 2013 sharaunga and mudhara 2016 5 conclusion this paper documented farmer led institutional innovations implemented in the last three years by 28 farmer groups located in four smallholder irrigation schemes in kwazulu natal tugela and mooi river and the eastern cape qamata and zanyokwe these schemes have existed for more than 30 years and the management of the scheme activities had been transferred to farmers moreover these schemes were regarded as hotspots for management failure therefore understanding how they had institutionally innovated was important for policy interventions out of the 28 groups interviewed 21 75 groups institutional innovated in the last three years most of the innovations reported were incremental and mainly problem induced most groups implemented innovations to improve collective choice arrangements monitoring graduated sanctions and conflict resolution this was due to weak monitoring and free riding problems that are the significant bottleneck in the management of common pool resources innovative groups had smaller group size but both groups were dominated by older farmers with low or no education level the results indicated that farmers are active agents who are creative in coming up with solutions to solve the problems of today farmers are capable of coming up with institutional innovations that are farmer led useful novel and legitimate while farmer led institutional innovations are good for better scheme management however external actors such as the government should guide support and regulate farmer led schemes to ensure that the innovations implemented are both socially and environmentally sustainable eliminate negative externalities such as over exploitation of water resources and power disparities the innovative agency of the irrigators should be acknowledged and harnessed to strengthen irrigation institutions and performance the focus should be on strengthening the institutions designed by the farmers themselves as these are locally contextualised and socially embedded and hence legitimate institutional changes that incrementally build on the current institutional arrangements are more likely to succeed than radical changes the study s findings suggest that small groups should be actively promoted while tailored training should be offered based on the groups specific needs to improve institutional innovations in the smallholder irrigation sector in south africa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

the management of water resources in irrigation schemes however little is known about them in south africa this study documents institutional innovations by 28 farmer groups located on four irrigation schemes in kwazulu natal and eastern cape provinces south africa induced institutional innovation theory ostrom s eight design principles and thematic analysis of interview transcripts were used to analyse the data the study results show that 21 groups engaged in institutional innovations indicating high levels of farmer led innovative activity among these irrigators examples of innovations include among others the introduction of a secret voting system to improve participation of marginalised people in decision making processes designing daily rotation rosters to reduce conflicts as well as using an attendance register for participation in group activities and rewarding members according to their participation levels the majority of these innovations were designed to improve the graduated sanction mechanism 22 2 enhancing the penalty system for non compliance improving collective action arrangements 27 8 monitoring attendance of group meetings 18 5 democratising decision making and ensuring equitable water distribution these innovations focused mainly on addressing challenges rather than exploiting opportunities and were mostly incremental 94 involving an adjustment or reinterpretation of rules and regulations radical institutional innovations constituted only 6 the innovative groups were smaller in size and experienced less conflict than the non innovative groups both groups had low levels of education and were mostly dominated by female farmers the study recommends that the government should build on the agency of the irrigators to improve the effectiveness and legitimacy of institutional arrangements in irrigation schemes the study s findings suggest that small groups should be actively promoted while tailored training should be offered based on the groups specific needs to improve institutional innovations in the smallholder irrigation sector in south africa keywords smallholder irrigation induced institutional innovation farmer led institutions ostrom s eight design principles 1 introduction the performance of smallholder irrigation schemes in south africa and in other developing countries has been below expectations a growing body of literature reports that weak institutions among other reasons is a major bottleneck in the performance of these smallholder irrigation schemes across the developing countries including south africa dirwai et al 2019 mnkeni et al 2010 muchara et al 2014 vandersypen et al 2006 according to van averbeke et al 2011 of the 302 smallholder irrigation schemes in south africa in 2010 164 54 were underperforming because of poor managerial capabilities among farmers and weak or poor institutions institutions refer to humanly designed rules norms and regulations to facilitate the coordination among people and reduce uncertainty transactional costs and free riding north 1993 ostrom 2008 they are crucial in the establishment of individual rights over resources and providing mandates and steadiness in a complex and ambiguous world of economic relations menard and shirley 2005 among others studies have identified two main reasons behind poor institutions in smallholder irrigation schemes firstly that the agency of the irrigators themselves were ignored during their design and secondly that institutions have failed to evolve to cope with the dynamic nature of challenges and opportunities in the sector muchara et al 2014 mnkeni et al 2010 van averbeke et al 2011 yokwe 2009 according to these studies the irrigators were treated as passive recipients not active partners during the rehabilitation of irrigation schemes through programs such as irrigation management transfer participatory irrigation management and support to farmer managed irrigation systems the focus was on top down command and control type interventions characterised by limited farmer participation muchara et al 2014 shiferaw et al 2009 treating farmers as passive rather than active agents resulted in institutional arrangements that were not context specific as well as weak farmer commitment in the ownership and management of the schemes leading to system breakdown as raffaelli and glynn 2015 observed institutions designed by outsiders often fail due to lack of legitimacy despite being noble in intention or design institutions perform better when designed and implemented in a socially and politically acceptable manner with the involvement of all in the process to enhance legitimacy raffaelli and glynn 2015 institutions should be stable over a reasonable period to be effective in performing their crucial role of establishing reasonable expectations in dealings among people ruttan 2005 however institutional innovations are required to keep up with the changing nature of development gatzweiler and von braun 2016 ruttan 2005 spielman et al 2011 institutional innovation refers to the design and implementation of new or significantly improved rules norms processes and procedures that differ significantly from an organisation s previous ones they should be led by the actors to create an enabling societal environment that motivates people to use their capabilities fully gatzweiler and von braun 2016 raffaelli and glynn 2015 farmer led institutional innovation refers to a process in which farmers themselves initiate establish and improve institutions based on their context specific challenges or opportunities de bont and veldwisch 2020 farmers are rational agents who understand their local context and are capable of negotiating designing adapting and implementing innovations that relate to their local realities which can positively contribute to better adaptations to rapidly changing environments ostrom 2008 reij and waters bayer 2001 tambo 2018 tran et al 2019 current literature focusing on inclusive innovation cozzens and sutz 2014 fressoli et al 2014 gupta 2012 has highlighted the importance of not only ensuring that marginalised or poor people benefit from outcomes of innovation but also ensuring their participation in the innovation processes that is it is not just about innovations for the poor but innovations with the poor gupta 2012 it is vital to highlight that even though farmer led institutional innovations are touted as the key to improving water resources management because of farmers capabilities to implement context specific solutions de bont and veldwisch 2020 mdee and harrison 2019 farmer led irrigation must occur within a regulated context to avoid externalities and improve their long term sustainability lefore et al 2019 woodhouse et al 2017 noted that in sub saharan africa irrigated hectares in most farmer led irrigation schemes were greater than the official government assessments resulting in over exploitation of water resources therefore the government s role is to regulate and support farmers to govern water resources within the wider landscape supportive legislation and regulations the government should control and mitigate negative externalities such as over exploitation of water resources contamination of soil and water with agrochemicals to avoid environmental degradation lefore et al 2019 and allow farmers to play a prominent role in the management of irrigation schemes documenting farmer led institutional innovations is an important step toward recognising farmers as major producers and users of innovations however in the agricultural sector information about institutional innovations that are led by farmers is scarce the focus of a growing strand of literature documenting farmer led innovations has been more on technological oriented innovations new crops varieties soil conservation practices new planting methods and irrigation and drainage technologies tran et al 2019 jouni et al 2018 tambo 2018 levidow et al 2014 while there have been some studies on institutional innovations mose et al 2015 muchara and mbatha 2016 tambo 2018 vandersypen et al 2006 most of these studies have overlooked the importance of legitimacy in institutional innovations focusing more on usefulness and novelty raffaelli and glynn 2015 for example mose et al 2015 reported institutional innovations around improving access to information and market through the establishment of private extension officers and the implementation of a computerised program to manage production operations tambo 2018 in a study seeking to highlight farmer generated innovations reported mainly technically oriented innovations and very few institutional innovations vandersypen et al 2006 reported the implementation of a rotation roster for irrigation access and canal cleaning as an example of institutional innovations in niger irrigation schemes their study findings revealed farmers inabilities to monitor and enforce rules thus their institutions remained immature in south africa muchara and mbatha 2016 showed how farmers through small informal groups were able to improve input procurement market access and information flow in the mooi river irrigation scheme their study indicated a need for strong institutions to enforce rules regulations and incentives for motivating more farmers to participate in reducing transactional costs and that farmers should lead in crafting their institutions managing drainage network is vital for reducing excessive salinity in irrigation schemes minhas et al 2020 jouni et al 2018 however according to minhas et al 2006 p 476 managing drainage networks requires techno economic water conveyance which is too costly for farmers to maintain hence government support is still required to maintain hydrological infrastructure farmers in india adopted a less costly strategy bio drainage to control channel seepage by implementing canal side plantation and block plantation to protect the canal from sand drifts singh and lal 2018 moreover in australia farmers controlled a shallow groundwater table by planting deep rooted permanent pastures trees and crops singh and lal 2018 even though bio drainage reduces land size it is a viable innovation for controlling excessive salinity moreover studies on water governance in smallholder irrigation schemes such as those by dirwai et al 2019 and muchara et al 2014 have mainly focused on broad issues such as how governance affects infrastructure paying limited attention on how farmers have solved their institutional challenges therefore this paper seeks to contribute to the literature by conceptualising and operationalising institutional innovation in the context of smallholder irrigation schemes to the best our knowledge few studies if any have contextualised institutional innovations with an emphasis on legitimacy raffaelli and glynn 2015 institutional innovations were investigated at the farmer group level because nearly all institutional innovations in the smallholder sector are group based tambo 2018 farmer groups are important in south africa because the government and other development agencies prefer working with groups in their interventions in the sector sinyolo and mudhara 2018 understanding why and how a group of farmers collectively choose to make changes in their everyday operational and constitutional rules is imperative for policymakers to know where interventions can be best made ostrom and benjamin 1993 while there is a plethora of literature investigating collective action among farmer groups barham and chitemi 2009 gezahegn et al 2019 muchara et al 2014 sinyolo and mudhara 2018 these studies rarely ask questions on the internal dynamics of the groups with the exception of that of barham and chitemi 2009 this study focused on documenting institutional innovations in four irrigation schemes in the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces of south africa the four schemes were chosen because they have existed for a longer period at least 29 years long enough for us to understand the dynamics of institutional innovations since the management of schemes was transferred to farmers moreover these schemes have been identified as major hotspots for irrigation management failure dirwai et al 2019 muchara et al 2014 van averbeke et al 2011 yokwe 2009 the paper is organised as follows section 2 provides a brief conceptualisation of institutional innovation and the theoretical framework focusing on how institutions change as well as explaining ostrom s eight design principles section 3 presents the research methodology while section 4 presents the results and discussions on the nature of institutional innovations identified and the group characteristics lastly conclusions and policy recommendations are presented 2 theoretical framework 2 1 definition of institutional innovation there are various interpretations of the term institution edquist 2005 north 1990 the widely cited definition refers to institutions as a set of common habits norms routines practices or laws that govern the behaviour of participants or members of a community edquist 2005 north 1990 they are designed to cope with uncertainty reduce transactional costs and free riding issues following north 1990 and many studies in innovation literature e g edquist 2005 we differentiate between the rules of the game i e institutions and the players of the game i e actors or organisations institutions are shared concepts that exist in the minds of the actors as mostly implicit norms rather than explicit rules ostrom 1990 these shared concepts can be categorised as rules in use and rules in form north 1993 ostrom 2008 quinn et al 2007 wilson et al 2013 the rules in use are informal rules that an individual farmer learns on the ground while rules in form are formal rules that are documented in an explicit form ostrom 1990 according to ostrom and benjamin 1993 researchers should focus more on rules in use rather than focusing on rules in form because rules in use help in identifying shared norms relations and the building of trust among a group of farmers or a society these will eventually lead to strengthening collective action spielman et al 2011 raffaelli and glynn 2015 p 2 define institutional innovation as novel useful and legitimate change that disrupts to varying degrees the cognitive normative or regulative mainstays of an organisational field while most innovation definitions emphasise newness and usefulness muchara and mbatha 2016 oecd 2018 spielman et al 2011 raffaelli and glynn 2015 argue for the inclusion of legitimacy as a key dimension when dealing with institutional innovation that is an institutional change should be novel unique useful solve a problem or add value and be legitimate be accepted by the users for it to be considered an innovation raffaelli and glynn 2015 this study expands the concept of legitimate to further include the concept of environmental and ecological sustainability this means that since the sources of irrigation water which are the rivers are shared by multiple actors institutional innovation implemented by farmers should not have an adverse negative impact on the end users and the environment innovations can be incremental less disruptive changes comprising of the modification of existing institutions or radical more disruptive change involving the creation of new institutions leading to significantly different ways of doing things raffaelli and glynn 2015 rogers 2010 following hargrave and van de ven 2006 and raffaelli and glynn 2015 institutional innovation in this study includes both the creation of new institutions and change in existing institutions legitimate institutional innovations are often path dependent involving incremental changes from previous institutions which actors can easily comprehend and accept as desirable raffaelli and glynn 2015 usefulness and novelty should be judged or defined within the context of the adopting group because innovation does not stop being an innovation just because it already exists elsewhere oecd 2018 however raffaelli and glynn 2015 argue that the novelty of institutional innovation should be less localised and be perceived in terms of the broader community in which innovations arises this means novelty must be perceived by relevant audiences or users such as farmers or the community as legitimate credible and appropriate legitimacy is crucial when dealing with institutional innovations because for institutions to be stable over time this requires the creation of credible and appropriate transformation processes which are socially constructed and culturally embedded to ensure inclusiveness of all actors and sustainability libecap 1993 ostrom and benjamin 1993 raffaelli and glynn 2015 however usefulness is more important than novelty when dealing with innovations in developing countries in general and in the smallholder sector in particular because the important aspect of innovation is that it should be value laden or solve challenges that induce groups to innovate 2 2 how do institutional innovations emerge two main bodies of theories have emerged in studying induced institutional innovation particularly in agriculture i e neoclassical and new institutional economics nie the neoclassical model mainly considers three variables price consumer preferences and technology that affect relative factor endowments and lead to induced change menard and shirley 2005 neoclassical is criticised for being too narrow as it ignores the importance of variables such as power culture and ideology in institutional change grabowski 1988 ruttan and hayami 1984 the nie approach gives a more comprehensive overview of institutional change as it extends neoclassical theory and considers these additional variables menard and shirley 2005 ruttan and hayami 1984 north 1990 argues that continuous interaction between actors in an organisation given scarce resources increases competition competition leads groups to observe learn and innovate to survive and remain stable however existing internal institutions determine innovations that can be accepted by members based on the maximum payoff because of factors such as culture ideology and power which determine the speed and supply cost of initiating of institutional innovation particular ideologies and traditional cultures can make certain institutional innovations more easily established and accepted by the actors if they share the same systems of values and norms this means that institutional innovation may not occur at a socially optimum level because power dynamics play a crucial role in determining the demand and supply of institutional innovation in society actors who have power may design and implement institutions that redistribute returns in their favour the role of collective action in changing the supply of institutional innovation encompasses struggles to eliminate power disparities and this depends on the cost of achieving a social consensus mahoney and thelen 2009 north 1990 1993 ruttan and hayami 1984 however if collective action fails government can play a regulative role and enforce rules in order to eliminate power disparities in the management of common pool resources libecap 1993 and raffaelli and glynn 2015 further note that institutional innovations are generally an incremental modification of existing institutions path dependent process because organisations learn and develop their ideologies in the context of already existing formal and informal rules incremental innovations arise purposefully to solve problems or add value while radical innovations creation of new institutions usually result due to significant shocks that can disrupt the status quo cleaver 2012 mahoney and thelen 2009 note that incremental innovations come when a group adjusts its situational processes and regularisation over time situational adjustment allows actors to create or disentangle confusing situations by reinterpreting or redefining rules and relationships farmers may gradually or incrementally change their institutions to ensure that current institutions relate to current challenges with gradual institutional change a farmer group may apply displacement or layering to re design institutions mahoney and thelen 2009 displacement happens when the existing rules and procedures in an organisation are entirely substituted by new ones through progressive change while layering occurs when existing rules are significantly improved from the previous ones changes take place as actors re assign or reinterpret rules values and norms to have a new purpose and meaning in the context of smallholder irrigation schemes ostrom s eight design principles ostrom 2008 ostrom and benjamin 1993 wilson et al 2013 offer a guideline for designing efficient institutional conditions for their effective management a design principle refers to that condition which accounts for successfully designing irrigation institutions that are self governing and self managing over a period of time sarker and itoh 2001 the eight design principles include 1 clearly defined boundaries in which unentitled external parties are effectively excluded from using the resource 2 there must be congruence between the resource environment and its governing structures rules in place should fit local conditions 3 there must be collective choice arrangements participatory decision making among resource users 4 rules in place should be enforced through effective monitoring 5 there should be graduated sanctions for those who abuse the resources and for free riders 6 conflict resolution mechanisms should be easily available 7 there must be minimal recognition of rights to organise and 8 rules should be organised and enforced through nested enterprises ostrom 2008 ostrom and benjamin 1993 these principles can be adapted and applied to a diverse environment which requires cooperation among members to achieve shared objectives sarker and itoh 2001 wilson et al 2013 given the importance of these design principles in the management of irrigation schemes this study uses these design principles as the key themes across which the irrigators should innovate for example in most schemes routines when to access water and for how long are apparent however the challenge is on the enforcement monitoring and on penalising free riders phakathi and wale 2018 dirwai et al 2019 and muchara et al 2014 indicated that most farmers in the mooi river and tugela ferry schemes did not abide by irrigation routines as they irrigated more days than allocated exposing other farmers to water insecurities moreover muchara et al 2014 reported that there is weak or a lack of collective action in the management of the schemes as few farmers participate in decision making canal cleaning and scheme maintenance it is therefore expected that irrigators would be induced to continually design re assign or reinterpret rules values and norms around water access and the eight design principles for scheme management hargrave and van de ven 2006 however because smallholder farming is highly unequal in terms of assets ownership and is dominated by a patriarchal system sinyolo and mudhara 2018 phakathi and wale 2018 certain farmers based on their power and status may influence decisions which may exclude the much marginalised farmers for example those who are water secure may resist new institutions and may deliberately close any room for innovation or only accommodate innovations that bolster their status quo cleaver and de koning 2015 variables such as group size education levels of group members gender composition of members and leaders etc either inhibit or enhance the speed of designing and implementation of institutional change it becomes difficult to monitor and enforce rules in bigger groups because of increasing transactional costs for rule enforcement due to free riding among members gezahegn et al 2019 in addition studies have indicated that groups dominated by males tend to be more successful because male farmers have better access to resources in rural areas which are dominated by the patriarchal systems barham and chitemi 2009 sinyolo and mudhara 2018 therefore regulated farmer led institutional innovations are vital for eliminating power disparities within schemes 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling procedure and study area description a sample of 28 groups across four irrigation schemes in the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces in south africa were selected using a multi stage purposive sampling approach the first stage involved the purposive selection of the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces the two provinces were selected because they have the second and third largest number of irrigation schemes in south africa and irrigated agriculture is the primary source of livelihood among rural farmers due to high level of temperature and low precipitation rate mnkeni et al 2010 muchara et al 2014 van averbeke et al 2011 yokwe 2009 in stage two four irrigation schemes were purposively selected from a list of irrigation schemes in the eastern cape and kwazulu natal provinces the lists were obtained from the provincial departments of agriculture the selection criteria included the number of years the scheme had been in operation numbers of beneficiaries land size and occurrence of water management challenges such as free riding issues weak penalty systems and weak monitoring mechanisms after field visits to most of the schemes and informal discussions with farmers on scheme management and challenges the qamata and zanyokwe irrigation schemes of the eastern cape and tugela and mooi river irrigation schemes of the kwazulu natal were selected the last sampling stage involved the selection of irrigation groups or blocks in the four chosen irrigation schemes the study targeted groups instead of individual farmers because as tambo 2018 reported institutional innovations in the smallholder sector are mainly implemented at the group level the contact details of a group or block chairperson were obtained from the local extension officers in the provincial departments of agriculture and appointments were made with them with the assistance of the extension officers the total number of groups selected was 28 tugela ferry 7 mooi river 9 and qamata 6 zanyokwe 6 the data was collected between january and march 2018 table 1 shows the key features of the selected irrigation schemes and the number of blocks groups selected these irrigation groups share water from the same secondary canal hence they have to work together on devising institutions for water management and distribution the aim was to select groups blocks located in the upper middle and lower end of the participating irrigation schemes however most groups were selected in tugela ferry and zanyokwe while only one did form part of the sample in qamata in mooi river irrigation schemes nine of the 15 groups were selected representing three locations upper middle and lower end several studies have reported challenges in water access management and distribution among the irrigators in these irrigation schemes dirwai et al 2019 mnkeni et al 2010 sharaunga and mudhara 2016 yokwe 2009 table 1 shows that all four schemes have been in operation for about 60 years on average with mooi river having been in existence for the longest duration 116 years with tugela ferry the shortest 29 years the tugela ferry and mooi river irrigation schemes fall under umzinyathi district in the umsinga local municipality in kwazulu natal these schemes were established to improve rural livelihoods in 2013 rehabilitation took place in tugela ferry while in mooi river the rehabilitation process is ongoing both tugela and mooi river went through irrigation management transfer in 1997 where the management of the scheme was given over to farmers dirwai et al 2019 in the tugela irrigation scheme water is diverted from the tugela river using a 34 km long canal under gravity feed for block 1 2 3 4 and 5 however due to geographical locations other blocks draw water using either electric 4a and 7 or diesel pump 4b because of broken canals resulting in water shortages particularly on the tail end position the zanyokwe irrigation scheme falls under the amathole municipality in the eastern cape the scheme was established in 1983 by the israeli government after democracy in 1994 the limocor co operative a government parastatal took up management of the scheme in 1997 limocor left and the management of the scheme was transferred to farmers due to challenges in managing the scheme the zanyokwe scheme was vandalised but in 2004 co operatives were formed and the government revitalised the irrigation system the qamata irrigation scheme falls under the intsika yethu municipality in the eastern cape and it was established in the late 1960 s by the former transkei government it receives water from the lubisi dam diverted from the indwe river through a 28 km canal these schemes use a short furrow irrigation system but zanyokwe uses sprinklers 3 2 approach to identify farmer led institutional innovations institutional changes were considered innovations when they met five criteria a they should have been new or significantly improved rules norms processes and procedures b they should add value c they should have been legitimate d they should have been implemented within three years e they should have been initiated and led by the farmers with no or very limited external help newness was measured at the community level which meant that an institutional change had to differ significantly from the group s previous ones and be new to their community for it to be considered an innovation while innovation literature generally uses the lower standard of new to the innovator raffaelli and glynn 2015 argue that institutional innovations should be new at least to the innovator s community however farmer led innovation may be perceived as problematic for environmental sustainability in terms of exploiting water resources and water shortages downstream de bont and veldwisch 2020 in this study value and legitimacy were defined and measured in a broader way to encompass sustainability to the community and other users of the irrigation water source value addition was according to the perceptions of the groups while legitimacy was according to both group members and external actors such as officials from the provincial departments of agriculture rural development water affairs as well as other local development agencies who evaluated the sustainability the period of three years was considered long enough to capture innovation activities and reduce recall problem armbruster et al 2008 highlight that for institutional innovation activities the period to categorise innovators should be longer because shorter periods may categorise the imitators as innovators and the inventors as non innovators the study implemented various steps to identify and document institutional innovation among the selected irrigating groups the approach used adapted the steps that were used by tambo 2018 with some variations for example the study did not use contests as this was considered ill suited for the identification of institutional innovations firstly focus group discussions were conducted involving between 10 and 15 participants including irrigators extension officers and ngo representatives at least one focus group discussion was done with each selected group focusing on broad water management access challenges the farmers were facing some of the initiative s irrigators had implemented to deal with the challenges as well as examples of institutional innovations the groups had implemented extension officers and other development officials participated in some of these focus group discussions and assisted in giving further information on some of the innovations implemented by the irrigators over the years particularly on sustainability to ensure that water resources were not exploited the discussions were around the eight design principles on water management covering norms processes and regulations about equitable distribution of water conflict resolutions sanctions mechanisms participation and transparent decision making on the scheme secondly interviews were done at the group level with either a group chairperson treasurer or secretary insights from field observations and focus group discussions were used to design the questionnaire that was used in the second round to collect information about specific examples of institutional innovations these group leaders were asked to provide specific information on some of the innovations that were identified during focus group discussions as well as identify others that might have been omitted the questionnaire also asked questions about group characteristics such as group size education levels gender composition etc thirdly key informant interviews were done with mainly extension officers who confirmed the extent to which the examples of institutional innovations were new to the community or were initiated and led by the farmer and they further evaluated the social and environmental sustainability of the reported innovations following tambo s 2018 study the verification process resulted in some institutional changes being rejected because they were not new to the community or were not sufficiently led by the farmers 3 3 data analysis the data were analysed using thematic analysis based on the eight design principles to give a narrative analysis for the nature of institutional innovations implemented by farmer groups thematic analysis is a qualitative analysis that is suitable when the researcher s objectives are to understand the current practices of groups or individuals and to present and interpret themes that relate to the data braun et al 2014 since this study aimed to identify institutional innovations implemented in the last three years this first required the historical narrative that elaborated how and why institutions change and innovate through these narratives the study identified groups that implemented incremental or radical innovations the data on group dynamics in terms of the number of innovations implemented group age size and education level were presented using descriptive statistics 4 results and discussions 4 1 characteristics and examples of institutional innovations focus group discussions with the irrigators and interviews with group leaders generated a total of 86 institutional changes that they considered potentially innovative the verification step which included key informants mainly extension officers who confirmed the extent of the institutional changes identified by the irrigators led to 32 institutional changes being rejected these changes were considered to be not new to the community 26 or not sufficiently led by the farmers 8 table 2 shows that a total of 54 institutional changes met all the criteria out of the 28 groups 21 groups 75 reported at least one institutional innovation that met the criteria and thus were considered innovators only 7 groups 25 had not implemented any institutional innovation this suggests that most of the irrigation groups in irrigation schemes are engaged in innovative activities to improve their institutions almost all innovations reported were incremental 94 involving adjustment or reinterpretation of rules and regulations as per previous literature libecap 1993 north 1993 raffaelli and glynn 2015 as expected radical institutional innovations which involved implementation of new institutions leading to significantly different ways of doing things were very rare across all the schemes with only three examples identified table 2 shows that 98 of the institutional innovations were in response to challenges or problems and rarely did the irrigators innovate to exploit opportunities table 3 summarises some of the examples of institutional innovations implemented by farmer groups farmers in the irrigation schemes are interdependent as they share the same water distribution system and they have to cooperate regarding routine canal maintenance and payment for energy where pumping is involved to ensure equal distribution muchara et al 2014 however due to the sharing of irrigation systems many groups reported free riding issues and that rule violations are rampant as reported by other studies dirwai et al 2019 muchara et al 2014 due to this challenge a group in qamata which has been using a progressive financial penalty system as a graduated sanction to disincentive free riding and rule violation indicated that this mechanism did not achieve the desirable results the majority did not pay the penalty because the monetary value was not high enough to disincentivise free riding to improve design principle 8 they implemented a new penalty system where free riders would forfeit certain group benefits depending on the seriousness of the offence for example some had been deprived of using the group s tractor during planting and of buying inputs with the group to reduce transactional costs this form of penalty system was legitimate as the group s members negotiated and implemented this procedure collectively moreover as farmers are rational agents the majority valued this sanction to maximise the utility of being a group member because the cost of being caught outweighed the benefits that could be lost furthermore the chairperson indicated that this has been working and the incidences of free riding have been relatively reduced participation in a group comes with an opportunity cost for attending group meetings the time spent on meetings could be potentially used for other activities however meeting attendance still remains important for purposes of communication results showed that a group in the zanyokwe irrigation scheme was challenged by a high rate of absenteeism which hindered effective and efficient communication meeting spaces give an opportunity for groups to craft and implement new rules and regulations on water access however absenteeism resulted in poor implementation as most farmers were not aware of new changes as a result absenteeism made it difficult for committee leaders to hold farmers accountable for violating new rules as they could claim that they were not aware of them merely taking a register had not improved the situation for the past few years therefore to improve meeting participation among farmers they implemented an incentive mechanism where consistency in meeting attendance would be rewarded with an extra two hours to access irrigation water for the next full production season in general the group has a scheduled monthly meeting however special meetings are called when there are pressing issues the attendance register is used as a tool to identify the deserving farmers to be rewarded based on consistency in attendance and punctuality this innovation has been successful and useful in improving meeting attendance moreover during focus groups farmers indicated that two more hours to access water for irrigation makes a significant difference to their crops given high temperatures and persistent drought this is in line with muchara and mbatha 2016 who highlighted a need for robust institutional strategies that can be used to incentivise and motivate farmers to participate in canal maintenance this strategy used in zanyokwe was both useful novel and legitimate and improved meeting participation according to the farmers to ensure the sustainability of this innovation an irrigation week slot was adjusted to ensure that water resources were not depleted as the amathole water regulates the amount of irrigation water released from the dam to avoid over exploitation of water resources previously farmers had a privilege to irrigate during weekends but this privilege was now only for those who consistently attended meetings this meant that no extra water allocation had to be allocated by the department of water affairs since farmers re allocated the already available resources only attending meetings without any significant contributions however may undermine fair say on decision making in most irrigation schemes located in rural areas a patriarchal system dominates and it is regarded as a taboo when a female argues with a male sharaunga and mudhara 2016 a group in zanyokwe mitigated this challenge by replacing an open voting system with a secret voting system to address the challenge of inequality in decision making from which female or poor farmers were excluded this seemed to have improved transparency in the management of the scheme this was not expected given that the farmers are located in a space which embraces patriarchy but this is a critical component of transformation that is required in rural areas among many challenges water theft in the balancing dams has been reported to be a hinderance to equal water distribution among farmers sharaunga and mudhara 2016 a group in the qamata irrigation scheme was challenged by night water theft by farmers while some farmers cited this as being survival of the fittest this resulted in conflicts which undermined collective action as a result the group resorted to hiring canal rangers to guard the water in the overnight dam this was an effective institutional innovation until farmers were not financially stable to pay the canal rangers and they stopped hiring guards indeed financial capital is indeed the most critical factor that determines the success of innovations oecd 2018 water insecurity is a result of both physical and economic water scarcity however economic issues such as a lack of financial capital required to improve infrastructure and fuel procurement still exposes farmers to water insecurity the study found that in mooi river and tugela ferry about three groups were financially challenged with regard to procuring diesel and electricity this exposed the group to water insecurity as they could not pump sufficient water to irrigate their plots therefore to improve timely payment for water charges this group established a money collection fund called phosa esivivaneni throw a stone in a pile which means to come together as a group and commit to a common purpose farmers contribute a minimum of r5 a day for financial security for rainy days although one of the members of the committee elaborated paying r200 or r100 monthly is burdensome particularly in january where they have to take children back to school nevertheless this money collection scheme eased the financial burden moreover in tugela ferry as a result of the rehabilitation of the scheme in 2013 the sharing of a pipe system was designed for farmers to irrigate from their infield canals as a result of this change some groups in tugela ferry implemented a rule that states that farmers who participate consistently in canal cleaning are rewarded with a privilege to be the first ones to irrigate in a week as farmers use a rotation system where they share a pipe and in which they generally have access to irrigation water once or twice per week farmers implemented various institutional and water management strategies other groups implemented a diverse internal crops plantation calendar system based on crop water requirements for example while some members plant maize which requires much water others cultivated tomatoes moreover some groups bought a particular expensive seed variety which is highly resistant to drought to reduce irrigation water use other groups covered their crops with black plastic sheets to reduce evaporation in qamata all farmer groups rejected the government proposal to establish water user associations because it is perceived as being a tool the government wants to use to make them pay for irrigation water farmers should play a prominent role in the establishment of context specific solutions and government should regulate and support their interventions and ensure that institutions implemented are in the context of wider landscape in order to avoid capability trap andrews et al 2013 mdee and harrison 2019 some groups innovated technologically to address issues of unequal distribution of water due to their geographical location for instance one group in tugela bought a new mobile diesel pump with their capital to improve water security however other groups were not as creative as they just increased the monetary penalties and reported free riders to traditional authorities to enforce rule penalties for example in block 7b in tugela ferry free riders were only reported to traditional authorities to enforce penalties among members however the group felt a need for a nested collective organisation the group therefore innovated by introducing the traditional authorities in their steering committee as a form of nested collective organisation rather than just reporting free riders when challenges arose when traditional authorities are more involved in running the schemes as part of the community farmer led innovation stands to be supported legitimate and value laden most groups implemented innovations to improve collective choice arrangements monitoring graduated sanctions and conflict resolution as shown in table 4 this was to improve equal water distribution because of water shortages due to geographic plot location and theft and to reduce non compliance because of free riding issues among group members as explained above 4 2 institutional innovations and group characteristics table 5 presents the group characteristics according to their innovation status the table indicates that innovative groups were on average smaller than the non innovative groups this is in line with barham and chitemi 2009 and gezahegn et al 2019 who argue that bigger group size presents challenges in terms of enforcing rules and regulations because of increased monitoring and enforcement costs and given diverse ideologies and power dynamics within members which lowers the speed of institutional innovations north 1993 during the focus group discussions some chairpersons indicated that big group size was posing significant challenges in terms of monitoring and ensuring that each member abides by the rules and regulations in one of the groups in tugela ferry the chairperson proposed sub dividing the farmers into smaller groups to improve management because bigger groups exclude most of the more impoverished farmers in decision making which tends to be concentrated on the management committee females and older farmers who have low or no education level generally dominate smallholder farming and both groups in the study had almost the same level of education and were both dominated by female members males tend to migrate to urban areas for greener pastures while women are left in rural areas taking care of their children cousins 2013 dirwai et al 2019 yokwe 2009 youth participation in farming is still relatively low 19 in innovative groups and 17 non innovative groups this was expected because most studies conducted in south africa in the smallholder sector see sharaunga and mudhara 2016 sinyolo and mudhara 2018 yokwe 2009 found that older farmers mainly dominate smallholder agriculture as the youth do not perceive agriculture as an appealing career as it takes time to reap the harvest and earn cash furthermore there was low attendance of meetings in both groups however non innovative groups on average had the highest percentage of conflicts 71 compared to 43 of innovative groups this may be related to relatively bigger group size for non innovative groups due to diverse ideologies in total only three groups one non innovative and two innovative were led by a female chairperson this was expected because these schemes are located in rural areas dominated by the patriarchal system which recognise males as capable and suitable leaders and discourages leadership by women cousins 2013 sharaunga and mudhara 2016 5 conclusion this paper documented farmer led institutional innovations implemented in the last three years by 28 farmer groups located in four smallholder irrigation schemes in kwazulu natal tugela and mooi river and the eastern cape qamata and zanyokwe these schemes have existed for more than 30 years and the management of the scheme activities had been transferred to farmers moreover these schemes were regarded as hotspots for management failure therefore understanding how they had institutionally innovated was important for policy interventions out of the 28 groups interviewed 21 75 groups institutional innovated in the last three years most of the innovations reported were incremental and mainly problem induced most groups implemented innovations to improve collective choice arrangements monitoring graduated sanctions and conflict resolution this was due to weak monitoring and free riding problems that are the significant bottleneck in the management of common pool resources innovative groups had smaller group size but both groups were dominated by older farmers with low or no education level the results indicated that farmers are active agents who are creative in coming up with solutions to solve the problems of today farmers are capable of coming up with institutional innovations that are farmer led useful novel and legitimate while farmer led institutional innovations are good for better scheme management however external actors such as the government should guide support and regulate farmer led schemes to ensure that the innovations implemented are both socially and environmentally sustainable eliminate negative externalities such as over exploitation of water resources and power disparities the innovative agency of the irrigators should be acknowledged and harnessed to strengthen irrigation institutions and performance the focus should be on strengthening the institutions designed by the farmers themselves as these are locally contextualised and socially embedded and hence legitimate institutional changes that incrementally build on the current institutional arrangements are more likely to succeed than radical changes the study s findings suggest that small groups should be actively promoted while tailored training should be offered based on the groups specific needs to improve institutional innovations in the smallholder irrigation sector in south africa declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

10174,soil mulching and nitrogen application have long been applied in rainfed agriculture but their interactive effects on crop productivity and especially environments remain poorly understood field

n2 200 kg n ha 1 and n3 300 kg n ha 1 and their interactions the results showed that there were no significant differences in grain yield water productivity and nue between rf and sm irrespective of nitrogen rates but rf and sm significantly increased grain yield by 12 4 and 7 9 water productivity by 13 7 and 10 2 and partial factor productivity by 12 1 and 7 2 compared with nm 7620 8 kg ha 1 18 86 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 45 3 kg kg 1 respectively sm obtained comparable net income to rf under n2 1567 0 and 1632 4 usd ha 1 and n3 1593 9 and 1709 9 usd ha 1 grain yield and net income increased by 12 0

introduction rainfed agriculture accounts for more than 70 of the total arable land in north and northwest china mainly located in the arid and semi arid regions li et al 2014 drought and nutrient deficiency are the major factors limiting maize zea mays l production in these regions hu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 scarce and variable annual precipitation 200 600 mm is the only water input for rainfed agriculture about 60 of which occurs between july and september chen et al 2020 fan et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 in the context of water shortage straw mulching sm and ridge furrow cultivation with plastic film mulching on the ridge rf have been widely adopted to improve water productivity and maize yield by reducing soil evaporation conserving soil water and regulating soil temperature organic matter and structure li et al 2013 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a hu et al 2019 maneepitak et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 2021 nitrogen n amendment is an effective way for promoting maize growth and ultimately enhancing grain yield wang et al 2020 however the n input for rainfed maize in northwest china averagely amounts to 300 kg n ha 1 which is much higher than the nitrogen requirement for summer maize chang et al 2014 although the high n input may guarantee high maize yield it significantly decreases the nitrogen use efficiency nue and contributes to high soil n residual the nue for the wheat maize cropping system in china was only 16 18 due to the excessive use of mineral n from 1987 to 2015 liang et al 2018 scientists have recently paid more attention to environmental issues worldwide ammonia nh3 is a major environmental pollutant and a critical precursor for pm2 5 dan et al 2004 sun et al 2018 its atmospheric deposition to the land surface also contributes to soil acidification eutrophication and loss of biodiversity asman et al 1998 hellsten et al 2008 agricultural fertilizers are the world s biggest sources of nh3 contributing 41 9 to the total emission xu et al 2015 pan et al 2016 global warming due to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg emissions is also a severe environmental issue nitrous oxide n2o carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 are the major ghg and have rapidly increased especially since the mid 20th century agriculture is the second greatest ghg emission source after fossil fuels anthropogenic co2 emission dominated by agriculture totaled 5575 mt and increased to 5800 mt by 2014 fao 2015 global warming potentials gwp of n2o and ch4 are 298 and 28 times greater than that of co2 and agriculture soil has been estimated to contribute 84 and 52 to the global anthropogenic n2o and ch4 emissions respectively ipcc 2014 the changing soil water and temperature conditions as a result of soil mulching can influence nh3 and ghg emissions however it is not clear yet that how straw and plastic film mulching affect nh3 volatilization despite several studies on nh3 volatilization in northwest china or other regions with similar climates cai et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 2015 li et al 2017 li et al 2019a inconsistent results of straw and plastic mulching on ghg emissions have been observed even in the same field during various seasons chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 co2 and ch4 emissions under straw mulching are mostly increase due to the readily available c from straw decomposition but chen et al 2017 found that straw mulching increased the soil s ability to absorb ch4 it has been reported that rf increased no2 and co2 emissions because the increased soil temperature and moisture stimulated nitrifier and or denitrifier activities wrage et al 2001 and promoted soil mineralization li et al 2004 however no2 and co2 emissions have also been decreased largely due to the decreased soil mineral n or the barrier effect of plastic film on the ridge gan et al 2013 liu et al 2014b improving our knowledge of soil mulching effects on maize growth and environmental effects is still highly required for rainfed agriculture nitrogen application can lead to nh3 air pollution and ghg emissions from mineral n fertilizers previous studies showed that applied n was lost by nh3 volatilization under decreased soil ph conditions due to hydrolysis of granule urea into nh4 oh and co3 2 after n application hayashi et al 2008 tian et al 2017 n2o can be generated from the nitrification and denitrification processes which are mainly controlled by the soil available substrate no3 nh4 migliorati et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2016 urea is converted into nh4 oh and hco3 in the presence of water and urease enzymes and hco3 then evolves into co2 and water therefore higher nh3 n2o and co2 are usually emitted from the soil with the increasing nitrogen input snyder et al 2009 however both increase and decrease of soil oxidation capacity for ch4 emission have been observed with the increased nh4 contents from fertilizers van den pol van dasselaar et al 1999 bodelier and laanbroek 2004 an optimal n rate is thus critical not only for sustaining maize yield but also for ensuring good environment soil mulching and nitrogen application have long been used for improving crop productivity in rainfed agriculture but there remain large uncertainties regarding their comprehensive impacts on environments such as nh3 volatilization and greenhouse gas emissions what s more important the interacting effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on maize yield and greenhouse gas emissions have not been explored yet therefore the objective of this study was to explore the responses of maize yield water productivity wp n utilization efficiency nue economic benefit nh3 ventilation and ghg emissions to various soil mulching practices n application rates and their interactions the hypotheses were that 1 plastic film mulching produces the highest maize yield wp nue and economic benefit but also the greatest ghg emissions 2 straw mulching obtains comparable maize yield wp nue and economic benefit to plastic film mulching but it produces low ghg emissions and 3 the combination of straw mulching and a medium nitrogen rate of 200 n kg ha 1 better balances the agronomic economic and environmental benefits of rainfed maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the

the soil was sampled by the static closed chamber method cha un et al 2017 which consisted of a stainless steel chamber 40 40 40 cm and a frame with a groove 40 40 15 cm the outside of chamber was covered with insulating material to reduce the inside temperature change in addition the chamber had a small hole with a temperature probe and a sampling gas channel with a three way stopcock an electric fan was also equipped for gas mixing inside the chamber after sowing the maize one frame was inserted 15 cm into the soil for nm and sm and two were installed one on the ridge and the other

plot before sowing and after harvest there was a concentration gradient between the fertilizer band and the maize row when fertilizers were applied in bands soil samples were thus collected in three locations one in the maize row one in the fertilizer band and one in between the maize rows at each gas sampling location and mixed to measure soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n fig 2a 2 3 4 plant sampling

soil temperature wfps and mineral n dynamics soil temperatures at 10 cm depth were similar to daily air temperature in various treatments fig 1 fig 3a mean soil temperatures were similar at n1 n2 and n3 over the two growing seasons with values of 27 31 27 27 and 27 23 respectively soil temperatures were greatly influenced by mulching practices compared with nm soil temperatures were reduced on average by 0 51 under sm and increased by 3 25 on the ridge of rf wfps at 20 cm depth increased following rainfall events and declined as a combined result of soil evaporation and plant transpiration fig 3b mean wfps were similar under n1 n2 and n3 with values of 64 4 66 0 and 65 0 respectively compared to nm sm increased wfps by 2 7 wfps on the ridge of rf was 19 3 lower than that of nm while wfps in the furrow was close to that of nm 67 1 and 68 4 respectively generally soil no3 and nh4 contents in the 0 20 cm layer showed high levels following n application and gradually decreased to the baseline level later however as for the ridge of rf soil no3 contents showed varying trends with relatively higher values at the late growth stage of summer maize fig 3c d the lowest soil no3 and nh4 contents were observed under ck on average 10 22 and 6 88 mg kg 1 respectively compared with n1 averaged soil no3 and nh4 contents were increased by 42 5 and 22 5 at n2 80 0 and 38 3 at n3 respectively mean soil no3 contents were 18 35 20 53 55 42 and 21 10 mg kg 1 under nm sm ridge and furrow of rf while the corresponding soil nh4 contents were 8 12 8 70 11 91 and 8 85 mg kg 1 respectively 3 2 grain yield plant n uptake and water productivity grain yield gy and n uptake generally increased with the increasing n application rate fig 4 gy and n uptake were lowest under ck

no significant difference in gy was observed between n2 and n3 under the same mulching practice compared with n1 mean plant n uptake was increased by 25 7 and 38 0 at n2 and n3 in 2018 by 31 6 and 49 8 in 2019 respectively compared with nm mean gy was increased by 9 2 and 15 2 under sm and rf in 2018 by 6 5 and 9 6 in 2019 respectively there was no significant difference in gy between sm and rf under n2 and n3 compared with nm n uptake was increased by 10 7 and 14 2 under sm and rf in 2018 by 8 5 and 10 8 in 2019 respectively nitrogen rate and mulching practice had significant effects on wp table 2 mean wp at n2 was highest in 2018 23 19 kg ha 1 mm 1 14 6 higher than that at n1 and 3 3 higher than that at n3 mean wp at n2 and n3 in 2019 was increased by 13 8 and 17 3 compared with that at n1 on average wp under sm and rf was 10 4 and 16 5 higher than that of nm in 2018 and 10 1 and 10 5 higher in 2019 respectively however there was no significant difference in wp between sm and rf under various nitrogen rates 3 3 residual soil nitrate and nue soil nitrate residue snr at maize maturity in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 5 no3 n contents showed a decreasing trend over depth nitrate n residue was mainly retained in the 0 100 cm soil layer accounting for 72 0 and 64 5 of snr in the 0 200 cm soil profile over the two seasons respectively this indicated that no3 n leaching beyond the 100 cm soil layer was increased in 2019 increasing nitrogen rate significantly increased no3 n accumulation in the 0 200 cm soil profile table 3 the lowest cumulative snr was observed under ck in both 2018 100 1 kg ha 1 and 2019 95 9 kg ha 1 cumulative snr was increased by 52 0 63 3 and 131 8 138 5 at n2 and n3 in 2018 by 50 1 122 9 and 136 0 208 6 in 2019 compared with n1 respectively at the same n rate cumulative snr showed no significant difference among nm sm and rf in 2018 and there was no significant difference among mulching practices under n2 in 2019 compared with nm cumulative snr was decreased by 7 6 12 2 and 14 7 17 0 under sm and rf in 2018 by 4 8 14 3 and 17 4 40 2 in 2019 respectively n rates significantly affected nupe pfp and nhi in both years table 2 compared with n1 n2 and n3 decreased nupe by 37 2 and 54 0 pfp by 44 5 and 61 9 but increased nhi by 6 2 and 10 2 in 2018 respectively in 2019 n2 and n3 decreased nupe by 34 2 and 50 1 pfp by 43 4 and 59 8 but increased nhi by 10 5 and 9 9 compared to n1 respectively the effect of mulching practice on nue was less than that of n rate mulching practice significantly affected nupe and pfp p 0 05 but it had no significant influence on nhi p 0 05 in 2018 sm increased nupe pfp and nhi by 8 0 8 1 and 1 1 compared with nm respectively the corresponding values were 13 2 15 2 and 2 7 under rf respectively sm and rf increased nupe by 9 0 and 9 2 pfp by 6 3 and 8 9 and nhi by 2 2 and 0 2 in 2019 respectively there were no significant differences in the three nue indices between sm and rf under n2 and n3 in both years 3 4 economic benefit total economic inputs mainly consisted of mulching materials plastic film labor seed and fertilizer costs labor and fertilizer costs varied due to the differences in mulching practice and n rate table 4 over the two growing seasons total economic output ranged from 1830 8 to 2770 3 usd us dollars ha 1 in 2018 and 1648 2 2739 6 usd ha 1 in 2019 net income followed the order of rf sm nm under n2 and n3 but net income under sm was lower than that under nm and rf at n1 the mean net income increased from 1356 6 to 1558 0 usd ha 1 from n1 to n2 increase by 14 8 and from 1558 0 to 1614 0 usd ha 1 from n2 to n3 increase by 3 6 during the two seasons 3 5 soil ammonia volatilization temporal variations of nh3 emissions in various treatments in 2019 are presented in fig 6 for ck nh3 fluxes maintained relatively low levels throughout the season with mean value of 0 83 mg n m 2 h 1 different treatments generally exhibited a similar trend in nh3 fluxes with larger volatilization in the first two weeks and close to ck afterwards the highest nh3 fluxes varied 1 11 5 98 mg n m 2 h 1 in various treatments over the growing season nitrogen fertilization significantly increased nh3 emission table 3 but no significant difference existed between n1 and ck irrespective of mulching practices compared with n1 n2 and n3 increased cumulative nh3 emissions by 35 7 and 72 1 respectively soil mulching tended to increase nh3 flux but there was no significant difference among the mulching practices compare with nm sm and rf increased cumulative nh3 emissions by 13 6 and 9 2 respectively 3 6 soil ghg emissions 3 6 1 soil n2o emission similar seasonal variations of soil n2o flux were observed in various treatments fig 7 n2o fluxes increased and peaked on 27 june in 2018 and on 23 june in 2019 approximately 8 10 days after basal fertilization the fluxes then gradually declined and maintained a relatively low level except for some small peaks after rainfall fig 1 fig 7 in 2018 soil n2o fluxes varied from 29 8 1228 3 μg m 2 h 1 which were higher than those in 2019 58 1 to 731 8 μg m 2 h 1 over the two seasons cumulative n2o emission was significantly influenced by nitrogen rate mulching practices and their interactions table 1 ck had the lowest cumulative n2o emission in both 2018 and 2019 0 42 and 0 34 kg ha 1 about half of that under nm at n1 the mean cumulative n2o emissions of n2 and n3 were increased by 69 5 and 126 9 in 2018 and by 102 6 and 215 3 in 2019 compared with that of n1 respectively in 2018 rf significantly increased seasonal n2o emission at different nitrogen rates 97 1 142 5 higher than that of nm for sm n2o emission was slightly increased at n1 but decreased at n2 and n3 p 0 05 compared with nm in 2019 seasonal n2o emission was increased by 5 8 51 4 under rf and decreased by 3 1 40 9 under sm compared with nm 3 6 2 soil co2 emission seasonal variations of soil co2 flux followed the trend of air temperature over the two growing seasons with peaks accompanied with high air temperatures fig 1 fig 8 in general relatively high co2 emission was observed after basal fertilization co2 fluxes were significantly increased by nitrogen application as compared to ck in 2018 nevertheless there was no significant difference among n1 n2 and n3 under the same mulching practice with mean cumulative co2 emissions of 10 569 5 9833 2 and 10 583 4 kg ha 1 respectively table 3 in 2019 no significant change in co2 flux was found among n rates compared with ck the mean cumulative co2 emissions were 10 342 8 10 475 9 and 10 865 8 kg ha 1 under n1 n2 and n3 respectively p 0 05 over the two growing seasons cumulative co2 emission was significantly influenced by mulching practice table 1 compared with nm cumulative co2 emission was increased by 9 0 19 5 and 35 6 51 6 under sm and rf in 2018 and by 9 7 32 7 and 37 2 78 9 in 2019 respectively 3 6 3 soil ch4 emission seasonal variations of soil ch4 flux were basically consistent in various treatments but the variations showed no obvious trends fig 9 the soil generally acted as a small sink for air ch4 under ck seasonal ch4 absorptions were 1 79 and 1 25 kg ha 1 over the two growing seasons respectively nitrogen rate had no significant influence on cumulative soil ch4 absorption in both years p 0 05 table 3 mean cumulative ch4 absorptions were 2 13 1 97 and 2 38 kg ha 1 at n1 n2 and n3 in 2018 and 0 99 1 28 and 1 18 kg ha 1 in 2019 respectively in both years mean ch4 absorption under sm was decreased by 11 1 at n1 p 0 05 but it increased by 35 4 at n2 and 39 3 at n3 compared with nm p 0 05 rf tended to absorb more ch4 from the atmosphere at various nitrogen rates compared to nm cumulative ch4 absorption was increased by 12 6 79 6 in 2018 and by 51 7 210 8 in 2019 under rf respectively 3 7 relations of nh3 and ghg fluxes with soil properties table 5 shows the relationships of nh3 n2o co2 ch4 fluxes and soil temperature at 10 cm depth wfps no3 n and nh4 n contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer nh3 emission was significantly increased with the increasing soil temperature no3 n and nh4 n contents but significantly decreased with the increasing wfps p 0 01 both n2o and co2 emissions were significantly correlated to soil temperature no3 n and nh4 n contents p 0 05 but not wfps p 0 05 soil ch4 emission did not correlate well with soil temperature no3 n and nh4 n content p 0 05 but was positively correlated with wfps p 0 01 indicating that soil ch4 absorption increased as wfps decreased 3 8 gwp and ghgi seasonal gwp and ghgi were significantly influenced by n fertilization rate mulching practices and their interactions table 2 gwp and ghgi increased with the increasing n rate the lowest gwp and ghgi were obtained under ck on average 71 1 and 12 3 kg co2 eq t 1 yield over the two growing seasons compared with n1 mean gwp and ghgi was increased by 83 4 and 68 7 in 2018 by 116 7 and 90 6 in 2019 at n2 respectively n3 significantly increased mean gwp by 147 6 and 252 9 ghgi by 119 2 and 191 6 in 2018 and 2019 compared with n1 respectively compared with nm increases in seasonal gwp were observed under rf by 92 6 and 19 9 in 2018 and 2019 respectively but decreases under sm by 15 9 and 33 0 respectively ghgi was also increased by 68 2 in 2018 and 8 5 in 2019 under rf while mean ghgi was decreased by 23 1 and 37 1 in 2018 and 2019 under sm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on maize yield economic benefit wp and nue the grain yield wp and nue of rainfed summer maize were significantly affected by mulching practice and nitrogen rate but not their interactions maize yield was increased by 7 9 under sm and by 12 4 under rf relative to nm wp under sm and under rf was 10 3 and 13 5 higher than that of nm these were lower than the finding of gao et al 2019 who concluded that straw and plastic mulching increased maize yield by 12 0 and 29 2 wp by 11 4 and 29 5 compared to non mulching based on data from 176 peer reviewed publications this can be largely due to that the beneficial effect of mulching on maize yield was restricted by the high soil water availability resulting from high seasonal rainfall in our study qin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a both sm and rf increased nue and thus decreased the residual soil nitrate at maturity comparable higher net income was obtained under sm and rf than nm however straw mulching is more preferable due to the adverse effects of plastic film residues on soil environment liu et al 2014a steinmetz et al 2016 qi et al 2020 the grain yield nhi and net income were increased by 17 5 10 1 and 18 9 from n1 to n3 respectively but the nue was significantly decreased the wp under n3 was less than the value under n2 in 2018 indicating that excessive nitrogen application does not contribute to an increase in wp which supported by zhang et al 2017b this highlighted the great potential to better manage n rate for improving n use efficiency while maintain stable grain yield and economic benefit in the rainfed areas of northwest china zhang et al 2017b gao et al 2009 4 2 effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on ammonia volatilization ammonia volatilization was not significantly affected by the interaction of mulching practice and nitrogen rate nh3 emission significantly increased with the increasing soil temperature but decreased with the increase in wfps high soil c n ratio resulting from the wheat straw may stimulate soil microbial activity thereby increasing urea hydrolysis soil nh4 n content and subsequent nh3 volatilization bünemann et al 2006 however higher soil water and lower soil temperature under sm may inhibit nh3 volatilization resulting in non significant increase in nh3 emission decreased soil oxygen concentration and increased soil temperature under film mulching can inhibit ammonium nitrification and improve fertilizer releasing leading to the increase in nh3 volatilization chen et al 1995 however the increase in nh3 flux was not significant between rp and nm this may be supported by the fact that the barrier effect of plastic film blocked nh3 emission from the soil to the atmosphere partially offsetting the increasing effect under rf n application significantly increased nh3 emission regardless of mulching practices in this study nh3 volatilization increased with the increasing nh4 n content p 0 01 which was in line with the finding of zhang et al 2018b in our study an n application rate of 200 kg ha 1 resulted in relatively high grain yield while mitigating nh3 losses to a certain degree unfortunately nh3 has only been collected for analysis during the 2019 growing season due to the technical issue therefore these results need to be further verified in future studies 4 3 effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on greenhouse gas emissions 4 3 1 n2o emission the interaction of mulching practice and nitrogen rate had significant effect on n2o emission mulching practices regulated soil n2o emission by influencing soil temperature and water content chen et al 2017 2019 improved soil water conditions are usually favorable for nitrification and thus increase n2o emission n2o emission reaches a peak at 60 70 wfps and significantly reduces at high wfps bateman and baggs 2005 schmidt et al 2000 gao et al 2014 this explains why n2o emission in 2018 was greater than that in 2019 as a result of remarkably increased soil wfps from intensive rainfall during the maize growing season of 2019 a significant positive correlation was observed between n2o emission and soil temperature which agrees with previous studies zhang et al 2018b li et al 2020 decreased soil temperature under sm caused negative influence on n2o emission an increased soil c n ratio under sm may immobilize soil mineral n and further reduce the n substrate for n2o production anderson et al 2011 plastic film intercepted rainwater and resulted in lower wpfs on the ridge average 55 which was favorable to the production of n2o higher soil temperature on the ridge was also a critical factor for higher n2o production n fertilization is the most direct factor promoting soil n2o emission linquist et al 2012 liu et al 2017 kuang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 n2o emission exhibited high positive correlations with soil inorganic n irrespective of mulching practices especially no3 n excessive n fertilization increased soil mineral n content contributing to higher n2o emission zhong et al 2016 kim and giltrap 2017 4 3 2 co2 emission co2 emission was significantly affected by mulching practices but not nitrogen rate and their interactions zhang et al 2017a yu et al 2018 non significant negative relationships between co2 emission and wfps were observed similar to the finding of liu et al 2010 and li et al 2019b the direct temperature change largely explained the differences in co2 emission under various mulching practices despite low soil temperature available c and soil organic carbon was increased by straw decomposition in the soil under sm xu et al 2019 promoting the effect of available substrates for co2 emission this explained the increase in co2 emission under sm and suggested that soil c played an important role in regulating soil co2 emission increased temperature promoted co2 emission under rf due to the improved microbial activity bacterial diversity and organic matter decomposition li et al 2004 li et al 2011 argued that film mulching reduced co2 emission because plastic film prevented gas from being released from the soil the atmosphere however the improved metabolic rate and microbiological activity resulting from increased soil temperature offset the barrier effect of plastic film gan et al 2013 there was no obvious trend in co2 emission among n rates in 2018 but co2 emission slightly increased with the increase of n rate in 2019 nikièma et al 2011 also pointed out that the increase in co2 emission with increasing n rate was not significant gagnon et al 2016 found that nitrogen application stimulated soil co2 emission under high soil organic matter conditions whereas soil respiration was inhibited with n fertilizer in low organic matter soils non significant changes in co2 emission among different n rates can be due to the soil low organic matter 10 g kg 1 in our system 4 3 3 ch4 emission ch4 fluxes were not significantly affected by the interaction of nitrogen rate and mulching practice rainfed soils are usually sinks of ch4 under dry conditions ch4 emission and consumption patterns were inconsistent under sm at the same n rate straw mulching increased soil porosity and enhanced the soil s capability of absorbing ch4 chen et al 2017 whereas straw amendment may increase ch4 emission due to higher soil c released from straw decomposition wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a optimum soil temperature stimulated methanotrophic activities and increased ch4 uptake from the atmosphere under rf in our study chen et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that ch4 emission showed a downward trend with increasing n rate because methane oxidation was stimulated by higher soil o2 input from increased root biomass in addition ch4 production was inhibited when more n2o was generated in the soil under higher n inputs yao et al 2012 nevertheless some studies indicated that n application increased ch4 emission by influencing soil ph eh methanogen activity and plant growth wang et al 1992 cai et al 2007 in our study no obvious difference in ch4 emission was observed among n rates due to complex underlying mechanisms of methanogen activity ch4 fluxes were not closely related to the influencing factors but wfps 4 4 gwp and ghgi net co2 emissions from soil and plant respiration usually offer a conceivable explanation of ghg impact robertson et al 2000 figured out that soc observation was a typical method for evaluating co2 exchange in this study soc in the 0 20 cm soil layer measured after harvest during the two maize growing seasons were not significantly different 5 11 0 82 5 24 1 13 4 66 0 78 4 85 0 73 4 55 1 06 5 93 1 30 at n1 5 5 0 10 5 64 0 60 5 63 0 77 6 13 1 12 5 28 0 43 5 83 0 27 at n2 and 4 15 0 58 4 78 1 01 5 05 0 56 5 45 0 67 5 47 0 90 5 88 1 53 at n3 under nm sm and rf respectively chen et al 2017 also found that soc was not significantly different in the wheat maize rotation system before planting and after harvest on the loess plateau of china using only n2o and ch4 exchanges to estimate net gwp in this study was considered reliable n2o contributed more to gwp than ch4 in the maize fields because ch4 consumption exceeded emission due to the rainfed condition gwp and ghgi were decreased under sm but increased under rf compared with nm straw mulching can be a promising alternative to plastic mulching in dryland production by reducing ghg emissions while maintaining maize yield and economic benefit zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2019 in contrast chen et al 2017 found both straw and plastic mulching decreased ghgi redundant rainfall occurred during the two seasons which may resulted in a smaller increase in grain yield and subsequent a high ghgi under rf in our study ghgi was decreased by 60 when n rate decreased from 300 to 100 n kg ha 1 while grain yield and net income were only decreased by 14 9 and 15 9 respectively however 100 kg n ha 1 could not satisfy the plant n uptake fig 4 therefore a better balance between agronomic economic and environmental benefits can be achieved by straw mulching with an n application rate of 200 n kg ha 1 5 conclusions the response of maize yield economic benefit wp nue nh3 and ghg emissions to various mulching practices n application rates and their interactions were explored in this study both straw and plastic film mulching were favorable to maize growth water productivity plant n utilization and economic benefit but rf produced much higher gwp and ghgi a medium n application rate of 200 kg n ha 1 resulted in relatively low snr nh3 gwp ghgi but relatively high grain yield wp nue and net income which was friendly to the environment while producing satisfactory maize yield and net income in this study in conclusion straw mulching with 200 kg n ha 1 achieved a better balance between agronomic economic and environmental benefits which is highly recommended for the sustainable production of rainfed maize in the sub humid and drought prone region of northwest china however a more accurate optimal n rate needs to be explored in future

10174,soil mulching and nitrogen application have long been applied in rainfed agriculture but their interactive effects on crop productivity and especially environments remain poorly understood field experiments were carried out in 2018 and 2019 to investigate the responses of grain yield water productivity nitrogen use efficiency economic benefit and greenhouse gas n2o co2 and ch4 emissions of rainfed summer maize in northwest china to various mulching practices nm no mulching sm straw mulching and rf ridge furrow cultivation with film mulching on the ridge nitrogen rates n1 100 kg n ha 1 n2 200 kg n ha 1 and n3 300 kg n ha 1 and their interactions the results showed that there were no significant differences in grain yield water productivity and nue between rf and sm irrespective of nitrogen rates but rf and sm significantly increased grain yield by 12 4 and 7 9 water productivity by 13 7 and 10 2 and partial factor productivity by 12 1 and 7 2 compared with nm 7620 8 kg ha 1 18 86 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 45 3 kg kg 1 respectively sm obtained comparable net income to rf under n2 1567 0 and 1632 4 usd ha 1 and n3 1593 9 and 1709 9 usd ha 1 grain yield and net income increased by 12 0 and 14 8 from n1 7408 6 kg ha 1 and 1356 6 usd ha 1 to n2 and by only 5 5 and 3 6 from n2 8297 3 kg ha 1 and 1558 0 usd ha 1 to n3 respectively water productivity was increased by 14 3 from n1 18 6 kg ha 1 mm 1 to n2 but it decreased by 3 3 in 2018 and increased by 3 0 in 2019 from n2 23 2 and 19 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 to n3 both sm and rf increased co2 emission compared to nm while n2o emission decreased under sm and increased under rf rf increased soil ch4 absorption while ch4 patterns were not consistent under sm sm significantly decreased global warming potential by 23 1 and greenhouse gas intensity by 29 0 relative to nm 405 4 kg co2 eq and 52 0 kg co2 eq t 1 yield but they were significantly increased by 62 1 and 22 4 compared with nm under rf respectively compared to n1 74 09 kg kg 1 n2 and n3 decreased partial factor productivity by 44 0 and 60 9 respectively n rate had little influence on co2 and ch4 emissions but it significantly promoted n2o emission there were significant interacting effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on n2o emission and global warming potential in conclusion straw mulching with 200 kg n ha 1 achieved a better balance between agronomic economic and environmental benefits of rainfed summer maize in northwest china keywords nitrogen rate mulching practice nitrogen use efficiency ammonia volatilization greenhouse gas emissions 1 introduction rainfed agriculture accounts for more than 70 of the total arable land in north and northwest china mainly located in the arid and semi arid regions li et al 2014 drought and nutrient deficiency are the major factors limiting maize zea mays l production in these regions hu et al 2019 xu et al 2020 scarce and variable annual precipitation 200 600 mm is the only water input for rainfed agriculture about 60 of which occurs between july and september chen et al 2020 fan et al 2021 zheng et al 2019 in the context of water shortage straw mulching sm and ridge furrow cultivation with plastic film mulching on the ridge rf have been widely adopted to improve water productivity and maize yield by reducing soil evaporation conserving soil water and regulating soil temperature organic matter and structure li et al 2013 chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2017a hu et al 2019 maneepitak et al 2019 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 zheng et al 2020 2021 nitrogen n amendment is an effective way for promoting maize growth and ultimately enhancing grain yield wang et al 2020 however the n input for rainfed maize in northwest china averagely amounts to 300 kg n ha 1 which is much higher than the nitrogen requirement for summer maize chang et al 2014 although the high n input may guarantee high maize yield it significantly decreases the nitrogen use efficiency nue and contributes to high soil n residual the nue for the wheat maize cropping system in china was only 16 18 due to the excessive use of mineral n from 1987 to 2015 liang et al 2018 scientists have recently paid more attention to environmental issues worldwide ammonia nh3 is a major environmental pollutant and a critical precursor for pm2 5 dan et al 2004 sun et al 2018 its atmospheric deposition to the land surface also contributes to soil acidification eutrophication and loss of biodiversity asman et al 1998 hellsten et al 2008 agricultural fertilizers are the world s biggest sources of nh3 contributing 41 9 to the total emission xu et al 2015 pan et al 2016 global warming due to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas ghg emissions is also a severe environmental issue nitrous oxide n2o carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 are the major ghg and have rapidly increased especially since the mid 20th century agriculture is the second greatest ghg emission source after fossil fuels anthropogenic co2 emission dominated by agriculture totaled 5575 mt and increased to 5800 mt by 2014 fao 2015 global warming potentials gwp of n2o and ch4 are 298 and 28 times greater than that of co2 and agriculture soil has been estimated to contribute 84 and 52 to the global anthropogenic n2o and ch4 emissions respectively ipcc 2014 the changing soil water and temperature conditions as a result of soil mulching can influence nh3 and ghg emissions however it is not clear yet that how straw and plastic film mulching affect nh3 volatilization despite several studies on nh3 volatilization in northwest china or other regions with similar climates cai et al 2002 zhang et al 2004 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 2015 li et al 2017 li et al 2019a inconsistent results of straw and plastic mulching on ghg emissions have been observed even in the same field during various seasons chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 co2 and ch4 emissions under straw mulching are mostly increase due to the readily available c from straw decomposition but chen et al 2017 found that straw mulching increased the soil s ability to absorb ch4 it has been reported that rf increased no2 and co2 emissions because the increased soil temperature and moisture stimulated nitrifier and or denitrifier activities wrage et al 2001 and promoted soil mineralization li et al 2004 however no2 and co2 emissions have also been decreased largely due to the decreased soil mineral n or the barrier effect of plastic film on the ridge gan et al 2013 liu et al 2014b improving our knowledge of soil mulching effects on maize growth and environmental effects is still highly required for rainfed agriculture nitrogen application can lead to nh3 air pollution and ghg emissions from mineral n fertilizers previous studies showed that applied n was lost by nh3 volatilization under decreased soil ph conditions due to hydrolysis of granule urea into nh4 oh and co3 2 after n application hayashi et al 2008 tian et al 2017 n2o can be generated from the nitrification and denitrification processes which are mainly controlled by the soil available substrate no3 nh4 migliorati et al 2014 wang et al 2016 zhong et al 2016 urea is converted into nh4 oh and hco3 in the presence of water and urease enzymes and hco3 then evolves into co2 and water therefore higher nh3 n2o and co2 are usually emitted from the soil with the increasing nitrogen input snyder et al 2009 however both increase and decrease of soil oxidation capacity for ch4 emission have been observed with the increased nh4 contents from fertilizers van den pol van dasselaar et al 1999 bodelier and laanbroek 2004 an optimal n rate is thus critical not only for sustaining maize yield but also for ensuring good environment soil mulching and nitrogen application have long been used for improving crop productivity in rainfed agriculture but there remain large uncertainties regarding their comprehensive impacts on environments such as nh3 volatilization and greenhouse gas emissions what s more important the interacting effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on maize yield and greenhouse gas emissions have not been explored yet therefore the objective of this study was to explore the responses of maize yield water productivity wp n utilization efficiency nue economic benefit nh3 ventilation and ghg emissions to various soil mulching practices n application rates and their interactions the hypotheses were that 1 plastic film mulching produces the highest maize yield wp nue and economic benefit but also the greatest ghg emissions 2 straw mulching obtains comparable maize yield wp nue and economic benefit to plastic film mulching but it produces low ghg emissions and 3 the combination of straw mulching and a medium nitrogen rate of 200 n kg ha 1 better balances the agronomic economic and environmental benefits of rainfed maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the

was 30 cm fig 2a irrigation was not applied over the two maize growing seasons and other field managements e g pest weed and diseases control were undertaken following local farmers practices 2 3 sampling and measurements 2 3 1 nh3 collection and measurement nh3 volatilization was measured using vented chambers made of pvc cylinders 40 cm in diameter and 25 cm in height liao 1983 wang et al 2011 dong et al 2019 which was only conducted during the summer maize growing season of 2019 due to technical issues for nm and sm one pvc cylinder was installed at each experimental plot for rf one pvc cylinder was located on the ridge and the other in the furrow fig 2 two pieces of sponges 40 cm in diameter and 2 cm in thickness soaked in phosphoglycerin 50 ml phosphoric acid 40 ml glycerin fill water to 1000 ml were placed in each cylinder as absorbents the upper sponge was used to reduce air nh3 and dust pollution while the bottom captured volatilized nh3 from the soil nh3 volatilization was measured every 2 3 days in the first week and then every 10 15 days until harvest with a total of 11 measurements during each growing season the bottom sponge was immediately immersed in a solution of 300 ml 1 mol l 1 kcl in a 500 ml container and was vibrated on a reciprocating vibrator for 1 h the nh4 n concentration of extracted solution was tested using the microflow

covered with insulating material to reduce the inside temperature change in addition the chamber had a small hole with a temperature probe and a sampling gas channel with a three way stopcock an electric fan was also equipped for gas mixing inside the chamber after sowing the maize one frame was inserted 15 cm into the soil for nm and sm and two were installed one on the ridge and the other in the furrow for rf fig 2 samples were taken 2 3 days after fertilization and heavy rainfall 10 mm and about every 10 days thereafter during sampling a chamber was placed into the groove filled with

nh4 n concentrations in the extracts were analyzed by the micro flow auto analyzer aa3 seal company germany in addition soil samples in the 0 200 cm profile were collected at 20 cm intervals at each plot before sowing and after harvest there was a concentration gradient between the fertilizer band and the maize row when fertilizers were applied in bands soil samples were thus collected in three locations one in the maize row one in the fertilizer band and one in between the maize rows at each gas sampling location and mixed to measure soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n fig 2a 2 3 4 plant sampling and measurement at physiological maturity 12 maize plants were randomly harvested in the center of each experimental plot to determine the average grain yield of a maize plant which was then multiplied by the planting density 56000 plant ha 1 to obtain final grain yield at 14 0 moisture level maize leaves stem and sheath cob and grain were separated and oven dried at 105 for 30 min and then at 75 to a constant weight plant samples were passed through a 2 mm sieve after grinding and digested with concentrated h2so4 h2o2 for tissue n analysis using the kjeldahl method bremner 1996 2 4

soil temperature wfps and mineral n dynamics soil temperatures at 10 cm depth were similar to daily air temperature in various treatments fig 1 fig 3a mean soil temperatures were similar at n1 n2 and n3 over the two growing seasons with values of 27 31 27 27 and 27 23 respectively soil temperatures were greatly influenced by mulching practices compared with nm soil temperatures were reduced on average by 0 51 under sm and increased by 3 25 on the ridge of rf wfps at 20 cm depth increased following rainfall events and declined as a combined result of soil evaporation and plant transpiration fig 3b mean wfps were similar under n1 n2 and n3 with values of 64 4 66 0 and 65 0 respectively compared to nm sm increased wfps by 2 7 wfps on the ridge of rf was 19 3 lower than that of nm while wfps in the furrow was close to that of nm 67 1 and 68 4 respectively generally soil no3 and nh4 contents in the 0 20 cm layer showed high levels following n application and gradually decreased to the baseline level later however as for the ridge of rf soil no3 contents showed varying trends with relatively higher values at the late growth stage of summer maize fig 3c d the lowest soil no3 and nh4

under various nitrogen rates 3 3 residual soil nitrate and nue soil nitrate residue snr at maize maturity in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 5 no3 n contents showed a decreasing trend over depth nitrate n residue was mainly retained in the 0 100 cm soil layer accounting for 72 0 and 64 5 of snr in the 0 200 cm soil profile over the two seasons respectively this indicated that no3 n leaching beyond the 100 cm soil layer was increased in 2019 increasing nitrogen rate significantly increased no3 n accumulation in the 0 200 cm soil profile table 3 the lowest cumulative snr was observed under ck in both 2018 100 1 kg ha 1 and 2019 95 9 kg ha 1 cumulative snr was increased by 52 0 63 3 and 131 8 138 5 at n2 and n3 in 2018 by 50 1 122 9 and 136 0 208 6 in 2019 compared with n1 respectively at the same n rate cumulative snr showed no significant difference among nm sm and rf in 2018 and there was no significant difference among mulching practices under n2 in 2019 compared with nm cumulative snr was decreased by 7 6 12 2 and 14 7 17 0 under sm and rf in 2018 by 4 8 14 3 and 17 4 40 2 in 2019 respectively n rates significantly affected nupe pfp and nhi in both years table 2

59 8 but increased nhi by 10 5 and 9 9 compared to n1 respectively the effect of mulching practice on nue was less than that of n rate mulching practice significantly affected nupe and pfp p 0 05 but it had no significant influence on nhi p 0 05 in 2018 sm increased nupe pfp and nhi by 8 0 8 1 and 1 1 compared with nm respectively the corresponding values were 13 2 15 2 and 2 7 under rf respectively sm and rf increased nupe by 9 0 and 9 2 pfp by 6 3 and 8 9 and nhi by 2 2 and 0 2 in 2019 respectively there were no significant differences in the three nue indices between sm and rf under n2 and n3 in both years 3 4 economic benefit total economic inputs mainly consisted of mulching materials plastic film labor seed and fertilizer costs labor and fertilizer costs varied due to

nh3 fluxes with larger volatilization in the first two weeks and close to ck afterwards the highest nh3 fluxes varied 1 11 5 98 mg n m 2 h 1 in various treatments over the growing season nitrogen fertilization significantly increased nh3 emission table 3 but no significant difference existed between n1 and ck irrespective of mulching practices compared with n1 n2 and n3 increased cumulative nh3 emissions by 35 7 and 72 1 respectively soil mulching tended to increase nh3 flux but there was no significant difference among the mulching practices compare with nm sm and rf increased

at n1 p 0 05 but it increased by 35 4 at n2 and 39 3 at n3 compared with nm p 0 05 rf tended to absorb more ch4 from the atmosphere at various nitrogen rates compared to nm cumulative ch4 absorption was increased by 12 6 79 6 in 2018 and by 51 7 210 8 in 2019 under rf respectively 3 7 relations of nh3 and ghg fluxes with soil properties table 5 shows the relationships of nh3 n2o co2 ch4 fluxes and soil temperature at 10 cm depth wfps no3 n and nh4 n contents in the 0 20 cm soil layer nh3 emission was significantly increased with the increasing soil temperature no3 n and nh4 n contents but significantly decreased with the increasing wfps p 0 01 both n2o and co2 emissions were significantly correlated to soil temperature no3 n and nh4 n contents p 0 05 but not wfps p 0 05 soil ch4 emission did not correlate well with soil temperature no3 n and nh4 n content p 0 05 but was positively correlated with wfps p 0 01 indicating that soil ch4 absorption increased as wfps decreased 3 8 gwp and ghgi seasonal gwp and ghgi were significantly influenced by n fertilization rate mulching practices and their interactions table 2 gwp and ghgi increased with the increasing n rate the lowest gwp and ghgi were obtained under ck on average 71 1 and 12 3 kg co2 eq t 1 yield over the two growing seasons compared with n1 mean gwp and ghgi was increased by 83 4 and 68 7 in 2018 by 116 7 and 90 6 in 2019 at n2 respectively n3 significantly increased mean gwp by 147 6 and 252 9 ghgi by 119 2 and 191 6 in 2018 and 2019 compared with n1 respectively compared with nm increases in seasonal gwp were observed under rf by 92 6 and 19 9 in 2018 and 2019 respectively but decreases under sm by 15 9 and 33 0 respectively ghgi was also increased by 68 2 in 2018 and 8 5 in 2019 under rf while mean ghgi was decreased by 23 1 and 37 1 in 2018 and 2019 under sm respectively 4 discussion 4 1 effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on maize yield economic benefit wp and nue the grain yield wp and nue of rainfed summer maize were significantly affected by mulching practice and nitrogen rate but not their interactions maize yield was increased by 7 9 under sm and by 12 4 under rf relative to nm wp under sm and under rf was 10 3 and 13 5 higher than that of nm these were lower than the finding of gao et al 2019 who concluded that straw and plastic mulching increased maize yield by 12 0 and 29 2 wp by 11 4 and 29 5 compared to non mulching based on data from 176 peer reviewed publications this can be largely due to that the beneficial effect of mulching on maize yield was restricted by the high soil water availability resulting from high seasonal rainfall in our study qin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018a both sm and rf increased nue and thus decreased the residual soil nitrate at maturity comparable higher net income was obtained under sm and rf than nm however straw mulching is more preferable due to the adverse effects of plastic film residues on soil environment liu et al 2014a steinmetz et al 2016 qi et al 2020 the grain yield nhi and net income were increased by 17 5 10 1 and 18 9 from n1 to n3 respectively but the nue was significantly decreased the wp under n3 was less than the value under n2 in 2018 indicating that excessive nitrogen application does not contribute to an increase in wp which supported by zhang et al 2017b this highlighted the great potential to better manage n rate for improving n use efficiency while maintain stable grain yield and economic benefit in the rainfed areas of northwest china zhang et al 2017b gao et al 2009 4 2 effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on ammonia volatilization ammonia volatilization was not significantly affected by the interaction of mulching practice and nitrogen rate nh3 emission significantly increased with the increasing soil temperature but decreased with the increase in wfps high soil c n ratio resulting from the wheat straw may stimulate soil microbial activity thereby increasing urea hydrolysis soil nh4 n content and subsequent nh3 volatilization bünemann et al 2006 however higher soil water and lower soil temperature under sm may inhibit nh3 volatilization resulting in non significant increase in nh3 emission decreased soil oxygen concentration and increased soil temperature under film mulching can inhibit ammonium nitrification and improve fertilizer releasing leading to the increase in nh3 volatilization chen et al 1995 however the increase in nh3 flux was not significant between rp and nm this may be supported by the fact that the barrier effect of plastic film blocked nh3 emission from the soil to the atmosphere partially offsetting the increasing effect under rf n application significantly increased nh3 emission regardless of mulching practices in this study nh3 volatilization increased with the increasing nh4 n content p 0 01 which was in line with the finding of zhang et al 2018b in our study an n application rate of 200 kg ha 1 resulted in relatively high grain yield while mitigating nh3 losses to a certain degree unfortunately nh3 has only been collected for analysis during the 2019 growing season due to the technical issue therefore these results need to be further verified in future studies 4 3 effects of mulching practice and nitrogen rate on greenhouse gas emissions 4 3 1 n2o emission the interaction of mulching practice and nitrogen rate had significant effect on n2o emission mulching practices regulated soil n2o emission by influencing soil temperature and water content chen et al 2017 2019 improved soil water conditions are usually favorable for nitrification and thus increase n2o emission n2o emission reaches a peak at 60 70 wfps and significantly reduces at high wfps bateman and baggs 2005 schmidt et al 2000 gao et al 2014 this explains why n2o emission in 2018 was greater than that in 2019 as a result of remarkably increased soil wfps from intensive rainfall during the maize growing season of 2019 a significant positive correlation was observed between n2o emission and soil temperature which agrees with previous studies zhang et al 2018b li et al 2020 decreased soil temperature under sm caused negative influence on n2o emission an increased soil c n ratio under sm may immobilize soil mineral n and further reduce the n substrate for n2o production anderson et al 2011 plastic film intercepted rainwater and resulted in lower wpfs on the ridge average 55 which was favorable to the production of n2o higher soil temperature on the ridge was also a critical factor for higher n2o production n fertilization is the most direct factor promoting soil n2o emission linquist et al 2012 liu et al 2017 kuang et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 n2o emission exhibited high positive correlations with soil inorganic n irrespective of mulching practices especially no3 n excessive n fertilization increased soil mineral n content contributing to higher n2o emission zhong et al 2016 kim and giltrap 2017 4 3 2 co2 emission co2 emission was significantly affected by mulching practices but not nitrogen rate and their interactions zhang et al 2017a yu et al 2018 non significant negative relationships between co2 emission and wfps were observed similar to the finding of liu et al 2010 and li et al 2019b the direct temperature change largely explained the differences in co2 emission under various mulching practices despite low soil temperature available c and soil organic carbon was increased by straw decomposition in the soil under sm xu et al 2019 promoting the effect of available substrates for co2 emission this explained the increase in co2 emission under sm and suggested that soil c played an important role in regulating soil co2 emission increased temperature promoted co2 emission under rf due to the improved microbial activity bacterial diversity and organic matter decomposition li et al 2004 li et al 2011 argued that film mulching reduced co2 emission because plastic film prevented gas from being released from the soil the atmosphere however the improved metabolic rate and microbiological activity resulting from increased soil temperature offset the barrier effect of plastic film gan et al 2013 there was no obvious trend in co2 emission among n rates in 2018 but co2 emission slightly increased with the increase of n rate in 2019 nikièma et al 2011 also pointed out that the increase in co2 emission with increasing n rate was not significant gagnon et al 2016 found that nitrogen application stimulated soil co2 emission under high soil organic matter conditions whereas soil respiration was inhibited with n fertilizer in low organic matter soils non significant changes in co2 emission among different n rates can be due to the soil low organic matter 10 g kg 1 in our system 4 3 3 ch4 emission ch4 fluxes were not significantly affected by the interaction of nitrogen rate and mulching practice rainfed soils are usually sinks of ch4 under dry conditions ch4 emission and consumption patterns were inconsistent under sm at the same n rate straw mulching increased soil porosity and enhanced the soil s capability of absorbing ch4 chen et al 2017 whereas straw amendment may increase ch4 emission due to higher soil c released from straw decomposition wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017a optimum soil temperature stimulated methanotrophic activities and increased ch4 uptake from the atmosphere under rf in our study chen et al 2017 previous studies have suggested that ch4 emission showed a downward trend with increasing n rate because methane oxidation was stimulated by higher soil o2 input from increased root biomass in addition ch4 production was inhibited when more n2o was generated in the soil under higher n inputs yao et al 2012 nevertheless some studies indicated that n application increased ch4 emission by influencing soil ph eh methanogen activity and plant growth wang et al 1992 cai et al 2007 in our study no obvious difference in ch4 emission was observed among n rates due to complex underlying mechanisms of methanogen activity ch4 fluxes were not closely related to the influencing factors but wfps 4 4 gwp and ghgi net co2 emissions from soil and plant respiration usually offer a conceivable explanation of ghg impact robertson et al 2000 figured out that soc observation was a typical method for evaluating co2 exchange in this study soc in the 0 20 cm soil layer measured after harvest during the two maize growing seasons were not significantly different 5 11 0 82 5 24 1 13 4 66 0 78 4 85 0 73 4 55 1 06 5 93 1 30 at

that soc was not significantly different in the wheat maize rotation system before planting and after harvest on the loess plateau of china using only n2o and ch4 exchanges to estimate net gwp in this study was considered reliable n2o contributed more to gwp than ch4 in the maize fields because ch4 consumption exceeded emission due to the rainfed condition gwp and ghgi were decreased under sm but increased under rf compared with nm straw mulching can be a promising alternative to plastic mulching in dryland production by reducing ghg emissions while maintaining maize yield and economic benefit zhao et al 2019 chen et al 2019 in contrast chen et al 2017 found both straw and plastic mulching decreased ghgi redundant rainfall occurred during the two seasons which may resulted in a smaller increase in grain yield and subsequent a high ghgi under rf in our study ghgi was decreased by 60 when n rate decreased from 300 to 100 n kg ha 1 while grain yield and net income were only decreased by 14 9 and 15 9 respectively however 100 kg n ha 1 could not satisfy the plant n uptake fig 4 therefore a better balance between agronomic economic and environmental benefits can be achieved by straw mulching with an n application rate of 200 n kg ha 1 5 conclusions the response of maize yield economic benefit wp nue nh3 and ghg emissions to various mulching practices n application rates and their interactions were explored in this study both straw and plastic film mulching were favorable to maize growth water productivity plant n utilization and economic benefit but rf produced much higher gwp and ghgi a medium n application rate of 200 kg n ha 1 resulted in relatively low snr nh3 gwp ghgi but relatively high grain yield wp nue and net income which was friendly to the environment while producing satisfactory maize yield and net income in this study in conclusion straw mulching with 200 kg n ha 1 achieved a better balance between agronomic economic and environmental benefits which is highly recommended for the sustainable production of rainfed maize in the sub humid and drought prone region of northwest china however a more accurate optimal n rate needs to be explored in future
