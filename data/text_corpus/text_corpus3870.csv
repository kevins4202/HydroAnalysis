19350,oxidation processes are impacted by the type concentration and reactivity of the dissolved organic matter dom in this study the reactions between various types of dom suwannee river fulvic acid srfa nordic reservoir nom nnom and pony lake fulvic acid plfa and two oxidants ozone and chlorine were studied in the ph range 2 9 by using a combination of optical measurements and electron donating capacities the relationships between residual electron donating capacity edc and residual absorbance showed a strong ph dependence for the ozone dom reactions with phenolic functional groups being the main reacting moieties relative edc and absorbance abatements uv254 or uv280 were similar at ph 2 at ph 7 or 9 the relative abatement of edc was more pronounced than for absorbance which could be explained by the formation of uv absorbing products such as benzoquinone from the transformation of phenolic moieties an increase in fluorescence abatement with increasing ph was also observed during ozonation the increase in fluorescence quantum yields could not be attributed to formation of benzoquinone but related to a faster abatement of phenolic moieties relative to fluorophores with low ozone reactivity the overall oh yields as a result of dom induced ozone consumption increased significantly with increasing ph which could be related to the higher reactivity of phenolic moieties at higher ph the oh yields for srfa and plfa were proportional to the phenolic contents whereas for nnom the oh yield was about 30 higher during chlorination of dom at ph 7 an efficient relative edc abatement was observed whereas the relative absorbance abatement was much less pronounced this is due to the formation of chlorophenolic moieties which exert a significant absorbance and partly lose their electron donating capacity pre ozonation of srfa leads to a decrease of chloroform and haloacetic acid formation however only after a threshold of 50 abatement of the edc and under conditions which are not precursor limited the decrease in chloroform and haloacetic acid formation after the threshold edc abatement was proportional to the relative residual edc graphical abstract image 1

engineered aquatic systems dissolved organic matter dom plays an important role in numerous natural and engineered aquatic processes dom consists of a mixture of heterogenous compounds with a continuum of functional groups and molecular sizes leenheer and croue 2003 dom contains organic molecular structures with a wide size range including humic substances biopolymers building blocks and low molecular weight organic acids huber et al 2011 leenheer and croue 2003 in water treatment dom is typically characterized by measurements of concentration dissolved organic carbon doc and or optical properties absorbance or fluorescence absorbance has been used as a surrogate for dom concentration and as a process control parameter for the oxidation of organic contaminants in water and wastewater treatment gerrity et al 2012 wittmer et al 2015 dom is often characterized by the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 uv absorbance divided by the doc a surrogate for dom aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 over the last years the use of dom fluorescence measurements has become more common these measurements were used to quantify both dom concentration and character in natural and engineered systems gerrity et al 2012 osburn et al 2012 stedmon et al 2003 1 2 role and change of the dom in oxidative water treatment processes during oxidative processes e g application of ozone or chlorine dom is the main sink for the added oxidants specific functional groups within the dom e g poly phenols amines olefins anilines etc are susceptible to chemical modifications during exposure of the dom to oxidants lee and von gunten 2010 the reactivities and concentrations of such moieties in the dom determine the extent of the dom oxidant interactions and their effects on the targeted oxidation disinfection processes lee and von gunten 2010 some understanding of the reactions between the oxidants and dom can be gained by considering reaction rate constants between a specific oxidant and known dom moieties for example the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction between ozone and phenol is on the order of 106 m 1s 1 at ph 7 whereas for chlorine hocl it is 20 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 given that the aromaticity i e average proportion of aromatic moieties including phenolic moieties to the total carbon varies between 12 and 22 for dom isolates a phenol concentration of approximately 2 10 6 m can be estimated for a 1 mg c l solution of srfa this suggests that an equimolar concentration of ozone will be consumed within seconds whereas the hocl consumption will take about 5 h changes in selected physicochemical properties of dom during its reaction between ozone or hocl are well characterized for example the overall absorbance and fluorescence intensities decrease with increasing extent of chemical oxidation gerrity et al 2012 concomitantly the reaction of the oxidants with dom result in the formation of disinfection by products dbps lee et al 2007 mitch and sedlak 2002 von gunten 2003 and also changes in the redox properties of the dom wenk et al 2013 depending on the oxidant applied different types of dbps can be formed primary products from the attack of phenolic compounds by ozone are benzoquinones catchechols muconic acids etc mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 which can be further oxidized to aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids hammes et al 2006 for chlorination primary products from phenolic moieties are chlorophenols which are then further transformed to trihalomethanes e g chloroform or haloacetic acids gallard and von gunten 2002 ge et al 2014 in addition both ozone and chlorine can react with amines forming e g nitroso and nitro compounds or n oxides or organic and inorganic halamines respectively de vera et al 2017b heeb et al 2017 mccurry et al 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 1 3 characterizing the redox properties of the dom and assessing dbps formation recently there has been a growing interest in the electrochemical properties of dom in water treatment applications a method based on mediated electrochemical oxidation employing abts the one electron oxidation product of abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulphonicacid as an electron transfer mediator to facilitate electron transfer from oxidizable moieties in the dom to the working electrode of the electrochemical cell aeschbacher et al 2010 the outcome of this measurement is the so called electron donating capacity edc a further development of this method involved automation by implementing flow injection analysis to monitor the reduction of abts to abts by dom chronoamperometrically in an electrochemical flow cell walpen et al 2016 in another study edc was measured employing size exclusion chromatography for dom size separation followed by the same approach involving abts for edc quantification by a post column reaction and spectrophotometric analysis of the decolourization of abts to abts chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 edc measurements allow for an assessment of the redox properties or the antioxidant capacity of the dom aeschbacher et al 2010 known electron donating moieties of the dom include phenols such as mono and poly hydroxylated benzene rings amines aniline sulfur or olefinic moieties previous work has shown that the edc values of ten dom isolates were positively correlated with their titrated phenol contents strongly suggesting that phenolic moieties of the dom are major contributors to the edc of dom samples aeschbacher et al 2012 taken together the extent of the oxidant consumption and the formation of dbps from the oxidant dom reactions depend on the concentrations and types of the reactive moieties in dom combined edc and absorbance measurements have advanced the understanding of the dom ozone and the dom chlorine reactions wenk et al 2013 including the effects on micropollutant abatement chon et al 2015 de vera et al 2017a the main objective of this paper is to advance our understanding of the reactions between oxidants ozone and chlorine and dom to investigate changes in the dom during oxidation changes in edc and optical properties absorbance and fluorescence were assessed at various ph values for dosage and kinetic experiments furthermore the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh was investigated during ozonation of dom finally the formation of chloroform and chloroacetic acids without or with pre ozonation followed by chlorination was measured and related to the abatement of the edc 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals natural organic matter isolates preparation of solutions a list of the chemicals and standards used in this study is provided in text s1 in the supplementary data model dom isolates including suwanee river fulvic acid srfa nordic reservoir nom nnom and pony lake fulvic acid plfa were obtained from the international humic substances society ihss details are given in table s1 the type and composition of all solutions used in this study including preparation details are provided in text s2 and table s2 2 2 oxidation experiments ozonation was performed as dosage experiments 50 ml or kinetic experiments 5 250 ml in absence or in presence of 100 mm t buoh as a hydroxyl radical oh scavenger staehelin and hoigné 1985 control experiments showed that the added t buoh did not interfere with absorbance measurements at 254 nm nor with the quantification of the edc table s3 for ozone dosage experiments samples that had been ozonated were stored at room temperature overnight to ensure complete ozone depletion for kinetic experiments 5 ml samples were collected using a dispenser system hoigné and bader 1994 and immediately quenched by various quenchers see below at pre determined reaction times up to 3000s samples corresponding to 5 10 and 15s were obtained from separate experiments performed in 15 ml glass vials with a 5 ml reaction volume and direct quenching see below chlorine dosage experiments were performed with 40 ml samples after chlorine addition the samples were stored for 48 h at room temperature for complete depletion of chlorine the samples were stored in the dark to avoid photo decomposition of chlorine nowell and hoigné 1992 in dosage experiments specific ozone doses of 0 0 5 mmol o3 mmol c or specific chlorine doses of 0 0 2 mmol hocl mmol c were applied the specific oxidant doses lie within the typical range applied in water and wastewater treatment of bourgin et al 2018 garcia villanova et al 1997 zimmermann et al 2011 for some selected experiments srfa was pre ozonated with higher specific ozone doses than above 0 2 0 mmol o3 mmol c to obtain an edc abatement of up to 95 thereafter the samples were treated with the above specific chlorine doses to follow the conventional treatment step undertaken at water treatment plants with pre ozonation and post chlorination kinetic ozone experiments were performed with a specific ozone dose of 0 25 mmol o3 mmol c depending on the subsequent measurements see sections 2 4 1 2 4 4 ozone in the kinetic experiments was quenched by either i indigo to quantify residual ozone ii maleic acid to quantify the edc or iii sulfite to quench ozone to quantify oh formation and to measure solution absorbance spectra control measurements are shown in table s3 2 2 1 quantification of the formation of oh during ozone depletion oh is formed by various pathways during ozone decomposition in water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the use of t buoh as oh quencher results in the formation of formaldehyde flyunt et al 2003 two moles of formaldehyde are formed from the reaction of 1 mol of oh with t buoh flyunt et al 2003 2 2 2 optical measurements absorbance spectra 200 600 nm were measured on uvikon 940 kontron instruments or varian cary 100 agilent technologies instruments in quartz cuvettes 1 and 5 cm path lengths the spectra were collected at least 2 h after addition of the oxidant kinetic experiments or after resting overnight ozone or 48 h chlorine to ensure that the oxidants were completely consumed fluorescence was collected in duplicate with a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba usa for ozonated or non ozonated samples fluorescence emission was collected between 300 and 700 nm at excitation wavelengths between 240 and 550 nm using a 0 25s integration time and a 5 nm bandpass spectra were corrected for inner filter effects and normalized to raman area at ex 350 nm in matlab fluorescence quantum yields were calculated using quinine sulfate in 0 05 m h2so4 as a reference based on a previously reported method cawley et al 2014 to confirm that measurements from ozone dosed samples prepared in the two involved laboratories resulted in identical conditions the respective absorbance spectra were compared this comparison indicated good agreement between the experimental protocols of the two laboratories figure s1 allowing for comparison of edc and fluorescence spectra collected in the first and second laboratory respectively 2 2 3 quantification of the edc by sec edc edc was quantified following the method described in detail elsewhere chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 in brief the method consists of size exclusion chromatography sec followed by a post column reaction pcr of dom with the radical cation of abts abts as a chemical oxidant which was pre formed by oxidation of abts with chlorine pinkernell et al 2000 the sec edc system leads to a molecular size fractionation of dom prior to its oxidation of electron donating moieties in the dom by abts the resulting reductive decolourization of abts absorbance maximum at 405 nm to abts no absorbance at 405 nm is then quantified by monitoring absorbance at this wavelength using a spectrophotometric flow through detector a more detailed description of the method is given in text s3 and in önnby et al 2018 2 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of formaldehyde was determined colorimetrically using the hantzsch reaction nash 1953 the quantified samples were in the concentration range of 5 200 μm with a quantification limit of 0 5 μm formaldehyde the obtained molar absorption coefficient at 412 nm of formaldehyde was 7207 m 1cm 1 reported concentrations were average values from triplicate measurements with a residual standard deviation rsd 5 the exact concentration of a commercial formaldehyde solution used as a calibration standard for the colometric method was determined by volumetric titration with sulfuric acid in a solution containing formaldehyde and sodium sulfite walker 1944 ozone depletion was followed by measuring the residual ozone concentration using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 briefly a 2 mm indigo solution and a 0 02 m phosphate buffer reagent was added and diluted prior to use by ensuring that indigo was present in a stoichiometric excess to ozone and measured at 600 nm in quartz cuvettes 1 and 5 cm path lengths chloroform formed during reaction of dom with hocl was quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms gc 8000 fisions with head space injection combi pal samples 5 ml were filled in 10 ml head space vials which were pre equilibrated at 80 c for 30 min prior to injection following a previous protocol shah et al 2015 haloacetic acids haas were measured using a capillary ion chromatography thermo dionex ics 4000 coupled to tandem mass spectrometry thermo tsq vantage with an injection volume of 100 μl shah et al 2015 more details about the two analytical methods for chloroform and haas quantification including method detection limits measuring ranges and rsd values are given in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of phenol concentrations the aromaticity for the chosen dom isolates was obtained from the ihss cf table s1 and a certain fraction of the aromatic units are phenolic moieties in this study we quantified the edc abatement for dom isolates treated with specific ozone doses between 0 05 and 0 15 mmol o3 mmol c a linear response in edc abatement edc edc0 as a function of the specific ozone dose was observed figure s2 the calculated edc abatement was then correlated with the previous relationship between edc and phenol aeschbacher et al 2012 according to text s5 table 1 summarizes the phenol content determined from edc measurements the aromaticity obtained from the ihss respectively and the nitrogen content for srfa nnom and plfa the quantified phenol contents based on edc measurements show a similar trend as the aromaticity from the ihss the quantified phenolic content for srfa and plfa were well correlated with the values for phenolic content given by ihss ihss 2017 it is observed that the phenol content decreased in the order srfa nnom plfa table 1 shows that the absolute edc of plfa is lower 2 43 mmol e g c compared to the edc of srfa or nnom respectively 5 98 and 4 16 mmol e g c aeschbacher et al 2012 3 2 ph dependence of the ozone consumption kinetics upon reaction with the three model dom isolates fig 1 shows the kinetics of the ozone depletion in solutions containing either srfa nnom or plfa as a function of ph in presence of t buoh to quench oh generally the rates of the ozone depletion decreased with decreasing ph which is a consequence of the lower reactivity of protonated organic moiteies with ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 at ph 2 ozone was still detectable after 3000s roughly 10 for srfa 20 for nnom and plfa overlapping data points of the initially added ozone for ph 3 less than 5 of the initially added ozone was detectable after 3000s of reaction with srfa and nnom whereas the ozone residual was still about 20 of the initially added ozone for plfa at ph 7 or 9 ozone depletion was significantly faster at ph 9 ozone was completely consumed within 60s of its addition to srfa and nnom solutions respectively and only 10 residual ozone was detected for plfa the pronounced decrease in ozone reactivity with increasing ph can be rationalized by dom moieties that undergo acid base speciation e g phenols and or amines these are typically less or non reactive in their neutral protonated forms which is the case at ph 2 lee and von gunten 2010 for example apparent second order rate constants for the reaction between ozone and phenol increases from 103 to 108 m 1s 1 when the ph is increased from ph 2 to 9 lee and von gunten 2010 for amines the apparent second order rate constants are very low for the protonated species whereas they are much higher between 104 and 106 m 1s 1 for neutral amines lee and von gunten 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 based on the higher phenolic aromatic and the lower nitrogen proportion of srfa and nnom compared to plfa table 1 we hypothesize that the observed increase in the ozone depletion rate with increasing ph was due to the reaction with deprotonated phenolic moieties in contrast plfa has lower phenol contents and more nitrogen containing moieties such as amines which are present in higher proportions 6 51 n table 1 and might play a certain role for the ph dependence of the slower observed ozone depletion kinetics in the plfa experiments to this end it was demonstrated in a recent study that the nitrate formation from amine moieties in plfa increased relative to the absorbance abatement phenolic moieties with increasing ph song et al 2017 this finding indicated that there was a higher contribution of nitrogen containing moiteies to the ozone consumption in plfa as compared to srfa regardless of similar concentrations of phenol and amine moieties phenolic moieties will always outcompete amines in the dom ozone interactions however due to the high amine reactivity at higher ph it will be difficult to resolve the two individual effects kinetically in batch type experiments with ozone 3 3 kinetics of edc edc0 abatement during oxidation figure s3 shows the kinetics of the relative edc edc edc0 abatement during ozonation of srfa nnom and plfa in the ph range 2 9 the decrease in edc edc0 during ozonation increased with increasing ph these results suggest that edc active sites react more efficiently at a higher ph which is in accordance with the faster ozone depletion discussed in section 3 2 based on the correlation of edc with dom phenolic content this result provides additional evidence for the importance of phenolic moieties in dom in the consumption of ozone by dom 3 4 kinetics of absorbance abatement during oxidation changes in absorbance spectra during ozonation of srfa nnom and plfa are shown in figures s4 s7 for experiments at ph 2 3 7 and 9 respectively the largest absorbance changes were observed over the wavelength range 220 280 nm although experiments at all phs showed a fast initial abatement in dom absorbance the abatement was strongly ph dependent at ph 2 and 3 the absorbance decreases occurred over the entire reaction time of 3000s figures s4 and s5 at ph 7 the absorbance abatement is significant for the initial 100s followed by a slower and gradual decrease until 1000s figure s6 for ph 9 the absorbance abatement occurred very rapidly after ozone addition with no further decrease in absorbance at longer reaction times figure s7 3 5 relationships between changes in edc and absorbance previous studies investigated the relationships between the relative abatements of edc and absorbance during dom chemical oxidation only at circumneutral ph chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 figs 2 a d show the relative abatement in both edc and absorbances during ozonation of srfa in the ph range 2 9 figures s8 and s9 show the analogous relationships for the same ph range for nnom and plfa absorbance at 254 nm and for srfa nnom and plfa absorbance at 280 nm respectively at low ph ozonation resulted in comparable relative decreases of edc and absorbance i e data close to the 1 1 line in figs 2a b by comparison at high ph the relative edc abatement increases compared to the relative absorbance abatement data to the left of the 1 1 line in figs 2c d the decrease in edc edc0 compared to the relative absorbance abatement with increasing ph may have resulted from a higher extent of benzoquinone formation from phenolic moieties at higher than lower ph mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 these benzoquinone moieties in the dom also absorb light at 254 nm and would therefore have led to a smaller decrease in the absorbance at 254 nm at high ph the formation of benzoquinones would thus be consistent with the observed shifts in the correlations edc edc0 vs a ao towards smaller decreases in absorbance values in these plots at lower ph the yield of benzoquinones from the phenol ozone reaction is smaller with a higher yield of ring opening products such as acetic formic and maleic acids with low uv absorbance ramseier and von gunten 2009 hence ozonation of dom at the low ph resulted in limited formation of uv absorbing moieties and thus a comparable relative decrease of the absorbance total aromatics and edc phenols a subset of the aromatic moieties consistent with this explanation the data collected for srfa nnom and plfa at low ph fell close to the 1 1 lines in figs 2 s8 and s9 to further elucidate the reasons for the observed correlations between the relative abatements of edc and absorbance changes in absorbance spectra were investigated for the reaction of ozone with phenol as a surrogate for phenolic moieties in the dom for these experiments we did not quantify edc for phenol as this low molecular weight compound will not be detectable in the sec edc set up due to its small molecular size figs 3 a c show the changes in absorbance spectra for the reactions between ozone 52 μm and phenol 34 μm yielding a similar molar ozone carbon ratio as in fig 2 0 25 1 0 absorbance spectra for reaction times of 0 and 60s are shown completion of the reaction in fig 3 for ph 2 3 and 7 fig 3b and c also include the spectra of 1 4 benzoquinone at ph 3 and ph 7 for comparison the added 1 4 benzoquinone concentrations in figs 3b and c are 10 μm for ph 3 and 21 μm for ph 7 respectively figs 3a c show that as the ph increased oxidation of phenol via ozone led to an enhanced formation of an absorbance peak centered at a maximum of about 252 nm the good agreement with the maximum absorbance at 252 nm suggest that 1 4 benzoquinone was formed in these experiments both at ph 3 and ph 7 this conclusion is supported by earlier studies which used hplc analyses to demonstrate that the ozonation of phenols results in 1 4 benzoquinone formation ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 based on the above mentioned concentrations of formed benzoquinone the calculated yields relative to the initial phenol concentration were 17 at ph 3 and 40 at ph 7 which is comparable to previous findings mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 in parallel with the development of an absorbance peak at 252 nm the absorbance at 272 nm increased at ph 7 while it decreased at ph 3 during ozonation of phenol compare figs 3b c these results suggest that phenolic polymerization products are possibly formed during ozonation of phenol at ph 7 giving rise to the absorbance increase at 272 nm overall the absorbance at 254 nm increases during ozonation of phenol at all ph values and under the experimental conditions used herein however the increase was smaller at lower ph values because phenols are only a subset of chromophores in dom the results obtained from phenol ozonation can only be applied to the ozonation of dom in a qualitative manner despite this limitation the overall trend of the dom experiments above where an increased absorbance peak was formed at 254 nm at high ph due to formation of 1 4 benzoquinone from phenolic moieties in dom can partially be explained by the smaller formation of uv absorbing moieties at lower ph overall a deviation from the 1 1 correlation figs 2c d is partially caused by the formation of benzoquinone type compounds which still absorb light but are more electron deficient and hence lead to an enhanced relative edc abatement compared to the absorbance 3 6 changes of fluorescence of dom during dom ozonation 3 6 1 changes in fluorescence intensity as a function of ozone dose and experimental ph in addition to evaluating the absorbance the changes in fluorescence were also considered fluorescence offers an additional tool to assess the contribution of different moieties of the dom towards the observed reactivity with ozone the fluorescence intensity of dom has previously been shown to decrease with increased ozone dose gerrity et al 2012 as an example oxidation of phenols and formation of benzoquinone should result in a decrease in fluorescence intensity due to the very weak fluorescence of benzoquinones ma et al 2010 the decrease is explained by destruction of chromophoric aromatic moieties swietlik and sikorska 2004 figure s10 shows that both the relative fluorescence intensity and the relative absorbances for srfa and plfa decreased with increasing specific ozone doses at ph 3 7 and 9 respectively overall the decrease in fluorescence was less pronounced compared to the loss in absorbance indicating that light absorbing moieties were more sensitive to ozone oxidation than fluorescent moieties see below 3 6 2 changes in fluorescence quantum yields of dom with increasing ozonation the de coupling of the absorbance and fluorescence responses to oxidation by ozone was further studied by measuring the fluorescence quantum yield φf the φf describes the probability of the excited singlet state within dom to be deactivated through fluorescence relative to non radiative pathways lakowicz 2006 φf was calculated as the integrated emission spectrum divided by the absorbance at a particular excitation wavelength cawley et al 2014 employing quinine sulfite as a reference the φf were investigated for ozonated srfa and plfa in the ph range 3 9 figure s11 shows how φf generally increase continuously with specific ozone doses for srfa and plfa at all ph values the extent of the observed φf increase depends on both the type of dom as well as the ph in contrast to plfa an induction period was apparent for srfa at ph 7 and 9 but not at ph 3 the values for φf did not significantly change compared to non ozonated dom up to a specific ozone dose of 0 05 mmol o3 mmol c figs 4 a and b show the relative changes in absorbance and φf at λ ex 350 nm relative to samples without ozonation for plfa and srfa as a function of the specific ozone dose or the relative residual edc respectively for plfa absorbance and φf respond immediately to changes in specific ozone doses fig 4a for srfa the φf increases more steadily as a function of the specific ozone dose or the relative edc abatement figs 4a and b it is worthwhile to consider these changes in φf with increasing ozone exposure in light of the charge transfer ct model for dom photophysics sharpless and blough 2014 benzoquinones are known not to fluoresce and it could be expected that a conversion of phenolic moieties to benzoquinones as a result of ozone dom reactions as discussed above would lead to lower φf additionally considering the ct model for fluorescence the overall quantum yield would decrease due to the loss of electron donors i e phenols thereby reducing the abundance of ct bands however a recent study suggests that ct interactions are not the main photophysical mechanism within dom and therefore the observed results should be considered in the context of individual compounds mckay et al 2018 the effect of ozone on both absorbance and fluorescence i e decrease in intensity while observing an increase in φf can be explained as follows ozone treatment of the dom resulted in the loss of both light absorbing and fluorescent moieties including phenols in the case of absorption the abatement of these moieties still leaves residual absorbance from the transformation products and the edc is reduced more efficiently due to the conversion of phenols into non electron donating moieties see discussion above the overall fluorescence intensity decreased as fluorescent moieties are removed by reaction with o3 the increase in φf can be explained by a model where absorbing moieties that are not fluoresceing are degraded faster than fluorescing moieties therefore the overall φf values increase for example electron poor aromatic moieties e g but not limited to hydroxy aromatic ketones aldehydes or acids may not be abated efficiently by ozone under the chosen experimental conditions due to their low second order rate constants in comparison to phenol von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fluorescence by these refractory components would be less diluted from absorbance by non fluorescing chromophores that have reacted with ozone overall this results in an increased φf for higher specific ozone doses these data indicate that a fraction of fluorophores within dom are not very reactive to ozone and the overall fraction of fluorescent moieties in dom is lower than for absorbance 3 7 oh radical formation from ozone dom reactions upon reaction of ozone with electron rich moieties of dom e g phenolic moieties amines etc oh can be formed by direct or indirect electron transfer reactions to ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 table s4 summarizes published oh yields for a range of compounds the oh yield amount of oh formed relative to consumed ozone for e g both phenol and catechol was found to be 24 at ph 7 nöthe et al 2009 the cumulative oh concentration was measured by formaldehyde formation during ozonation of srfa nnom and plfa in presence of t buoh as a oh scavenger under these conditions the stability of ozone is enhanced because chain reactions are suppressed staehelin and hoigné 1985 therefore these measurements correspond to the primary oh formation only and do not include chain reactions fig 5 shows the cumulative oh concentration as a function of time for srfa nnom plfa and phenol in the ph range of 2 9 data is shown for an ozone residual 10 of initial ozone addition in figure s12 the cumulative oh concentration is shown for longer reaction times generally the cumulative oh concentration increased during the first phase of the reaction whereafter it leveled off due to the depletion of the reactive moieties that lead directly to oh formation in absence of t buoh re formation of phenolic type and other oh forming moieties could be expected by the reaction of oh with aromatic sites nöthe et al 2009 however these reactions were suppressed under the applied experimental conditions because the ozone depletion was slow both at ph 2 and 3 the consumption of the sites leading to oh formation was slower and started to level off after 120s phenol was consumed in a relatively similar reaction time faster at ph 3 than at ph 2 for ph 3 this leads to an earlier termination of the phenol induced oh formation figs 5a and b at ph 7 the cumulative oh concentration increased intially very sharply the rate of depletion of the sites responsible for oh formation decreased in the order phenol srfa nnom plfa fig 5c at ph 9 the maximum cumulative oh concentration was observed at 15s for both srfa and nnom whereas for plfa it gradually increased until 90s fig 5d the cumulative oh formation can be compared with the ozone depletion kinetics in fig 1 an initial drop in ozone depletion shown at 120s ph 2 and 3 and at 90 and 15s ph 7 and 9 respectively corresponded to time points in fig 5 where the cumulative oh formation leveled off these observations can be explained by the reactions between ozone and phenolic moieties consuming ozone instantly fig 1 and yielding oh radicals fig 5 table 2 shows the oh yields maximum oh concentration observed normalized to the ozone dose as a function of the ph for srfa nnom plfa and phenol respectively and for a complete depletion of ozone at ph 2 the oh yields are 6 7 12 4 and 13 6 for srfa nnom or plfa respectively the yields observed at ph 3 7 3 14 2 9 6 for srfa nnom or plfa respectively were all in reasonable agreement with the obtained yields for phenol at ph 2 and 3 at ph 7 the oh yields were 27 30 5 or 21 for srfa nnom or plfa respectively and at ph 9 they were about 33 7 and 38 6 for srfa and nnom whereas for plfa it was 28 5 hence overall the oh yields increase with increasing ph this is in agreement with the higher oh yields for phenol at ph 7 37 5 than at the lower phs compared to a previous study the yields in this study were higher compare 24 obtained before with 28 obtained in this study table s4 flyunt et al 2003 at ph 7 and 9 the observed oh yields for nnom srfa and plfa were quite similar the trend for these yields are similar to the estimated phenol content of the respective dom isolate table 1 however it could be expected that nnom which only has about 70 of the phenol content of srfa compare 2 05 nnom with 2 86 mmol phenol g c srfa respectively table 1 should have a smaller oh yield for the same ozonation conditions in the case of plfa 1 77 mmol phenol g c the oh yield corresponded to about 80 of the oh yield of srfa the relatively high oh yield for plfa could be due to the higher content of amine containing moieties which may also be important sources for an indirect oh formation via a superoxide radical induced pathway buffle and von gunten 2006 figure s13 shows a correlation between the relative edc abatement and the cumulative oh yields for srfa nnom and plfa in the ph range 2 9 it is shown that the oh yields are within certain limits proportional to the relative edc abatement for all dom types in summary the results show that the oh yields from ozone dom interactions significantly increase with increasing ph amine moieties may partly explain this trend mvula and von sonntag 2003 3 8 effect of chlorination on edc abatement 3 8 1 changes in edc as a function of the specific chlorine doses we determined the changes in edc and absorbance 254 and 280 nm of srfa nnom and plfa as a function of an increasing chlorine dose at ph 7 figure s14 for all dom isolates the relative abatement of edc is significantly more enhanced compared to the loss in the relative absorbance in comparison to the ozonation experiments compare figure s14 with fig 2 and figures s8 s9 this is consistent with previous findings wenk et al 2013 and has been explained by the formation of chlorinated phenolic moieties which still have a significant uv absorbance while being less redox active criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 wenk et al 2013 to this end table s5 shows the molar absorption coefficients ε of the expected chlorinated reaction products gallard and von gunten 2002 lee and morris 1962 at 254 or 280 nm respectively which were determined from the uv vis spectra in this study figure s15 despite the unknown product distribution during chlorination a strong absorbance can be expected because most molar absorption coefficients ε 254 or ε 280nm are 2000 m 1cm 1 table s5 compared to phenols chlorophenols react more slowly with chlorine to form non absorbing products deborde and von gunten 2008 and because chlorophenols have significant uv absorbances the slopes in plots of the relative abatements of edc versus uv absorbance are 1 3 8 2 edc abatement and correlation with chloroform formation during chlorination phenols and other activated aromatic moieties such as resorcinol norwood et al 1980 rebenne et al 1996 rook 1977 theruvathu et al 2001 but also β diketo acid type moieties and β diketones dickenson et al 2008 can serve as precursors for trihalomethanes thms e g chloroform formation as discussed above the same activated aromatic compounds such as hydoxybenzenes react readily with ozone hoigné and bader 1983 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as hydroxybenzenes including phenol resorcinol moieties also play an important role for the edc the effect of edc abatement on thm formation was assessed to change the edc pre ozonation experiments were performed to abate edc to up to 95 in srfa chloroform and haas were then measured after post chlorination of these samples fig 6 shows the chloroform formation during post chlorination as a function of the relative edc abatement in most experiments except 40 μm hocl fig 6a a pronounced decrease in chloroform formation was observed only for the pre ozonated samples with a relative edc of 50 similar observations were also apparent for the formation of the haloacetic acids monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa or trichloroacetic acid tcaa figure s16 once an abatement of edc of about 50 was reached the chcl3 formation decreased this threshold was reached earlier for a higher chlorine dose 40 μm because under these conditions chloroform formation was precursor limited and small changes in precursor concentrations led to a decrease in contrast for smaller chlorine doses 25 μm this effect was no longer visible until a threshold edc abatement was reached because of the excess of precursors relative to chlorine in agreement to the current observations no effect on dbp formation chloroform tcaa and adsorbable organic chlorine could be observed from a dbp formation potential test during chlorination after 10 40 edc abatement by ozone in a previous study de vera et al 2017a therefore the above mentioned results might be explained by a low extent of precursor abatement during pre ozonation for low relative edc abatements the presence of t buoh during pre ozonation blocks hydroxyl radical oxidation but also leads to a higher ozone stability and hence a higher ozone exposures compared to the absence of a scavenger the higher exposure may affect the chloroform formation during post chlorination as demonstrated in a previous study in which an identical ozone dose was applied with and without t buoh de vera et al 2015 in contrast to these previous observations the results obtained in presence and absence of t buoh are very similar in the current study figs 6a and b based on these results we conclude that oh only has a limited effect on chloroform formation during post chlorination similar conclusions can be drawn from the formation of haas in presence and absence of t buoh figure s16 4 conclusions based on results from ozone dom interactions in the ph range 2 9 and chlorine dom interactions at ph 7 it can be concluded that phenolic moiteies play a dominant role for the dom reactivity the ozone depletion kinetics during ozonation of dom was greatly affected by changes in degree of protonation the ozone depletion kinetics increased in the ph range 2 9 which could be explained by an important contribution of phenolic moieties in the dom the ph dependence of edc absorbance correlations during i ozonation indicate a higher benzoquinone yield from the dom oxidation at higher ph which is in agreement with results from ozone phenol reactions ii for chlorine a more efficient edc abatement as compared to absorbance was observed and could be explained by formation of strongly uv absorbing mono di and or trichlorophenols which are not oxidized by the abts radical cation the fluorescence intensity decreased during ozonation while an increase in fluorescence quantum yield φf was observed the increase in φf could not be explained by benzoquinone formation it is suggested to take place due to the fast abatement of phenolic moieties relative to fluorophores with low ozone reactivity during ozonation increasing oh yields were observed with increasing ph 2 9 as a result of the higher amine reactivity at higher ph the relative abatement of edc by pre ozonation did not influence the chloroform chloroacetic acids formation during post chlorination for relative edc abatements 50 as long as the chloroform chloroacetic acids formation is not precursor limited for edc abatements 50 the chloroform chloroacetic acids from post chlorination decrease was strongly correlated with the ozone induced edc abatement acknowledgements lö acknowledges the swedish research council vr grant number 2014 6839 for financial support gm and fro ackknowledge support

19350,oxidation processes are impacted by the type concentration and reactivity of the dissolved organic matter dom in this study the reactions between various types of dom suwannee river fulvic acid srfa nordic reservoir nom nnom and pony lake fulvic acid plfa and two oxidants ozone and chlorine were studied in the ph range 2 9 by using a combination of optical measurements and electron donating capacities the relationships between residual electron donating capacity edc and residual absorbance showed a strong ph dependence for the ozone dom reactions with phenolic functional groups being the main reacting moieties relative edc and absorbance abatements uv254 or uv280 were similar at ph 2 at ph 7 or 9 the relative abatement of edc was more pronounced than for absorbance which could be explained by the formation of uv absorbing products such as benzoquinone from the transformation of phenolic moieties an increase in fluorescence abatement with increasing ph was also observed during ozonation the increase in fluorescence quantum yields could not be attributed to formation of benzoquinone but related to a faster abatement of phenolic moieties relative to fluorophores with low ozone reactivity the overall oh yields as a result of dom induced ozone consumption increased significantly with increasing ph which could be related to the higher reactivity of phenolic moieties at higher ph the oh yields for srfa and plfa were proportional to the phenolic contents whereas for nnom the oh yield was about 30 higher during chlorination of dom at ph 7 an efficient relative edc abatement was observed whereas the relative absorbance abatement was much less pronounced this is due to the formation of chlorophenolic moieties which exert a significant absorbance and partly lose their electron donating capacity pre ozonation of srfa leads to a decrease of chloroform and haloacetic acid formation however only after a threshold of 50 abatement of the edc and under conditions which are not precursor limited the decrease in chloroform and haloacetic acid formation after the threshold edc abatement was proportional to the relative residual edc graphical abstract image 1

low molecular weight organic acids huber et al 2011 leenheer and croue 2003 in water treatment dom is typically characterized by measurements of concentration dissolved organic carbon doc and or optical properties absorbance or fluorescence absorbance has been used as a surrogate for dom concentration and as a process control parameter for the oxidation of organic contaminants in water and wastewater treatment gerrity et al 2012 wittmer et al 2015 dom is often characterized by the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm suva254 uv absorbance divided by the doc a surrogate for dom aromaticity weishaar et al 2003 over the last years the use of dom fluorescence measurements has become more common these measurements were used to quantify both dom concentration and character in natural and engineered systems gerrity et al 2012 osburn et al 2012 stedmon et al 2003 1 2 role and change of the dom in oxidative water treatment processes during oxidative processes e g application of ozone or chlorine dom is the main sink for the added oxidants specific functional groups within the dom e g poly phenols amines olefins anilines etc are susceptible to chemical modifications during exposure of the dom to oxidants lee and von gunten 2010 the reactivities and concentrations of such moieties in the dom determine the extent of the dom oxidant interactions and their effects on the targeted oxidation disinfection processes lee and von gunten 2010 some understanding of the reactions between the oxidants and dom can be gained by considering reaction rate constants between a specific oxidant and known dom moieties for example the apparent second order rate constant for the reaction between ozone and phenol is on the order of 106 m 1s 1 at ph 7 whereas for chlorine hocl it is 20 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002 given that the aromaticity i e average proportion of aromatic moieties including phenolic moieties to the total carbon varies between 12 and 22 for dom isolates a phenol concentration of approximately 2 10 6 m can be estimated for a 1 mg c l solution of srfa this suggests that an equimolar concentration of ozone will be consumed within seconds whereas the hocl consumption will take about 5 h changes in selected physicochemical properties of dom during its reaction between ozone or hocl are well characterized for example the overall absorbance and fluorescence intensities decrease with increasing extent of chemical oxidation gerrity et al 2012 concomitantly the reaction of the oxidants with dom result in the formation of disinfection by products dbps lee et al 2007 mitch and sedlak 2002 von gunten 2003 and also changes in the redox properties of the dom wenk et al 2013 depending on the oxidant applied different types of dbps can be formed primary products from the attack of phenolic compounds by ozone are benzoquinones catchechols muconic acids etc mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 which can be further oxidized to aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids hammes et al 2006 for chlorination primary products from phenolic moieties are chlorophenols which are then further transformed to trihalomethanes e g chloroform or haloacetic acids gallard and von gunten 2002 ge et al 2014 in addition both ozone and chlorine can react with amines forming e g nitroso and nitro compounds or n oxides or organic and inorganic halamines respectively de vera et al 2017b heeb et al 2017 mccurry et al 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 1 3 characterizing the redox properties of the dom and assessing dbps formation recently there has been a growing interest in the electrochemical properties of dom in water treatment applications a method based on mediated electrochemical oxidation employing abts the one electron oxidation product of abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulphonicacid as an electron transfer mediator to facilitate electron transfer from oxidizable moieties in the dom to the working electrode of the electrochemical cell aeschbacher et al 2010 the outcome of this measurement is the so called electron donating capacity edc a further development of this method involved automation by implementing flow injection analysis to monitor the reduction of abts to abts by dom chronoamperometrically in an electrochemical flow cell walpen et al 2016 in another study edc was measured employing size exclusion chromatography for dom size separation followed by the same approach involving abts for edc quantification by a post column reaction and spectrophotometric analysis of the decolourization of abts to abts chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 edc measurements allow for an assessment of the redox properties or the antioxidant capacity of the dom aeschbacher et al 2010 known electron donating moieties of the dom include phenols such as mono and poly hydroxylated benzene rings amines aniline sulfur or olefinic moieties previous work has shown that the edc values of ten dom isolates were positively correlated with their titrated phenol contents strongly suggesting that phenolic moieties of the dom are major contributors to the edc of dom samples aeschbacher et al 2012 taken together the extent of the oxidant consumption and the formation of dbps from the oxidant dom reactions depend on the concentrations and types of the reactive moieties in dom combined edc and absorbance measurements have advanced the understanding of the dom ozone and the dom chlorine reactions wenk et al 2013 including the effects on micropollutant abatement chon et al 2015 de vera et al 2017a the main objective of this paper is to advance our understanding of the reactions between oxidants ozone and chlorine and dom to investigate changes in the dom during oxidation changes in edc and optical properties absorbance and fluorescence were assessed at various ph values for dosage and kinetic experiments furthermore the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh was investigated during ozonation of dom finally the formation of chloroform and chloroacetic acids without or with pre ozonation followed by chlorination was measured and related to the abatement of the edc 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals natural organic matter isolates preparation of solutions a list of the chemicals and standards used in this study

international humic substances society ihss details are given in table s1 the type and composition of all solutions used in this study including preparation details are provided in text s2 and table s2 2 2 oxidation experiments ozonation was performed as dosage experiments 50 ml or kinetic experiments 5 250 ml in absence or in presence of 100 mm t buoh as a hydroxyl radical oh scavenger staehelin and hoigné 1985 control experiments showed that the added t buoh did not interfere with absorbance measurements at 254 nm nor with the quantification of the edc table s3 for ozone dosage experiments samples that had been ozonated were stored at room temperature overnight to ensure complete ozone depletion for kinetic experiments 5 ml samples were collected using a dispenser system hoigné and bader 1994 and immediately quenched by various quenchers see below at pre determined reaction times up to 3000s samples corresponding to 5 10 and 15s were obtained from separate experiments performed in 15 ml glass vials with a 5 ml reaction volume and direct quenching see below chlorine dosage experiments were performed with 40 ml samples after chlorine addition the samples were stored for 48 h at room temperature for complete depletion of chlorine the samples were stored in the dark to avoid photo decomposition of chlorine nowell and hoigné 1992 in dosage experiments specific ozone doses of 0 0 5 mmol o3 mmol c or specific chlorine doses of 0 0 2 mmol hocl mmol c were applied the specific oxidant doses lie within the typical range applied in water and wastewater treatment of bourgin et al 2018 garcia villanova et al 1997 zimmermann et al 2011 for some selected experiments srfa was pre ozonated with higher specific ozone doses than above 0 2 0 mmol o3 mmol c to obtain an edc abatement of up to 95 thereafter the samples were treated with the above specific chlorine doses to follow the conventional treatment step undertaken at water treatment plants with pre ozonation and post chlorination kinetic ozone experiments were performed with a specific ozone dose of 0 25 mmol o3 mmol c depending on the subsequent measurements see sections 2 4 1 2 4 4 ozone in the kinetic experiments was quenched by either i indigo to quantify residual ozone ii maleic acid to quantify the edc or iii sulfite to quench ozone to quantify oh formation and to measure solution absorbance spectra control measurements are shown in table s3 2 2 1 quantification of the formation of oh during ozone depletion oh is formed by various pathways during ozone decomposition in water von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the use of t buoh as oh quencher results in the formation of formaldehyde flyunt et al 2003 two moles of formaldehyde are formed from the reaction of 1 mol of oh with t buoh flyunt et al 2003 2 2 2 optical measurements absorbance spectra 200 600 nm were measured on uvikon 940 kontron instruments or varian cary 100 agilent technologies instruments in quartz cuvettes 1 and 5 cm path lengths the spectra were collected at least 2 h after addition of the oxidant kinetic experiments or after resting overnight ozone or 48 h chlorine to ensure that the oxidants were completely consumed fluorescence was collected in duplicate with a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba usa for ozonated or non ozonated samples fluorescence emission was collected between 300 and 700 nm at excitation wavelengths between 240 and 550 nm using a 0 25s integration time and a 5 nm bandpass spectra were corrected for inner filter effects and normalized to raman area at ex 350 nm in matlab fluorescence quantum yields were calculated using quinine sulfate in 0 05 m h2so4 as a reference based on a previously reported method cawley et al 2014 to confirm that measurements from ozone dosed samples prepared in the two involved laboratories resulted in identical conditions the respective absorbance spectra were compared this comparison indicated good agreement between the experimental protocols of the two laboratories figure s1 allowing for comparison of edc and fluorescence spectra collected in the first and second laboratory respectively 2 2 3 quantification of the edc by sec edc edc was quantified following the method described in detail elsewhere chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 in brief the method consists of size exclusion chromatography sec followed by a post column reaction pcr of dom with the radical cation of abts abts as a chemical oxidant which was pre formed by oxidation of abts with chlorine pinkernell et al 2000 the sec edc system leads to a molecular size fractionation of dom prior to its oxidation of electron donating moieties in the dom by abts the resulting reductive decolourization of abts absorbance maximum at 405 nm to abts no absorbance at 405 nm is then quantified by monitoring absorbance at this wavelength using a spectrophotometric flow through detector a more detailed description of the method is given in text s3 and in önnby et al 2018 2 2 4 analytical methods the concentration of formaldehyde was determined colorimetrically using the hantzsch reaction nash 1953 the quantified samples were in the concentration range of 5 200 μm with a quantification limit of 0 5 μm formaldehyde the obtained molar absorption coefficient at 412 nm of formaldehyde was 7207 m 1cm 1 reported concentrations were average values from triplicate measurements with a residual standard deviation rsd 5 the exact concentration of a commercial formaldehyde solution used as a calibration standard for the colometric method was determined by volumetric titration with sulfuric acid in a solution containing formaldehyde and sodium sulfite walker 1944 ozone depletion was followed by measuring the residual ozone concentration using the indigo method bader and hoigné 1981 briefly a 2 mm indigo solution and a 0 02 m phosphate buffer reagent was added and diluted prior to use by ensuring that indigo was present in a stoichiometric excess to ozone and measured at 600 nm in quartz cuvettes 1 and 5 cm path lengths chloroform formed during reaction of dom with hocl was quantified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms gc 8000 fisions with head space injection combi pal samples 5 ml were filled in 10 ml head space vials which were pre equilibrated at 80 c for 30 min prior to injection following a previous protocol shah et al 2015 haloacetic acids haas were measured using a capillary ion chromatography thermo dionex ics 4000 coupled to tandem mass spectrometry thermo tsq vantage with an injection volume of 100 μl shah et al 2015 more details about the two analytical methods for chloroform and haas quantification including method detection limits measuring ranges and rsd values are given in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 estimation of phenol concentrations the aromaticity for the chosen dom isolates was obtained from the ihss cf table s1 and a certain fraction of the aromatic units are phenolic moieties in this study we quantified the edc abatement for dom isolates treated with specific ozone doses between 0 05 and 0 15 mmol o3 mmol c a linear response in edc abatement edc edc0 as a function of the specific ozone dose was observed figure s2 the calculated edc abatement was then correlated with the previous relationship between edc and phenol aeschbacher et al 2012 according to text s5 table 1 summarizes the phenol content determined from edc measurements the aromaticity obtained from the ihss respectively and the nitrogen content for srfa nnom and plfa the quantified phenol contents based on edc measurements show a similar trend as the aromaticity from the ihss the quantified phenolic content for srfa and plfa were well correlated with the values for phenolic content given by ihss ihss 2017 it is observed that the phenol content decreased in the order srfa nnom plfa table 1 shows that the absolute edc of plfa is lower 2 43 mmol e g c compared to the edc of srfa or nnom respectively 5 98 and 4 16 mmol e g c aeschbacher et al 2012 3 2 ph dependence of the ozone consumption kinetics upon reaction with the three model dom isolates fig 1 shows the kinetics of the ozone depletion in solutions containing either srfa nnom or plfa as a function of ph in presence of t buoh to quench oh generally the rates of the ozone depletion decreased with decreasing ph which is a consequence of the lower reactivity of protonated organic moiteies with ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 at ph 2 ozone was still detectable after 3000s roughly 10 for srfa 20 for nnom and plfa overlapping data points of the initially added ozone for ph 3 less than 5 of the initially added ozone was detectable after 3000s of reaction with srfa and nnom whereas the ozone residual was still about 20 of the initially added ozone for plfa at ph 7 or 9 ozone depletion was significantly faster at ph 9 ozone was completely consumed within 60s of its addition to srfa and nnom solutions respectively and only 10 residual ozone was detected for plfa the pronounced decrease in ozone reactivity with increasing ph can be rationalized by dom moieties that undergo acid base speciation e g phenols and or amines these are typically less or non reactive in their neutral protonated forms which is the case at ph 2 lee and von gunten 2010 for example apparent second order rate constants for the reaction between ozone and phenol increases from 103 to 108 m 1s 1 when the ph is increased from ph 2 to 9 lee and von gunten 2010 for amines the apparent second order rate constants are very low for the protonated species whereas they are much higher between 104 and 106 m 1s 1 for neutral amines lee and von gunten 2016 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 based on the higher phenolic aromatic and the lower nitrogen proportion of srfa and nnom compared to plfa table 1 we hypothesize that the observed increase in the ozone depletion rate with increasing ph was due to the reaction with deprotonated phenolic moieties in contrast plfa has lower phenol contents and more nitrogen containing moieties such as amines which are present in higher proportions 6 51 n table 1 and might play a certain role for the ph dependence of the slower observed ozone depletion kinetics in the plfa experiments to this end it was demonstrated in a recent study that the nitrate formation from amine moieties in plfa increased relative to the absorbance abatement phenolic moieties with increasing ph song et al 2017 this finding indicated that there was a higher contribution of nitrogen containing moiteies to the ozone consumption in plfa as compared to srfa regardless of similar concentrations of phenol and amine moieties phenolic moieties will always outcompete amines in the dom ozone interactions however due to the high amine reactivity at higher ph it will be difficult to resolve the two individual effects kinetically in batch type experiments with ozone 3 3 kinetics of edc edc0 abatement during oxidation figure s3 shows the kinetics of the relative edc edc edc0 abatement during ozonation of srfa nnom and plfa in the ph range 2 9 the decrease in edc edc0 during ozonation increased with increasing ph these results suggest that edc active sites react more efficiently at a higher ph which is in accordance with the faster ozone depletion discussed in section 3 2 based on the correlation of edc with dom phenolic content this result provides additional evidence for the importance of phenolic moieties in dom in the consumption of ozone by dom 3 4 kinetics of absorbance abatement during oxidation changes in absorbance spectra during ozonation of srfa nnom and plfa are shown in figures s4 s7 for experiments at ph 2 3 7 and 9 respectively the largest absorbance changes were observed over the wavelength range 220 280 nm although experiments at all phs showed a fast initial abatement in dom absorbance the abatement was strongly ph dependent at ph 2 and 3 the absorbance decreases occurred over the entire reaction time of 3000s figures s4 and s5 at ph 7 the absorbance abatement is significant for the initial 100s followed by a slower and gradual decrease until 1000s figure s6 for ph 9 the absorbance abatement occurred very rapidly after ozone addition with no further decrease in absorbance at longer reaction times figure s7 3 5 relationships between changes in edc and absorbance previous studies investigated the relationships between the relative abatements of edc and absorbance during dom chemical oxidation only at circumneutral ph chon et al 2015 önnby et al 2018 wenk et al 2013 figs 2 a d show the relative abatement in both edc and absorbances during ozonation of srfa in the ph range 2 9 figures s8 and s9 show the analogous relationships for the same ph range for nnom and plfa absorbance at 254 nm and for srfa nnom and plfa absorbance at 280 nm respectively at low ph ozonation resulted in comparable relative decreases of edc and absorbance i e data close to the 1 1 line in figs 2a b by comparison at high ph the relative edc abatement increases compared to the relative absorbance abatement data to the left of the 1 1 line in figs 2c d the decrease in edc edc0 compared to the relative absorbance abatement with increasing ph may have resulted from a higher extent of benzoquinone formation from phenolic moieties at higher than lower ph mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 these benzoquinone moieties in the dom also absorb light at 254 nm and would therefore have led to a smaller decrease in the absorbance at 254 nm at high ph the formation of benzoquinones would thus be consistent with the observed shifts in the correlations edc edc0 vs a ao towards smaller decreases in absorbance values in these plots at lower ph the yield of benzoquinones from the phenol ozone reaction is smaller with a higher yield of ring opening products such as acetic formic and maleic acids with low uv absorbance ramseier and von gunten 2009 hence ozonation of dom at the low ph resulted in limited formation of uv absorbing moieties and thus a comparable relative decrease of the absorbance total aromatics and edc phenols a subset of the aromatic moieties consistent with this explanation the data collected for srfa nnom and plfa at low ph fell close to the 1 1 lines in figs 2 s8 and s9 to further elucidate the reasons for the observed correlations between the relative abatements of edc and absorbance changes in absorbance spectra were investigated for the reaction of ozone with phenol as a surrogate for phenolic moieties in the dom for these experiments we did not quantify edc for phenol as this low molecular weight compound will not be detectable in the sec edc set up due to its small molecular size figs 3 a c show the changes in absorbance spectra for the reactions between ozone 52 μm and phenol 34 μm yielding a similar molar ozone carbon ratio as in fig 2 0 25 1 0 absorbance spectra for reaction times of 0 and 60s are shown completion of the reaction in fig 3 for ph 2 3 and 7 fig 3b and c also include the spectra of 1 4 benzoquinone at ph 3 and ph 7 for comparison the added 1 4 benzoquinone concentrations in figs 3b and c are 10 μm for ph 3 and 21 μm for ph 7 respectively figs 3a c show that as the ph increased oxidation of phenol via ozone led to an enhanced formation of an absorbance peak centered at a maximum of about 252 nm the good agreement with the maximum absorbance at 252 nm suggest that 1 4 benzoquinone was formed in these experiments both at ph 3 and ph 7 this conclusion is supported by earlier studies which used hplc analyses to demonstrate that the ozonation of phenols results in 1 4 benzoquinone formation ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 based on the above mentioned concentrations of formed benzoquinone the calculated yields relative to the initial phenol concentration were 17 at ph 3 and 40 at ph 7 which is comparable to previous findings mvula and von sonntag 2003 ramseier and von gunten 2009 tentscher et al 2018 in parallel with the development of an absorbance peak at 252 nm the absorbance at 272 nm increased at ph 7 while it decreased at ph 3 during ozonation of phenol compare figs 3b c these results suggest that phenolic polymerization products are possibly formed during ozonation of phenol at ph 7 giving rise to the absorbance increase at 272 nm overall the absorbance at 254 nm increases during ozonation of phenol at all ph values and under the experimental conditions used herein however the increase was smaller at lower ph values because phenols are only a subset of chromophores in dom the results obtained from phenol ozonation can only be applied to the ozonation of dom in a qualitative manner despite this limitation the overall trend of the dom experiments above where an increased absorbance peak was formed at 254 nm at high ph due to formation of 1 4 benzoquinone from phenolic moieties in dom can partially be explained by the smaller formation of uv absorbing moieties at lower ph overall a deviation from the 1 1 correlation figs 2c d is partially caused by the formation of benzoquinone type compounds which still absorb light but are more electron deficient and hence lead to an enhanced relative edc abatement compared to the absorbance 3 6 changes of fluorescence of dom during dom ozonation 3 6 1 changes in fluorescence intensity as a function of ozone dose and experimental ph in addition to evaluating the absorbance the changes in fluorescence were also considered fluorescence offers an additional tool to assess the contribution of different moieties of the dom towards the observed reactivity with ozone the fluorescence intensity of dom has previously been shown to decrease with increased ozone dose gerrity et al 2012 as an example oxidation of phenols and formation of benzoquinone should result in a decrease in fluorescence intensity due to the very weak fluorescence of benzoquinones ma et al 2010 the decrease is explained by destruction of chromophoric aromatic moieties swietlik and sikorska 2004 figure s10 shows that both the relative fluorescence intensity and the relative absorbances for srfa and plfa decreased with increasing specific ozone doses at ph 3 7 and 9 respectively overall the decrease in fluorescence was less pronounced compared to the loss in absorbance indicating that light absorbing moieties were more sensitive to ozone oxidation than fluorescent moieties see below 3 6 2 changes in fluorescence quantum yields of dom with increasing ozonation the de coupling of the absorbance and fluorescence responses to oxidation by ozone was further studied by measuring the fluorescence quantum yield φf the φf describes the probability of the excited singlet state within dom to be deactivated through fluorescence relative to non radiative pathways lakowicz 2006 φf was calculated as the integrated emission spectrum divided by the absorbance at a particular excitation wavelength cawley et al 2014 employing quinine sulfite as a reference the φf were investigated for ozonated srfa and plfa in the ph range 3 9 figure s11 shows how φf generally increase continuously with specific ozone doses for srfa and plfa at all ph values the extent of the observed φf increase depends on both the type of dom as well as the ph in contrast to plfa an induction period was apparent for srfa at ph 7 and 9 but not at ph 3 the values for φf did not significantly change compared to non ozonated dom up to a specific ozone dose of 0 05 mmol o3 mmol c figs 4 a and b show the relative changes in absorbance and φf at λ ex 350 nm relative to samples without ozonation for plfa and srfa as a function of the specific ozone dose or the relative residual edc respectively for plfa absorbance and φf respond immediately to changes in specific ozone doses fig 4a for srfa the φf increases more steadily as a function of the specific ozone dose or the relative edc abatement figs 4a and b it is worthwhile to consider these changes in φf with increasing ozone exposure in light of the charge transfer ct model for dom photophysics sharpless and blough 2014 benzoquinones are known not to fluoresce and it could be expected that a conversion of phenolic moieties to benzoquinones as a result of ozone dom reactions as discussed above would lead to lower φf additionally considering the ct model for fluorescence the overall quantum yield would decrease due to the loss of electron donors i e phenols thereby reducing the abundance of ct bands however a recent study suggests that ct interactions are not the main photophysical mechanism within dom and therefore the observed results should be considered in the context of individual compounds mckay et al 2018 the effect of ozone on both absorbance and fluorescence i e decrease in intensity while observing an increase in φf can be explained as follows ozone treatment of the dom resulted in the loss of both light absorbing and fluorescent moieties including phenols in the case of absorption the abatement of these moieties still leaves residual absorbance from the transformation products and the edc is reduced more efficiently due to the conversion of phenols into non electron donating moieties see discussion above the overall fluorescence intensity decreased as fluorescent moieties are removed by reaction with o3 the increase in φf can be explained by a model where absorbing moieties that are not fluoresceing are degraded faster than fluorescing moieties therefore the overall φf values increase for example electron poor aromatic moieties e g but not limited to hydroxy aromatic ketones aldehydes or acids may not be abated efficiently by ozone under the chosen experimental conditions due to their low second order rate constants in comparison to phenol von sonntag and von gunten 2012 fluorescence by these refractory components would be less diluted from absorbance by non fluorescing chromophores that have reacted with ozone overall this results in an increased φf for higher specific ozone doses these data indicate that a fraction of fluorophores within dom are not very reactive to ozone and the overall fraction of fluorescent moieties in dom is lower than for absorbance 3 7 oh radical formation from ozone dom reactions upon reaction of ozone with electron rich moieties of dom e g phenolic moieties amines etc oh can be formed by direct or indirect electron transfer reactions to ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 table s4 summarizes published oh yields for a range of compounds the oh yield amount of oh formed relative to consumed ozone for e g both phenol and catechol was found to be 24 at ph 7 nöthe et al 2009 the cumulative oh concentration was measured by formaldehyde formation during ozonation of srfa nnom and plfa in presence of t buoh as a oh scavenger under these conditions the stability of ozone is enhanced because chain reactions are suppressed staehelin and hoigné 1985 therefore these measurements correspond to the primary oh formation only and do not include chain reactions fig 5 shows the cumulative oh concentration as a function of time for srfa nnom plfa and phenol in the ph range of 2 9 data is shown for an ozone residual 10 of initial ozone addition in figure s12 the cumulative oh concentration is shown for longer reaction times generally the cumulative oh concentration increased during the first phase of the reaction whereafter it leveled off due to the depletion of the reactive moieties that lead directly to oh formation in absence of t buoh re formation of phenolic type and other oh forming moieties could be expected by the reaction of oh with aromatic sites nöthe et al 2009 however these reactions were suppressed under the applied experimental conditions because the ozone depletion was slow both at ph 2 and 3 the consumption of the sites leading to oh formation was slower and started to level off after 120s phenol was consumed in a relatively similar reaction time faster at ph 3 than at ph 2 for ph 3 this leads to an earlier termination of the phenol induced oh formation figs 5a and b at ph 7 the cumulative oh concentration increased intially very sharply the rate of depletion of the sites responsible for oh formation decreased in the order phenol srfa nnom plfa fig 5c at ph 9 the maximum cumulative oh concentration was observed at 15s for both srfa and nnom whereas for plfa it gradually increased until 90s fig 5d the cumulative oh formation can be compared with the ozone depletion kinetics in fig 1 an initial drop in ozone depletion shown at 120s ph 2 and 3 and at 90 and 15s ph 7 and 9 respectively corresponded to time points in fig 5 where the cumulative oh formation leveled off these observations can be explained by the reactions between ozone and phenolic moieties consuming ozone instantly fig 1 and yielding oh radicals fig 5 table 2 shows the oh yields maximum oh concentration observed normalized to the ozone dose as a function of the ph for srfa nnom plfa and phenol respectively and for a complete depletion of ozone at ph 2 the oh yields are 6 7 12 4 and 13 6 for srfa nnom or plfa respectively the yields observed at ph 3 7 3 14 2 9 6 for srfa nnom or plfa respectively were all in reasonable agreement with the obtained yields for phenol at ph 2 and 3 at ph 7 the oh yields were 27 30 5 or 21 for srfa nnom or plfa respectively and at ph 9 they were about 33 7 and 38 6 for srfa and nnom whereas for plfa it was 28 5 hence overall the oh yields increase with increasing ph this is in agreement with the higher oh yields for phenol at ph 7 37 5 than at the lower phs compared to a previous study the yields in this study were higher compare 24 obtained before with 28 obtained in this study table s4 flyunt et al 2003 at ph 7 and 9 the observed oh yields for nnom srfa and plfa were quite similar the trend for these yields are similar to the estimated phenol content of the respective dom isolate table 1 however it could be expected that nnom which only has about 70 of the phenol content of srfa compare 2 05 nnom with 2 86 mmol phenol g c srfa respectively table 1 should have a smaller oh yield for the same ozonation conditions in the case of plfa 1 77 mmol phenol g c the oh yield corresponded to about 80 of the oh yield of srfa the relatively high oh yield for plfa could be due to the higher content of amine containing moieties which may also be important sources for an indirect oh formation via a superoxide radical induced pathway buffle and von gunten 2006 figure s13 shows a correlation between the relative edc abatement and the cumulative oh yields for srfa nnom and plfa in the ph range 2 9 it is shown that the oh yields are within certain limits proportional to the relative edc abatement for all dom types in summary the results show that the oh yields from ozone dom interactions significantly increase with increasing ph amine moieties may partly explain this trend mvula and von sonntag 2003 3 8 effect of chlorination on edc abatement 3 8 1 changes in edc as a function of the specific chlorine doses we determined the changes in edc and absorbance 254 and 280 nm of srfa nnom and plfa as a function of an increasing chlorine dose at ph 7 figure s14 for all dom isolates the relative abatement of edc is significantly more enhanced compared to the loss in the relative absorbance in comparison to the ozonation experiments compare figure s14 with fig 2 and figures s8 s9 this is consistent with previous findings wenk et al 2013 and has been explained by the formation of chlorinated phenolic moieties which still have a significant uv absorbance while being less redox active criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 wenk et al 2013 to this end table s5 shows the molar absorption coefficients ε of the expected chlorinated reaction products gallard and von gunten 2002 lee and morris 1962 at 254 or 280 nm respectively which were determined from the uv vis spectra in this study figure s15 despite the unknown product distribution during chlorination a strong absorbance can be expected because most molar absorption coefficients ε 254 or ε 280nm are 2000 m 1cm 1 table s5 compared to phenols chlorophenols react more slowly with chlorine to form non absorbing products deborde and von gunten 2008 and because chlorophenols have significant uv absorbances the slopes in plots of the relative abatements of edc versus uv absorbance are 1 3 8 2 edc abatement and correlation with chloroform formation during chlorination phenols and other activated aromatic moieties such as resorcinol norwood et al 1980 rebenne et al 1996 rook 1977 theruvathu et al 2001 but also β diketo acid type moieties and β diketones dickenson et al 2008 can serve as precursors for trihalomethanes thms e g chloroform formation as discussed above the same activated aromatic compounds such as hydoxybenzenes react readily with ozone hoigné and bader 1983 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 as hydroxybenzenes including phenol resorcinol moieties also play an important role for the edc the effect of edc abatement on thm formation was assessed to change the edc pre ozonation experiments were performed to abate edc to up to 95 in srfa chloroform and haas were then measured after post chlorination of these samples fig 6 shows the chloroform formation during post chlorination as a function of the relative edc abatement in most experiments except 40 μm hocl fig 6a a pronounced decrease in chloroform formation was observed only for the pre ozonated samples with a relative edc of 50 similar observations were also apparent for the formation of the haloacetic acids monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa or trichloroacetic acid tcaa figure s16 once an abatement of edc of about 50 was reached the chcl3 formation decreased this threshold was reached earlier for a higher chlorine dose 40 μm because under these conditions chloroform formation was precursor limited and small changes in precursor concentrations led to a decrease in contrast for smaller chlorine doses 25 μm this effect was no longer visible until a threshold edc abatement was reached because of the excess of precursors relative to chlorine in agreement to the current observations no effect on dbp formation chloroform tcaa and adsorbable organic chlorine could be observed from a dbp formation potential test during chlorination after 10 40 edc abatement by ozone in a previous study de vera et al 2017a therefore the above mentioned results might be explained by a low extent of precursor abatement during pre ozonation for low relative edc abatements the presence of t buoh during pre ozonation blocks hydroxyl radical oxidation but also leads to a higher ozone stability and hence a higher ozone exposures compared to the absence of a scavenger the higher exposure may affect the chloroform formation during post chlorination as demonstrated in a previous study in which an identical ozone dose was applied with and without t buoh de vera et al 2015 in contrast to these previous observations the results obtained in presence and absence of t buoh are very similar in the current study figs 6a and b based on these results we conclude that oh only has a limited effect on chloroform formation during post chlorination similar conclusions can be drawn from the formation of haas in presence and absence of t buoh figure s16 4 conclusions based on results from ozone dom interactions in the ph range 2 9 and chlorine dom interactions at ph 7 it can be concluded that phenolic moiteies play a dominant role for the dom reactivity the ozone depletion kinetics during ozonation of dom was greatly affected by changes in degree of protonation the ozone depletion kinetics increased in the ph range 2 9 which could be explained by an important contribution of phenolic moieties in the dom the ph dependence of edc absorbance correlations during i ozonation indicate a higher benzoquinone yield from the dom oxidation at higher ph which is in agreement with results from ozone phenol reactions ii for chlorine a more efficient edc abatement as compared to absorbance was observed and could be explained by formation of strongly uv absorbing mono di and or trichlorophenols which are not oxidized by the abts radical cation the fluorescence intensity decreased during ozonation while an increase in fluorescence quantum yield φf was observed the increase in φf could not be explained by benzoquinone formation it is suggested to take place due to the fast abatement of phenolic moieties relative to fluorophores with low ozone reactivity during ozonation increasing oh yields were observed with increasing ph 2 9 as a result of the higher amine reactivity at higher ph the relative abatement of edc by pre ozonation did not influence the chloroform chloroacetic acids formation during post chlorination for relative edc abatements 50 as long as the chloroform chloroacetic acids formation is not precursor limited for edc abatements 50 the chloroform chloroacetic acids from post chlorination decrease was strongly correlated with the ozone induced edc abatement acknowledgements lö acknowledges the swedish research council vr grant number 2014 6839 for financial support gm and fro ackknowledge support

19351,human urine is a valuable resource for nutrient recovery given its high levels of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium but the compositional complexity of urine presents a challenge for an energy efficient concentration and refinery of nutrients in this study a pilot installation combining precipitation nitrification and electrodialysis ed designed for one person equivalent 1 2 lurine d 1 was continuously operated for 7 months first naoh addition yielded calcium and magnesium precipitation preventing scaling in ed second a moving bed biofilm reactor oxidized organics preventing downstream biofouling and yielded complete nitrification on diluted urine 20 40 i e dilution factors 5 and 2 5 at an average loading rate of 215 mg n l 1 d 1 batch tests demonstrated the halotolerance of the nitrifying community with nitrification rates not affected up to an electrical conductivity of 40 ms cm 1 and gradually decreasing yet ongoing activity up to 96 ms cm 1 at 18 of the maximum rate next generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that switching from a synthetic influent to real urine induced a profound shift in microbial community and that the aob community was dominated by halophilic species closely related to nitrosomonas aestuarii and nitrosomonas marina third nitrate phosphate and potassium in the filtered 0 1 μm bioreactor effluent were concentrated by factors 4 3 2 6 and 4 6 respectively with ed doubling the urine concentration from 20 to 40 further increased the ed recovery efficiency by 10 batch experiments at ph 6 7 and 8 indicated a more efficient phosphate transport to the concentrate at ph 7 the newly proposed three stage strategy opens up opportunities for energy and chemical efficient nutrient recovery from urine precipitation and nitrification

phosphate and carbonate ions causing supersaturation and thus triggering precipitation subsequently the urine was treated in an aerobic bioreactor the purpose of the bioreactor was to i convert biodegradable organics into co2 and sludge by heterotrophic bacteria thereby reducing the biofouling potential in ed and ii to convert urea 85 of the nitrogen in fresh urine into nitrate through ammonification followed by nitrification in addition nitrification decreases the ph leading to undersaturation thereby preventing further precipitation in ed ammonification or the hydrolysis of urea to bicarbonate and ammonium is initiated by the urease enzyme produced by many heterotrophic bacteria and some nitrifiers defoirdt et al 2017 koops et al 1991 mobley and hausinger 1989 the nitrification process consists of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob converting ammonium into nitrite nitritation followed by the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate nitratation by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrification is a well documented stabilisation method of urine as nitrate is a stable molecule in contrast to ammonia which upon volatilisation causes significant malodour and nitrogen losses coppens et al 2016 feng et al 2008 udert et al 2003a udert and wachter 2012 additionally nitrate is the preferred nitrogen species for recovery as it is a charged molecule which can be captured

4 ed batch phosphate transport experiment a batch experiment on the ed unit was performed in order to investigate the influence of the diluate ph on the phosphate transport to the concentrate the

autotrophic conditions of the cr and this colour typically matured into brownish upon several weeks exposure to the heterotrophic real urine conditions in the pr figure s4 the beads were stored at 80

under accession number srp111125 the data was processed using the mothur software package v 1 38 0 schloss et al 2009 as outlined by de paepe et al 2017 and described in section 1 2 in si 3 results 3 1 precipitation on a 20 urine solution to prevent scaling in the ed stack removal of calcium and magnesium was targeted in the precipitation reactor the fivefold dilution 20 urine solution resulted in influent concentrations of 31 10 mg ca2 l 1 and 11 5 mg mg2 l 1 respectively precipitation lowered the concentrations to 1 9 1 0 mg ca2 l 1 94 reduction and 1 6 0 4 mg mg2 l 1 84 reduction concomittantly 32 of the phosphate and 17 of the sulphate was precipitated the sodium concentration increased threefold due to the dosage of naoh to increase the ph the ammonium concentration increased by a factor of 2 4 indicating that some ureolysis occurred in the influent tubing or in the precipitation reactor despite the high ph 3 2 nitrification bioreactor 3 2 1 operation using a 20 urine solution in the bioreactor organic nitrogen and ammonium were converted into nitrate in order to stabilise the urine and to be able to capture the nitrogen in a non volatile form in ed on average 1 2 l d 1 of urine with an average tkn concentration of 5 4 g n l 1 before dilution was treated which corresponded to a volumetric nitrogen loading rate of 214 85 mg n l 1 d 1 approximately one third of the tkn was already hydrolysed to ammonium before the urine entered the bioreactor fig 1a b on average 92 of the nitrogen present in the influent was converted into nitrate fig 1a d some nitrogen 1 was not fully nitrified and was still present under the form of ammonium or nitrite in the effluent fig 1b c the missing nitrogen 8 was most likely lost in the precipitation reactor and the bioreactor due to struvite precipitation ammonia stripping and assimilation by the biomass and also denitrification or n2o production could not be excluded the time series data presented in fig s6 showed effluent concentrations below 0 5 mg nh4 n l 1 during 55 of the operation time and below 5 mg nh4 n l 1 during 80 of the time only during reactor upsets ph control failure or influent dosing problems the concentration increased above 20 mg nh4 n l 1 another purpose of the bioreactor was to remove the organic matter in order to prevent biofouling in ed the chemical oxygen demand cod in the influent and effluent of the bioreactor was 818 214 and 65 13 mg l 1 respectively which corresponds to a removal percentage of 92 3 2 2 operation using a 40 urine solution the bioreactor was operated using a 40 urine solution to study the effect of a higher salinity on the nitrification to maintain the same nitrogen loading rate of 215 mg n l 1 d 1 the total influent rate was decreased from 5 8 to 3 5 l d 1 as a consequence the hrt increased from 5 0 to 8 6 days and the influent concentrations of the different ions doubled compared to the test on a 20 urine solution increasing the ec in the bioreactor to 17 3 1 1 ms cm 1 compared to 10 5 1 2 ms cm 1 in the test on a 20 urine solution the fraction of organic nitrogen in the influent was considerably lower compared to the period on a 20 urine solution fig 1e which is probably due to ureolysis as a result of the longer residence time in the influent line or in the precipitation reactor no residual ammonium or nitrite were detected in the effluent of the bioreactor fig 1f g apart from accumulations on day 16 21 mg no2 n l 1 day 27 62 mg no2 n l 1 and day 28 16 mg nh4 n l 1 and 89 mg no2 n l 1 resulting from technical upsets the nitrate concentration in the effluent reached 1477 81 mg no3 n l 1 almost double compared to the test on a 20 urine solution fig 1h again 91 of the cod was removed but due to the higher influent concentration the cod in the effluent was more than twice higher 158 mg cod l 1 instead of 65 mg cod l 1 compared to the period on a 20 urine solution 3 2 3 halotolerance of the nitrifying biofilm the short term effect of a higher ec on maximum ureolysis nitritation and nitratation rates was investigated in a batch experiment in which the beads were exposed to short term salt stress by adding a salt mix of nacl and nano3 the ureolysis rate decreased by 52 from 1249 mg n l 1 d 1 at an ec of 20 ms cm 1 to 600 mg n l 1 d 1 at an ec of 96 ms cm 1 fig 2 the nitritation rate was barely affected at low ec 58 ms cm 1 but decreased with 77 between an ec of 58 ms cm 1 and 96 ms cm 1 the nitratation activity decreased almost linearly p 3e 8 r2 of 0 91 with more than 96 between 20 and 96 ms cm 1 the ureolysis nitritation ratio increased whereas the nitratation nitritation ratio decreased at higher salt concentrations although the nob activity was most severely affected at high ec nitritation remained the rate limiting process 3 2 4 microbial community composition the microbial community colonising the beads in the cultivation reactor cr and pilot reactor pr was followed up over time through next generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to track the influence of a synthetic urine solution versus the complex urine matrix the microbial community at phylum level was dominated by proteobacteria 70 10 and bacteroidetes 23 9 while acidobacteria gradually increased over time up to 15 in the pr figure s7 the most abundant families were moraxellaceae comamonadaceae xanthomonadaceae chitinophagaceae and the most prevalent genera included acinetobacter luteimonas nitrosomonas and comamonas figure s8 s9 approximately 30 of the community could not be classified at the genus level the most dominant otus operational taxonomic unit were related to acinetobacter venetianus otu1 comamonas sp otu2 luteimonas aquatica otu3 and nitrosomonas sp otu4 table s2 figure s10 a principle coordinate analysis pcoa of the microbial community on the beads of the cr and pr at the otu level fig 3 revealed how the reactor specific microbial community developed over time after start up and stabilisation samples originating from the same reactor cr or pr are clustered together cr operated using a synthetic influent was characterized by the dominance of acinetobacter on the other hand comamonas luteimonas and ferruginibacter were more characteristic for pr figure s9 samples of pr were more scattered and the observed shifts coincided with shifts in the influent composition as demonstrated by the arrows in fig 3 acinetobacter comamonas and ferruginibacter became more estabilished on the beads when the influent was shifted from the urea solution to real urine whereas azoarcus and dokdonella disappeared during operation using a 20 urine solution the relative abundance of luteimonas and nitrosomonas gradually increased changing the influent back to a synthetic nh4 2so4 solution between the two experiments to maintain the microbial culture resulted in a decreased relative abundance of acinetobacter and further increased abundance of luteimonas feeding the pr with a 40 urine solution afterwards led to an increased enrichment of comamonas on the beads nitrosomonas was the sole known aob genus present in the cr and pr with a total relative abundance around 7 further classification using ncbi blast rdp seqmatch and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree indicated that the key players in the aob community were closely related to n aestuarii n marina n europaea and n ureae table s2 figure s11 s12 otu4 which showed the highest sequence identity to n aestuarii marina was the most abundant aob with relative abundances reaching up to 90 in some samples interestingly otu24 most similar to n europaea which is only moderately halotolerant was replaced by more halophilic n aestuarii marina ureae like organisms in the pr when the influent was shifted from a synthetic influent to real urine when the influent was changed back to a synthetic nh4 2so4 solution otu81 and otu91 most similar to n halophila and n ureae respectively proportionally increased but disappeared when the reactor was operated again on real urine 40 158 bradyrhizobiaceae family including nob related otus were found in the microbial community but individual otus were 1 of the sequenced community figure s8 neither qpcr gave sufficient results to draw conclusions from 3 3 electrodialysis 3 3 1 operation using a 20 urine solution the effluent of the bioreactor with an ec of 10 5 1 2 ms cm 1 was fed into the ed to concentrate the nutrients the predominant ions in the feed stream of the ed were sodium of which 75 originates from the naoh dosage in the precipitation reactor and nitrification reactor nitrate due to nitrification chloride and potassium fig 4a by applying an electric field on average 4 1 l d 1 of diluate with an ec of 5 1 1 8 ms cm 1 and 0 7 l d 1 of concentrate with an ec around 50 ms cm 1 was produced the average recovery efficiencies fig 4c varied between 40 and 74 with the highest efficiency for sulphate 74 followed by potassium 71 and nitrate 70 only 40 of the phosphate in the feed stream was transported to the concentrate stream sodium and nitrate made up the largest fraction of the transported ions corresponding to respectively 47 and 35 of the total molar transport whereas phosphate and sulphate contributed less than 1 to the absolute molar transport in general the concentrations in the concentrate were 4 5 times higher than the concentrations in the feed stream fig 4d while only phosphate had a lower concentration factor 2 6 3 3 2 operation using a 40 urine solution increasing the urine concentration from a 20 to a 40 urine solution almost doubled the ion concentrations and the ec of the feed stream to the ed but the volumetric salt loading rate remained the same fig 4b table s3 ed produced on average 2 8 l d 1 diluate and 0 7 l d 1 concentrate with an ec value of around 5 5 and 60 ms cm 1 respectively the recovery efficiencies increased by 7 14 but the concentration factors of each ion decreased fig 4c d the coulombic efficiency is compared in table s3 3 3 3 influence of ph on phosphate transport in ed the recovery efficiency of phosphate in ed was significantly lower compared to the other ions transfer of phosphate through membranes is challenging due to its large size high molecular mass and large hydration shell resulting in a high stokes radius and low diffusion rate in water table s5 it was hypothesized that the phosphate transfer to the concentrate could be enhanced by increasing the ph in the diluate since the dominant phosphate species shifts from h2po4 to hpo4 2 between a ph of 6 and 8 table s6 generally the higher the charge of an ion the more the ion is susceptible to the electric field and thus the larger the driving force in the bulk solution nernst planck this hypothesis was addressed in a batch experiment in which three different ph values were tested since nitrate and chloride removal should not be ph dependent these ions were used as a reference to confirm whether the difference in recovery efficiency of phosphate could be attributed to the ph difference and not to technical variability between the tests phosphate transfer was clearly influenced by the ph as opposed to nitrate and chloride transfer fig 5 s14 after an electric charge of 2500 coulomb c had passed through the ed 29 54 and 31 of phosphate was removed from the diluate at a ph of 6 7 and 8 respectively yielding ph 7 as optimum 3 4 recovery of n p and k the aim of this study was to determine the recovery potential of the nutrients in urine based on the performance of the pilot installation during operation using a 20 urine solution on average 32 of the phosphate p was captured in precipitates in total 64 of the nitrogen 22 of the phosphorus and 70 of the potassium were captured in the concentrate on average 29 of the nitrogen 33 of the phosphorus and 30 of the potassium remained in the diluate fig 6a c s13 about 8 of the nitrogen was not recovered as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the concentrate contained on average 3 7 g no3 n l 1 1 5 g k l 1 and 0 06 g po4 3 p l 1 on a 40 urine solution 29 of the phosphate p was captured in precipitates in total 70 of the nitrogen 38 of the phosphate p and 83 of the potassium were captured in the concentrate on average 17 of the nitrogen 32 of the phosphate p and 17 of the potassium remained in the diluate fig 6d f about 13 of the nitrogen was lost the concentrate contained on average 5 1 g no3 n l 1 2 3 g k l 1 and 0 06 g po4 3 p l 1 4 discussion 4 1 precipitation and nitrification minimize scaling and biofouling in ed in this study an integrated system combining precipitation nitrification and ed was evaluated to refine and concentrate nutrients from fresh urine operation of this three stage system was successfully demonstrated in a relevant environment corresponding to level 6 on the technology readiness level trl scale the use of a precipitation reactor proved to be an effective strategy to safeguard the ed from excessive scaling more than 90 of the calcium and 80 of the magnesium was precipitated and no scaling was observed in the ed unit both the precipitation and nitrification reactor require base addition in the precipitation reactor approximately 215 mmol naoh l 1 urine was dosed to increase the ph to 11 in the nitrification reactor base is needed to counteract the acidification caused by nitrification without base addition maximally 50 of the nitrogen in urine can be converted into nitrate udert et al 2003a in principle base addition in the precipitation reactor does not increase the total base consumption as a more alkaline influent entering the bioreactor reduces the amount of alkaline equivalents required in the bioreactor to counteract the acidification in total about 300 mmol naoh l 1 urine was needed to convert all urea into nitrate of which only one third was dosed in the nitrification reactor the use of a bioreactor proved to be an effective strategy to limit biofouling in ed by oxidizing the cod moreover uncharged urea was converted into nitrate in order to stabilise the urine and to capture the nitrogen in a non volatile form in ed although the total nitrogen concentration in the influent fluctuated due to the variable composition of urine stable nitrification was achieved in the bioreactor with an average volumetric nitrogen loading rate of 215 mg n l 1 reactor d 1 and a salinity of 10 5 ms cm 1 only after reactor disturbances due to failure of the ph control or influent dosing problems ammonium was detected in the bioreactor effluent nitrifiers quickly recovered once the optimal conditions were restored bacteria grown in a biofilm are generally more protected to transient stressors such as a low ph and high free ammonia concentration due to diffusion limitations ikuma et al 2013 moreover nitritation which causes the acidification is generally hampered by a low ph presumably due to a limited atp generation fumasoli et al 2015 in addition besides precipitation and protection of the subsequent ed the precipitation reactor was also used to increase the alkalinity of the nitrification reactor influent as a consequence we never observed the ph dropping below 5 5 in case of ph control failure it is in this respect also noteworthy that the cultivation reactor was ph controlled solely by providing sufficient alkalinity in the feed and not by a ph controller ed was used to concentrate nutrients in an energy efficient manner the concentrate flow was generated by osmotic and electro osmotic water transport across the membrane and contained about 70 of the ions of the feed stream the increase in concentrate ec and obtained concentration factors of 3 5 are in line with results obtained by pronk et al 2007 periodic cleaning in place once a month with an acid and alkaline solution was sufficient to keep the ed stack operational 7 months with the same membranes and a stable performance such cleaning can easily be automated however the anion exchange membranes turned brown figure s15 which was also reported by aponte and colon 2001 this is probably due to irreversible adsorption of negatively charged organic molecules aponte and colon 2001 4 2 nitrification and cod oxidation remained unaffected at a decreased urine dilution the high salt content of urine and base addition leads to a high ec in the bioreactor living in a salty environment is an energetically costly process for bacteria since more energy is required to balance the cell osmotic pressure oren 1999 this limits the energy available for nitrification which typically results in lower activity rates at high ec the salt tolerance of the nitrifying community on the beads was assessed in a batch experiment in which beads were exposed to a short term salt shock the maximum ureolysis nitritation and nitratation rates of the beads decreased with 52 82 and 96 respectively when the ec was increased from 20 ms cm 1 to 96 ms cm 1 interestingly the rate limiting nitritation and hence the overall nitrification rate remained unaffected up to 40 ms cm 1 this also explains why nitrification was not affected during continuous operation using a 40 urine solution despite the higher ec 17 3 ms cm 1 instead of 10 5 ms cm 1 the results of the batch experiment suggest that the bioreactor can operate on undiluted urine expected ec between 45 and 60 ms cm 1 but at a lower volumetric rate although this should be tested on the long term the relatively high salt resistance of the beads is probably a result of the inoculum selection coppens et al 2016 the higher drop in nitratation rate indicates that the nob on the beads were more sensitive to the short term salt stress than the aob literature is inconclusive concerning the salt tolerance of aob versus nob due to differences in experimental set up operational conditions and test duration salt dosage and aob and nob community composition moussa et al 2006 moussa et al 2006 and coppens et al 2016 reported that aob were more sensitive to salt stress on the other hand bassin et al 2011 dincer and kargi 1999 cui et al 2009 and cortes lorenzo et al 2015 concluded based on the accumulation of nitrite in their experiments that nob were more affected by salinity 4 3 shifts in microbial community composition parallel shifts in influent composition the shifts in microbial community composition in the pilot reactor coincided with changes in the influent composition as shown by pcoa analysis fig 3 and may be attributed to the nature of the organic fraction in the influent acetate in synthetic medium versus complex cod matrix in urine in addition salinity is known to affect the microbial community composition in nitrification reactors bassin et al 2012 coppens et al 2016 cortes lorenzo et al 2015 gonzalez silva 2016 moussa et al 2006 classification using ncbi blast rdp seqmatch and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree indicated that the aob community was dominated by species closely related to n aestuarii or n marina both species are obligate halophilic and described in marine environments koops et al 1991 n aestuarii was also found to be the dominating aob species in reactors operated on seawater gonzalez silva 2016 sudarno et al 2010 the presence of these halophilic aob species can also explain why the nitritation activity was so well preserved at high ec in the batch experiment besides salinity the shifts in the aob community in the pilot reactor corresponded to the nitrogen source urea n or ammonium n otus related to the urease negative n europaea and n halophila koops et al 1991 only thrived when the reactor was operated using a synthetic ammonium sulphate solution 4 4 lowering the urine dilution leads to a higher recovery efficiency but a lower concentration factor in ed increasing the urine concentration from 20 to 40 decreased the volume ratio of diluate to concentrate from 5 8 to 4 due to the higher ec gradient between the diluate and concentrate and the increased transport of ions from diluate to concentrate the osmotic and electro osmotic water transport increased hence relatively more concentrate was produced on a 40 urine solution depending on the ion the recovery efficiency increased by 7 14 which is probably due to the higher residence time in the diluate tank 14 h instead of 8 h despite the higher end concentrations and overall ec of the concentrate on a 40 urine solution the concentration factors decreased as a result of the higher ion concentrations in the feed stream to conclude more nutrients were captured in the concentrate but in a comparatively larger concentrate volume 4 5 strategies to increase nutrient recovery efficiencies respectively 70 and 80 of the ions were captured in 15 and 20 of the initial volume when the pilot installation was operated using a 20 or 40 urine solution it is almost impossible to capture all nutrients in the concentrate as a result of the equilibrium established between the diluate and concentrate stream part of the nutrients remain in the diluate additionally relatively low concentration factors ion concentration in the concentrate stream devided by the concentration in the feed stream present a second limitation inherent to ed due to the osmotic and electro osmotic water transport a high concentration gradient between the diluate and the concentrate leads to increased osmotic water transport from diluate to concentrate and back diffusion of ions from concentrate to diluate which in turn limits the maximum achievable concentration factor in case of phosphate the large size and low diffusion rate of the ion limits the recovery efficiency to 40 as opposed to 70 75 for all other ions corresponding to a concentration factor of only 2 6 it was hypothesized that the phosphate transport would increase by increasing the ph in the diluate since more phosphate ions are dissociated at a higher ph which could facilitate the transport as the ions are more susceptible to the electric field the recovery efficiency of phosphate in the batch test at ph 7 was indeed higher compared to ph 6 the slower phosphate transport at ph 8 compared to ph 7 can possibly be attributed to competition in migration with carbonate ions like phosphate the charge of carbonate depends on the ph most of the carbonate is uncharged h2co3 at ph 6 while more than 90 of the carbonate species have a charge of 1 hco3 at ph 8 table s7 further research is needed to confirm the hypothesis of reduced phosphorus transport due to carbonate competition at elevated ph another way to recover more phosphorus is to precipitate all the phosphorus in the precipitation reactor phosphorus precipitation is limited by calcium and magnesium due to the excess of anions phosphate sulphate and carbonate in urine by substituting naoh by ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 to increase the ph in the precipitation reactor or adding another calcium or magnesium source up to 90 of the phosphate can be precipitated etter et al 2011 however excess calcium or magnesium dosage should be avoided to prevent scaling issues in the ed unit decreasing the concentrate volume by means of distillation is an option to concentrate the nutrients in a smaller volume distillation was already applied by udert and wachter 2012 in combination with nitrification to concentrate nutrients in urine all nutrients were recovered in a dry solid however the high energy demand of distillation 700 whprimary energy l 1 urine presents a major drawback of the process the energy consumption of ed is significantly lower the electrode power consumption of ed in this study equalled only 4 3 whelectrical energy l 1 urine or 14 whprimary energy l 1 urine table s4 however ed removed only 88 of the water whereas distillation can remove almost all water udert and wachter 2012 suggested that the energy demand could be significantly reduced by first removing 80 of the water with reverse osmosis and subsequently operating distillation with vapor compression 100 wh l 1 urine alternatively the required 80 water removal could be obtained by ed instead of ro as demonstrated in this study to conclude a combination of precipitation nitrification ed and distillation could offer a maximal concentration of nutrients with a minimal input of energy 4 6 resource reuse possibilities for precipitate ed concentrate and ed diluate the output of the integrated system consists of the precipitates formed in the precipitation reactor and the diluate and concentrate stream of the ed unit the precipitates could be used as a solid phosphorus fertilizer in agriculture about 30 of the phosphate in urine was incorporated in the precipitates which corresponds to values reported in literature udert et al 2006 the use of urine derived precipitates as fertilizer has been demonstrated by bonvin et al 2015 moreover it was reported by escher et al 2006 and ronteltap et al 2007 that urine precipitates were clean and safe fertilizers since the micropollutants in urine pharmaceuticals hormones mainly remained in the liquid phase the ed concentrate is rich in nutrients predominantly nitrogen npk 85 9 0 7 13 4 mol which is present under the form of nitrate nitrate in contrast to urea ammonia or ammonium nitrate is a thermally stable non volatile molecule and in a lot of cases the preferred nitrogen source for plants marschner 1995 udert and wachter 2012 besides nitrogen plant growth requirements are also met for potassium whereas phosphorus will be the limiting macronutrient in the ed concentrate due to the partial incorporation in the precipitates larsen et al 2013 the excessive salt concentration particularly sodium resulting from the naoh demand by precipitation and nitrification might present another barrier for fertilizer application in this regards partial nitrification is a promising new lead to reduce the sodium load simultaneously saving chemicals udert and wachter 2012 the dense nature of the ed membranes typically results in a high retention of pathogens and micropollutants in the diluate escher et al 2006 pronk et al 2006b pronk and kone 2009 however pronk et al 2006a showed that breakthrough of certain micropollutants e g propranolol and ibuprofen can occur over time to guarantee a micropollutant free product a post treatment such as ozonation or adsorption on activated carbon can be included to remove the residual micropollutants in the concentrate dodd et al 2008 larsen et al 2013 pronk et al 2007 udert et al 2016 ozonation is even more effective in combination with a nitrate based cod low stream given the ozone scavenging potential of ammonium and competition between cod and micropollutants for the chemical oxidant larsen et al 2013 pronk et al 2007 finally the ed diluate is low in nutrients and salts which makes it a suitable stream for water recovery through membrane filtration as particularly relevant for regenerative life support systems for human space exploration clauwaert et al 2017 lindeboom et al 2015 5 conclusion an electrodialysis ed stack was operated for 7 months on real diluted urine the use of a precipitation reactor and aerobic bioreactor proved to be an effective strategy to minimize scaling and biofouling in ed more than 90 and 95 of incoming cod and urea were converted in the bioreactor at salinities of 10 20 ms cm 1 shifts in the microbial community coincided with changes in the influent composition of the bioreactor the aob community was dominated by species closely related to nitrosomonas aestuarii and nitrosomonas marina respectively 70 and 80 of the ions were captured in 15 and 20 of the initial volume when the pilot installation was operated using a 20 or 40 urine solution the p rich precipitates and n k rich ed concentrate can be valorised as fertilizers whereas water can be recovered from the ed diluate further research on the fate of micropollutants and pathogens in the three stage system is necessary to valorise the recovered fertilizers declarations of interest none acknowledgements this article has been made possible through

19351,human urine is a valuable resource for nutrient recovery given its high levels of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium but the compositional complexity of urine presents a challenge for an energy efficient concentration and refinery of nutrients in this study a pilot installation combining precipitation nitrification and electrodialysis ed designed for one person equivalent 1 2 lurine d 1 was continuously operated for 7 months first naoh addition yielded calcium and magnesium precipitation preventing scaling in ed second a moving bed biofilm reactor oxidized organics preventing downstream biofouling and yielded complete nitrification on diluted urine 20 40 i e dilution factors 5 and 2 5 at an average loading rate of 215 mg n l 1 d 1 batch tests demonstrated the halotolerance of the nitrifying community with nitrification rates not affected up to an electrical conductivity of 40 ms cm 1 and gradually decreasing yet ongoing activity up to 96 ms cm 1 at 18 of the maximum rate next generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that switching from a synthetic influent to real urine induced a profound shift in microbial community and that the aob community was dominated by halophilic species closely related to nitrosomonas aestuarii and nitrosomonas marina third nitrate phosphate and potassium in the filtered 0 1 μm bioreactor effluent were concentrated by factors 4 3 2 6 and 4 6 respectively with ed doubling the urine concentration from 20 to 40 further increased the ed recovery efficiency by 10 batch experiments at ph 6 7 and 8 indicated a more efficient phosphate transport to the concentrate at ph 7 the newly proposed three stage strategy opens up opportunities for energy and chemical efficient nutrient recovery from urine precipitation and nitrification enabled the long term continuous operation of ed on fresh urine requiring minimal maintenance which has to the best of our knowledge never been achieved before graphical abstract image 1 keywords

renewable energy to produce ammonia and finite natural resources such as phosphate rock and potassium minerals ledezma et al 2015 the growing world population the limited resources and the environmental burden of eutrophication demand a paradigm shift towards recovery and reuse of nutrients verstraete et al 2016 recently source separated urine has gained great interest as a valuable resource of nutrients given its relatively high concentration in macronutrients 9 g n l 1 0 7 g p l 1 and 2 g k l 1 udert et al 2006 efficient nutrient recovery from source separated urine could provide an estimated 20 of the nitrogen phosphorus and potassium for the current fertilizer production in the eu kuntke 2013 ledezma et al 2015 since urine is often diluted with flushing water it is important to concentrate the nutrients in order to reduce transport and storage volumes and to facilitate the recovery of nutrients maurer et al 2006 numerous technologies have been proposed to separate and or concentrate nutrients from urine however none of these technologies are capable of capturing the broad urine nutrient spectrum in a micropollutant free fertilizer in a scalable energy and chemical efficient manner evaporation reverse osmosis freeze thawing and nitrification distillation are energy intensive microbial fuel cells and electrolysis cells are difficult to scale up

decreased with approximately 50 over a period of 195 days due to fouling pronk et al 2007 in the present study fresh urine was used and scaling and biofouling were prevented by a combination of precipitation and an aerobic bioreactor disadvantages of using hydrolysed urine include uncontrolled precipitation of phosphorus and evaporation of ammonia during storage leading to phosphorus and nitrogen losses maurer et al 2006 udert et al 2003b 2003c enzymatic urea hydrolysis can be prevented during storage through addition of acids metals caustics but it is considered challenging to stop the process for 100 randall et al 2016 ray et al 2018 calcium and magnesium were removed in a precipitation reactor in which naoh was dosed to increase the ph to 11 shifting the speciation of phosphate and carbonate ions causing supersaturation and thus triggering precipitation subsequently the urine was treated in an aerobic bioreactor the purpose of the bioreactor was to i convert biodegradable organics into co2 and sludge by heterotrophic bacteria thereby reducing the biofouling potential in ed and ii to convert urea 85 of the nitrogen in fresh urine into nitrate through ammonification followed by nitrification in addition nitrification decreases the ph leading to undersaturation thereby preventing further precipitation in ed ammonification or the hydrolysis of urea to bicarbonate and ammonium is initiated by the urease enzyme produced by many heterotrophic bacteria and some nitrifiers defoirdt et al 2017 koops et al 1991 mobley and hausinger 1989 the nitrification process consists of ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob converting ammonium into nitrite nitritation followed by the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate nitratation by nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrification is a well documented stabilisation method of urine as nitrate is a stable molecule in contrast to ammonia which upon volatilisation causes significant malodour and nitrogen losses coppens et al 2016 feng et al 2008 udert et al 2003a udert and wachter 2012 additionally nitrate is the preferred nitrogen species for recovery as it is a charged molecule which can be captured in the ed concentrate and in a lot of cases the preferred nitrogen fertilizer for plants marschner 1995 the integration of precipitation nitrification and ed to refine and concentrate nutrients from fresh urine of one person equivalent was for the first time evaluated in an automated pilot scale installation during four months on a 20 urine solution i e dilution factor of 5 as upstream

urinal and stored in a freezer 20 c urine collection was approved by the ethical committee of ghent university hospital under registration number b670201523246 before feeding to the precipitation reactor the urine was thawed and preserved at 4 c demineralised water was added to simulate flush water the installation was operated during four months on a 20 urine solution daily 1 2 l of urine and 4 6 l of demineralised water were separately fed into the system and subsequently mixed in the precipitation reactor to study the effect of a higher salinity on the nitrification and the recovery efficiencies and concentration factors of the ed the installation was operated using a 40 urine solution 1 3 l d 1 of urine mixed with 2 2 l d 1 of demineralised water for two months 2 2 2 reactor inoculation based on the inoculum screening described by coppens et al 2016 three inoculum sources urine nitrification oland and commercial aquaculture inoculum were selected to inoculate a cultivation reactor cr used to establish a nitrifying biofilm on the beads the cr 22l was operated as a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and received a synthetic influent with a salinity around 10 ms

cr as mbbr it was operated for several months as a sbr the initial influent composition was based on the information provided by the suppliers of the inoculum and gradually tuned also using batch assays towards maximizing nitritation and nitratation rates while maintaining the cultures functionality for ureolysis and cod removal at slightly saline conditions the additional nitrite was used to create a slight overcapacity in nitratation compared to nitritation to minimize nitrite toxicity risks during start up the volumetric nitrogen loading rate amounted to 165 mg n l 1 d 1 the ph was between ph 6 5 8 0 nahco3 buffer and oxygen was continuously supplied with an aquarium pump do 2 mg o2 l 1 an average hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 4 days was applied to ensure sufficient selective pressure for biofilm growth by washing out the suspended biomass the bioreactor of the pilot installation was inoculated with beads from the cultivation reactor 2 2 3 automation operation

determine the salt tolerance of ureolytic bacteria aob and nob on the beads erlenmeyer flasks were filled with 200 ml beads and 300 ml mixed liquor from the bioreactor operated using a 40 urine solution and an ec around 20 ms cm 1 the ec was increased by adding a salt mix 1 5 nacl and 4 5 nano3 on a mass basis to the erlenmeyer flasks five different salt additions were tested 0 20 40 60 and 80 g salt l 1 mixed liquor resulting in an ec of 20 39 58 77 and 96 ms cm 1 the ureolysis rate was determined by adding urea 50 mg n l 1 and allylthiourea 250 mg l 1 to inhibit the ammonia oxidation to the erlenmeyer flasks aob activity was analysed by adding 2 5 ml of urine and 0 5 g l 1 nahco3 nob activity was determined by spiking the flasks with nano2 50 mg n l 1 the tests were performed in triplicate in a room controlled at 28 c the flasks were covered with parafilm to prevent evaporation and shaken at 130 rpm using an orbital shaker innova 2300 new brunswick the netherlands to provide aeration samples were taken at a 30 min time interval afterwards they were filtered 0 20 μm chromafil xtra filter macherey nagel pa usa and stored in the fridge ammonium and nitrite concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically with a tecan infinite plate reader infinite f50 absorbance microplate reader tecan trading ag männedorf switserland according to the berthelot reaction at 690 nm and montgomerey reaction at 540 nm respectively bucur et al 2006 montgomery and dymock 1961 the experiments lasted between 3 at low salinity and 24 at high salinity hours activity rates were derived from the slope of the ammonium ureolytic and aob activity or nitrite concentration nob activity in function of time a linear model was fitted to the data in r using the stats package version 3 4 0 r core team 2017 prior to formal hypothesis testing the assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality of the residuals were visually assessed and confirmed with the bartlett test and shapiro test in r 2 4 ed batch phosphate transport experiment a batch experiment on the ed unit was performed in order to investigate the influence of the diluate ph on the phosphate transport to the concentrate the diluate tank was filled with 2 l of uf filtrate with an ec around 20 ms cm 1 at the start of each experiment and the ph was adapted with hcl or naoh to a ph of 6 7 or 8 the concentrate tank was filled with 1 5 l of demineralised water the current of the power supply was automatically controlled at 90 of the lcd based on the ec of the diluate the current voltage ph of the diluate and conductivity of the diluate and concentrate were continuously monitored throughout the experiment samples were taken at a 30 or 60 min time interval at the beginning and end of the batch experiment respectively afterwards they were filtered 0 20 μm chromafil xtra filter macherey nagel pa usa and stored in the fridge 4 c prior to analysis the experiments were ended after 7 h ec diluate 2 3 ms cm 1 2 5 analytical methods chloride nitrite nitrate sulphate and phosphate were analysed with anion chromatography 930 compact ic flex with metrosep a supp 5 150 4 0 column and conductivity detector metrohm herisau switzerland sodium total ammonium nitrogen tan and potassium were measured using cation chromatography 761 compact ic with metrosep c6 250 4 0 column and conductivity detector metrohm herisau switzerland calcium and magnesium concentrations were analysed by means of flame atomic absorption spectrometry shimadzu aa 6300 shimadzu kyoto japan the samples were diluted and acidified with 1 nitric acid and 2 of lanthanum solution cod was determined with nanocolor test tubes nanocolor cod 15000 macherey nagel pa usa in unfiltered samples total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn was analysed according to standard methods greenberg et al 1992 2 6 microbial community analysis samples of the biofilm carriers from the cultivation reactor cr and pilot reactor pr were collected throughout the experiment for microbial community analysis a distinction was made between young yellowish beads and mature brownish beads based on a visual colour difference the young beads developed their colour under the autotrophic conditions of the cr and this colour typically matured into brownish upon several weeks exposure to the heterotrophic real urine conditions in the pr figure s4 the beads were stored at 80 c for each sampling time point three beads were pooled for dna extraction using the method described by de paepe et al 2017 dna extracts were sent out to lgc genomics teddington uk for library preparation and sequencing of the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene on an illumina miseq platform the sequence data are deposited at the ncbi national center for biotechnology information database under accession number srp111125 the data was processed using the mothur software package v 1 38 0 schloss et al 2009 as outlined by de paepe et al 2017 and described in section 1 2 in si 3 results 3 1 precipitation on a 20 urine solution to prevent scaling in the ed stack removal of calcium and magnesium was targeted in the precipitation reactor the fivefold dilution 20 urine solution resulted in influent concentrations of 31 10 mg ca2 l 1 and 11 5 mg mg2 l 1 respectively precipitation lowered the concentrations to 1 9 1 0 mg ca2 l 1 94 reduction and 1 6 0 4 mg mg2 l 1 84 reduction concomittantly 32 of the phosphate and 17 of the sulphate was precipitated the sodium concentration increased threefold due to the dosage of naoh to increase the ph the ammonium concentration increased by a factor of 2 4 indicating that some ureolysis occurred in the influent tubing or in the precipitation reactor despite the high ph 3 2 nitrification bioreactor 3 2 1 operation using a 20 urine solution in the bioreactor organic nitrogen and ammonium were converted into nitrate in order to stabilise the urine and to be able to capture the nitrogen in a non volatile form in ed on average 1 2 l d 1 of urine with an average tkn concentration of 5 4 g n l 1 before dilution was treated which corresponded to a volumetric nitrogen loading rate of 214 85 mg n l 1 d 1 approximately one third of the tkn was already hydrolysed to ammonium before the urine entered the bioreactor fig 1a b on average 92 of the nitrogen present in the influent was converted into nitrate fig 1a d some nitrogen 1 was not fully nitrified and was still present under the form of ammonium or nitrite in the effluent fig 1b c the missing nitrogen 8 was most likely lost in the precipitation reactor and the bioreactor due to struvite precipitation ammonia stripping and assimilation by the biomass and also denitrification or n2o production could not be excluded the time series data presented in fig s6 showed effluent concentrations below 0 5 mg nh4 n l 1 during 55 of the operation time and below 5 mg nh4 n l 1 during 80 of the time only during reactor upsets ph control failure or influent dosing problems the concentration increased above 20 mg nh4 n l 1 another purpose of the bioreactor was to remove the organic matter in order to prevent biofouling in ed the chemical oxygen demand cod in the influent and effluent of the bioreactor was 818 214 and 65 13 mg l 1 respectively which corresponds to a removal percentage of 92 3 2 2 operation using a 40 urine solution the bioreactor was operated using a 40 urine solution to study the effect of a higher salinity on the nitrification to maintain the same nitrogen loading rate of 215 mg n l 1 d 1 the total influent rate was decreased from 5 8 to 3 5 l d 1 as a consequence the hrt increased from 5 0 to 8 6 days and the influent concentrations of the different ions doubled compared to the test on a 20 urine solution increasing the ec in the bioreactor to 17 3 1 1 ms cm 1 compared to 10 5 1 2 ms cm 1 in the test on a 20 urine solution the fraction of organic nitrogen in the influent was considerably lower compared to the period on a 20 urine solution fig 1e which is probably due to ureolysis as a result of the longer residence time in the influent line or in the precipitation reactor no residual ammonium or nitrite were detected in the effluent of the bioreactor fig 1f g apart from accumulations on day 16 21 mg no2 n l 1 day 27 62 mg no2 n l 1 and day 28 16 mg nh4 n l 1 and 89 mg no2 n l 1 resulting from technical upsets the nitrate concentration in the effluent reached 1477 81 mg no3 n l 1 almost double compared to the test on a 20 urine solution fig 1h again 91 of the cod was removed but due to the higher influent concentration the cod in the effluent was more than twice higher 158 mg cod l 1 instead of 65 mg cod l 1 compared to the period on a 20 urine solution 3 2 3 halotolerance of the nitrifying biofilm the short term effect of a higher ec on maximum ureolysis nitritation and nitratation rates was investigated in a batch experiment in which the beads were exposed to short term salt stress by adding a salt mix of nacl and nano3 the ureolysis rate decreased by 52 from 1249 mg n l 1 d 1 at an ec of 20 ms cm 1 to 600 mg n l 1 d 1 at an ec of 96 ms cm 1 fig 2 the nitritation rate was barely affected at low ec 58 ms cm 1 but decreased with 77 between an ec of 58 ms cm 1 and 96 ms cm 1 the nitratation activity decreased almost linearly p 3e 8 r2 of 0 91 with more than 96 between 20 and 96 ms cm 1 the ureolysis nitritation ratio increased whereas the nitratation nitritation ratio decreased at higher salt concentrations although the nob activity was most severely affected at high ec nitritation remained the rate limiting process 3 2 4 microbial community composition the microbial community colonising the beads in the cultivation reactor cr and pilot reactor pr was followed up over time through next generation 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to track the influence of a synthetic urine solution versus the complex urine matrix the microbial community at phylum level was dominated by proteobacteria 70 10 and bacteroidetes 23 9 while acidobacteria gradually increased over time up to 15 in the pr figure s7 the most abundant families were moraxellaceae comamonadaceae xanthomonadaceae chitinophagaceae and the most prevalent genera included acinetobacter luteimonas nitrosomonas and comamonas figure s8 s9 approximately 30 of the community could not be classified at the genus level the most dominant otus operational taxonomic unit were related to acinetobacter venetianus otu1 comamonas sp otu2 luteimonas aquatica otu3 and nitrosomonas sp otu4 table s2 figure s10 a principle coordinate analysis pcoa of the microbial community on the beads of the cr and pr at the otu level fig 3 revealed how the reactor specific microbial community developed over time after start up and stabilisation samples originating from the same reactor cr or pr are clustered together cr operated using a synthetic influent was characterized by the dominance of acinetobacter on the other hand comamonas luteimonas and ferruginibacter were more characteristic for pr figure s9 samples of pr were more scattered and the observed shifts coincided with shifts in the influent composition as demonstrated by the arrows in fig 3 acinetobacter comamonas and ferruginibacter became more estabilished on the beads when the influent was shifted from the urea solution to real urine whereas azoarcus and dokdonella disappeared during operation using a 20 urine solution the relative abundance of luteimonas and nitrosomonas gradually increased changing the influent back to a synthetic nh4 2so4 solution between the two experiments to maintain the microbial culture resulted in a decreased relative abundance of acinetobacter and further increased abundance of luteimonas feeding the pr with a 40 urine solution afterwards led to an increased enrichment of comamonas on the beads nitrosomonas was the sole known aob genus present in the cr and pr with a total relative abundance around 7 further classification using ncbi blast rdp seqmatch and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree indicated that the key players in the aob community were closely related to n aestuarii n marina n europaea and n ureae table s2 figure s11 s12 otu4 which showed the highest sequence identity to n aestuarii marina was the most abundant aob with relative abundances reaching up to 90 in some samples interestingly otu24 most similar to n europaea which is only moderately halotolerant was replaced by more halophilic n aestuarii marina ureae like organisms in the pr when the influent was shifted from a synthetic influent to real urine when the influent was changed back to a synthetic nh4 2so4 solution otu81 and otu91 most similar to n halophila and n ureae respectively proportionally increased but disappeared when the reactor was operated again on real urine 40 158 bradyrhizobiaceae family including nob related otus were found in the microbial community but individual otus were 1 of the sequenced community figure s8 neither qpcr gave sufficient results to draw conclusions from 3 3 electrodialysis 3 3 1 operation using a 20 urine solution the effluent of the bioreactor with an ec of 10 5 1 2 ms cm 1 was fed into the ed to concentrate the nutrients the predominant ions in the feed stream of the ed were sodium of which 75 originates from the naoh dosage in the precipitation reactor and nitrification reactor nitrate due to nitrification chloride and potassium fig 4a by applying an electric field on average 4 1 l d 1 of diluate with an ec of 5 1 1 8 ms cm 1 and 0 7 l d 1 of concentrate with an ec around 50 ms cm 1 was produced the average recovery efficiencies fig 4c varied between 40 and 74 with the highest efficiency for sulphate 74 followed by potassium 71 and nitrate 70 only 40 of the phosphate in the feed stream was transported to the concentrate stream sodium and nitrate made up the largest fraction of the transported ions corresponding to respectively 47 and 35 of the total molar transport whereas phosphate and sulphate contributed less than 1 to the absolute molar transport in general the concentrations in the concentrate were 4 5 times higher than the concentrations in the feed stream fig 4d while only phosphate had a lower concentration factor 2 6 3 3 2 operation using a 40 urine solution increasing the urine concentration from a 20 to a 40 urine solution almost doubled the ion concentrations and the ec of the feed stream to the ed but the volumetric salt loading rate remained the same fig 4b table s3 ed produced on average 2 8 l d 1 diluate and 0 7 l d 1 concentrate with an ec value of around 5 5 and 60 ms cm 1 respectively the recovery efficiencies increased by 7 14 but the concentration factors of each ion decreased fig 4c d the coulombic efficiency is compared in table s3 3 3 3 influence of ph on phosphate transport in ed the recovery efficiency of phosphate in ed was significantly lower compared to the other ions transfer of phosphate through membranes is challenging due to its large size high molecular mass and large hydration shell resulting in a high stokes radius and low diffusion rate in water table s5 it was hypothesized that the phosphate transfer to the concentrate could be enhanced by increasing the ph in the diluate since the dominant phosphate species shifts from h2po4 to hpo4 2 between a ph of 6 and 8 table s6 generally the higher the charge of an ion the more the ion is susceptible to the electric field and thus the larger the driving force in the bulk solution nernst planck this hypothesis was addressed in a batch experiment in which three different ph values were tested since nitrate and chloride removal should not be ph dependent these ions were used as a reference to confirm whether the difference in recovery efficiency of phosphate could be attributed to the ph difference and not to technical variability between the tests phosphate transfer was clearly influenced by the ph as opposed to nitrate and chloride transfer fig 5 s14 after an electric charge of 2500 coulomb c had passed through the ed 29 54 and 31 of phosphate was removed from the diluate at a ph of 6 7 and 8 respectively yielding ph 7 as optimum 3 4 recovery of n p and k the aim of this study was to determine the recovery potential of the nutrients in urine based on the performance of the pilot installation during operation using a 20 urine solution on average 32 of the phosphate p was captured in precipitates in total 64 of the nitrogen 22 of the phosphorus and 70 of the potassium were captured in the concentrate on average 29 of the nitrogen 33 of the phosphorus and 30 of the potassium remained in the diluate fig 6a c s13 about 8 of the nitrogen was not recovered as mentioned in section 3 2 1 the concentrate contained on average 3 7 g no3 n l 1 1 5 g k l 1 and 0 06 g po4 3 p l 1 on a 40 urine solution 29 of the phosphate p was captured in precipitates in total 70 of the nitrogen 38 of the phosphate p and 83 of the potassium were captured in the concentrate on average 17 of the nitrogen 32 of the phosphate p and 17 of the potassium remained in the diluate fig 6d f about 13 of the nitrogen was lost the concentrate contained on average 5 1 g no3 n l 1 2 3 g k l 1 and 0 06 g po4 3 p l 1 4 discussion 4 1 precipitation and nitrification minimize scaling and biofouling in ed in this study an integrated system combining precipitation nitrification and ed was evaluated to refine and concentrate nutrients from fresh urine operation of this three stage system was successfully demonstrated in a relevant environment corresponding to level 6 on the technology readiness level trl scale the use of a precipitation reactor proved to be an effective strategy to safeguard the ed from excessive scaling more than 90 of the calcium and 80 of the magnesium was precipitated and no scaling was observed in the ed unit both the precipitation and nitrification reactor require base addition in the precipitation reactor approximately 215 mmol naoh l 1 urine was dosed to increase the ph to 11 in the nitrification reactor base is needed to counteract the acidification caused by nitrification without base addition maximally 50 of the nitrogen in urine can be converted into nitrate udert et al 2003a in principle base addition in the precipitation reactor does not increase the total base consumption as a more alkaline influent entering the bioreactor reduces the amount of alkaline equivalents required in the bioreactor to counteract the acidification in total about 300 mmol naoh l 1 urine was needed to convert all urea into nitrate of which only one third was dosed in the nitrification reactor the use of a bioreactor proved to be an effective strategy to limit biofouling in ed by oxidizing the cod moreover uncharged urea was converted into nitrate in order to stabilise the urine and to capture the nitrogen in a non volatile form in ed although the total nitrogen concentration in the influent fluctuated due to the variable composition of urine stable nitrification was achieved in the bioreactor with an average volumetric nitrogen loading rate of 215 mg n l 1 reactor d 1 and a salinity of 10 5 ms cm 1 only after reactor disturbances due to failure of the ph control or influent dosing problems ammonium was detected in the bioreactor effluent nitrifiers quickly recovered once the optimal conditions were restored bacteria grown in a biofilm are generally more protected to transient stressors such as a low ph and high free ammonia concentration due to diffusion limitations ikuma et al 2013 moreover nitritation which causes the acidification is generally hampered by a low ph presumably due to a limited atp generation fumasoli et al 2015 in addition besides precipitation and protection of the subsequent ed the precipitation reactor was also used to increase the alkalinity of the nitrification reactor influent as a consequence we never observed the ph dropping below 5 5 in case of ph control failure it is in this respect also noteworthy that the cultivation reactor was ph controlled solely by providing sufficient alkalinity in the feed and not by a ph controller ed was used to concentrate nutrients in an energy efficient manner the concentrate flow was generated by osmotic and electro osmotic water transport across the membrane and contained about 70 of the ions of the feed stream the increase in concentrate ec and obtained concentration factors of 3 5 are in line with results obtained by pronk et al 2007 periodic cleaning in place once a month with an acid and alkaline solution was sufficient to keep the ed stack operational 7 months with the same membranes and a stable performance such cleaning can easily be automated however the anion exchange membranes turned brown figure s15 which was also reported by aponte and colon 2001 this is probably due to irreversible adsorption of negatively charged organic molecules aponte and colon 2001 4 2 nitrification and cod oxidation remained unaffected at a decreased urine dilution the high salt content of urine and base addition leads to a high ec in the bioreactor living in a salty environment is an energetically costly process for bacteria since more energy is required to balance the cell osmotic pressure oren 1999 this limits the energy available for nitrification which typically results in lower activity rates at high ec the salt tolerance of the nitrifying community on the beads was assessed in a batch experiment in which beads were exposed to a short term salt shock the maximum ureolysis nitritation and nitratation rates of the beads decreased with 52 82 and 96 respectively when the ec was increased from 20 ms cm 1 to 96 ms cm 1 interestingly the rate limiting nitritation and hence the overall nitrification rate remained unaffected up to 40 ms cm 1 this also explains why nitrification was not affected during continuous operation using a 40 urine solution despite the higher ec 17 3 ms cm 1 instead of 10 5 ms cm 1 the results of the batch experiment suggest that the bioreactor can operate on undiluted urine expected ec between 45 and 60 ms cm 1 but at a lower volumetric rate although this should be tested on the long term the relatively high salt resistance of the beads is probably a result of the inoculum selection coppens et al 2016 the higher drop in nitratation rate indicates that the nob on the beads were more sensitive to the short term salt stress than the aob literature is inconclusive concerning the salt tolerance of aob versus nob due to differences in experimental set up operational conditions and test duration salt dosage and aob and nob community composition moussa et al 2006 moussa et al 2006 and coppens et al 2016 reported that aob were more sensitive to salt stress on the other hand bassin et al 2011 dincer and kargi 1999 cui et al 2009 and cortes lorenzo et al 2015 concluded based on the accumulation of nitrite in their experiments that nob were more affected by salinity 4 3 shifts in microbial community composition parallel shifts in influent composition the shifts in microbial community composition in the pilot reactor coincided with changes in the influent composition as shown by pcoa analysis fig 3 and may be attributed to the nature of the organic fraction in the influent acetate in synthetic medium versus complex cod matrix in urine in addition salinity is known to affect the microbial community composition in nitrification reactors bassin et al 2012 coppens et al 2016 cortes lorenzo et al 2015 gonzalez silva 2016 moussa et al 2006 classification using ncbi blast rdp seqmatch and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree indicated that the aob community was dominated by species closely related to n aestuarii or n marina both species are obligate halophilic and described in marine environments koops et al 1991 n aestuarii was also found to be the dominating aob species in reactors operated on seawater gonzalez silva 2016 sudarno et al 2010 the presence of these halophilic aob species can also explain why the nitritation activity was so well preserved at high ec in the batch experiment besides salinity the shifts in the aob community in the pilot reactor corresponded to the nitrogen source urea n or ammonium n otus related to the urease negative n europaea and n halophila koops et al 1991 only thrived when the reactor was operated using a synthetic ammonium sulphate solution 4 4 lowering the urine dilution leads to a higher recovery efficiency but a lower concentration factor in ed increasing the urine concentration from 20 to 40 decreased the volume ratio of diluate to concentrate from 5 8 to 4 due to the higher ec gradient between the diluate and concentrate and the increased transport of ions from diluate to concentrate the osmotic and electro osmotic water transport increased hence relatively more concentrate was produced on a 40 urine solution depending on the ion the recovery efficiency increased by 7 14 which is probably due to the higher residence time in the diluate tank 14 h instead of 8 h despite the higher end concentrations and overall ec of the concentrate on a 40 urine solution the concentration factors decreased as a result of the higher ion concentrations in the feed stream to conclude more nutrients were captured in the concentrate but in a comparatively larger concentrate volume 4 5 strategies to increase nutrient recovery efficiencies respectively 70 and 80 of the ions were captured in 15 and 20 of the initial volume when the pilot installation was operated using a 20 or 40 urine solution it is almost impossible to capture all nutrients in the concentrate as a result of the equilibrium established between the diluate and concentrate stream part of the nutrients remain in the diluate additionally relatively low concentration factors ion concentration in the concentrate stream devided by the concentration in the feed stream present a second limitation inherent to ed due to the osmotic and electro osmotic water transport a high concentration gradient between the diluate and the concentrate leads to increased osmotic water transport from diluate to concentrate and back diffusion of ions from concentrate to diluate which in turn limits the maximum achievable concentration factor in case of phosphate the large size and low diffusion rate of the ion limits the recovery efficiency to 40 as opposed to 70 75 for all other ions corresponding to a concentration factor of only 2 6 it was hypothesized that the phosphate transport would increase by increasing the ph in the diluate since more phosphate ions are dissociated at a higher ph which could facilitate the transport as the ions are more susceptible to the electric field the recovery efficiency of phosphate in the batch test at ph 7 was indeed higher compared to ph 6 the slower phosphate transport at ph 8 compared to ph 7 can possibly be attributed to competition in migration with carbonate ions like phosphate the charge of carbonate depends on the ph most of the carbonate is uncharged h2co3 at ph 6 while more than 90 of the carbonate species have a charge of 1 hco3 at ph 8 table s7 further research is needed to confirm the hypothesis of reduced phosphorus transport due to carbonate competition at elevated ph another way to recover more phosphorus is to precipitate all the phosphorus in the precipitation reactor phosphorus precipitation is limited by calcium and magnesium due to the excess of anions phosphate sulphate and carbonate in urine by substituting naoh by ca oh 2 or mg oh 2 to increase the ph in the precipitation reactor or adding another calcium or magnesium source up to 90 of the phosphate can be precipitated etter et al 2011 however excess calcium or magnesium dosage should be avoided to prevent scaling issues in the ed unit decreasing the concentrate volume by means of distillation is an option to concentrate the nutrients in a smaller volume distillation was already applied by udert and wachter 2012 in combination with nitrification to concentrate nutrients in urine all nutrients were recovered in a dry solid however the high energy demand of distillation 700 whprimary energy l 1 urine presents a major drawback of the process the energy consumption of ed is significantly lower the electrode power consumption of ed in this study equalled only 4 3 whelectrical energy l 1 urine or 14 whprimary energy l 1 urine table s4 however ed removed only 88 of the water whereas distillation can remove almost all water udert and wachter 2012 suggested that the energy demand could be significantly reduced by first removing 80 of the water with reverse osmosis and subsequently operating distillation with vapor compression 100 wh l 1 urine alternatively the required 80 water removal could be obtained by ed instead of ro as demonstrated in this study to conclude a combination of precipitation nitrification ed and distillation could offer a maximal concentration of nutrients with a minimal input of energy 4 6 resource reuse possibilities for precipitate ed concentrate and ed diluate the output of the integrated system consists of the precipitates formed in the precipitation reactor and the diluate and concentrate stream of the ed unit the precipitates could be used as a solid phosphorus fertilizer in agriculture about 30 of the phosphate in urine was incorporated in the precipitates which corresponds to values reported in literature udert et al 2006 the use of urine derived precipitates as fertilizer has been demonstrated by bonvin et al 2015 moreover it was reported by escher et al 2006 and ronteltap et al 2007 that urine precipitates were clean and safe fertilizers since the micropollutants in urine pharmaceuticals hormones mainly remained in the liquid phase the ed concentrate is rich in nutrients predominantly nitrogen npk 85 9 0 7 13 4 mol which is present under the form of nitrate nitrate in contrast to urea ammonia or ammonium nitrate is a thermally stable non volatile molecule and in a lot of cases the preferred nitrogen source for plants marschner 1995 udert and wachter 2012 besides nitrogen plant growth requirements are also met for potassium whereas phosphorus will be the limiting macronutrient in the ed concentrate due to the partial incorporation in the precipitates larsen et al 2013 the excessive salt concentration particularly sodium resulting from the naoh demand by precipitation and nitrification might present another barrier for fertilizer application in this regards partial nitrification is a promising new lead to reduce the sodium load simultaneously saving chemicals udert and wachter 2012 the dense nature of the ed membranes typically results in a high retention of pathogens and micropollutants in the diluate escher et al 2006 pronk et al 2006b pronk and kone 2009 however pronk et al 2006a showed that breakthrough of certain micropollutants e g propranolol and ibuprofen can occur over time to guarantee a micropollutant free product a post treatment such as ozonation or adsorption on activated carbon can be included to remove the residual micropollutants in the concentrate dodd et al 2008 larsen et al 2013 pronk et al 2007 udert et al 2016 ozonation is even more effective in combination with a nitrate based cod low stream given the ozone scavenging potential of ammonium and competition between cod and micropollutants for the chemical oxidant larsen et al 2013 pronk et al 2007 finally the ed diluate is low in nutrients and salts which makes it a suitable stream for water recovery through membrane filtration as particularly relevant for regenerative life support systems for human space exploration clauwaert et al 2017 lindeboom et al 2015 5 conclusion an electrodialysis ed stack was operated for 7 months on real diluted urine the use of a precipitation reactor and aerobic bioreactor proved to be an effective strategy to minimize scaling and biofouling in ed more than 90 and 95 of incoming cod and urea were converted in the bioreactor at salinities of 10 20 ms cm 1 shifts in the microbial community coincided with changes in the influent composition of the bioreactor the aob community was dominated by species closely related to nitrosomonas aestuarii and nitrosomonas marina respectively 70 and 80 of the ions were captured in 15 and 20 of the initial volume when the pilot installation was operated using a 20 or 40 urine solution the p rich precipitates and n k rich ed concentrate can be valorised as fertilizers whereas water can be recovered from the ed diluate further research on the fate of micropollutants and pathogens in the three stage system is necessary to valorise the recovered fertilizers declarations of interest none acknowledgements this article has been made possible through

19352,pathogen contamination is a major cause of surface water impairment in the united states and fecal bacteria levels are typically used to evaluate microbial loading in bodies of water environmental models are considered a useful tool for evaluating watershed management practices in this study we assessed e coli contamination of the upper stroubles creek virginia usa using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the study area has been declared an impaired body of water due to recent bacterial contamination bacterial source characterizations play a critical role in such modeling exercises and especially in the case of non point sources as the swat model involves bacteria load estimation at a hydrological response unit hru level we use the spatially explicit load enrichment calculation tool select for our e coli load estimations we also evaluate current approaches to the measurement of bacterial interactions of the sediment water interface using swat and the frequent measurements of streambed e coli concentrations for the simulation of in stream e coli concentrations using estimates drawn from select without with sediment bacteria resuspension deposition nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 41 to 0 34 0 19 to 0 36 are found moreover in stream e coli concentrations measured at flow duration intervals show that the model frequently overestimates mid range flows while underestimating low range flows even with model improvements the use of high resolution e coli loads and the consideration of sediment bacteria resuspension deposition processes generated higher e coli concentrations for forested areas compared to those of urban and pasture lands suggesting the importance of using detailed bacteria load estimations and land use information when assessing e coli distribution in the environment keywords swat bacteria e coli source characterization resuspension 1 introduction the contamination of surface waters by pathogenic bacteria has become a major concern in managing the water quality of rivers lakes and wetlands pathogen contamination is typically evaluated from levels of fecal indicator bacteria fib anderson et al 2005 benham et al 2006a cho et al 2012 kim et al 2017 russo et al 2011 while the presence of elevated fib levels does not necessarily denote the occurrence of pathogen contamination pachepsky et al 2014 elevated levels are considered an indicator of the hygienic status of a water body cho et al 2016b the failure to meet standards related to pathogen contamination is a leading cause of surface water impairment in the united states usepa 2016 such water impairments are primarily addressed using total maximum daily load tmdl standards usepa 2016 which are associated with higher costs even in the planning phase liao et al 2015 environmental models of bacteria deposition and transport can facilitate the cost effective prediction of microbial quality levels and the evaluation of management practices watershed scale models such as the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1997 and soil and water assessment tool swat sadeghi and jeffrey 2002 are generally used to model bacteria contamination the identification of bacteria sources and the estimation of loads play a key role in modeling teague et al 2009 point sources are considered as single identifiable sources hill 2010 noaa 2008 which are a significant source of human enteric bacteria petersen et al 2005 wastewater treatment plants wwtps and confined animal feeding operations cafos are two of the most widely known contributors of fecal bacteria to streams non point source nps contamination can occur with the failure of septic systems and the deposition of animal feces which are typically transported to streams via sub surface leaching or surface runoff the characterization of non point sources is vital to optimal watershed modeling teague et al 2009 the spatially diffuse nature of non point sources renders such characterization challenging and several tools have been developed to address this issue for instance zeckoski et al 2005 developed a spreadsheet tool for estimating sub watershed level nps bacteria loads however such methods fail to spatially represent non point sources at a higher resolution teague et al 2009 developed the spatially explicit load enrichment calculation tool select for the characterization of bacteria sources as the select can be used to make grid level rasterized high resolution bacteria load estimations based primarily on land use data the tool offers more flexibility in the assimilation of nps source loads into watershed models for instance in the swat model surface runoff and water quality elements are calculated at the hydrological response unit hru level and then these elements are combined at the sub watershed level neitsch et al 2009 hrus are defined by geophysical attributes such as land use soil and slope characteristics the flexibility of the select methodology facilitates estimation at the hru level watershed scale models play an important role in the tmdl development process which are effectively used for the identification of prominent sources of contaminants and for the evaluation of different remediation strategies benham et al 2006a b however microbial deposition and transport processes according to these models assume that bacteria act as a single discrete free floating organism at nearly neutral buoyancy and are subject to first order die off effects partyka et al 2016 russo et al 2011 several studies have shown that sediment beds can act as bacteria reservoirs harboring 10 to 10000 times more fib than the water columns of various environments an et al 2002 buckley et al 1998 pandey et al 2012 van donsel and geldreich 1971 for instance liao et al 2014 reported that streambed sediments harbor 40 to 350 times the e coli concentrations and 7 to 580 times the enterococci concentrations of the overlying water column of the upper stroubles creek a tributary to the new river close to blacksburg virginia streambed microorganisms can be released into the overlying water column as sediments are suspended resulting in a multi fold increase in bacteria in the water muirhead et al 2004 nagels et al 2002 wilkinson et al 1995 several researchers have adopted algorithms to include streambed bacteria resuspension and deposition in current watershed scale models kim et al 2010 liao et al 2015 pandey et al 2016 russo et al 2011 kim et al 2010 improved the swat model by applying bacteria resuspension and deposition algorithms the maximum sediment carrying capacity of a channel was computed as a function of peak stream velocity for channel erosion to occur transport capacity levels must be high and the sediment load carried by the stream from upland processes must be lower than the capacity streambed sediment associated e coli concentrations were determined by fitting a function to observed streambed bacteria data due to a lack of understanding of e coli population dynamics in sediments baffaut and sadeghi 2010 though the methodology provided by kim et al 2010 was used by several subsequent studies making other improvements to the model cho et al 2012 2016a hong et al 2017 kim et al 2017 park et al 2017 the algorithms have not been evaluated using an extensive observed dataset for instance cho et al 2012 used a calibrated value of sediment bacteria concentrations due to a lack of observed data moreover kim et al 2017 used the same sine function as kim et al 2010 with calibrated coefficients to compute sediment e coli concentrations as models are extensively used in decision making and policy formulations on water quality related aspects of water resource management discussions of model uncertainty are important parajuli et al 2009b sharpley et al 2002 parameter uncertainties of bacteria deposition and transport related to the swat model have been discussed extensively by parajuli et al 2009a b recently effects of equifinality in hydrological models beven 2006 have become a central issue of various areas of hydrology ficklin and barnhart 2014 poulin et al 2011 schwartz and smith 2014 for instance ficklin and barnhart 2014 used a selected number of parameter sets to explore the implications of parameter uncertainty the present study applies the select approach to estimate hru level e coli loads in the swat model and evaluates sediment bacteria resuspension where the shear stress can be higher due to interactions between sediment bound bacteria and streambed of the bacteria deposition and transport model from high resolution temporal sediment e coli concentration data we hypothesize that the swat model with improved source characterizations and considering sediment bacteria resuspension can simulate in stream e coli concentrations at different flow duration intervals and for heterogeneous land cover types we used the swat model to simulate in stream bacteria concentrations with improved algorithms to gain insight into bacteria input estimations model processes and parameter uncertainties of a highly urbanized watershed the upper stroubles creek the objectives of this study are a to evaluate the inclusion of bacteria sediment interactions through a high resolution zero threshold for land use soil slope in the segmentation of hrus swat model of a watershed of mixed land use mostly urban b to determine nps bacteria load estimations and to input them into swat model inputs c to understand the model s setup at different flow duration intervals and d to better understand the impacts of land use and land cover in simulating bacteria released from upland catchments 2 study area our study focuses on the upper stroubles creek a tributary to the new river in southwest virginia within a watershed covering an area of 31 km2 it is located in the ridge and valley ecoregion of virginia fig 1 a the upper stroubles creek begins in the vicinity of the town of blacksburg virginia and flows through the virginia tech blacksburg campus and drains into the new river the upper stroubles creek is a predominantly urban stream 49 land use coverage with 11 km of its reaches declared impaired for exceedances in e coli standards vadeq 2015 the remainder of the watershed is a mixture of forested land 30 pastureland 16 and cropland 4 fig 1b annual precipitation varies from 745 mm to 1245 mm with an average of 980 mm 2005 2015 for the ten year period of 2005 2015 22 1 23 6 and 24 1 of annual average precipitation fell during the winter spring and fall seasons respectively and 30 2 of precipitation fell in the summer season the average temperature in the winter is roughly 3 7 c and that of the summer is 21 2 c for the same period daily flow measurements collected at the b3 gauge site from 2011 to 2013 record an average flow rate of 0 19 m3 s for the summer and of 0 17 m3 s for the winter 3 methods we used grid based nps bacteria load estimations based on the select methodology to estimate hru level bacteria inputs a watershed scale model for the upper stroubles creek was then developed using the swat fig 1c we employed algorithms proposed by kim et al 2010 and evaluated the modified model using an extensive observed e coli dataset furthermore we adopted the approach developed by ficklin and barnhart 2014 to assess parameter uncertainty levels of the existing and modified swat bacteria deposition and transport models 3 1 e coli source load estimation and preparation of inputs for the swat model the identification of e coli sources in a watershed is the first step to estimating the bacteria load the spatially explicit methodology select described in riebschleager et al 2012 and borel et al 2015 was used for the estimation of daily potential e coli loads from all potential e coli sources the e coli source characterization method based on the select approach is illustrated in fig 2 a the analysis was performed at a 30 m resolution similar to that of nlcd 2011 land use data the estimation process was based on the land use data primary e coli sources can be divided into two segments sources from animals pets wildlife and farm animals and human 3 1 1 pets wildlife and farm animals for urban areas the number of dogs was estimated assuming that 70 of the households in urban areas have at least one dog due to a reduction in the student population during the summer in the college town end of may to mid august 25 of e coli loadings from dogs were reduced for that time period using swat management options waterfowl are considered a significant source of pathogens in the upper stroubles creek liao et al 2016 and includes ducks and geese and a majority of waterfowl dwell near the duck pond shown in fig 1c in addition to waterfowl muskrats and beavers are present along the upper stroubles creek data on the white tailed deer population the predominant wildlife source in the watershed were obtained from vdgif 2015 wild turkeys skunks and raccoons were also considered in our analysis due to their presence in the watershed estimates of the number of farm animals and of wildlife levels though not for deer populations were obtained from liao et al 2015 and liao et al 2014 most pasturelands in the watershed are owned and managed by virginia tech for farm animals beef cattle dairy cattle swine horses sheep and turkeys were considered and this data could be extrapolated from virginia tech stocking information from our field visits and interviews it was assumed that grazing occurs for 218 days after april 1st of each year regarding agricultural land it was assumed that manure from dairy cows is applied to croplands in the study area at the start of the crop season in the upper stroubles creek area virginia tech uses the land to cultivate crops during the crop growing season running from may to october hence manure application was considered for the period of february to april 3 1 2 human sources the failure of septic systems is a significant source from which e coli enters natural waters a residential address list and map of sewage lines in the town of blacksburg were obtained smith and brooks 2012 a list of addresses of the watershed area was obtained and addresses connected to the wwtp were modeled as such and those addresses not connected to the wwtp were assumed to have on site sewage facilities ossfs for each of the recognized households a constant sewage discharge volume of 70 gallons per day was applied to the model borel et al 2015 while the ossf failure rate was assumed as 15 while the data are scarce for onsite sewer systems failing the literature referred from virginia including the virginia department of health and other sources suggest that the failing percentage assumed in this study to be conservative https www census gov hhes www housing census historic sewage html for instance in virginia 28 of households are adopting oss and a fraction of them was assumed as failing systems as most of the recognized units are single household units the effect of a reduction in the population in the summer was not included in the model inputs however it is estimated that roughly 25000 students of virginia tech live within the town limits of blacksburg while the total estimated population is roughly 42000 in 2010 blacksburg town council 2014 3 2 hydrology module inputs of the swat model were developed using the 10 m resolution dem drawn from the usgs national elevation dataset using 1 km resolution soil data drawn from statsgo database and using 30 m resolution land use data drawn from nlcd 2011 the watershed was delineated into 30 sub watersheds that included 1117 hrus by using zero thresholds for land use soil and slopes though streamflow simulations have been found to be insensitive to the high resolution delineation of hrus bingner et al 1997 chen and mackay 2004 fitzhugh and mackay 2000 manguerra and engel 1998 in this study hru delineation offered at the highest resolution at which to designate e coli source loads of the model in a detailed manner the hru thresholds can impact the representation of non point source loadings of a certain land use type and its hydrological characteristics temperature data were obtained from the national weather service office nws in blacksburg virginia and daily precipitation data were obtained from kentland farm located in the vicinity for the calibration 1 jan 2011 and 31 dec 2012 and validation 1 jan 2013 and 31 dec 2013 of streamflow we used stream stage data measured at the virginia tech stream research education and management laboratory stream lab that included at least one wet year and one dry year to ensure that the model properly captured wet and dry weather related hydrological properties resop and hession 2010 thompson et al 2012 hourly streamflow measurements were obtained at b1 fig 1c and these data were then averaged as daily streamflow measurements 3 3 sediment and bacteria modules of the existing swat model the swat model uses the modified version of the universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 to simulate erosion caused by rainfall and runoff neitsch et al 2009 to calculate the maximum amount of sediment transported within a reach the swat model uses a simplified version of the bagnold stream power equation bagnold 1977 neitsh et al 2009 however it is not able to keep track of sediment pools of various particle sizes neitsch et al 2009 ch eqn 0 in our study musle parameters were calibrated by using previously published sediment loadings for each specific land use area vadeq and vadcr 2003 streambed and in stream e coli concentrations were obtained from four bacteria monitoring sites dpin dpout b1 and b3 the swat computes bacteria levels across land areas at the hru level and the deposition and transport of bacteria is simulated in three segments as foliage soil solution and soil particles the swat model computes ground cover using the leaf area index lai and a complementary error function ground cover percentages affect the amount of manure placed on foliage and soil a user defined fraction governs the wash off value from bacteria landing on foliage wash off from foliage to soil occurs when daily precipitation exceeds 2 54 mm and then it is combined with bacteria in the soil solution where a partition coefficient computes the amount of bacteria attached to soil particles when runoff occurs in the hru bacteria levels in overland flow are computed based on runoff volumes soil bulk density levels bacteria available in soil solutions and a bacteria partitioning coefficient for runoff benham et al 2006b some bacteria in the soil solution are leached into the soil profile and bacteria percolated into the first soil layer are considered a loss to the system the swat bacteria deposition and transport model assume that bacteria die off according to chick s law the model allows the user to define die off and regrowth rates at hru level segments foliage soil solution and soil particles while the in stream bacteria fate model only measures die off rates at hru level segments the overall rate of bacteria loss is computed as a die off rate that is less than the re growth rate in this study only die off rates were introduced at the hru level as in numerous previous studies iudicello and chin 2015 kim et al 2010 parajuli et al 2009a b the existing bacteria module of the swat offers no provisions for capturing effects of the deposition and resuspension of sediment associated bacteria on bacteria concentrations in an overlying water column kim et al 2010 as noted in our introduction we evaluated the previously published modified swat bacteria module kim et al 2010 developed to capture effects of the deposition and resuspension of sediment associated bacteria 3 4 swat modified bacteria module kim et al 2010 used an earlier version of the swat swat2005 to consider sediment bacteria resuspensions we used swat2012 rev 664 wherein the subroutine that routes sediment from sub basins to basin outlets rtsed f has been revised from the earlier swat2005 fig 2b the ch eqn 0 option uses the simplified bagnold stream power equation to compute sediment transport capacities of a given channel when compared to swat2005 in swat2012 sediment

national elevation dataset ned the ssurgo soil dataset nlcd 2011 land use data and weather data the model was calibrated from the streamflow at bridge 1 a sensitivity analysis on 29 flow related parameters was conducted using the swat cup program abbaspour et al 2007 and 8 parameters were selected for calibration by sensitivity ranking and manual verification jin and sridhar 2012 the selected parameters and their descriptions are presented in table 1 the streamflow simulation was calibrated using daily observed streamflow patterns for january 1 2011 to december 31 2012 at site b1 and an accuracy level of 0 61 nse was obtained the calibration period includes one dry year 2011 and one wet year 2012 to ensure the model s capacity to capture both high and low flow conditions results of the calibration and validation of daily streamflow based on parameter set 1 are shown in fig 3 a the equifinality or non uniqueness of the model results in the generation of streamflow simulations of the same accuracy for different parameter sets according to swat bacteria deposition and transport processes surface runoff plays a major role in releasing bacteria into streams and is the only mechanism that transports land bacteria to streams in the swat hence the evaluation of water balance components surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow etc for different parameter sets based on streamflow simulations of the same accuracy may reduce parameter uncertainty levels of bacteria deposition and transport we selected five parameter sets that yielded satisfactory nash sutcliffe efficiency nse levels for the daily streamflow results table 2 we evaluated average monthly water balance components from the parameter sets to examine whether significant differences exist among them the difference found between monthly water balance components of the parameter sets is negligible as high flows are associated with storm events which can release contaminants including bacteria into streams we evaluated the performance of simulation of high flows observed daily streamflows of higher than the 90th percentile were considered high flows roughly 0 32 m3 s the performance of the high flow simulation was evaluated and all of the selected parameter sets performed similarly r2 0 46 as overall performance levels were reasonably good parameter set 1 was selected for the evaluation of the bacteria deposition and transport model as the observed sediment data for the stroubles creek were not available we used previously published sediment loadings per unit of area for each land use published in a previous sediment tmdl report vadeq and vadcr 2003 sediment loadings were calculated using the universal soil loss equation usle with a delivery ratio as noted in the methods section the swat uses the musle to estimate erosion eliminating the need for a delivery ratio neitsh et al 2009 the sediment loading estimates of vadeq and vadcr 2003 were used to compute average annual sediment yields of the sub basin level the computed average annual sediment yields were used to calibrate musle parameters of the swat model we used the usle equation support practice factor usle p in range of 0 1 1 0 and the usle equation soil erodibility factor usle k within a range of relative change of 50 to 50 results of the calibration of annual average sediment yields of the sub basin level are illustrated in fig 3b higher annual sediment yields were calculated for pasture dominant sub watersheds simulated sediment yields were underestimated up to 50 for some of the forested sub watersheds sub watersheds 15 and 17 generally better simulated sediment yields were found for urban and pasture dominant sub watersheds 4 2 evaluation of bacteria deposition and transport using the existing swat the observed in stream bacteria concentrations were drawn from dpout dpin b1 and b3 bacteria monitoring sites the temperature adjustment factor thbact see the supplement 1 was set to the same value as in coffey et al 2013 and parajuli et al 2009a b which was obtained by manual calibration and used by kim et al 2010 the swat model allows for the decay and regrowth of bacteria in three sub sections at the hru level in foliage soil solution and soil particles as we are focused on the evaluation of in stream bacteria concentrations bacteria deposition in soil particles was neglected furthermore after dividing soil solutions free floating from soil particles particle sorbed bacteria the model does not simulate any interactions between these two phases bacteria die off rates measured at 20 c from soil solution wdpq and stream water wdprch values were respectively set to 0 659 day 1 and 0 990 day 1 as in kim et al 2010 and were adopted from the bacteria die off review of crane and moore 1986 we calibrated the bacteria partition coefficient of surface runoff bactkdq rather than adopting the value from past research and we included the bacteria decay rate for foliage as a parameter during calibration the width of the edge of field filter strip filterw was not used for the calibration as much of the upper stroubles creek flows through a highly urbanized area thus five parameter sets were selected for the calibration of bacteria deposition and transport in the existing swat2012 table 2 4 3 estimated potential e coli loads the estimated potential e coli loads were distributed among land uses associated with recognized e coli sources as the swat model allows the user to enter bacteria loads at the hru level the land use category of each hru was used to assign bacteria loads using the select methodology in some cases e g bacteria inputs of waterfowl the relative locations of hrus were used as a guiding factor when assigning bacteria loads e g urban areas close to duck pond were considered a key habitat for waterfowl estimated e coli loads for the summer and winter seasons after aggregation at the sub basin level are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that in the summer potential e coli loads are higher in sub basins of mainly pasture land fig 4 b shows that in the winter potential e coli loads are highest in the urban dominant sub basins this difference occurs due to the termination of grazing operations during the grazing period defecation by farm animals can enter the streams through runoff in the winter combined with a reduction in the population during the summer holidays in blacksburg these estimations fall within the range of estimations presented in baffaut and sadeghi 2010 4 4 sediment e coli concentration the streambed e coli concentration obtained from four bacteria monitoring sites dpin dpout b1 and b3w generated a higher number of observations of streambed e coli concentrations from the aforementioned sites 46 50 50 and 50 it should be noted that observations for january were obtained for 2013 while the remaining data were obtained for 2012 these observations cover the entire year and include at least three observations for a given month though not for the dpin site for which data for february were not available we assigned observed average monthly sediment e coli concentrations of each site to corresponding reaches fig 5 a d for other reaches average monthly sediment e coli concentrations were based on all observed sediment e coli concentrations fig 5 e as the sediment e coli concentration for february is not available for the dpin site the average for january and march was used as the value for february e coli concentrations were lowest in winter across all sites generally higher e coli concentrations were found in the summer while similar concentrations were measured during the fall and spring these observations illustrate the slow growth of sediment e coli at low temperatures see supplement 2 4 5 evaluation of bacteria deposition and transport in the swat the sensitivity analysis was conducted using six identified parameters table 3 of the existing swat swat2012 rev 664 in the modified swat model 12 selected parameters were used in the sensitivity analysis our study revealed five parameter sets from the existing and modified swat models that exhibit similar performance in simulating the in stream e coli concentrations tables 4 and 5 though the musle parameters were calibrated from the previously published annual average sediment yield results the reach level sediment routing and channel erosion related parameters were used for the calibration of the modified bacteria deposition and transport model the fitted values of channel erosion related parameters compare favorably set to similar spcon 0 006 spexp 1 250 ch erodmo 0 2 and ch cov2 0 5 values with past findings for the stroubles creek staley 2006 wagner et al 2007 clay content in the sediments was assumed to be the same for all of the reaches the performance of the model was evaluated using the selected approaches via the comparison of observed and simulated values of the same day and the comparison of observed and simulated values for the 3 day window russo et al 2011 for the 3 day window approach the closest model prediction for the chosen day for the day before the sampling date and for the day after the sampling date was compared with the observed data even though this approach may overestimate the model s accuracy the approach is useful in addressing uncertainties at the time of sampling and during a daytime rainfall event liao et al 2015 for both models the most sensitive parameter was identified as the bactkddb parameter a higher bactkddb parameter denotes that a lower volume of bacteria is transported through runoff meaning that a larger portion of bacteria is absorbed into soil particles tang et al 2011 moreover for both the existing and modified models bactkddb parameter takes a value of lower than 0 5 in agreement with kim et al 2010 and kim et al 2017 however this contrasts with parajuli et al 2009a b who reported a higher value 0 90 for the bactkddb parameter the value for the decay in foliage varies within a greater range for both models compared to that of bougeard et al 2011 a decay rate of 0 016 was obtained through our calibration revealing higher foliage decay rates 0 15 and even higher decay rates in the modified model calibration results 0 50 however jones 1986 suggests that bacteria are unlikely to survive on the surfaces of crops due to exposure to desiccation and sunlight sunlight was not considered as a stressor of bacteria decay in this study which may justify the application of higher decay rates to foliage chase et al 2017 and atwill et al 2015 investigated bacterial transfer from fecal deposits to heads of mature lettuce during foliar irrigation and their survival however they reported that microbial contamination were limited to the outer leaves of the head that eventually got discarded during post processing and emphasized the importance of determining the appropriate time for bacterial die off the bactkdq value governs the partitioning of bacteria into a free floating state and sorption to soil particles in surface runoff a higher bactkdq denotes the presence of a higher portion of sorbed bacteria parajuli 2007 the calibration results of the modified model show slightly lower bactkdq values compared to those of the existing model however it should be noted that unlike in the existing swat model bactkdq values present a low sensitivity rank in the modified model wof p and bact swf are fractional parameters that affect the volume of bacteria eventually accumulating in runoff higher wof p and bact swf values denote an increased possibility of higher bacteria content levels being found in runoff in both the existing and modified models wof p values are lower 0 5 in most cases while bact swf values are higher 0 5 in the existing model according to the performance indicators parameter set 1 was selected for the existing swat model while parameter set 2 was selected for the modified model for further discussion fig 6 compares the observed and simulated in stream bacteria concentrations derived from the existing and modified swat models for the dpin and dpout sites while comparisons of the other two sites are not shown here these results were similar to those for the dpout site the comparisons presented in fig 6 a vs b and c vs d clearly show increased levels of model accuracy with the refinement of modeling techniques employed in this study however fig 5 b shows that the addition of e coli into the water column at the dpin site by streambed release was not sufficient to simulate higher levels of in stream e coli concentrations at the site as is illustrated in fig 7 a at the dpin site observed in stream e coli concentrations remained higher under both high and low flow conditions the dpout site fig 7 b on the other hand presented lower in stream e coli concentrations under low flow conditions elevated levels of e coli observed over low flow duration intervals are typically an indication of the presence of a point source upstream as a permitted point source was not found at the upstream of dpin site contaminant leakage from storm drains may act as a point source furthermore a large portion of the upstream dpin site is covered and diverges underground and thus lower die off rates resulting from reduced sunlight levels may contribute to increased e coli concentrations observed at the dpin parece et al 2010 fig 8 a and b show that the existing model produced null values for in stream e coli concentrations for a considerable period nearly 73 of the days in the existing model more than 90 of the positive 0 simulated in stream bacteria concentrations were reported for rainy days for the winter this percentage reached nearly 75 while it approached 100 in the summer the simulation of e coli wash off levels from foliage for days with rainfall levels of more than 2 54 mm and higher lai values for the summer caused this difference between seasonal simulations this can be attributed to the fact that higher lai values cause more bacteria to adhere to plant foliage due to enhanced ground cover levels we analyzed errors from the results of the modified swat model using all five selected parameter sets the resulting overestimations and underestimations of simulated in stream e coli concentrations were summarized by hydrologic condition class usepa 2007 hydrological conditions were defined by flow duration intervals as 0 10 high flows 10 40 moist conditions 40 60 mid range conditions 60 90 dry conditions and 90 100 low flows fig 9 fig 9 a shows a larger number of underestimations for dry and low flow conditions 80 and 58 respectively relative to the observed in stream e coli concentrations for moderate flow conditions the prevalence of overestimations is high 66 moreover for most of the cases e coli generated through streambed release and the absolute deviation from the observed concentrations do not suggest that the overestimations are due to sediment bacteria release fig 9 b and c however the simplified bagnold approach ch eqn 0 neglects the fact that contributions of bank erosion may lead to the overestimation of suspended sediments from streambeds moreover it should be noted that the ch eqn 0 approach does not allow the user to consider the effects of sediment particle sizes to study the model simulated bacteria dynamics by land use categories we analyzed the simulated e coli concentrations of the three selected sub watersheds selection were made based on dominant land uses sub watershed 2 99 urban was selected as an urban dominant watershed sub watershed 12 was selected as a pasture dominated watershed 46 pasture 24 urban and 10 cropland and sub watershed 17 94 forest was selected as a forest dominated watershed the selected sub watersheds do not include upstream regions hence we isolated the effects of land use characteristics on the selected sub watersheds however the area of each sub watershed differs affecting streamflows simulated in each channel segment the existing swat model simulated the results under high flow conditions for all three watersheds and especially for urban and forest dominant watersheds see supplement 2 the modified swat model presents higher bacteria concentrations for all sub watersheds due to the release of e coli in the streambed to the water column under dry and low flow conditions the existing swat model simulates very low e coli concentrations in the forest dominant sub watershed these lower concentrations may be attributed to lower levels of surface runoff from the forested land hence this causal relationship of increased levels of bacteria simulated by the modified model as in figs 9 and 10 can be cautiously related to processes pertaining to streamflow and sediment bacteria resuspension that dominate in stream e coli concentrations in the forest dominant sub watershed in our study urban and pasture sub watersheds did not show such deviations due to the presence of resuspended e coli this can occur due to differences in channel erosion levels among three sub watersheds as assumed sediment e coli concentration levels are similar according to the simplified bagnold method the peak stream velocity governs the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported as differences in channel cross sections are negligible in the selected watersheds the maximum sediment capacity is dependent on the streamflow as is illustrated in fig 10 a the streamflow in the urban dominant sub watershed is higher than it is in the others channel erosion is computed as the difference between the maximum sediment concentration that can be transported and the current sediment concentration of the sub watershed as the selected watersheds do not have upstream sub watersheds to route sediment loads upland erosion serves as the main means of adding sediment to the streams as is illustrated in fig 10 b channel erosion levels observed under high and moist flow conditions are higher in the forest dominant sub watershed and are even higher than those of the urban region as high runoff levels high stream power levels spur more channel erosion the simulated channel erosion trends represent be an overprediction this may have occurred due to low sediment yields in the forested areas and due to higher sediment yields observed in the pasture and urban areas fig 3 hence the model may overpredict channel erosion in forest dominant watersheds this may lead to an overprediction of levels of streambed bacteria released into forest dominant watersheds the effects of shear stress on the dislodging of sediment particles in channels may serve as a solution moreover as channel erodibility and cover related parameters were assumed to be similar across all sub watersheds considering dominant land uses associated with channel segments in the determination of such parameters may prevent such discrepancies from occurring 5 conclusions in this study a spatial resolution of 30 m e coli load estimation based on the select approach was employed to evaluate spatiotemporal variations in e coli loads and response of the swat model in simulating e coli concentrations we evaluated an algorithm that uses sediment bacteria resuspension processes of the existing swat model to assess in stream e coli concentration simulation performance levels from high frequency e coli levels measured from a stream bed we input monthly median sediment e coli concentrations rather than deriving sediment e coli concentrations by empirically fitting to a curve the results of the model were analyzed by flow duration intervals to understand dynamics of the bacteria deposition and transport model notable observations derived from this study are listed below the existing swat model with select source characterization was unable to simulate e coli concentrations measured during low dry flow duration intervals select source characterization is an effective tool for the precise identification of non point bacteria sources of the upper stroubles creek basin which includes different land uses the selected parameter sets of modified swat bacteria simulations show that only the results for the dpout site are moderately accurate nse value of 0 2 0 4 while the existing model is less accurate 0 2 nse for the same site based on same day comparisons the modified swat model tended to overestimate in stream e coli concentrations compared to those observed at low dry flow duration intervals 80 within the low flow range and 58 within the dry flow range and to underestimate in stream e coli concentrations compared to those of observed over a mid range flow duration interval 66 within the mid range flow range however it should be noted that sediment bacteria resuspension was not the sole reason for these overestimations according to our simulation of in stream e coli concentrations sediment bacteria resuspension is dominant under mid range flow conditions for areas of highly permeable low runoff such as undeveloped or forested areas however this is counter intuitive to our general understanding that highly erodible and less pervious runoff areas are prone to erosion leading to increased levels of sediment bacteria interaction low runoff levels resulting in limited presence of bacteria generated by wash off processes in the existing swat model in forested sub watersheds is noteworthy however the model predicts higher levels of channel erosion in segments associated with undeveloped land during high and mid range flows possibly due to low levels of upland erosion these findings denote the importance of model parametrizations and consideration of shear stress effects on the channel erosion process this study is limited in its lack of consideration of explicit seasonal variations observed in the wildlife population and thus improvements must be made to select based input calculations to measure spatiotemporal variability in nonpoint source areas and to improve other transport measures of streambed bacteria in conclusion the newly developed framework can be effectively used for watershed

19352,pathogen contamination is a major cause of surface water impairment in the united states and fecal bacteria levels are typically used to evaluate microbial loading in bodies of water environmental models are considered a useful tool for evaluating watershed management practices in this study we assessed e coli contamination of the upper stroubles creek virginia usa using the soil and water assessment tool swat model the study area has been declared an impaired body of water due to recent bacterial contamination bacterial source characterizations play a critical role in such modeling exercises and especially in the case of non point sources as the swat model involves bacteria load estimation at a hydrological response unit hru level we use the spatially explicit load enrichment calculation tool select for our e coli load estimations we also evaluate current approaches to the measurement of bacterial interactions of the sediment water interface using swat and the frequent measurements of streambed e coli concentrations for the simulation of in stream e coli concentrations using estimates drawn from select without with sediment bacteria resuspension deposition nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 41 to 0 34 0 19 to 0 36 are found moreover in stream e coli concentrations measured at flow duration intervals show that the model frequently overestimates mid range flows while underestimating low range flows even with model improvements the use of high resolution e coli loads and the consideration of sediment bacteria resuspension deposition processes generated higher e coli concentrations for forested areas compared to those of urban and pasture lands suggesting the importance of using detailed bacteria load estimations and land use information when assessing e coli distribution in the environment keywords swat bacteria e coli source characterization resuspension 1 introduction the contamination of surface waters by pathogenic bacteria has become a major concern in managing the water quality of rivers lakes and wetlands pathogen contamination is typically evaluated from levels of fecal indicator bacteria fib anderson et al 2005 benham et al 2006a cho et al 2012 kim et al 2017 russo et al 2011 while the presence of elevated fib levels does not necessarily denote the occurrence of pathogen contamination pachepsky et al 2014 elevated levels are considered an indicator of the hygienic status of a water body cho et al 2016b the failure to meet standards related to pathogen contamination is a leading cause of surface water impairment in the united states usepa 2016 such water impairments are primarily addressed using total maximum daily load tmdl standards usepa 2016 which are associated with higher costs even in the planning phase liao et al 2015 environmental models of bacteria deposition and transport can facilitate the cost effective prediction of microbial quality levels and the evaluation of management practices watershed scale models such as the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf bicknell et al 1997 and soil and water assessment tool swat sadeghi and jeffrey 2002 are generally used to model bacteria contamination the identification of bacteria sources and the estimation of loads play a key role in modeling teague et al 2009 point sources are considered as single identifiable sources hill 2010 noaa 2008 which are a significant source of human enteric bacteria petersen et al 2005 wastewater treatment plants wwtps and confined animal feeding operations cafos are two of the most widely known contributors of fecal bacteria to streams non point source nps contamination can occur with the failure of septic systems and the deposition of animal feces which are typically transported to streams via sub surface leaching or surface runoff the characterization of non point sources is vital to optimal watershed modeling teague et al 2009 the spatially diffuse nature of non point sources renders such characterization challenging and several tools have been developed to address this issue for instance zeckoski et al 2005 developed a spreadsheet tool for estimating sub watershed level nps bacteria loads however such methods fail to spatially represent non point sources at a higher resolution teague et al 2009 developed the spatially explicit load enrichment calculation tool select for the characterization of bacteria sources as the select can be used to make grid level rasterized high resolution bacteria load estimations based primarily on land use data the tool offers more flexibility in the assimilation of nps source loads into watershed models for instance in the swat model surface runoff and water quality elements are calculated at the hydrological response unit hru level and then these elements are combined at the sub watershed level neitsch et al 2009 hrus are defined by geophysical attributes such as land use soil and slope characteristics the flexibility of the select methodology facilitates estimation at the hru level watershed scale models play an important role in the tmdl development process which are effectively used for the identification of prominent sources of contaminants and for the evaluation of different remediation strategies benham et al 2006a b however microbial deposition and transport processes according to these models assume that bacteria act as a single discrete free floating organism at nearly neutral buoyancy and are subject to first order die off effects partyka et al 2016 russo et al 2011 several studies have shown that sediment beds can act as bacteria reservoirs harboring 10 to 10000 times more fib than the water columns of various environments an et al 2002 buckley et al 1998 pandey et al 2012 van donsel and geldreich 1971 for instance liao et al 2014 reported that streambed sediments harbor 40 to 350 times the e coli concentrations and 7 to 580 times the enterococci concentrations of the overlying water column of the upper stroubles creek a tributary to the new river close to blacksburg virginia streambed microorganisms can be released into the overlying water column as sediments are suspended resulting in a multi fold increase in bacteria in the water muirhead et al 2004 nagels et al 2002 wilkinson et al 1995 several researchers have adopted algorithms to include streambed bacteria resuspension and deposition in current watershed scale models kim et al 2010 liao et al 2015 pandey et al 2016 russo et al 2011 kim et al 2010 improved the swat model by applying bacteria resuspension and deposition algorithms the maximum sediment carrying capacity of a channel was computed as a function of peak stream velocity for channel erosion to occur transport capacity levels must be high and the sediment load carried by the stream from upland processes must be lower than the capacity streambed sediment associated e coli concentrations were determined by fitting a function to observed streambed bacteria data due to a lack of understanding of e coli population dynamics in sediments baffaut and sadeghi 2010 though the methodology provided by kim et al 2010 was used by several subsequent studies making other improvements to the model cho et al 2012 2016a hong et al 2017 kim et al 2017 park et al 2017 the algorithms have not been evaluated using an extensive observed dataset for instance cho et al 2012 used a calibrated value of sediment bacteria concentrations due to a lack of observed data moreover kim et al 2017 used the same sine function as kim et al 2010 with calibrated coefficients to compute sediment e coli concentrations as models are extensively used in decision making and policy formulations on water quality related aspects of water resource management discussions of model uncertainty are important parajuli et al 2009b sharpley et al 2002 parameter uncertainties of bacteria deposition and transport related to the swat model have been discussed extensively by parajuli et al 2009a b recently effects of equifinality in hydrological models beven 2006 have become a central issue of various areas of hydrology ficklin and barnhart 2014 poulin et al 2011 schwartz and smith 2014 for instance ficklin and barnhart 2014 used a selected number of parameter sets to explore the implications of parameter uncertainty the present study applies the select approach to estimate hru level e coli loads in the swat model and evaluates sediment bacteria resuspension where the shear stress can be higher due to interactions between sediment bound bacteria and streambed of the bacteria deposition and transport model from high resolution temporal sediment e coli concentration data we hypothesize that the swat model with improved source characterizations and considering sediment bacteria resuspension can simulate in stream e coli concentrations at different flow duration intervals and for heterogeneous land cover types we used the swat model to simulate in stream bacteria concentrations with improved algorithms to gain insight into bacteria input estimations model processes and parameter uncertainties of a highly urbanized watershed the upper stroubles creek the objectives of this study are a to evaluate the inclusion of bacteria sediment interactions through a high resolution zero threshold for land use soil slope in the segmentation of hrus swat model of a watershed of mixed land use mostly urban b to determine nps bacteria load estimations and to input them into swat model inputs c to understand the model s setup at different flow duration intervals and d to better understand the impacts of land use and land cover in simulating bacteria released from upland catchments 2 study area our study focuses on the upper stroubles creek a tributary to the new river in southwest virginia within a watershed covering an area of 31 km2 it is located in the ridge and valley ecoregion of virginia fig 1 a the upper stroubles creek begins in the vicinity of the town of blacksburg virginia and flows through the virginia tech blacksburg campus and drains into the new river the upper stroubles creek is a predominantly urban stream 49 land use coverage with 11 km of its reaches declared impaired for exceedances in e coli standards vadeq 2015 the remainder of the watershed is a mixture of forested land 30 pastureland 16 and cropland 4 fig 1b annual precipitation varies from 745 mm to 1245 mm with an average of 980 mm 2005 2015 for the ten year period of 2005 2015 22 1 23 6 and 24 1 of annual average precipitation fell during the winter spring and fall seasons respectively and 30 2 of precipitation fell in the summer season the average temperature in the winter is roughly 3 7 c and that of the summer is 21 2 c for the same period daily flow measurements collected at the b3 gauge site from 2011 to 2013 record an average flow rate of 0 19 m3 s for the summer and of 0 17 m3 s for the winter 3 methods we used grid based nps bacteria load estimations based on the select methodology to estimate hru level bacteria inputs a watershed scale model for the upper stroubles creek was then developed using the swat fig 1c we employed algorithms proposed by kim et al 2010 and evaluated the modified model using an extensive observed e coli dataset furthermore we adopted the approach developed by ficklin and barnhart 2014 to assess parameter uncertainty levels of the existing and modified swat bacteria deposition and transport models 3 1 e coli source load estimation and preparation of inputs for the swat model the identification of e coli sources in a watershed is the first step to estimating the bacteria load the spatially explicit methodology select described in riebschleager et al 2012 and borel et al 2015 was used for the estimation of daily potential e coli loads from all potential e coli sources the e coli source characterization method based on the select approach is illustrated in fig 2 a the analysis was performed at a 30 m resolution similar to that of nlcd 2011 land use data the estimation process was based on the land use data primary e coli sources can be divided into two segments sources from animals pets wildlife and farm animals and human 3 1 1 pets wildlife and farm animals for urban areas the number of dogs was estimated assuming that 70 of the households in urban areas have at least one dog due to a reduction in the student population during the summer in the college town end of may to mid august 25 of e coli loadings from dogs were reduced for that time period using swat management options waterfowl are considered a significant source of pathogens in the upper stroubles creek liao et al 2016 and includes ducks and geese and a majority of waterfowl dwell near the duck pond shown in fig 1c in addition to waterfowl muskrats and beavers are present along the upper stroubles creek data on the white tailed deer population the predominant wildlife source in the watershed were obtained from vdgif 2015 wild turkeys skunks and raccoons were also considered in our analysis due to their presence in the watershed estimates of the number of farm animals and of wildlife levels though not for deer populations were obtained from liao et al 2015 and liao et al 2014 most pasturelands in the watershed are owned and managed by virginia tech for farm animals beef cattle dairy cattle swine horses sheep and turkeys were considered and this data could be extrapolated from virginia tech stocking information from our field visits and interviews it was assumed that grazing occurs for 218 days after april 1st of each year regarding agricultural land it was assumed that manure from dairy cows is applied to croplands in the study area at the start of the crop season in the upper stroubles creek area virginia tech uses the land to cultivate crops during the crop growing season running from may to october hence manure application was considered for the period of february to april 3 1 2 human sources the failure of septic systems is a significant source from which e coli enters natural waters a residential address list and map of sewage lines in the town of blacksburg were obtained smith and brooks 2012 a list of addresses of the watershed area was obtained and addresses connected to the wwtp were modeled as such and those addresses not connected to the wwtp were assumed to have on site sewage facilities ossfs for each of the recognized households a constant sewage discharge volume of 70 gallons per day was applied to the model borel et al 2015 while the ossf failure rate was assumed as 15 while the data are scarce for onsite sewer systems failing the literature referred from virginia including the virginia department of health and other sources suggest that the failing percentage assumed in this study to be conservative https www census gov hhes www housing census historic sewage html for instance in virginia 28 of households are adopting oss and a fraction of them was assumed as failing systems as most of the recognized units are single household units the effect of a reduction in the population in the summer was not included in the model inputs however it is estimated that roughly 25000 students of virginia tech live within the town limits of blacksburg while the total estimated population is roughly 42000 in 2010 blacksburg town council 2014 3 2 hydrology module inputs of the swat model were developed using the 10 m resolution dem drawn from the usgs national elevation dataset using 1 km resolution soil data drawn from statsgo database and using 30 m resolution land use data drawn from nlcd 2011 the watershed was delineated into 30 sub watersheds that included 1117 hrus by using zero thresholds for land use soil and slopes though streamflow simulations have been found to be insensitive to the high resolution delineation of hrus bingner et al 1997 chen and mackay 2004 fitzhugh and mackay 2000 manguerra and engel 1998 in this study hru delineation offered at the highest resolution at which to designate e coli source loads of the model in a detailed manner the hru thresholds can impact the representation of non point source loadings of a certain land use type and its hydrological characteristics temperature data were obtained from the national weather service office nws in blacksburg virginia and daily precipitation data were obtained from kentland farm located in the vicinity for the calibration 1 jan 2011 and 31 dec 2012 and validation 1 jan 2013 and 31 dec 2013 of streamflow we used stream stage data measured at the virginia tech stream research education and management laboratory stream lab that included at least one wet year and one dry year to ensure that the model properly captured wet and dry weather related hydrological properties resop and hession 2010 thompson et al 2012 hourly streamflow measurements were obtained at b1 fig 1c and these data were then averaged as daily streamflow measurements 3 3 sediment and bacteria modules of the existing swat model the swat model uses the modified version of the universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 to simulate erosion caused by rainfall and runoff neitsch et al 2009 to calculate the maximum amount of sediment transported within a reach the swat model uses a simplified version of the bagnold stream power equation bagnold 1977 neitsh et al 2009 however it is not able to keep track of sediment pools of various particle sizes neitsch et al 2009 ch eqn 0 in our study musle parameters were calibrated by using previously published sediment loadings for each specific land use area vadeq and vadcr 2003 streambed and in stream e coli concentrations were obtained from four bacteria monitoring sites dpin dpout b1 and b3 the swat computes bacteria levels across land areas at the hru level and the deposition and transport of bacteria is simulated in three segments as foliage soil solution and soil particles the swat model computes ground cover using the leaf area index lai and a complementary error function ground cover percentages affect the amount of manure placed on foliage and soil a user defined fraction governs the wash off value from bacteria landing on foliage wash off from foliage to soil occurs when daily precipitation exceeds 2 54 mm and then it is combined with bacteria in the soil solution where a partition coefficient computes the amount of bacteria attached to soil particles when runoff occurs in the hru bacteria levels in overland flow are computed based on runoff volumes soil bulk density levels bacteria available in soil solutions and a bacteria partitioning coefficient for runoff benham et al 2006b some bacteria in the soil solution are leached into the soil profile and bacteria percolated into the first soil layer are considered a loss to the system the swat bacteria deposition and transport model assume that bacteria die off according to chick s law the model allows the user to define die off and regrowth rates at hru level segments foliage soil solution and soil particles while the in stream bacteria fate model only measures die off rates at hru level segments the overall rate of bacteria loss is computed as a die off rate that is less than the re growth rate in this study only die off rates were introduced at the hru level as in numerous previous studies iudicello and chin 2015 kim et al 2010 parajuli et al 2009a b the existing bacteria module of the swat offers no provisions for capturing effects of the deposition and resuspension of sediment associated bacteria on bacteria concentrations in an overlying water column kim et al 2010 as noted in our introduction we evaluated the previously published modified swat bacteria module kim et al 2010 developed to capture effects of the deposition and resuspension of sediment associated bacteria 3 4 swat modified bacteria module kim et al 2010 used an earlier version of the swat swat2005 to consider sediment bacteria resuspensions we used swat2012 rev 664 wherein the subroutine that routes sediment from sub basins to basin outlets rtsed f has been revised from the earlier swat2005 fig 2b the ch eqn 0 option uses the simplified bagnold stream power equation to compute sediment transport capacities of a given channel when compared to swat2005 in swat2012 sediment

national elevation dataset ned the ssurgo soil dataset nlcd 2011 land use data and weather data the model was calibrated from the streamflow at bridge 1 a sensitivity analysis on 29 flow related parameters was conducted using the swat cup program abbaspour et al 2007 and 8 parameters were selected for calibration by sensitivity ranking and manual verification jin and sridhar 2012 the selected parameters and their descriptions are presented in table 1 the streamflow simulation was calibrated using daily observed streamflow patterns for january 1 2011 to december 31 2012 at site b1 and an accuracy level of 0 61 nse was obtained the calibration period includes one dry year 2011 and one wet year 2012 to ensure the model s capacity to capture both high and low flow conditions results of the calibration and validation of daily streamflow based on parameter set 1 are shown in fig 3 a the equifinality or non uniqueness of the model results in the generation of streamflow simulations of the same accuracy for different parameter sets according to swat bacteria deposition and transport processes surface runoff plays a major role in releasing bacteria into streams and is the only mechanism that transports land bacteria to streams in the swat hence the evaluation of water balance components surface runoff lateral flow groundwater flow etc for different parameter sets based on streamflow simulations of the same accuracy may reduce parameter uncertainty levels of bacteria deposition and transport we selected five parameter sets that yielded satisfactory nash sutcliffe efficiency nse levels for the daily streamflow results table 2 we evaluated average monthly water balance components from the parameter sets to examine whether significant differences exist among them the difference found between monthly water balance components of the parameter sets is negligible as high flows are associated with storm events which can release contaminants including bacteria into streams we evaluated the performance of simulation of high flows observed daily streamflows of higher than the 90th percentile were considered high flows roughly 0 32 m3 s the performance of the high flow simulation was evaluated and all of the selected parameter sets performed similarly r2 0 46 as overall performance levels were reasonably good parameter set 1 was selected for the evaluation of the bacteria deposition and transport model as the observed sediment data for the stroubles creek were not available we used previously published sediment loadings per unit of area for each land use published in a previous sediment tmdl report vadeq and vadcr 2003 sediment loadings were calculated using the universal soil loss equation usle with a delivery ratio as noted in the methods section the swat uses the musle to estimate erosion eliminating the need for a delivery ratio neitsh et al 2009 the sediment loading estimates of vadeq and vadcr 2003 were used to compute average annual sediment yields of the sub basin level the computed average annual sediment yields were used to calibrate musle parameters of the swat model we used the usle equation support practice factor usle p in range of 0 1 1 0 and the usle equation soil erodibility factor usle k within a range of relative change of 50 to 50 results of the calibration of annual average sediment yields of the sub basin level are illustrated in fig 3b higher annual sediment yields were calculated for pasture dominant sub watersheds simulated sediment yields were underestimated up to 50 for some of the forested sub watersheds sub watersheds 15 and 17 generally better simulated sediment yields were found for urban and pasture dominant sub watersheds 4 2 evaluation of bacteria deposition and transport using the existing swat the observed in stream bacteria concentrations were drawn from dpout dpin b1 and b3 bacteria monitoring sites the temperature adjustment factor thbact see the supplement 1 was set to the same value as in coffey et al 2013 and parajuli et al 2009a b which was obtained by manual calibration and used by kim et al 2010 the swat model allows for the decay and regrowth of bacteria in three sub sections at the hru level in foliage soil solution and soil particles as we are focused on the evaluation of in stream bacteria concentrations bacteria deposition in soil particles was neglected furthermore after dividing soil solutions free floating from soil particles particle sorbed bacteria the model does not simulate any interactions between these two phases bacteria die off rates measured at 20 c from soil solution wdpq and stream water wdprch values were respectively set to 0 659 day 1 and 0 990 day 1 as in kim et al 2010 and were adopted from the bacteria die off review of crane and moore 1986 we calibrated the bacteria partition coefficient of surface runoff bactkdq rather than adopting the value from past research and we included the bacteria decay rate for foliage as a parameter during calibration the width of the edge of field filter strip filterw was not used for the calibration as much of the upper stroubles creek flows through a highly urbanized area thus five parameter sets were selected for the calibration of bacteria deposition and transport in the existing swat2012 table 2 4 3 estimated potential e coli loads the estimated potential e coli loads were distributed among land uses associated with recognized e coli sources as the swat model allows the user to enter bacteria loads at the hru level the land use category of each hru was used to assign bacteria loads using the select methodology in some cases e g bacteria inputs of waterfowl the relative locations of hrus were used as a guiding factor when assigning bacteria loads e g urban areas close to duck pond were considered a key habitat for waterfowl estimated e coli loads for the summer and winter seasons after aggregation at the sub basin level are shown in fig 4 fig 4 a shows that in the summer potential e coli loads are higher in sub basins of mainly pasture land fig 4 b shows that in the winter potential e coli loads are highest in the urban dominant sub basins this difference occurs due to the termination of grazing operations during the grazing period defecation by farm animals can enter the streams through runoff in the winter combined with a reduction in the population during the summer holidays in blacksburg these estimations fall within the range of estimations presented in baffaut and sadeghi 2010 4 4 sediment e coli concentration the streambed e coli concentration obtained from four bacteria monitoring sites dpin dpout b1 and b3w generated a higher number of observations of streambed e coli concentrations from the aforementioned sites 46 50 50 and 50 it should be noted that observations for january were obtained for 2013 while the remaining data were obtained for 2012 these observations cover the entire year and include at least three observations for a given month though not for the dpin site for which data for february were not available we assigned observed average monthly sediment e coli concentrations of each site to corresponding reaches fig 5 a d for other reaches average monthly sediment e coli concentrations were based on all observed sediment e coli concentrations fig 5 e as the sediment e coli concentration for february is not available for the dpin site the average for january and march was used as the value for february e coli concentrations were lowest in winter across all sites generally higher e coli concentrations were found in the summer while similar concentrations were measured during the fall and spring these observations illustrate the slow growth of sediment e coli at low temperatures see supplement 2 4 5 evaluation of bacteria deposition and transport in the swat the sensitivity analysis was conducted using six identified parameters table 3 of the existing swat swat2012 rev 664 in the modified swat model 12 selected parameters were used in the sensitivity analysis our study revealed five parameter sets from the existing and modified swat models that exhibit similar performance in simulating the in stream e coli concentrations tables 4 and 5 though the musle parameters were calibrated from the previously published annual average sediment yield results the reach level sediment routing and channel erosion related parameters were used for the calibration of the modified bacteria deposition and transport model the fitted values of channel erosion related parameters compare favorably set to similar spcon 0 006 spexp 1 250 ch erodmo 0 2 and ch cov2 0 5 values with past findings for the stroubles creek staley 2006 wagner et al 2007 clay content in the sediments was assumed to be the same for all of the reaches the performance of the model was evaluated using the selected approaches via the comparison of observed and simulated values of the same day and the comparison of observed and simulated values for the 3 day window russo et al 2011 for the 3 day window approach the closest model prediction for the chosen day for the day before the sampling date and for the day after the sampling date was compared with the observed data even though this approach may overestimate the model s accuracy the approach is useful in addressing uncertainties at the time of sampling and during a daytime rainfall event liao et al 2015 for both models the most sensitive parameter was identified as the bactkddb parameter a higher bactkddb parameter denotes that a lower volume of bacteria is transported through runoff meaning that a larger portion of bacteria is absorbed into soil particles tang et al 2011 moreover for both the existing and modified models bactkddb parameter takes a value of lower than 0 5 in agreement with kim et al 2010 and kim et al 2017 however this contrasts with parajuli et al 2009a b who reported a higher value 0 90 for the bactkddb parameter the value for the decay in foliage varies within a greater range for both models compared to that of bougeard et al 2011 a decay rate of 0 016 was obtained through our calibration revealing higher foliage decay rates 0 15 and even higher decay rates in the modified model calibration results 0 50 however jones 1986 suggests that bacteria are unlikely to survive on the surfaces of crops due to exposure to desiccation and sunlight sunlight was not considered as a stressor of bacteria decay in this study which may justify the application of higher decay rates to foliage chase et al 2017 and atwill et al 2015 investigated bacterial transfer from fecal deposits to heads of mature lettuce during foliar irrigation and their survival however they reported that microbial contamination were limited to the outer leaves of the head that eventually got discarded during post processing and emphasized the importance of determining the appropriate time for bacterial die off the bactkdq value governs the partitioning of bacteria into a free floating state and sorption to soil particles in surface runoff a higher bactkdq denotes the presence of a higher portion of sorbed bacteria parajuli 2007 the calibration results of the modified model show slightly lower bactkdq values compared to those of the existing model however it should be noted that unlike in the existing swat model bactkdq values present a low sensitivity rank in the modified model wof p and bact swf are fractional parameters that affect the volume of bacteria eventually accumulating in runoff higher wof p and bact swf values denote an increased possibility of higher bacteria content levels being found in runoff in both the existing and modified models wof p values are lower 0 5 in most cases while bact swf values are higher 0 5 in the existing model according to the performance indicators parameter set 1 was selected for the existing swat model while parameter set 2 was selected for the modified model for further discussion fig 6 compares the observed and simulated in stream bacteria concentrations derived from the existing and modified swat models for the dpin and dpout sites while comparisons of the other two sites are not shown here these results were similar to those for the dpout site the comparisons presented in fig 6 a vs b and c vs d clearly show increased levels of model accuracy with the refinement of modeling techniques employed in this study however fig 5 b shows that the addition of e coli into the water column at the dpin site by streambed release was not sufficient to simulate higher levels of in stream e coli concentrations at the site as is illustrated in fig 7 a at the dpin site observed in stream e coli concentrations remained higher under both high and low flow conditions the dpout site fig 7 b on the other hand presented lower in stream e coli concentrations under low flow conditions elevated levels of e coli observed over low flow duration intervals are typically an indication of the presence of a point source upstream as a permitted point source was not found at the upstream of dpin site contaminant leakage from storm drains may act as a point source furthermore a large portion of the upstream dpin site is covered and diverges underground and thus lower die off rates resulting from reduced sunlight levels may contribute to increased e coli concentrations observed at the dpin parece et al 2010 fig 8 a and b show that the existing model produced null values for in stream e coli concentrations for a considerable period nearly 73 of the days in the existing model more than 90 of the positive 0 simulated in stream bacteria concentrations were reported for rainy days for the winter this percentage reached nearly 75 while it approached 100 in the summer the simulation of e coli wash off levels from foliage for days with rainfall levels of more than 2 54 mm and higher lai values for the summer caused this difference between seasonal simulations this can be attributed to the fact that higher lai values cause more bacteria to adhere to plant foliage due to enhanced ground cover levels we analyzed errors from the results of the modified swat model using all five selected parameter sets the resulting overestimations and underestimations of simulated in stream e coli concentrations were summarized by hydrologic condition class usepa 2007 hydrological conditions were defined by flow duration intervals as 0 10 high flows 10 40 moist conditions 40 60 mid range conditions 60 90 dry conditions and 90 100 low flows fig 9 fig 9 a shows a larger number of underestimations for dry and low flow conditions 80 and 58 respectively relative to the observed in stream e coli concentrations for moderate flow conditions the prevalence of overestimations is high 66 moreover for most of the cases e coli generated through streambed release and the absolute deviation from the observed concentrations do not suggest that the overestimations are due to sediment bacteria release fig 9 b and c however the simplified bagnold approach ch eqn 0 neglects the fact that contributions of bank erosion may lead to the overestimation of suspended sediments from streambeds moreover it should be noted that the ch eqn 0 approach does not allow the user to consider the effects of sediment particle sizes to study the model simulated bacteria dynamics by land use categories we analyzed the simulated e coli concentrations of the three selected sub watersheds selection were made based on dominant land uses sub watershed 2 99 urban was selected as an urban dominant watershed sub watershed 12 was selected as a pasture dominated watershed 46 pasture 24 urban and 10 cropland and sub watershed 17 94 forest was selected as a forest dominated watershed the selected sub watersheds do not include upstream regions hence we isolated the effects of land use characteristics on the selected sub watersheds however the area of each sub watershed differs affecting streamflows simulated in each channel segment the existing swat model simulated the results under high flow conditions for all three watersheds and especially for urban and forest dominant watersheds see supplement 2 the modified swat model presents higher bacteria concentrations for all sub watersheds due to the release of e coli in the streambed to the water column under dry and low flow conditions the existing swat model simulates very low e coli concentrations in the forest dominant sub watershed these lower concentrations may be attributed to lower levels of surface runoff from the forested land hence this causal relationship of increased levels of bacteria simulated by the modified model as in figs 9 and 10 can be cautiously related to processes pertaining to streamflow and sediment bacteria resuspension that dominate in stream e coli concentrations in the forest dominant sub watershed in our study urban and pasture sub watersheds did not show such deviations due to the presence of resuspended e coli this can occur due to differences in channel erosion levels among three sub watersheds as assumed sediment e coli concentration levels are similar according to the simplified bagnold method the peak stream velocity governs the maximum amount of sediment that can be transported as differences in channel cross sections are negligible in the selected watersheds the maximum sediment capacity is dependent on the streamflow as is illustrated in fig 10 a the streamflow in the urban dominant sub watershed is higher than it is in the others channel erosion is computed as the difference between the maximum sediment concentration that can be transported and the current sediment concentration of the sub watershed as the selected watersheds do not have upstream sub watersheds to route sediment loads upland erosion serves as the main means of adding sediment to the streams as is illustrated in fig 10 b channel erosion levels observed under high and moist flow conditions are higher in the forest dominant sub watershed and are even higher than those of the urban region as high runoff levels high stream power levels spur more channel erosion the simulated channel erosion trends represent be an overprediction this may have occurred due to low sediment yields in the forested areas and due to higher sediment yields observed in the pasture and urban areas fig 3 hence the model may overpredict channel erosion in forest dominant watersheds this may lead to an overprediction of levels of streambed bacteria released into forest dominant watersheds the effects of shear stress on the dislodging of sediment particles in channels may serve as a solution moreover as channel erodibility and cover related parameters were assumed to be similar across all sub watersheds considering dominant land uses associated with channel segments in the determination of such parameters may prevent such discrepancies from occurring 5 conclusions in this study a spatial resolution of 30 m e coli load estimation based on the select approach was employed to evaluate spatiotemporal variations in e coli loads and response of the swat model in simulating e coli concentrations we evaluated an algorithm that uses sediment bacteria resuspension processes of the existing swat model to assess in stream e coli concentration simulation performance levels from high frequency e coli levels measured from a stream bed we input monthly median sediment e coli concentrations rather than deriving sediment e coli concentrations by empirically fitting to a curve the results of the model were analyzed by flow duration intervals to understand dynamics of the bacteria deposition and transport model notable observations derived from this study are listed below the existing swat model with select source characterization was unable to simulate e coli concentrations measured during low dry flow duration intervals select source characterization is an effective tool for the precise identification of non point bacteria sources of the upper stroubles creek basin which includes different land uses the selected parameter sets of modified swat bacteria simulations show that only the results for the dpout site are moderately accurate nse value of 0 2 0 4 while the existing model is less accurate 0 2 nse for the same site based on same day comparisons the modified swat model tended to overestimate in stream e coli concentrations compared to those observed at low dry flow duration intervals 80 within the low flow range and 58 within the dry flow range and to underestimate in stream e coli concentrations compared to those of observed over a mid range flow duration interval 66 within the mid range flow range however it should be noted that sediment bacteria resuspension was not the sole reason for these overestimations according to our simulation of in stream e coli concentrations sediment bacteria resuspension is dominant under mid range flow conditions for areas of highly permeable low runoff such as undeveloped or forested areas however this is counter intuitive to our general understanding that highly erodible and less pervious runoff areas are prone to erosion leading to increased levels of sediment bacteria interaction low runoff levels resulting in limited presence of bacteria generated by wash off processes in the existing swat model in forested sub watersheds is noteworthy however the model predicts higher levels of channel erosion in segments associated with undeveloped land during high and mid range flows possibly due to low levels of upland erosion these findings denote the importance of model parametrizations and consideration of shear stress effects on the channel erosion process this study is limited in its lack of consideration of explicit seasonal variations observed in the wildlife population and thus improvements must be made to select based input calculations to measure spatiotemporal variability in nonpoint source areas and to improve other transport measures of streambed bacteria in conclusion the newly developed framework can be effectively used for watershed

19353,cellulose represents a significant fraction of domestic wastewater but it is not considered as a separate state variable in the conventional activated sludge models asm cellulose is a very slowly degradable substrate that in traditional wastewater characterisation methods would be characterised partly as slowly biodegradable and partly as inert material this can be problematic when the same model is used under different temperature conditions or different solid retention times also with the emerging attention for cellulose recovery inclusion of this compound in models helps to assess the impact of cellulose recovery on operations and on operational costs but also in membrane bioreactors sieves are used in order to remove fibrous material mainly cellulose in this study a modification of asm1 is proposed where cellulose is introduced as a separate state variable and it is supposed to degrade with a first order hydrolysis rate with the aid of this model the effect of fine sieves is simulated using two alternatives by either sieving the influent or the activated sludge the model proved to be useful for operational purposes and illustrates the need for including cellulose as separate state variable keywords cellulose asm1 wastewater modelling resource recovery sieving 1 introduction cellulose represents a significant fraction of domestic wastewater as it is the main component of toilet paper ruiken et al 2013 around 14 kg of toilet paper representing roughly 14 kg of cod is used per capita per year tissue consumption per capita n d considering that toilet paper consists almost entirely of cellulose and that it is likely completely ending up in the sewer system this could mean that cellulose is 20 30 of the total cod load to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp until now it has however got very limited attention despite that cellulose fibres can readily be observed in microscopic evaluation of wastewater and sludge samples from a wwtp fig 1 it is remarkable that this large singular fraction of municipal wastewater has not yet been implemented in conventional activated sludge models henze et al 2000 introducing a new cod fraction is only relevant for long srt but since most modern treatment plants operate with nitrification it is relevant for most plants moreover the degradation rate is temperature sensitive and therefore significant differences in cellulose turn over between summer and winter occur in moderate climate regions in the last years efforts to turn wastewater treatment plants into resource recovery facilities are increasing guest et al 2009 sutton et al 2010 van der hoek et al 2016 mansouri et al 2017 papa et al 2017 cellulose is a major fraction from the incoming organic matter and could be directly recovered and reused ruiken et al 2013 chen et al 2017 ma et al 2016 the attention on cellulose as a resource to be reclaimed and recycled is already taken up by dutch water boards stowa 2013 jansen 2017 boztas 2017 cellulose recovery not only contributes to a circular economy but also leads to savings in energy for aeration and lower total sludge production recovery of cellulose can be easily implemented with the aid of fine mesh sieves ruiken et al 2013 in this paper with sieve is referred to fine mesh sieves sieves are already used in wastewater treatment plants in order to retain part of the organic matter before it reaches the biological reactor rusten and ødegaard 2006 reducing thus the aeration energy and the production of sludge ghasimi et al 2016 some authors claim a better performing nitrification and overall biogas production when sieved materials are redirected to the anaerobic digester rusten et al 2016 sieves are also widely used within membrane bioreactor treatment plants mbr where they are used to remove fibres in order to protect the membranes schier and frechen 2009 a large fraction of this sieving material consists of the cellulose fibres certainly when the sieves are applied under a high loading rate the sievings can be very highly enriched in cellulose fibres ruiken et al 2013 the retained sieving material from influent will contain appr 60 80 cellulose fibres ruiken et al 2013 the other organic components will be hair fat leaves seeds plastic ect composition if the sieving material of sludge is not known yet activated sludge models asm are the main tools used for wwtp design and operation henze et al 2000 so far three general models are available asm1 asm2 and asm3 each with several modifications have been proposed the influent composition for these models was mainly characterised based on respirometric experiments which means that no precise characterisation of components in the influent is made for practice respirometric methods are generally replaced by physical separation methods roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 in general a distinction is made between soluble and particulate fractions the latter consists of slowly biodegradable and inert cod fractions besides the biomass fractions nowak et al 1999 presented an adapted asm1 model in which xv described as very slowly biodegradable particulate matter was introduced as a model component the nature of this component was not specified but was estimated to constitute 10 15 of the influent cod the introduction of this new state variable was based on the observation that the division between inert and slowly biodegradable particulate material seemed to depend on the temperature and sludge age of the wastewater treatment plant also friedrich et al 2016 indicated that inert particulate cod can be biodegradable since when embedded in activated sludge cellulose is only very slowly hydrolysed ruiken et al 2013 and its biodegradation is more extensive in summer than in winter it is here proposed that the xv fraction described by nowak et al 1999 might be dominantly representing the cellulose fraction in the wastewater recently revilla et al 2016a b proposed an activated sludge model for the treatment of industrial wastewater from a cellulose factory with cellulose as state variable it is however not relevant in the case of municipal wastewater plants because it focuses on the effects of microbial predation in a bas biofilm activated sludge processes this phenomenon is not relevant in traditional activated sludge systems to the authors knowledge no municipal wastewater activated sludge model incorporating cellulose as state variable has been proposed yet this is a considerable omission in wastewater modelling since cellulose is an important fraction in wastewater and the real impact of sieves as applied in mbr processes or for raw wastewater primary treatment for example cannot be properly modelled the development of such a model is especially important in light of the growing interest in resource recovery from wastewater in this paper we present an asm1 based model that describes the behaviour of cellulose during the activated sludge process we use the model to describe the impact of cellulose recovery by sieves on the wastewater treatment process the goal of the paper is to show the range of different possible effects when the degradation rate of cellulose still unknown is varied within the range of possible values addition of cellulose as a standard state variable in commercially available asm models would be worth considering 2 materials and methods a modified version of asm1 asm1cl was developed introducing cellulose as a state variable called xcl cellulose was assumed to be partly slowly biodegradable particulate substrate xs and partly particulate inert organic matter xi in asm1 xcl was assumed to undergo hydrolysis introduced as a new process in the model with subsequent production of readily biodegradable substrate ss cellulose hydrolysis was assumed to follow a first order degradation kinetic x c l s s with ρ 9 k c l x c l where kcl is the cellulose hydrolysis constant t 1 and ρ9 is the process rate ml 3t 1 the hydrolysis process of xs includes enzymatic activities but also protozoan degradation processes moussa et al 2005 and therefore the rate is depending on redox conditions cellulose is enzymatically hydrolysed and therefore this process is not influenced by redox conditions table 1 shows the proposed model matrix for asm1cl different kinetics can describe cellulose degradation such as first order weimer 1992 modified contois von munch et al 1999 and monod mino et al 1995 considering that cellulose hydrolysis occurs on the surface of the particles the degradation rate is likely dependent on the specific surface this would result in a rate kinetics with a power of 2 3 in the cellulose concentration however since the actual process is not well characterised a simple first order degradation kinetic equation was chosen the hydrolysis process rate coefficient was assumed to be temperature dependent through the arrhenius relationship with a theta value of 1 1098 c 1 similar as for biomass decay k t k 20 c e ϑ t 20 c the asm1cl model was calibrated with the process data from wwtp blaricum in the netherlands the influent of this plant is 100 domestic wastewater the treatment scheme is described in fig 2 the operational data are listed in table 2 for calibration yearly averages were used for an average temperature of 14 c for modelling aquasim was used reichert p 1994 3 results and discussion 3 1 influent characterisation during the research several measurements of cellulose have been performed both in incoming wastewater and in activated sludge we used a method based on van soest 1963 and performed by the company masterlab in the netherlands the method gave reproducible data for cellulose amount in influent suspended solids however in sludge the measurement data were inconsistent with each other and they had a large standard deviation unpublished results since we have no validation on the accuracy of influent measurements we rather used the estimated amount of cellulose disposed per person in the wastewater for the influent load we assumed a value of cellulose discharged in the sewer corresponding to 10 kg pp y for wwtp blaricum this translates to a cellulose load of 822 kg d based on recent 2018 preliminary results research is going on and not published yet we measured cellulose fibres in 8 samples of influent this was done by filtering 60 l of influent over a 90 μm mesh filter and application of van soest method at the wwtp blaricum we measured cellulose to be appr 45 and at the wwtp amsterdam west appr 40 of the organic suspended solids in the influent based on 242 mgss l or appr 220 organic ss in the influent of wwtp blaricum table 2 and 45 cellulose with an influent flow 8123 m3 d table 2 gives 804 kg d for this publication we decided to use 822 kg d 10 kg pp y wwtp blaricum was modelled by asm1 before for an internal study by the dutch water company waternet the original influent cod characterisation for asm1 had to be adapted in order to introduce the cellulose component as mentioned in model development section xcl was assumed to be derived partially from xs and partially from xi for wwtp blaricum the total incoming particulate cod and the average excess sludge production are known table 2 the incoming particulate cod has to be divided in three fractions for cellulose a fixed amount based on 10 kg pp y was assumed meaning that the xs and xi fraction could be calibrated based on the sludge production a detailed description of this method is publicized by roeleveld roeleveld et al 2002 it should be noted that the sludge production will also depend on the value of the cellulose hydrolysis rate which set at a default value at this stage the resulting influent characterisation is given in table 3 the particulate cod partitioning in xi xs and xcl for asm1 and asm1cl are shown in fig 3 the estimation of the incoming particulate cod fractions for wwtp blaricum was made based on the estimated incoming cellulose load and the total amount of excess sludge produced this fractionation depends on the degradation rate of cellulose where we assumed a default value for the hydrolysis rate coefficient kcl if cellulose in the excess sludge could be measured reliably it would be possible to calibrate this parameter however hereto first a reliable method that is not influenced by the sludge matrix will have to be developed therefore we evaluated the impact of changing kcl values on the calibration of the influent xs and xi fractions table 4 reports the result of the calibration as function of the hydrolysis rate constant especially for the lower values there would be a significant impact on the influent characterisation however these low rate coefficients would lead to very low values likely too low for the amount of inert material in the influent 3 2 evaluation of the integrated plant model the model with the default influent composition was further evaluated with respect to the uncertain parameters the impact of the assumed kcl on the predicted amount of cellulose in the excess sludge is represented in fig 4 as it could be expected the trend is exponentially decreasing for rate coefficients larger than around 0 2 1 d the fraction of cellulose in the sludge is relatively constant variation in range of what could be expected as error in a good measurement the processes that take place in the activated sludge process are temperature dependent and this dependency is incorporated in the asm1cl model hereto we evaluated the impact of temperature for various rate coefficients on the total excess sludge production fig 5 under summer conditions there is some 5 10 variation in the predicted sludge production when a reasonable range of temperature coefficients are used cellulose recovery would decrease the cod load to the treatment plant while leaving the nitrogen load virtually unchanged this might impact the overall nitrogen removal potential because of a lower cod availability for denitrification with the asm1cl model for wwtp blaricum the impact of placing a sieve in the return sludge line see figs 6 and 7 on the nitrogen removal efficiency was evaluated note that ammonium in the effluent is low and therefore not influenced in these simulation results full nitrification is always occurring in systems with limited nitrification capacity removal of cellulose would allow a higher srt at constant sludge concentration in aeration basin and thereby a lower ammonium concentration in the effluent the effect of sieving and of different kcl values is given in fig 6 there is a small impact indeed which is also depending on the temperature the impact is much smaller than expected from the changed cod n ratio caused by cellulose recovery this is due to the fact that part of the cellulose is not hydrolysed anyway and a large fraction of hydrolysis occurs in the aeration tank of the system i e resulting in aerobic cellulose conversion 3 3 application of simulation model to the effect of sieves placement the obtained model was used to estimate the impact of sieving and the sieving placement influent or return sludge at a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in blaricum the netherlands from a modelling point of view the sieves were conceived as selective filters for cellulose with different levels of efficiency the concept of sieve efficiency can in real terms be seen from two different points of view a sieve with 50 efficiency for instance could either be a sieve that filters all the flow and only manages to retain 50 of the cellulose or a sieve that filters 50 of the flow with an absolute 100 efficiency cellulose can be retrieved at the treatment plant either directly from the influent or from within the activated sludge process these two options were compared by extending the model fig 7 for the influent sieve this is straightforward for the activated sludge several options are possible e g in the return sludge or in a recycle loop in the activated sludge tanks the position of the sieve is not relevant for the outcome of the simulations as long as it sieves the activated sludge with the simulated efficiency in this model we placed it in the return sludge in practice the position will likely depend heavily on the local situation although the size of the sieves could be smaller when placed in the return sludge flow fig 7 shows the position of the sieves in the treatment scheme sieves will decrease aeration costs and sludge disposal costs therefore the impact of sieving is presented as the change in operational expenditure opex the calculated reduction in oxygen requirements due to sieving is transformed into a kwh demand kg o2 kwh which at a cost of 0 1 kwh translates to reduced operational costs the reduced sludge production is associated with a costs of 0 6 kg dry solids treatment cost for excess sludge these economical figures are based on costs occurring in the netherlands as assessed by waternet and can be different for different geographic areas the sludge treatment costs include transport and treatment and are corrected for benefit from biogas production the yearly opex savings due to implementing sieves were calculated as a function of kcl keeping influent composition constant and for different sieve efficiencies fig 8 from fig 8 it can be noticed that when the cellulose hydrolysis rate constant is larger than 0 2 d 1 the savings have a constant value this insensitivity is logically similar to that observed in fig 4 and table 4 lower rates likely do not occur because that would lead to unrealistic low amount of inert material in the municipal wastewater the incoming amount of cellulose is also uncertain therefore we evaluated the impact of varying cellulose loads varied from 8 kg pp y to 12 kg pp y as expected the savings obtained are directly related to the amount of cellulose recovered results not reported 3 4 evaluation both figs 6 and 8 show that sieving all the sludge recirculation flow rate or only 20 of it leads to almost the same results for the influent the benefit depends on the sieving efficiency over the full range the insensitivity for sieve efficiency in the return sludge is due to the fact that the sludge recirculates over the sieve while the influent has only one pass since the degradation rate of cellulose is relatively slow it is no problem that the fibres have a retention time of a few days in the treatment plant only a small fraction of the fibres is hydrolysed in this time frame if the two sieves positions are compared it can be deduced that comparable savings at wwtp blaricum could be obtained by sieving 80 of the influent a flow of around 6 500 m3 d and 20 of the return sludge 4 100 m3 d current implementation of sieves can be in the influent many sieve installations in the influent world wide activated and return sludge for example cannibal and many mbr applications the simulations indicate that sieve placement in the return sludge or maybe activated sludge depending on local conditions could be more beneficial then in the influent the flow to be treated is smaller and likely maintenance costs and operational problems will be less when return sludge is sieved compared to raw influent sieving therefore already some technical and economic considerations can be made in order to make proper evaluation of the effect of cellulose retrieval more effort should be put into modelling and the measurements needed both in the influent in activated sludge to allow for a proper calibration of the kinetics of cellulose hydrolysis in addition to this focus should be put on the actual composition of the sievings in fact although asm1cl assumes that the sieves only retain cellulose actually also much other material is retained ruiken et al 2013 like hair seeds plastic particles other fibres etc the paper from nowak et al 1999 was the first to the author s best knowledge to point out the lack of an state variable representative of slowly degradable particulate matter in traditional activated sludge models their model was also important for the development of the one introduced in the present paper however few differences can be noticed in nowak s model the very slowly degradable fraction xv is assumed to partially derive from the decay heterotrophic biomass and its degradation different in aerobic and anoxic conditions and following a monod kinetic is assumed to yield xs the monod kinetics effectively are in this case also first order due to a choice for a relatively high affinity constant in the model in the present model instead cellulose is assumed to be partially deriving from what is traditionally regarded as particulate inert fraction xi and partially from particulate readily degradable fraction xs the kinetics of cellulose hydrolysis is here considered independent from the condition aerobic or anoxic and is of the first order the results obtained with the present approach show an equivalent goodness of fit if compared to the model presented by nowak et al 1999 however we believe that explicitly defining cellulose is more close to the factual processes occurring in activated sludge 4 conclusions cellulose is a significant fraction of wastewater that has a relatively slow hydrolysis rate therefore cellulose should be considered as a separate state variable in asm models the here proposed model structure can be used as basis for such models with the asm1cl model it was shown that modelling the behaviour of cellulose and the effect of fine sieves on the plant performance can be a useful instrument for operational purposes even if uncertainty especially on the hydrolysis rate constant still exists indeed through the use of this model it was demonstrated that the range of savings possible is very wide depending on the value of cellulose degradation for this reason more research should put into it in order to determine in which cases the application of fine sieving is beneficial further research could give vital insights on cellulose amounts and degradation processes in activated sludge and make cellulose including models powerful instruments for wwtp designers and operators 
19353,cellulose represents a significant fraction of domestic wastewater but it is not considered as a separate state variable in the conventional activated sludge models asm cellulose is a very slowly degradable substrate that in traditional wastewater characterisation methods would be characterised partly as slowly biodegradable and partly as inert material this can be problematic when the same model is used under different temperature conditions or different solid retention times also with the emerging attention for cellulose recovery inclusion of this compound in models helps to assess the impact of cellulose recovery on operations and on operational costs but also in membrane bioreactors sieves are used in order to remove fibrous material mainly cellulose in this study a modification of asm1 is proposed where cellulose is introduced as a separate state variable and it is supposed to degrade with a first order hydrolysis rate with the aid of this model the effect of fine sieves is simulated using two alternatives by either sieving the influent or the activated sludge the model proved to be useful for operational purposes and illustrates the need for including cellulose as separate state variable keywords cellulose asm1 wastewater modelling resource recovery sieving 1 introduction cellulose represents a significant fraction of domestic wastewater as it is the main component of toilet paper ruiken et al 2013 around 14 kg of toilet paper representing roughly 14 kg of cod is used per capita per year tissue consumption per capita n d considering that toilet paper consists almost entirely of cellulose and that it is likely completely ending up in the sewer system this could mean that cellulose is 20 30 of the total cod load to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp until now it has however got very limited attention despite that cellulose fibres can readily be observed in microscopic evaluation of wastewater and sludge samples from a wwtp fig 1 it is remarkable that this large singular fraction of municipal wastewater has not yet been implemented in conventional activated sludge models henze et al 2000 introducing a new cod fraction is only relevant for long srt but since most modern treatment plants operate with nitrification it is relevant for most plants moreover the degradation rate is temperature sensitive and therefore significant differences in cellulose turn over between summer and winter occur in moderate climate regions in the last years efforts to turn wastewater treatment plants into resource recovery facilities are increasing guest et al 2009 sutton et al 2010 van der hoek et al 2016 mansouri et al 2017 papa et al 2017 cellulose is a major fraction from the incoming organic matter and could be directly recovered and reused ruiken et al 2013 chen et al 2017 ma et al 2016 the attention on cellulose as a resource to be reclaimed and recycled is already taken up by dutch water boards stowa 2013 jansen 2017 boztas 2017 cellulose recovery not only contributes to a circular economy but also leads to savings in energy for aeration and lower total sludge production recovery of cellulose can be easily implemented with the aid of fine mesh sieves ruiken et al 2013 in this paper with sieve is referred to fine mesh sieves sieves are already used in wastewater treatment plants in order to retain part of the organic matter before it reaches the biological reactor rusten and ødegaard 2006 reducing thus the aeration energy and the production of sludge ghasimi et al 2016 some authors claim a better performing nitrification and overall biogas production when sieved materials are redirected to the anaerobic digester rusten et al 2016 sieves are also widely used within membrane bioreactor treatment plants mbr where they are used to remove fibres in order to protect the membranes schier and frechen 2009 a large fraction of this sieving material consists of the cellulose fibres certainly when the sieves are applied under a high loading rate the sievings can be very highly enriched in cellulose fibres ruiken et al 2013 the retained sieving material from influent will contain appr 60 80 cellulose fibres ruiken et al 2013 the other organic components will be hair fat leaves seeds plastic ect composition if the sieving material of sludge is not known yet activated sludge models asm are the main tools used for wwtp design and operation henze et al 2000 so far three general models are available asm1 asm2 and asm3 each with several modifications have been proposed the influent composition for these models was mainly characterised based on respirometric experiments which means that no precise characterisation of components in the influent is made for practice respirometric methods are generally replaced by physical separation methods roeleveld and van loosdrecht 2002 in general a distinction is made between soluble and particulate fractions the latter consists of slowly biodegradable and inert cod fractions besides the biomass fractions nowak et al 1999 presented an adapted asm1 model in which xv described as very slowly biodegradable particulate matter was introduced as a model component the nature of this component was not specified but was estimated to constitute 10 15 of the influent cod the introduction of this new state variable was based on the observation that the division between inert and slowly biodegradable particulate material seemed to depend on the temperature and sludge age of the wastewater treatment plant also friedrich et al 2016 indicated that inert particulate cod can be biodegradable since when embedded in activated sludge cellulose is only very slowly hydrolysed ruiken et al 2013 and its biodegradation is more extensive in summer than in winter it is here proposed that the xv fraction described by nowak et al 1999 might be dominantly representing the cellulose fraction in the wastewater recently revilla et al 2016a b proposed an activated sludge model for the treatment of industrial wastewater from a cellulose factory with cellulose as state variable it is however not relevant in the case of municipal wastewater plants because it focuses on the effects of microbial predation in a bas biofilm activated sludge processes this phenomenon is not relevant in traditional activated sludge systems to the authors knowledge no municipal wastewater activated sludge model incorporating cellulose as state variable has been proposed yet this is a considerable omission in wastewater modelling since cellulose is an important fraction in wastewater and the real impact of sieves as applied in mbr processes or for raw wastewater primary treatment for example cannot be properly modelled the development of such a model is especially important in light of the growing interest in resource recovery from wastewater in this paper we present an asm1 based model that describes the behaviour of cellulose during the activated sludge process we use the model to describe the impact of cellulose recovery by sieves on the wastewater treatment process the goal of the paper is to show the range of different possible effects when the degradation rate of cellulose still unknown is varied within the range of possible values addition of cellulose as a standard state variable in commercially available asm models would be worth considering 2 materials and methods a modified version of asm1 asm1cl was developed introducing cellulose as a state variable called xcl cellulose was assumed to be partly slowly biodegradable particulate substrate xs and partly particulate inert organic matter xi in asm1 xcl was assumed to undergo hydrolysis introduced as a new process in the model with subsequent production of readily biodegradable substrate ss cellulose hydrolysis was assumed to follow a first order degradation kinetic x c l s s with ρ 9 k c l x c l where kcl is the cellulose hydrolysis constant t 1 and ρ9 is the process rate ml 3t 1 the hydrolysis process of xs includes enzymatic activities but also protozoan degradation processes moussa et al 2005 and therefore the rate is depending on redox conditions cellulose is enzymatically hydrolysed and therefore this process is not influenced by redox conditions table 1 shows the proposed model matrix for asm1cl different kinetics can describe cellulose degradation such as first order weimer 1992 modified contois von munch et al 1999 and monod mino et al 1995 considering that cellulose hydrolysis occurs on the surface of the particles the degradation rate is likely dependent on the specific surface this would result in a rate kinetics with a power of 2 3 in the cellulose concentration however since the actual process is not well characterised a simple first order degradation kinetic equation was chosen the hydrolysis process rate coefficient was assumed to be temperature dependent through the arrhenius relationship with a theta value of 1 1098 c 1 similar as for biomass decay k t k 20 c e ϑ t 20 c the asm1cl model was calibrated with the process data from wwtp blaricum in the netherlands the influent of this plant is 100 domestic wastewater the treatment scheme is described in fig 2 the operational data are listed in table 2 for calibration yearly averages were used for an average temperature of 14 c for modelling aquasim was used reichert p 1994 3 results and discussion 3 1 influent characterisation during the research several measurements of cellulose have been performed both in incoming wastewater and in activated sludge we used a method based on van soest 1963 and performed by the company masterlab in the netherlands the method gave reproducible data for cellulose amount in influent suspended solids however in sludge the measurement data were inconsistent with each other and they had a large standard deviation unpublished results since we have no validation on the accuracy of influent measurements we rather used the estimated amount of cellulose disposed per person in the wastewater for the influent load we assumed a value of cellulose discharged in the sewer corresponding to 10 kg pp y for wwtp blaricum this translates to a cellulose load of 822 kg d based on recent 2018 preliminary results research is going on and not published yet we measured cellulose fibres in 8 samples of influent this was done by filtering 60 l of influent over a 90 μm mesh filter and application of van soest method at the wwtp blaricum we measured cellulose to be appr 45 and at the wwtp amsterdam west appr 40 of the organic suspended solids in the influent based on 242 mgss l or appr 220 organic ss in the influent of wwtp blaricum table 2 and 45 cellulose with an influent flow 8123 m3 d table 2 gives 804 kg d for this publication we decided to use 822 kg d 10 kg pp y wwtp blaricum was modelled by asm1 before for an internal study by the dutch water company waternet the original influent cod characterisation for asm1 had to be adapted in order to introduce the cellulose component as mentioned in model development section xcl was assumed to be derived partially from xs and partially from xi for wwtp blaricum the total incoming particulate cod and the average excess sludge production are known table 2 the incoming particulate cod has to be divided in three fractions for cellulose a fixed amount based on 10 kg pp y was assumed meaning that the xs and xi fraction could be calibrated based on the sludge production a detailed description of this method is publicized by roeleveld roeleveld et al 2002 it should be noted that the sludge production will also depend on the value of the cellulose hydrolysis rate which set at a default value at this stage the resulting influent characterisation is given in table 3 the particulate cod partitioning in xi xs and xcl for asm1 and asm1cl are shown in fig 3 the estimation of the incoming particulate cod fractions for wwtp blaricum was made based on the estimated incoming cellulose load and the total amount of excess sludge produced this fractionation depends on the degradation rate of cellulose where we assumed a default value for the hydrolysis rate coefficient kcl if cellulose in the excess sludge could be measured reliably it would be possible to calibrate this parameter however hereto first a reliable method that is not influenced by the sludge matrix will have to be developed therefore we evaluated the impact of changing kcl values on the calibration of the influent xs and xi fractions table 4 reports the result of the calibration as function of the hydrolysis rate constant especially for the lower values there would be a significant impact on the influent characterisation however these low rate coefficients would lead to very low values likely too low for the amount of inert material in the influent 3 2 evaluation of the integrated plant model the model with the default influent composition was further evaluated with respect to the uncertain parameters the impact of the assumed kcl on the predicted amount of cellulose in the excess sludge is represented in fig 4 as it could be expected the trend is exponentially decreasing for rate coefficients larger than around 0 2 1 d the fraction of cellulose in the sludge is relatively constant variation in range of what could be expected as error in a good measurement the processes that take place in the activated sludge process are temperature dependent and this dependency is incorporated in the asm1cl model hereto we evaluated the impact of temperature for various rate coefficients on the total excess sludge production fig 5 under summer conditions there is some 5 10 variation in the predicted sludge production when a reasonable range of temperature coefficients are used cellulose recovery would decrease the cod load to the treatment plant while leaving the nitrogen load virtually unchanged this might impact the overall nitrogen removal potential because of a lower cod availability for denitrification with the asm1cl model for wwtp blaricum the impact of placing a sieve in the return sludge line see figs 6 and 7 on the nitrogen removal efficiency was evaluated note that ammonium in the effluent is low and therefore not influenced in these simulation results full nitrification is always occurring in systems with limited nitrification capacity removal of cellulose would allow a higher srt at constant sludge concentration in aeration basin and thereby a lower ammonium concentration in the effluent the effect of sieving and of different kcl values is given in fig 6 there is a small impact indeed which is also depending on the temperature the impact is much smaller than expected from the changed cod n ratio caused by cellulose recovery this is due to the fact that part of the cellulose is not hydrolysed anyway and a large fraction of hydrolysis occurs in the aeration tank of the system i e resulting in aerobic cellulose conversion 3 3 application of simulation model to the effect of sieves placement the obtained model was used to estimate the impact of sieving and the sieving placement influent or return sludge at a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp located in blaricum the netherlands from a modelling point of view the sieves were conceived as selective filters for cellulose with different levels of efficiency the concept of sieve efficiency can in real terms be seen from two different points of view a sieve with 50 efficiency for instance could either be a sieve that filters all the flow and only manages to retain 50 of the cellulose or a sieve that filters 50 of the flow with an absolute 100 efficiency cellulose can be retrieved at the treatment plant either directly from the influent or from within the activated sludge process these two options were compared by extending the model fig 7 for the influent sieve this is straightforward for the activated sludge several options are possible e g in the return sludge or in a recycle loop in the activated sludge tanks the position of the sieve is not relevant for the outcome of the simulations as long as it sieves the activated sludge with the simulated efficiency in this model we placed it in the return sludge in practice the position will likely depend heavily on the local situation although the size of the sieves could be smaller when placed in the return sludge flow fig 7 shows the position of the sieves in the treatment scheme sieves will decrease aeration costs and sludge disposal costs therefore the impact of sieving is presented as the change in operational expenditure opex the calculated reduction in oxygen requirements due to sieving is transformed into a kwh demand kg o2 kwh which at a cost of 0 1 kwh translates to reduced operational costs the reduced sludge production is associated with a costs of 0 6 kg dry solids treatment cost for excess sludge these economical figures are based on costs occurring in the netherlands as assessed by waternet and can be different for different geographic areas the sludge treatment costs include transport and treatment and are

19354,onsite runoff control is considered an important part of sustainable urban drainage schemes but estimating the maximum runoff flow rate from a catchment with onsite runoff controls remains controversial runoff controls complicate the issue by dividing the catchment into several subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls which dynamically regulate the catchment imperviousness rational method rm is the most employed technique to determine maximum flow rates for designing urban drainage infrastructures but it cannot handle such conditions nonetheless it has advantages over alternative methods in terms of principle from the urban drainage design perspective this work develops rational method prime rmp that follows the basic principle of rm but instead recalculates catchment variables by taking into account runoff control effects and evaluates runoff control efficiencies by using two indices rmp has three merits 1 providing an integrated response of the whole catchment with runoff controls 2 interpreting runoff control effects by plotting runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves 3 connecting the design of runoff controls and storm sewers that are based on different design principles and rainfall statistics case study results showed that runoff controls reduced peak flow rates by 5 83 91 6 corresponding to reduction factors for return

introduction 1 1 peak flow rate from a catchment with runoff controls urbanization lead to covering the ground with impervious surfaces like roofs and roads which dramatically alter the surrounding environment editor of science magazine 2016 the conventional urban drainage model that carries rainwater runoff quickly to a stream by piped systems results in urban stream syndrome such as increased runoff volume and peak flow and more pollutants reaching the river etc walsh et al 2005 in addition climate change may have an amplifying effect on such problems sofia et al 2017 an effective solution is source control of stormwater runoff by using infiltration and storage in situ to reduce runoff discharge runoff control does not only reduce urban flooding risk effectively xie et al 2017 but it also decreases runoff pollutant discharge significantly bressy et al 2014 feng et al 2012 lefevre et al 2012 li and davis 2014 while causing less combined sewer overflow liao et al 2015 montalto et al 2007 thanks to the advantages of runoff control usage of onsite runoff control has increased since 1990s and is included in urban drainage schemes worldwide such as the sustainable urban drainage system suds in the united kingdom low impact development lid and green infrastructure in the united states water sensitive urban design in australia fletcher et al 2015 and sponge city in china xia et al 2017 also onsite runoff management has become a necessary indicator for rating a green building site u s green building council 2013 in catchments with runoff controls runoff from impervious surfaces flow to control facilities which do not produce discharge until they are filled rather than moving runoff directly to catchment outlet thus compared with conventional urban catchments runoff controls produce three important changes 1 the catchment is divided into several subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls 2 catchment imperviousness is regulated by runoff controls in a dynamic way 3 time of concentration of the catchment may be delayed these changes raise a science question how and to what extent can onsite runoff controls change peak flow rates in the design of storm drains the natural resources conservation service nrcs methodology applies a pond and swamp adjustment factor to address the surface detention effect on peak flow attenuation but this factor is applied only for ponds or swamps not in time of concentration flow path usda 1986 the effect of onsite runoff control on peak flow attenuation was also observed and statistically analyzed davis 2008 hunt et al 2008 but regression analyses has unsuccessfully attempted to predict peak flow reduction and timing because the irregularity of natural rainfall patterns and the variable detention storage in specific events make regression results arguably meaningless stovin et al 2012 these situations are not difficult to solve by modeling approaches and model simulation can be carried out based on single events obtained via observation ghadim and hin 2017 or generated by the rainfall intensity duration frequency idf formula accompanied with a standard hyetograph xie et al 2017 however modeling results do not directly and explicitly provide design maximum flow rates rational method rm has been employed for over 150 years to determine maximum runoff flow rates for designing urban drainage structures such as storm sewers and culverts and it is found in the majority of urban drainage manuals and textbooks because it is easy to use and condenses essential components of runoff estimation and drainage system principles which are good for teaching the fundamentals of storm water management compared with the alternative methods rm has theoretical advantages of estimating maximum flow rate at a certain probability but it cannot handle the above complex situations either 1 2 rational method and its last unpacked assumption rational method is based on the idf relationship in which rainfall intensity decreases with increasing rainfall duration and rarer events greater return period tend to have higher rainfall intensities for a given duration an idf curve at a certain return period can be fit by the following equation debo and reese 2002 1 i a d b n where i is rainfall intensity mm min a is a constant in the idf formula d is rainfall duration min b is a constant in the idf formula and n is a constant in the idf formula a cluster of idf curves at different return periods can be fit by the idf formula which is widely used in china jiao et al 2017 liao et al 2013 qin et al 2013 2 i a 1 1 c lg t d b n where a 1 is a constant in the idf formula c is a constant in the idf formula and t is return period year or yr i is the average rainfall depth over d thus total rainfall depth over d can be computed as 3 i i t d d where i is rainfall depth mm the basic principle of rm is that maximum flow rates occur when rainfall duration equals time of concentration which denotes the time it takes the flow to move from the most remote point to the discharge point and consists of overland flow time and channel or sewer flow time 4 t c t e t f where t c is time of concentration min t e is time of entry min and t f is time of sewer flow min with d t c t year rainfall intensity can be determined as 5 i i t t c a 1 1 c lg t t c b n then rm computes maximum flow rate as 6 q 167 c i a 7 c j 1 k c j a j j 1 k a j in which q is maximum flow rate l s c is runoff coefficient a is catchment area hm 2 k is number of distinct land covers c j is runoff coefficient for land cover j and a j is area of land cover j hm 2 indeed the original rational method is based on four assumptions 1 the rate of rainfall is constant throughout the storm and uniform over the whole catchment 2 the contributing area is uniform over the whole catchment 3 sewers flow at constant pipe full velocity throughout time of concentration 4 catchment imperviousness is constant throughout the storm butler and davies 2011 these assumptions also cause the method s limitations fig 1 provides a technical roadmap for overcoming these limitations the modified rational method is a somewhat recent adaptation of rational method 1 0 and has two versions version 1 is used in the united kingdom and modifies runoff coefficient as c c v c r where c r is dimensionless routing coefficient which addresses the fact that runoffs from some parts of the site would flow to the downstream point faster than others that tends to be ignored ballard et al 2015 version 2 is used in the united states and was developed to estimate runoff volumes and hydrographs using the same input data and coefficients as rational method along with the further assumption that the duration of peak producing rainfall is also the entire storm duration akan 2002 state of new jersey 2016 aiming at unfolding the assumptions time area method takes into account the time varying rainfall and the catchment shape breaking assumptions 1 and 2 and output flow hydrographs can be produced trrl method takes into account of the pipe storage effect which breaks assumption 3 butler and davies 2011 the last one that has not been unpacked is the assumption of constant catchment imperviousness throughout the storm which particularly does not stand for sustainable urban drainage systems in addition how differences in rainfall statistical methods affect peak flow control is rarely reported the ideal target of an onsite runoff control is to maintain or restore to the maximum extent technically feasible the predevelopment hydrology usepa 2009 this goal can be achieved by preventing off site runoff discharge of precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to a critical runoff control design rainfall depth e g the 95th percentile rainfall event mm d that is determined by statistical analysis of long term daily rainfall data usepa 2009 how well this goal is achieved can be measured by comparing catchment scale water balances askarizadeh et al 2015 or hydrological frequency curves wang et al 2018 before and after development however this statistical method for designing runoff control is different from idf sampling method applied for rational method therefore the goals of this study are 1 to move towards rm 2 0 by developing a new method that takes into account runoff control effects at the catchment scale addressing the last of the assumptions from rm 1 0 and 2 to use the newly developed method to examine peak flow control efficiencies across four cities that vary in precipitation patterns 2 method development and application 2 1 rational method redevelopment 2 1 1 potential range of peak flow rate rm provides a unique value of maximum flow rate for a given return period there are three key catchment variables for estimating the peak flow rate 1 catchment area 2 runoff coefficient and 3 time of concentration however setting up onsite runoff controls in the catchment complicates runoff flow condition at the catchment scale which alters these three catchment variables and results in a range of maximum flow rates that vary from worst case to best case worst case means that it recently rained so the detention storage of the runoff control facility is totally used out while best case is on the other way round below we use peak flow rate denoted as q to describe maximum flow rate as peak flow rates could be high and low which is more suitable to represent the scope of maximum flow rate at catchment with runoff control and chose to analyze the scope of q since these overland effects only change t e and not t f the latter can be considered as a constant thus the subsequent portion uses t e instead of t c and the key catchment variables become catchment area runoff coefficient and time of entry in the worst case scenario runoff control facility has no detention storage and thus plays no role in flow attenuation i e i and a do not change and runoff coefficient is the only catchment variable that may change in this case the original rm remains applicable as 8 q m a x 167 c i t t e a where q is potential peak flow rate l s q m a x is peak flow rate in worst case l s and c is runoff coefficient q m a x is the upper limit value of q and the worst case design flow for the storm sewer the best case reflects a scenario in which detention storage of the runoff control facility is fully usable and plays a predominant role in flow attenuation under this circumstance q reaches the lower limit value q m i n defined as 9 q m i n 167 c i a where q m i n is peak flow rate in best case l s and i is rainfall intensity mm min i i t t e t e is time of entry considering runoff control effects min a is contributing catchment area hm 2 all the three catchment variables in best case i e c t e and a need to be recalculated 2 1 2 recalculating catchment variables 1 time of entry t e in the best case scenario t e is delayed by onsite runoff controls assuming the detention storage of a stormwater runoff control facility is filled at d t l i d water balance is defined as fig 2 10 10 c v i t t l i d t e l i d t l i d t e l i d a d 0 001 i t t l i d t l i d a l i d a s l i d d l i d a i l i d f t l i d 0 at d t l i d the runoff amount received from a d is 10 c v i t t l i d t e l i d t l i d t e l i d a d m3 because it takes t e l i d for the runoff to move from a d to the runoff control lid facility meanwhile all rainfall fell on the facility is captured and equals to 0 001 i t t l i d t l i d a l i d m3 eq 10 can be simplified for different runoff control types as shown in table 1 for instance for a permeable pavement not connecting an impervious area with a l i d a s l i d a i l i d eq 10 becomes 11 0 001 i t t l i d t l i d d l i d f t l i d 0 t l i d can be easily solved by iteration using the microsoft excel goal seek function rainfall duration rendering the water balance less than or equal to the convergence target e g 10 6 is the t l i d otherwise the runoff control will not produce off site runoff discharge this is illustrated by fig 3 at t 0 5 year the water balance is always below zero indicating that there is no off site runoff discharge at t 3 year the water balance reaches zero at d 43 9 min indicating t l i d 43 9 min t 1 year is a special case in which t l i d 189 min which is beyond effective duration in the idf formula i e 120 min in this case the facility should be thought as producing no off site runoff discharge in addition since rainfall intensity is a descending curve against duration the water balance may be a concave curve with a downward opening and two intersections with the horizontal x axis among which only the intersection in the left rising part corresponds to the t l i d in case of multiple runoff control facilities times of entry in the best case for each subcatchment and the whole catchment can be defined as 12 t e m t l i d m t f l i d m 13 t e m a x t e 1 t e 2 t e m where m is the number of independent lid facilities and t f l i d is time of flow from the lid facility to the catchment outlet min 2 contributing catchment area a it is the sum of subcatchment areas that contribute off site runoff discharge to the catchment outlet if a runoff control facility does not contribute to off site runoff discharge the corresponding subcatchment area should be excluded from catchment area a 3 runoff coefficient c the onsite runoff control may alter the catchment runoff coefficient by changing both c j and a j 14 c j 1 k c j a j j 1 k a j where a j is the contributing area for land cover j hm 2 and c j is the runoff coefficient for land cover j with the onsite runoff control the runoff coefficient herein is the value when peak flow occurs for example a raingarden area a l i d located in greenspace area a j runoff coefficient c j as it is filled and contributes to off site runoff discharge its interception and infiltration situation becomes similar to that of the surrounding greenspace area indicating that the raingarden does not alter c j and a j as the raingarden is not filled and not producing off site runoff discharge the contributing area of greenspace decreases as a j a j a l i d but c j c j on the contrary a permeable pavement produces off site runoff discharge with c j c j but a j a j by recalculating the three variables t e c j and a this new method directly takes into account runoff control effects in the later parts of this work the efficacy of this new method will be assessed from two aspects 1 providing an integrated response of the whole catchment 2 interpreting runoff control effects by breaking the catchment into multiple subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls and plotting runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves 2 1 3 indices of peak flow rate control in order to evaluate to what extent onsite runoff controls can affect the peak flow rate two indices were proposed the first is ratio of peak flow rate reduction 15 r q q q q 1 q q where r q is peak flow reduction ratio for onsite runoff control in the worst case eq 15 can be reduced as r q 1 c j c the second is reduction factor for return period of maximum flow rate it is normally assumed that frequency of rainfall intensity is equal to that of maximum flow rate namely that t year rainfall intensity drives the t year maximum flow rate this is reasonable for the catchment of which imperviousness is constant throughout the storm i e one of the assumptions of the original rm but is not true for catchments with onsite runoff controls setting up onsite runoff controls would decrease the peak flow rate from q to q in a catchment without setting up onsite runoff controls q corresponds to rainfall intensity i q 167 c a and i corresponds to return period t 16 t t i t e p q 167 c a t e where t is equivalent return period because of the deploying onsite runoff controls year in the worst case since q q m a x 167 c i a eq 16 can simplified as t t i c c t e thus runoff controls can reduce return period of runoff event expressed by maximum flow rate from t year to t year of which the effect is evaluated as 17 d t t t in which d t is reduction factor for return period of maximum flow rate this novel technique still follows the basic principle of rational method but differs by recalculating catchment variables and proposing two indices that evaluate runoff peak control efficiencies this new method adds a mark to situations that take into account runoff control effects and is thus termed rational method prime 2 2 application of rational method prime 2 2 1 site description we applied rational method prime to a development project covering 11458 m2 of which land cover catchment variables the runoff control scheme and design parameters are shown in fig 4 two runoff control measures were 1 permeable pavement and 2 raingarden the permeable pavement was applied to the parking lot which captures rainfall and infiltrates rainwater into the underlying soil the raingarden was placed in greenspace which captures runoff from roofs and roads and infiltrates rainwater into the underlying soil the design objective of these runoff controls is to prevent off site runoff discharge of precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to a certain percentile rainfall event usepa 2009 thus the size of the runoff control facility was computed by water balance under the design conditions fig 2 as 18 10 d s t o r m c v a d 0 001 d s t o r m a l i d a s l i d d l i d a i l i d f t i n where t i n is design infiltration duration min and d s t o r m is lid design rainfall event mm d eq 18 does not consider flow routing and time of concentration because the water balance is computed at 24 h intervals this time step is larger than time of concentration for a small urban watershed indeed onsite runoff controls can retain not only rainfall events d s t o r m but also the portion of rainfall d s t o r m in events larger than d s t o r m the ratio of the sum of precipitation that can be retained in situ to total precipitation is defined as the precipitation volume capture ratio pvcr which is used in china as performance design objective and is determined by statistical analysis of 30 years of daily rainfall data li et al 2015 mohurd 2014a as shown in fig 5 china sponge city development technical guide low impact development partitions mainland china into 5 divisions applying different pvcr targets from 60 to 90 li et al 2015 urumqi kunming guiyang and guangzhou were selected to represent division i iv respectively among which guangzhou kunming and guiyang are in the subtropical monsoon climate while urumqi is in the temperate continental climate as shown in table 2 precipitation patterns were expressed by the idf formula and pvcr d s t o r m relationship the shortest effective duration of the idf formulas was 120 min urumqi and used as a unified effective duration for conducting comparisons under the same conditions the sizes of runoff control facilities at different sites were computed by eq 18 as shown in table 3 for each site the permeable pavement s d l i d was computed by eq 18 assuming the permeable pavement area to equal the parking lot area and the raingarden a l i d was computed with fixed raingarden s d l i d fig 4 because the raingarden is placed in greenspace its d l i d if necessary can be increased to prevent raingarden a l i d from being larger than that of the greenspace as design criteria and parameters were the same runoff control sizes in the order from smallest to biggest was urumqi kunming guiyang guangzhou as weather conditions were the same the higher the pvcr and or the shorter the t i n the larger the size of the runoff control facility specifically permeable pavement s d l i d 0 for kunming site with pvcr 60 and t i n 12 h and urumqi site with pvcr 60 85 and t i n 12 h indicating that detention storage volume is not taken into consideration in these scenarios 2 2 2 evaluation of scenarios the project was assumed to be carried out in four cities with the same design criteria i e the four project sites only differed in precipitation patterns the parameters constituting the evaluation scenarios are summarized as shown in table 4 total site scenarios 4 climates 6 pvcrs 2 t i n 48 for each site peak flow rate and timing were computed these scenarios and computation results were used to assess the efficacy of the new method and to examine runoff control efficiencies across four cities that vary in precipitation patterns then how the new method may improve the design of suds was discussed 3 results 3 1 method efficacy we used two examples to illustrate the method s efficacy as follow 3 1 1 computing the catchment response quickly example 1 urumqi site pvcr 75 t i n 12 h t 1 or 3 year example 1 corresponds to fig 3 where the raingarden does not produce off site runoff discharge as t 1 year q m a x and q m i n of the whole catchment were computed directly using eq 8 and eq 9 as shown in table 5 runoff control may reduce the peak flow rate in three ways 1 delaying time of entry e g t e 5 min vs t e 46 4 min best case t 3 year 2 lowering of runoff coefficient e g c 0 756 vs c 0 25 best case t 1 year 3 reducing the contributing catchment area e g a 1 1458 hm2 vs a 0 3177 hm2 best case t 1 year 3 1 2 interpreting runoff control effects example 2 kunming site pvcr 85 t i n 12h t 5 year in example 2 three ways by which runoff control reduces peak flow were interpreted from runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves in fig 6 as follows 1 lowering of runoff coefficient from c to c before development the whole catchment was covered by greenspace with runoff coefficient being 0 18 thus the maximum flow rate is low point f d t e after development the runoff coefficient was increased to 0 756 and hence the maximum flow rate became much higher than that before development represented by q point g d t e in the worst case of runoff control q q m a x point a d t e and was slightly lower than q because the catchment runoff coefficient was reduced from 0 756 to 0 712 since permeable pavement was applied to the parking lot 2 reducing contributing catchment area from a to a in the best case of runoff control the whole catchment is broken into three subcatchments namely greenspace permeable pavement and raingarden to facilitate the generation of runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves for each subcatchment finally these curves were combined to interpret how and to what extent runoff controls affect runoff peak flow rates at the whole catchment level in the best case t e 1 represents the subcatchment permeable pavement and t e 2 represents the subcatchment raingarden as d t e 1 both subcatchment permeable pavement and raingarden were excluded from the contributing catchment area and q was largest at d t e point b as d t e 2 the subcatchment raingarden was still excluded from contributing to the catchment area and q was largest at d t e 1 point c 3 delaying time of entry from t e to t e in the best case of runoff control as d t e 2 greenspace permeable pavement and raingarden all contributed to runoff thus t e m a x t e 1 t e 2 t e 2 at d t e point d q was largest and q q m i n at this time the best case turned into the worst case and q m i n q m a x because a longer duration lead to less intense rainfall as d t e the runoff flow rate was lower than before development nonetheless q m i n should be the lower limit of the peak flow rate because this can happen above all in both worst case and best cases the peak flow rate occurred when rainfall duration equals time of entry i e t e for worst case or t e for best case 3 2 efficiencies of runoff peak control runoff control efficiencies across four cities that differ in precipitation patterns were evaluated by r q and d t as shown in fig 7 in the worst case of runoff control r q was a constant not associated with the rainfall condition and equaled 5 83 in the best case the results varied with the pvcr and return period the higher the pvcr and or the shorter the return period the higher the r q for pvcr 60 85 and t 0 5 20 year the results ranged from 17 4 to 71 8 kunming 17 9 71 9 guiyang 20 2 66 4 guangzhou and 28 2 91 6 urumqi respectively in particular the raingarden at the urumqi site produced no off site runoff discharge in the following scenarios pvcr 60 and t 0 5 year pvcr 75 and t 0 5 or 1 year pvcr 85 and t 0 5 1 2 or 3 year in these conditions maximum r q 90 7 91 6 was obtained reduction of the peak flow rate suggested that runoff control could reduce the return period of the runoff event expressed by maximum flow rate for instance runoff control with pvcr 85 at the kunming site could reduce a 20 year runoff event to 13 9 year in the worst case or 2 6 year in the best case t and t are linearly related with a slope of d t that ranged from 0 13 to 0 71 kunming 0 12 to 0 71 guiyang 0 06 to 0 76 urumqi and 0 04 to 0 63 guangzhou respectively the lower the d t the better the effect of controlling the return period of runoff event scenarios at the urumqi site in which runoff controls produced no off site runoff discharge are not included in fig 7 because in these scenarios the contributing catchment area was significantly reduced that a different slope was achieved fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 influencing factors of runoff peak controls 4 1 1 effects of design parameters the effects of design parameters on peak flow rates are illustrated in fig 9 depicting results at the kunming site in the best case subfigure a illustrates how detention storage determined the step change in runoff flow rate rainfall duration curve at pvcr 60 and t i n 12 h permeable pavement s d l i d 0 m table 3 and thus permeable pavement s t l i d 0 only the step for the subcatchment raingarden was found on the curve pvcr 60 but none for the subcatchment permeable pavement in practice d l i d cannot be zero because of the porous structure in permeable pavements thus d l i d 0 would lead to flow rate overestimation in this study this was done for a fair comparison between the site scenarios under the same design criteria in practice this issue can be solved by presetting a minimum d l i d for permeable pavements according to structural requirements subfigure b illustrates how storage infiltration allocation influenced runoff control performance it can be seen in eq 18 that the precipitation volume captured was shared by storage a s l i d d l i d and infiltration a i l i d f t i n compared with t i n 12 h t i n 2 h resulted in larger storage volume and stronger ability of delaying time of entry this effect is expressed as a later step on the runoff flow rate rainfall duration curve t i n 2 h and hence a lower peak flow rate it is obvious in fig 9 b that the permeable pavement is more sensitive to this effect than raingarden which is also demonstrated in table 3 compared with the kunming site pvcr 85 and t i n 12 h at the same site and pvcr but t i n 2 h raingarden area s a s l i d would increase by 2 3 while permeable pavement s d l i d would increase by 78 3 this is because when sizing raingarden the first item 10 d s t o r m c v a d on the left side of eq 18 compressed the effect of t i n on storage volume a s l i d d l i d but this item 10 d s t o r m c v a d does not exist when sizing permeable pavements subfigure c illustrates how return period of storm event affects runoff control efficiencies the shape of the runoff flow rate rainfall duration curve does not change with return period but as return period decreases the curve moves down and right this confirms the observation that runoff control can better reduce the peak flow rate q m i n and delay flow peak t e in small to midsize storm events hunt et al 2008 4 1 2 effects of rainfall statistics the effects of precipitation patterns on runoff control performance is illustrated in fig 10 in which stormwater drainage is designed with the same criteria as pvcr 85 t i n 12 h and t 5 year for the four sites the order of rainfall intensity at the four sites from lowest to highest was guangzhou guiyang kunming urumqi and guangzhou s rainfall intensity was around 5 9 times urumqi s rainfall intensity fig 11 the order of q m i n from lowest to highest was also guangzhou guiyang kunming urumqi but q m i n of the guangzhou site was 12 3 times that of the urumqi site t e of urumqi was notably later which made q m i n of the urumqi site further lower d s t o r m for designing runoff controls and the idf formula for designing storm sewers are obtained by different rainfall statistical methods d s t o r m is based on daily rainfall data while the idf formula is based on the most intense rainfall in minutes what kind of storm events are retained by onsite runoff controls can be roughly estimated by comparing d s t o r m and 1 hour rainfall depth i as shown in fig 12 d s t o r m at pvcr 85 was equal to 0 39 0 66 and 0 8 year 1 hour rainfall depth in guangzhou kunming and guiyang respectively indicating that runoff controls could only retain frequent smaller rain events however d s t o r m at pvcr 85 was equal to 7 32 year 1 hour rainfall depth in urumqi indicating that runoff controls therein could retain midsize storm events which not only led much later t e at the urumqi site but also prevented the subcatchment raingarden from contributing to the catchment area a in common rain events such as t 0 5 or 1 year fig 13 urumqi is in the temperate continental climate with annual average rainfall depth below 300 mm which may explain these phenomena in order to prevent excessive rainwater detention infiltration should be a better runoff control measure than raingarden in arid areas such as urumqi our findings using rational method prime allow comparison of runoff control measures and storm sewer designs based on different design principles and rainfall statistical data in current chinese manuals and guidelines table 2 the period of rainfall records for the idf formula and rainfall events in the lid design are not the same for more accurate analysis and a better integrated design of runoff controls and storm sewers we suggest that relevant authorities unify the recording periods of these two types of rainfall information 4 2 rational method prime and rational method 2 0 this study developed rational method prime which can compute the peak flow rate in any scenario given an initial storage volume though was only used to derive q m i n and q m a x in this study besides by setting different t e l i d and t f l i d how the spatial distribution of runoff control measures affects catchment responses can be evaluated by this method in general a better spatial distribution of runoff control measures further reduces q by further delaying t e and results would be site specific as a summary rational method prime has three merits 1 quickly computing peak flow rate of the whole catchment using eq 8 and eq 9 2 interpreting runoff control effects by breaking the catchment into many subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls and then plotting runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves 3 connecting the design of runoff controls and storm sewers that are based on different design principles and rainfall statistics rational method prime proposed here takes into account runoff control effects at the catchment scale and contributes to breaking assumption 4 of rational method 1 0 fig 1 for an integrated design of runoff controls and storm drains rational method prime should be combined with time area method because rmp only partly changes overland flow computation of rational method 1 0 indeed trrl is not always needed since 2014 china has revised the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering which no longer considers pipe storage effects let alone surcharge effects in the design of urban drainage systems to cope with urban flooding risk that increases with climate change mohurd 2014b currently rational method at age 150 could be free from the four assumptions and time area method trrl method and rational method prime can constitute rational method 2 0 considering that maintaining or restoring predevelopment hydrology is a remarkable feature of suds rational method 2 0 is meaningful to moving in the direction of suds 4 3 developing onsite runoff control potential climate change that makes rainstorm stronger and more frequent may lead to runoff load greater than the designed capacity of storm sewers already in place this is particularly difficult for built up areas to deal with because it is often unaffordable to enlarge existing underground drainage infrastructure therefore climate change increases urban flooding risk rational method prime showed that the maximum runoff flow at the catchment with onsite runoff controls potentially ranges from q m i n to q m a x q m a x should be applied as a design flow to new storm sewers while realizing q m i n would help prevent waterlogging of built storm sewers recently a new concept of smarter stormwater systems was proposed that advocates operational transformation of runoff control facilities from static to adaptive by equipping them with low cost sensors and controllers kerkez et al 2016 this offers an opportunity for onsite runoff controls to realize q m i n if a runoff control facility does not accept runoff from its connected impervious area until runoff peak occurs it could provide maximum peak flow attenuation while retaining the same runoff volume this new rational method provides an analytical tool for developing runoff control measures that are sustainable given changing rainfall patterns with climate change 5 conclusion onsite runoff control is considered an important part of sustainable urban drainage schemes worldwide which requires new methods to quantify changes in peak runoff flow rates when designing storm sewers rational method is the most employed tool to determine the maximum flow rate in designing urban stormwater infrastructure this method has not been applicable to the catchments with runoff controls to this end this study developed rational method prime that takes into account runoff control effects and then used it to examine runoff peak control efficiencies across four cities that vary in precipitation patterns the main conclusions include 1 rational method prime follows the basic principle of rational method but is different by recalculating catchment variables and evaluating runoff peak control efficiencies by two indices it adds an apostrophe to represent situations that onsite runoff control plays roles in flow attenuation rational method prime has three advantages 1 to compute an integrated response of the whole catchment with runoff control 2 to interpret effects of runoff control by plotting runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves 3 to connect the design of runoff control and storm sewers based on different design principles and rainfall statistics 2 runoff control may reduce peak flow in three ways i e delaying time of entry lowering runoff coefficient and reducing the contributing catchment area which make peak flow rate to potentially range from q m i n in the best case to q m a x in the worst case to evaluate these effects three cities were selected in the subtropical monsoon climate and one in the temperate continental climate to represent precipitation patterns pvcr 60 85 and t 0 5 20 year were chosen to represent stormwater design criteria in the worst case the peak flow reduction ratio is a constant irrelevant to rainfall conditions and equals to 5 83 but in the best case it ranges from 17 4 to 71 8 kunming 17 9 71 9 guiyang 20 2 66 4 guangzhou and 28 2 91 6 urumqi respectively 3 runoff controls can hinder the return period of runoff events from increasing with storm ahead in the context of climate change runoff control with pvcr 85 at the kunming site can reduce a 20 year runoff event expressed as maximum flow rate to 13 9 year in the worst case or 2 6 year in the best case for pvcr 60 85 and t 0 5 20 year reduction factor for return period of maximum flow rate range from 0 13 to 0 71 kunming 0 12 to 0 71 guiyang 0 06 to 0 76 urumqi and 0 04 to 0 63 guangzhou respectively smarter stormwater systems to realize q m i n is worthy of further development and rational method prime provides an analytical tool for developing such technologies 4 our proposed rational method prime addresses the assumption of constant catchment imperviousness from the original rm that is necessary for this method to assess sustainable urban drainage systems this work finishes paving the way from rational method 1 0 to rational method 2 0 which consists of time area method trrl method and rational method prime and could be used for an integrated design of onsite runoff control and storm sewers since maintaining or restoring predevelopment hydrology is a remarkable feature of sustainable urban drainage systems rational method 2 0 is meaningful to moving in that direction acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support of science technology commission of shanghai municipality 15dz1207806 and

19354,onsite runoff control is considered an important part of sustainable urban drainage schemes but estimating the maximum runoff flow rate from a catchment with onsite runoff controls remains controversial runoff controls complicate the issue by dividing the catchment into several subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls which dynamically regulate the catchment imperviousness rational method rm is the most employed technique to determine maximum flow rates for designing urban drainage infrastructures but it cannot handle such conditions nonetheless it has advantages over alternative methods in terms of principle from the urban drainage design perspective this work develops rational method prime rmp that follows the basic principle of rm but instead recalculates catchment variables by taking into account runoff control effects and evaluates runoff control efficiencies by using two indices rmp has three merits 1 providing an integrated response of

introduction 1 1 peak flow rate from a catchment with runoff controls urbanization lead to covering the ground with impervious surfaces like roofs and roads which dramatically alter the surrounding environment editor of science magazine 2016 the conventional urban drainage model that carries rainwater runoff quickly to a stream by piped systems results in urban stream syndrome such as increased runoff volume and peak flow and more pollutants reaching the river etc walsh et al 2005 in addition climate change may have an amplifying effect on such problems sofia et al 2017 an effective solution is source control of stormwater runoff by using infiltration and storage in situ to reduce runoff discharge runoff control does not only reduce urban flooding risk effectively xie et al 2017 but it also decreases runoff pollutant discharge significantly bressy et al 2014 feng et al 2012 lefevre et al 2012 li and davis 2014 while causing less combined sewer overflow liao et al 2015 montalto et al

surfaces flow to control facilities which do not produce discharge until they are filled rather than moving runoff directly to catchment outlet thus compared with conventional urban catchments runoff controls produce three important changes 1 the catchment is divided into several subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls 2 catchment imperviousness is regulated by runoff controls in a dynamic way 3 time of concentration of the catchment may be delayed these changes raise a science question how and to what extent can onsite runoff controls change peak flow rates in the design of storm drains the natural resources conservation service nrcs methodology applies a pond and swamp adjustment factor to address the surface detention effect on peak flow attenuation but this factor is applied only for ponds or swamps not in time of concentration flow path usda 1986 the effect of onsite runoff control on peak flow attenuation was also observed and statistically analyzed davis 2008 hunt et al 2008 but regression analyses has unsuccessfully attempted to predict peak flow reduction and timing because the irregularity of natural rainfall patterns and the variable detention storage in specific events make regression results arguably meaningless stovin et al 2012 these situations are not difficult to solve by modeling approaches and model simulation can be carried out based on single events obtained via observation ghadim and hin 2017 or generated by the rainfall intensity duration frequency idf formula accompanied with a standard hyetograph xie et al 2017 however modeling results do not directly and explicitly provide design maximum flow rates rational method rm has been employed for over 150 years to determine maximum runoff flow rates for designing urban drainage structures such as storm sewers and culverts and it is found in the majority of urban drainage manuals and textbooks because it is easy to use and condenses essential components of runoff estimation and drainage system principles which are good for teaching the fundamentals of storm water management compared with the alternative methods rm has theoretical advantages of estimating maximum flow rate at a certain probability but it cannot handle the above complex situations either 1 2 rational method and its last unpacked assumption rational method is based on the idf relationship in which rainfall intensity decreases with increasing rainfall duration and rarer events greater return period tend to have higher rainfall intensities for a given duration an idf curve at a certain return period can be fit by the following equation debo and reese 2002 1 i a d b n where i is rainfall intensity mm min a is a constant in the idf formula d is rainfall duration min b is a constant in the idf formula and n is a constant in the idf formula a cluster of idf curves at different return periods can be fit by the idf formula which is widely used in china jiao et al 2017 liao et al 2013 qin et al 2013 2 i a 1 1 c lg t d b n where a 1 is a constant in the idf formula c is a constant in the idf formula and t is return period year or yr i is the average rainfall depth over d thus total rainfall depth over d can be computed as 3 i i t d d where i is rainfall depth mm the basic principle of rm is that maximum flow rates occur when rainfall duration equals time of concentration which denotes the time it takes the flow to move from the most remote point to the discharge point and consists of overland flow time and channel or sewer flow time 4 t c t e t f where t c is time of concentration min t e is time of entry min and t f is time of sewer flow min with d t c t year rainfall intensity can be determined as 5 i i t t c a 1 1 c lg t t c b n then rm computes maximum flow rate as 6 q 167 c i a 7 c j 1 k c j a j j 1 k a j in which q is maximum flow rate l s c is runoff coefficient a is catchment area hm 2 k is number of distinct land covers c j is runoff coefficient for land cover j and a j is area of land cover j hm 2 indeed the original rational method is based on four assumptions 1 the rate of rainfall is constant throughout the storm and uniform over the whole catchment 2 the contributing area is uniform over the whole catchment 3 sewers flow at constant pipe full velocity throughout time of concentration 4 catchment imperviousness is constant throughout the storm butler and davies 2011 these assumptions also cause the method s limitations fig 1 provides a technical roadmap for overcoming these limitations the modified rational method is a somewhat recent adaptation of rational method 1 0 and has two versions version 1 is used in the united kingdom and modifies runoff coefficient as c c v c r where c r is dimensionless routing coefficient which addresses the fact that runoffs from some parts of the site would flow to the downstream point faster than others that tends to be ignored ballard et al 2015 version 2 is used in the united states and was developed to estimate runoff volumes and hydrographs using the same input data and coefficients as rational method along with the further assumption that the duration of peak producing rainfall is also the entire storm duration akan 2002 state of new jersey 2016 aiming at unfolding the assumptions time area method takes into account the time varying rainfall and the catchment shape breaking assumptions 1 and 2 and output flow hydrographs can be produced trrl method takes into account of the pipe storage effect which breaks assumption 3 butler and davies 2011 the last one that has not been unpacked is the assumption of constant catchment imperviousness throughout the storm which particularly does not stand for sustainable urban drainage systems in addition how differences in rainfall statistical methods affect peak flow control is rarely reported the ideal target of an onsite runoff control is to maintain or restore to the maximum extent technically feasible the predevelopment hydrology usepa 2009 this goal can be achieved by preventing off site runoff discharge of precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to a critical runoff control design rainfall depth e g the 95th percentile rainfall event mm d that is determined by statistical analysis of long term daily rainfall data usepa 2009 how well this goal is achieved can be measured by comparing catchment scale water balances askarizadeh et al 2015 or hydrological frequency curves wang et al 2018 before and after development however this statistical method for designing runoff control is different from idf sampling method applied for rational method therefore the goals of this study are 1 to move towards rm 2 0 by developing a new method that takes into account runoff control effects at the catchment scale addressing the last of the assumptions from rm 1 0 and 2 to use the newly developed method to examine peak flow control efficiencies across four cities that vary in precipitation patterns 2 method development and application 2 1 rational method redevelopment 2 1 1 potential range of peak flow rate rm provides a unique value of maximum flow rate for a given return period there are three key catchment variables for estimating the peak flow rate 1 catchment area 2 runoff coefficient and 3 time of concentration however setting up onsite runoff controls in the catchment complicates runoff flow condition at the catchment scale which alters these three catchment variables and results in a range of maximum flow rates that vary from worst case to best case worst case means that it recently rained so the detention storage of the runoff control facility is totally used out while best case is on the other way round below we use peak flow rate denoted as q to describe maximum flow rate as peak flow rates could be high and low which is more suitable to represent the scope of maximum flow rate at catchment with runoff control and chose to analyze the scope of q since these overland effects only change t e and not t f the latter can be considered as a constant thus the subsequent portion uses t e instead of t c and the key catchment variables become catchment area runoff coefficient and time of entry in the worst case scenario runoff control facility has no detention storage and thus plays no role in flow attenuation i e i and a do not change and runoff coefficient is the only catchment variable that may change in this case the original rm remains applicable as 8 q m a x 167 c i t t e a where q is potential peak flow rate l s q m a x is peak flow rate in worst case l s and c is runoff coefficient q m a x is the upper limit value of q and the worst case design flow for the storm sewer the best case reflects a scenario in which detention storage of the runoff control facility is fully usable and plays a predominant role in flow attenuation under this circumstance q reaches the lower limit value q m i n defined as 9 q m i n 167 c i a where q m i n is peak flow rate in best case l s and i is rainfall intensity mm min i i t t e t e is time of entry considering runoff control effects min a is contributing catchment area hm 2 all the three catchment variables in best case i e c t e and a need to be recalculated 2 1 2 recalculating catchment variables 1 time of entry t e in the best case scenario t e is delayed by onsite runoff controls assuming the detention storage of a stormwater runoff control facility is filled at d t l i d water balance is defined as fig 2 10 10 c v i t t l i d t e l i d t l i d t e l i d a d 0 001 i t t l i d t l i d a l i d a s l i d d l i d a i l i d f t l i d 0 at d t l i d the runoff amount received from a d is 10 c v i t t l i d t e l i d t l i d t e l i d a d m3 because it takes t e l i d for the runoff to move from a d to the runoff control lid facility meanwhile all rainfall fell on the facility is captured and equals to 0 001 i t t l i d t l i d a l i d m3 eq 10 can be simplified for different runoff control types as shown in table 1 for instance for a permeable pavement not connecting an impervious area with a l i d a s l i d a i l i d eq 10 becomes 11 0 001 i t t l i d t l i d d l i d f t l i d 0 t l i d can be easily solved by iteration using the microsoft excel goal seek function rainfall duration rendering the water balance less than or equal to the convergence target e g 10 6 is the t l i d otherwise the runoff control will not produce off site runoff discharge this is illustrated by fig 3 at t 0 5 year the water balance is always below zero indicating that there is no off site runoff discharge at t 3 year the water balance reaches zero at d 43 9 min indicating t l i d 43 9 min t 1 year is a special case in which t l i d 189 min which is beyond effective duration in the idf formula i e 120 min in this case the facility should be thought as producing no off site runoff discharge in addition since rainfall intensity is a descending curve against duration the water balance may be a concave curve with a downward opening and two intersections with the horizontal x axis among which only the intersection in the left rising part corresponds to the t l i d in case of multiple runoff control facilities times of entry in the best case for each subcatchment and the whole catchment can be defined as 12 t e m t l i d m t f l i d m 13 t e m a x t e 1 t e 2 t e m where m is the number of independent lid facilities and t f l i d is time of flow from the lid facility to the catchment outlet min 2 contributing catchment area a it is the sum of subcatchment areas that contribute off site runoff discharge to the catchment outlet if a runoff control facility does not contribute to off site runoff discharge the corresponding subcatchment area should be excluded from catchment area a 3 runoff coefficient c the onsite runoff control may alter the catchment runoff coefficient by changing both c j and a j 14 c j 1 k c j a j j 1 k a j where a j is the contributing area for land cover j hm 2 and c j is the runoff coefficient for land cover j with the onsite runoff control the runoff coefficient herein is the value when peak flow occurs for example a raingarden area a l i d located in greenspace area a j runoff coefficient c j as it is filled and contributes to off site runoff discharge its interception and infiltration situation becomes similar to that of the surrounding greenspace area indicating that the raingarden does not alter c j and a j as the raingarden is not filled and not producing off site runoff discharge the contributing area of greenspace decreases as a j a j a l i d but c j c j on the contrary a permeable pavement produces off site runoff discharge with c j c j but a j a j by recalculating the three variables t e c j and a this new method directly takes into account runoff control effects in the later parts of this work the efficacy of this new method will be assessed from two aspects 1 providing an integrated response of the whole catchment 2 interpreting runoff control effects by breaking the catchment into multiple subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls and plotting runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves 2 1 3 indices of peak flow rate control in order to evaluate to what extent onsite runoff controls can affect the peak flow rate two indices were proposed the first is ratio of peak flow rate reduction 15 r q q q q 1 q q where r q is peak flow reduction ratio for onsite runoff control in the worst case eq 15 can be reduced as r q 1 c j c the second is reduction factor for return period of maximum flow rate it is normally assumed that frequency of rainfall intensity is equal to that of maximum flow rate namely that t year rainfall intensity drives the t year maximum flow rate this is reasonable for the catchment of which imperviousness is constant throughout the storm i e one of the assumptions of the original rm but is not true for catchments with onsite runoff controls setting up onsite runoff controls would decrease the peak flow rate from q to q in a catchment without setting up onsite runoff controls q corresponds to rainfall intensity i q 167 c a and i corresponds to return period t 16 t t i t e p q 167 c a t e where t is equivalent return period because of the deploying onsite runoff controls year in the worst case since q q m a x 167 c i a eq 16 can simplified as t t i c c t e thus runoff controls can reduce return period of runoff event expressed by maximum flow rate from t year to t year of which the effect is evaluated as 17 d t t t in which d t is reduction factor for return period of maximum flow rate this novel technique still follows the basic principle of rational method but differs by recalculating catchment variables and proposing two indices that evaluate runoff peak control efficiencies this new method adds a mark to situations that take into account runoff control effects and is thus termed rational method prime 2 2 application of rational method prime 2 2 1 site description we applied rational method prime to a development project covering 11458 m2 of which land cover catchment variables the runoff control scheme and design parameters are shown in fig 4 two runoff control measures were 1 permeable pavement and 2 raingarden the permeable pavement was applied to the parking lot which captures rainfall and infiltrates rainwater into the underlying soil the raingarden was placed in greenspace which captures runoff from roofs and roads and infiltrates rainwater into the underlying soil the design objective of these runoff controls is to prevent off site runoff discharge of precipitation from all rainfall events less than or equal to a certain percentile rainfall event usepa 2009 thus the size of the runoff control facility was computed by water balance under the design conditions fig 2 as 18 10 d s t o r m c v a d 0 001 d s t o r m a l i d a s l i d d l i d a i l i d f t i n where t i n is design infiltration duration min and d s t o r m is lid design rainfall event mm d eq 18 does not consider flow routing and time of concentration because the water balance is computed at 24 h intervals this time step is larger than time of concentration for a small urban watershed indeed onsite runoff controls can retain not only rainfall events d s t o r m but also the portion of rainfall d s t o r m in events larger than d s t o r m the ratio of the sum of precipitation that can be retained in situ to total precipitation is defined as the precipitation volume capture ratio pvcr which is used in china as performance design objective and is determined by statistical analysis of 30 years of daily rainfall data li et al 2015 mohurd 2014a as shown in fig 5 china sponge city development technical guide low impact development partitions mainland china into 5 divisions applying different pvcr targets from 60 to 90 li et al 2015 urumqi kunming guiyang and guangzhou were selected to represent division i iv respectively among which guangzhou kunming and guiyang are in the subtropical monsoon climate while urumqi is in the temperate continental climate as shown in table 2 precipitation patterns were expressed by the idf formula and pvcr d s t o r m relationship the shortest effective duration of the idf formulas was 120 min urumqi and used as a unified effective duration for conducting comparisons under the same conditions the sizes of runoff control facilities at different sites were computed by eq 18 as shown in table 3 for each site the permeable pavement s d l i d was computed by eq 18 assuming the permeable pavement area to equal the parking lot area and the raingarden a l i d was computed with fixed raingarden s d l i d fig 4 because the raingarden is placed in greenspace its d l i d if necessary can be increased to prevent raingarden a l i d from being larger than that of the greenspace as design criteria and parameters were the same runoff control sizes in the order from smallest to biggest was urumqi kunming guiyang guangzhou as weather conditions were the same the higher the pvcr and or the shorter the t i n the larger the size of the runoff control facility specifically permeable pavement s d l i d 0 for kunming site with pvcr 60 and t i n 12 h and urumqi site with pvcr 60 85 and t i n 12 h indicating that detention storage volume is not taken into consideration in these scenarios 2 2 2 evaluation of scenarios the project was assumed to be carried out in four cities with the same design criteria i e the four project sites only differed in precipitation patterns the parameters constituting the evaluation scenarios are summarized as shown in table 4 total site scenarios 4 climates 6 pvcrs 2 t i n 48 for each site peak flow rate and timing were computed these scenarios and computation results were used to assess the efficacy of the new method and to examine runoff control efficiencies across four cities that vary in precipitation patterns then how the new method may improve the design of suds was discussed 3 results 3 1 method efficacy we used two examples to illustrate the method s efficacy as follow 3 1 1 computing the catchment response quickly example 1 urumqi site pvcr 75 t i n 12 h t 1 or 3 year example 1 corresponds to fig 3 where the raingarden does not produce off site runoff discharge as t 1 year q m a x and q m i n of the whole catchment were computed directly using eq 8 and eq 9 as shown in table 5 runoff control may reduce the peak flow rate in three ways 1 delaying time of entry e g t e 5 min vs t e 46 4 min best case t 3 year 2 lowering of runoff coefficient e g c 0 756 vs c 0 25 best case t 1 year 3 reducing the contributing catchment area e g a 1 1458 hm2 vs a 0 3177 hm2 best case t 1 year 3 1 2 interpreting runoff control effects example 2 kunming site pvcr 85 t i n 12h t 5 year in example 2 three ways by which runoff control reduces peak flow were interpreted from runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves in fig 6 as follows 1 lowering of runoff coefficient from c to c before development the whole catchment was covered by greenspace with runoff coefficient being 0 18 thus the maximum flow rate is low point f d t e after development the runoff coefficient was increased to 0 756 and hence the maximum flow rate became much higher than that before development represented by q point g d t e in the worst case of runoff control q q m a x point a d t e and was slightly lower than q because the catchment runoff coefficient was reduced from 0 756 to 0 712 since permeable pavement was applied to the parking lot 2 reducing contributing catchment area from a to a in the best case of runoff control the whole catchment is broken into three subcatchments namely greenspace permeable pavement and raingarden to facilitate the generation of runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves for each subcatchment finally these curves were combined to interpret how and to what extent runoff controls affect runoff peak flow rates at the whole catchment level in the best case t e 1 represents the subcatchment permeable pavement and t e 2 represents the subcatchment raingarden as d t e 1 both subcatchment permeable pavement and raingarden were excluded from the contributing catchment area and q was largest at d t e point b as d t e 2 the subcatchment raingarden was still excluded from contributing to the catchment area and q was largest at d t e 1 point c 3 delaying time of entry from t e to t e in the best case of runoff control as d t e 2 greenspace permeable pavement and raingarden all contributed to runoff thus t e m a x t e 1 t e 2 t e 2 at d t e point d q was largest and q q m i n at this time the best case turned into the worst case and q m i n q m a x because a longer duration lead to less intense rainfall as d t e the runoff flow rate was lower than before development nonetheless q m i n should be the lower limit of the peak flow rate because this can happen above all in both worst case and best cases the peak flow rate occurred when rainfall duration equals time of entry i e t e for worst case or t e for best case 3 2 efficiencies of runoff peak control runoff control efficiencies across four cities that differ in precipitation patterns were evaluated by r q and d t as shown in fig 7 in the worst case of runoff control r q was a constant not associated with the rainfall condition and equaled 5 83 in the best case the results varied with the pvcr and return period the higher the pvcr and or the shorter the return period the higher the r q for pvcr 60 85 and t 0 5 20 year the results ranged from 17 4 to 71 8 kunming 17 9 71 9 guiyang 20 2 66 4 guangzhou and 28 2 91 6 urumqi respectively in particular the raingarden at the urumqi site produced no off site runoff discharge in the following scenarios pvcr 60 and t 0 5 year pvcr 75 and t 0 5 or 1 year pvcr 85 and t 0 5 1 2 or 3 year in these conditions maximum r q 90 7 91 6 was obtained reduction of the peak flow rate suggested that runoff control could reduce the return period of the runoff event expressed by maximum flow rate for instance runoff control with pvcr 85 at the kunming site could reduce a 20 year runoff event to 13 9 year in the worst case or 2 6 year in the best case t and t are linearly related with a slope of d t that ranged from 0 13 to 0 71 kunming 0 12 to 0 71 guiyang 0 06 to 0 76 urumqi and 0 04 to 0 63 guangzhou respectively the lower the d t the better the effect of controlling the return period of runoff event scenarios at the urumqi site in which runoff controls produced no off site runoff discharge are not included in fig 7 because in these scenarios the contributing catchment area was significantly reduced that a different slope was achieved fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 influencing factors of runoff peak controls 4 1 1 effects of design parameters the effects of design parameters on peak flow rates are illustrated in fig 9 depicting results at the kunming site in the best case subfigure a illustrates how detention storage determined the step change in runoff flow rate rainfall duration curve at pvcr 60 and t i n 12 h permeable pavement s d l i d 0 m table 3 and thus permeable pavement s t l i d 0 only the step for the subcatchment raingarden was found on the curve pvcr 60 but none for the subcatchment permeable pavement in practice d l i d cannot be zero because of the porous structure in permeable pavements thus d l i d 0 would lead to flow rate overestimation in this study this was done for a fair comparison between the site scenarios under the same design criteria in practice this issue can be solved by presetting a minimum d l i d for permeable pavements according to structural requirements subfigure b illustrates how storage infiltration allocation influenced runoff control performance it can be seen in eq 18 that the precipitation volume captured was shared by storage a s l i d d l i d and infiltration a i l i d f t i n compared with t i n 12 h t i n 2 h resulted in larger storage volume and stronger ability of delaying time of entry this effect is expressed as a later step on the runoff flow rate rainfall duration curve t i n 2 h and hence a lower peak flow rate it is obvious in fig 9 b that the permeable pavement is more sensitive to this effect than raingarden which is also demonstrated in table 3 compared with the kunming site pvcr 85 and t i n 12 h at the same site and pvcr but t i n 2 h raingarden area s a s l i d would increase by 2 3 while permeable pavement s d l i d would increase by 78 3 this is because when sizing raingarden the first item 10 d s t o r m c v a d on the left side of eq 18 compressed the effect of t i n on storage volume a s l i d d l i d but this item 10 d s t o r m c v a d does not exist when sizing permeable pavements subfigure c illustrates how return period of storm event affects runoff control efficiencies the shape of the runoff flow rate rainfall duration curve does not change with return period but as return period decreases the curve moves down and right this confirms the observation that runoff control can better reduce the peak flow rate q m i n and delay flow peak t e in small to midsize storm events hunt et al 2008 4 1 2 effects of rainfall statistics the effects of precipitation patterns on runoff control performance is illustrated in fig 10 in which stormwater drainage is designed with the same criteria as pvcr 85 t i n 12 h and t 5 year for the four sites the order of rainfall intensity at the four sites from lowest to highest was guangzhou guiyang kunming urumqi and guangzhou s rainfall intensity was around 5 9 times urumqi s rainfall intensity fig 11 the order of q m i n from lowest to highest was also guangzhou guiyang kunming urumqi but q m i n of the guangzhou site was 12 3 times that of the urumqi site t e of urumqi was notably later which made q m i n of the urumqi site further lower d s t o r m for designing runoff controls and the idf formula for designing storm sewers are obtained by different rainfall statistical methods d s t o r m is based on daily rainfall data while the idf formula is based on the most intense rainfall in minutes what kind of storm events are retained by onsite runoff controls can be roughly estimated by comparing d s t o r m and 1 hour rainfall depth i as shown in fig 12 d s t o r m at pvcr 85 was equal to 0 39 0 66 and 0 8 year 1 hour rainfall depth in guangzhou kunming and guiyang respectively indicating that runoff controls could only retain frequent smaller rain events however d s t o r m at pvcr 85 was equal to 7 32 year 1 hour rainfall depth in urumqi indicating that runoff controls therein could retain midsize storm events which not only led much later t e at the urumqi site but also prevented the subcatchment raingarden from contributing to the catchment area a in common rain events such as t 0 5 or 1 year fig 13 urumqi is in the temperate continental climate with annual average rainfall depth below 300 mm which may explain these phenomena in order to prevent excessive rainwater detention infiltration should be a better runoff control measure than raingarden in arid areas such as urumqi our findings using rational method prime allow comparison of runoff control measures and storm sewer designs based on different design principles and rainfall statistical data in current chinese manuals and guidelines table 2 the period of rainfall records for the idf formula and rainfall events in the lid design are not the same for more accurate analysis and a better integrated design of runoff controls and storm sewers we suggest that relevant authorities unify the recording periods of these two types of rainfall information 4 2 rational method prime and rational method 2 0 this study developed rational method prime which can compute the peak flow rate in any scenario given an initial storage volume though was only used to derive q m i n and q m a x in this study besides by setting different t e l i d and t f l i d how the spatial distribution of runoff control measures affects catchment responses can be evaluated by this method in general a better spatial distribution of runoff control measures further reduces q by further delaying t e and results would be site specific as a summary rational method prime has three merits 1 quickly computing peak flow rate of the whole catchment using eq 8 and eq 9 2 interpreting runoff control effects by breaking the catchment into many subcatchments that feed into individual runoff controls and then plotting runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves 3 connecting the design of runoff controls and storm sewers that are based on different design principles and rainfall statistics rational method prime proposed here takes into account runoff control effects at the catchment scale and contributes to breaking assumption 4 of rational method 1 0 fig 1 for an integrated design of runoff controls and storm drains rational method prime should be combined with time area method because rmp only partly changes overland flow computation of rational method 1 0 indeed trrl is not always needed since 2014 china has revised the code for design of outdoor wastewater engineering which no longer considers pipe storage effects let alone surcharge effects in the design of urban drainage systems to cope with urban flooding risk that increases with climate change mohurd 2014b currently rational method at age 150 could be free from the four assumptions and time area method trrl method and rational method prime can constitute rational method 2 0 considering that maintaining or restoring predevelopment hydrology is a remarkable feature of suds rational method 2 0 is meaningful to moving in the direction of suds 4 3 developing onsite runoff control potential climate change that makes rainstorm stronger and more frequent may lead to runoff load greater than the designed capacity of storm sewers already in place this is particularly difficult for built up areas to deal with because it is often unaffordable to enlarge existing underground drainage infrastructure therefore climate change increases urban flooding risk rational method prime showed that the maximum runoff flow at the catchment with onsite runoff controls potentially ranges from q m i n to q m a x q m a x should be applied as a design flow to new storm sewers while realizing q m i n would help prevent waterlogging of built storm sewers recently a new concept of smarter stormwater systems was proposed that advocates operational transformation of runoff control facilities from static to adaptive by equipping them with low cost sensors and controllers kerkez et al 2016 this offers an opportunity for onsite runoff controls to realize q m i n if a runoff control facility does not accept runoff from its connected impervious area until runoff peak occurs it could provide maximum peak flow attenuation while retaining the same runoff volume this new rational method provides an analytical tool for developing runoff control measures that are sustainable given changing rainfall patterns with climate change 5 conclusion onsite runoff control is considered an important part of sustainable urban drainage schemes worldwide which requires new methods to quantify changes in peak runoff flow rates when designing storm sewers rational method is the most employed tool to determine the maximum flow rate in designing urban stormwater infrastructure this method has not been applicable to the catchments with runoff controls to this end this study developed rational method prime that takes into account runoff control effects and then used it to examine runoff peak control efficiencies across four cities that vary in precipitation patterns the main conclusions include 1 rational method prime follows the basic principle of rational method but is different by recalculating catchment variables and evaluating runoff peak control efficiencies by two indices it adds an apostrophe to represent situations that onsite runoff control plays roles in flow attenuation rational method prime has three advantages 1 to compute an integrated response of the whole catchment with runoff control 2 to interpret effects of runoff control by plotting runoff flow rate rainfall duration curves 3 to connect the design of runoff control and storm sewers based on different design principles and rainfall statistics 2 runoff control may reduce peak flow in three ways i e delaying time of entry lowering runoff coefficient and reducing the contributing catchment area which make peak flow rate to potentially range from q m i n in the best case to q m a x in the worst case to evaluate these effects three cities were selected in the subtropical monsoon climate and one in the temperate continental climate to represent precipitation patterns pvcr 60 85 and t 0 5 20 year were chosen to represent stormwater design criteria in the worst case the peak flow reduction ratio is a constant irrelevant to rainfall conditions and equals to 5 83 but in the best case it ranges from 17 4 to 71 8 kunming 17 9 71 9 guiyang 20 2 66 4 guangzhou and 28 2 91 6 urumqi respectively 3 runoff controls can hinder the return period of runoff events from increasing with storm ahead in the context of climate change runoff control with pvcr 85 at the kunming site can reduce a 20 year runoff event expressed as maximum flow rate to 13 9 year in the worst case or 2 6 year in the best case for pvcr 60 85 and t 0 5 20 year reduction factor for return period of maximum flow rate range from 0 13 to 0 71 kunming 0 12 to 0 71 guiyang 0 06 to 0 76 urumqi and 0 04 to 0 63 guangzhou respectively smarter stormwater systems to realize q m i n is worthy of further development and rational method prime provides an analytical tool for developing such technologies 4 our proposed rational method prime addresses the assumption of constant catchment imperviousness from the original rm that is necessary for this method to assess sustainable urban drainage systems this work finishes paving the way from rational method 1 0 to rational method 2 0 which consists of time area method trrl method and rational method prime and could be used for an integrated design of onsite runoff control and storm sewers since maintaining or restoring predevelopment hydrology is a remarkable feature of sustainable urban drainage systems rational method 2 0 is meaningful to moving in that direction acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support of science technology commission of shanghai municipality 15dz1207806 and
