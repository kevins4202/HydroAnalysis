tank art roll stabilization tank genetic algorithm ga nonlinear seakeeping 1 introduction the roll motion of a ship is of significant practical importance it not only dictates the stability and safety aspects of the vessel but also governs the comfort levels and its safe operational limits large roll motions can induce significant transverse accelerations which could result in structural damage shifting of cargo and discomfort to the passenger and crew there is therefore great commercial interest to reduce the roll motions of a sea going vessel there are several means to control the amount of roll these include both active and passive devices roll mitigation devices include gyro stabilizers fins rudder and tanks one of the most cost effective method used is the u tube passive anti roll tank art which works on the principle of creating a fluid flow induced counter moment due to the dynamic oscillating flow of liquid from one vertical limb to the other through the cross connecting duct every time the ship rolls the geometric dimensions of the vertical limb and the cross connecting duct together decide the fluid oscillation frequency an important design aspect involves tuning the tank to ensure the fluid oscillation frequency is close to the roll natural frequency of the ship to obtain the maximum stabilization by roll reduction unlike fin stabilizers which are only effective at forward speed conditions the art is effective both in stationary and forward speed conditions the effectiveness of the art depends on many geometric parameters of the design several researchers have attempted to mathematically model the art over the years goodrich 1969 developed one of the earliest models of an art a modified version has been developed by moaleji and greig 2007 in this model the art effect on the roll motion is only via a single linear term proportional to the difference in fluid depths in the two reservoirs lloyd 1989 presented a simplified 4 dof coupling the liquid motions to the sway roll and yaw motions of the vessel recently holden et al 2011 developed a nonlinear lagrangian approach for modeling the u tube art for large roll amplitudes the body motions were restricted only to roll this work was expanded to include all degrees of freedom in holden and fossen 2012 to accurately predict the damping inside the passive art taskar et al 2014 proposed a cfd based methodology to find the art damping coefficient diebold et al 2018 presented an application of art for a barge shaped ship and the subsequent roll mitigation brought by these arts a coupled potential flow viscous solver approach was used to model the art ship motion problem genetic algorithm ga belongs to a class of artificial intelligence ai based techniques known as evolutionary algorithm ea ea takes a heuristic approach to solving problems by applying fundamental concepts in cell biology such as selection reproduction and mutation other ea based techniques include evolutionary strategies ess and evolutionary programming ep in ga the individuals are typically coded as integers the selection is done by selecting parents proportional to their fitness the genetic operators work on the individuals representing the parametric variables which are in turn usually represented at the bit level in evolutionary strategies the individuals are coded as vectors or real numbers the evolutionary programming highlights the development of behavioral models and not genetic models ep is derived from the simulation of adaptive behavior in evolution at present ga and es are amongst the most widely used optimization methods alajmi and wright 2014 ga based optimization schemes enjoy some key advantages over conventional methods such as hill climbing the main advantages include insensitivity to the initial guess solution s for multimodal optimization problems avoidance of computation of derivatives and ease of coding and implementation charbonneau 2002 in addition many engineering problems contain nonlinear constraints which can be handled in a straightforward manner chehouri et al 2016 several examples of ga based optimization techniques can be found in recent literature zhang et al 2012 employed a nonlinear programming for the optimization of anti roll tank viviani et al 2017 used a multidisciplinary optimization procedure for the self generation of re entry vehicle shapes an application of ga for vessel optimization is presented in luo and lan 2017 where a single objective genetic algorithm method was developed to minimize the resistance of a ship guha and falzarano 2015 applied a multi objective genetic algorithm optimization scheme to optimize a hull form of an ocean going vessel in terms of it is seakeeping performance bagheri et al 2014 employed single objective genetic algorithm method for ship hull form improvement for better sea keeping performance in head seas recently subramanian et al 2018 developed a new body exact scheme to predict ship roll responses in large amplitude waves this methodology has been extended in the present investigation to include an art module to implicitly solve a 7 dof dynamical system the equations of motion governing the tank dynamics have been derived from first principles using lagrangian mechanics similar to the approach used by holden et al 2011 the dynamical system can be modeled to include all the nonlinear terms in all seven degrees of freedom however with optimization being the key focus for the present study a linearized art model has been derived and used a nonlinear body exact strip theory method is used to solve the external wave body problem which has the key advantage of allowing for faster computational time and simplified body geometry definition when compared with fully three dimensional methods the coupled ship motion art simulator is linked to a ga based optimization routine to determine the optimum art size the present methodology has been applied to the case of a coastal research vessel requiring roll reduction using a passive u tube art experiments have been conducted on a 1 17 scaled model of the test vessel fitted with an art in order to validate the computational model the paper is organized in the following manner the details of the nonlinear coupled ship motion art computational model are first presented in section 2 the results of the validation studies using experiments are presented in section 3 the ga scheme is introduced in section 4 the details of the optimization procedure are given in sections 5 and 6 finally results are discussed in section 8 2 nonlinear strip theory formulation the fluid flow problem consists of two sub problems the external flow consists of the flow over the ship hull involving the response of the ship to incident waves the internal flow problem consists of the fluid flow of the liquid in the art since the key focus of the present work is the application of the optimization scheme the description of the fluid flow problem will be kept concise and presented in detail in a future publication 2 1 external flow problem the fluid flow is considered inviscid irrotational incompressible and unsteady for such a flow a velocity potential ϕ representing the perturbation potential for the absolute fluid velocity in an inertial earth fixed frame is defined the fluid particle velocity v can be written as 1 v ϕ if it is assumed that the ship is slender such that the slope of the body surface in the longitudinal direction is smaller than the slopes in the transverse direction the gradient x y z this forms the basis for the strip theory approximation where the three dimensional problem is solved as a series of individual two dimensional problems the strip wise two dimensional potential satisfies the laplace equation at each frame 2 2 ϕ y z t x 0 here ϕ ϕ y z t x shall henceforth refer to the two dimensional potential for notational convenience to set up the boundary value problem to solve the fluid flow three different right handed coordinate frames are used as in shown in fig 1 an earth fixed inertial axis x e y e z e is used to keep track of the position of the center of gravity of the ship and the euler angles a hydrodynamic frame x h y h z h translates in the horizontal calm water plane with translational velocities u v and rotational yaw rate ψ it thus follows the ship such that its origin o h is always in vertical line with the origin of the body frame o b this is the frame in which the boundary value problem is formulated a body fixed frame x b y b z b rotates and translates in all 6 dof with the body the origin of the body frame o b coincides with the center of gravity location of the ship this frame is used to compute the forces acting on the ship and to solve the coupled equations of motion the velocities u v and ψ are the instantaneous rates of the hydrodynamic frame as it follows the body which are body velocities transformed to the hydrodynamic frame the present work uses a blended method scheme the free surface boundary conditions are applied on a representative surface indicated by line o o in fig 1 given by z h ζ r t here ζ r t is a representative free surface at each station given by 3 ζ r t η i x h x s t a t i o n y h 0 t where η i x s t a t i o n and y h represent the incident wave elevation longitudinal location of a station and y coordinate in the hydrodynamic frame respectively the justification for this approach is that this is a more accurate representation of the instantaneous wetted surface of the hull the quasi linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions for the new formulation are written as δ η δ t ϕ z v η y x h ψ η y v m η y μ η 4 on z h ζ r t δ ϕ δ t g η v ϕ y x h ψ ϕ y v m ϕ y ζ r t ϕ z μ ϕ 5 on z h ζ r t here δ δ t refers to the time derivative taken by following a free surface node the terms η and x h represent the free surface wave elevation measured from the calm water surface and the longitudinal position of the station in the hydrodynamic frame respectively when performing the time stepping the change in the position of the nodes have to be carefully incorporated additional terms are picked up due to the changing vertical position of the free surface plane o o and body position with time v m is the velocity of the moving node the last term in the eqs 4 and 5 are the damping terms that are added to generate artificial damping at the beach details for the numerical beach can be found in subramanian and beck 2015 an explicit 4th order adams bashforth moulton predictor corrector scheme is used to predict the evolution of the free surface the perturbation potential can be broken down into different components for proper bookkeeping ϕ y z t x ϕ i ϕ d ϕ r where ϕ i ϕ d ϕ r refer to the incident diffracted and radiated potential respectively the body boundary condition can thus be written in terms of its individual components in the two dimensional frame 6 ϕ d n ϕ i n on s b t 7 ϕ r n v n on s b t the velocity v used in eq 7 is the velocity of a node on the body surface with respect to the earth fixed frame and includes the rotational velocity components here the two dimensional strip theory unit normal n is used s b t denotes the wetted surface of the body on which the boundary conditions are applied in the present body exact formulation s b t is given by the intersection of the surface z h ζ r t and the exact body position fig 1 it is to be noted that computations are only performed for sections that are wetted in the far field the radiation boundary condition is imposed such that only the incident waves are incoming this is done numerically by incorporating an outer damping beach and modifying the free surface boundary conditions as given by eqs 4 and 5 all simulations are carried out in deep water and so the gradient of the perturbation potential vanishes as z this is automatically satisfied by the selection of the green function the mixed boundary value problem eqs 2 7 is solved for the perturbation potentials ϕ r and ϕ d and their derivatives in the present work a source distribution technique is used desingularised sources are placed above the free surface nodes and constant strength panels are used on the body the desingularised method avoids complicated panel quadrature and can handle higher order derivatives in a straightforward manner cao et al 1991 once the source strengths are determined the potentials and their derivatives are determined on the body and free surface once the potentials are solved the pressure at any point on the hull surface is calculated using bernoulli s equation the pressure is integrated over the hull surface to obtain the hydrostatic and external hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the hull at a given instant of time details can be found in subramanian et al 2018 and subramanian and beck 2015 to model the viscous roll damping the ikeda kawahara model is used kawahara et al 2009 this model has been extensively validated and used including by the authors subramanian et al 2018 the present computational model will be referred by the acronym rbest representative body exact strip theory 2 2 art fluid flow problem the internal flow problem consists of the fluid flow of the liquid in the art the schematic of the u tube type passive art is shown in fig 2 the present work is restricted to art with prismatic sections and sharp corners however in principle the computational model can be extended to the case of more complicated geometry the art geometry consists of two vertical reservoirs and a horizontal duct through which the liquid flows from one side to another the principle geometric features are shown in fig 2 in order to practically model the flow the following assumptions will be made the fluid will be assumed to be ideal the art is assumed open at the top to the atmosphere the liquid free surface is assumed to be flat the liquid motion from one limb to another is assumed to be smooth with no air pockets the velocity profile of the liquid motion will be considered uniform across the cross section to model the fluid flow the lagrangian dynamics will be used the system that will be considered is the art with the fluid the dynamics of the system will be the solution to the euler lagrange equations l t u d d t l q l q τ e here l is the lagrangian t is the kinetic energy of the system u is the potential energy gravitational and q is the set of generalized coordinates τ e is the set of external forces acting on the system the set of generalized coordinates are defined w r t the earth fixed frame given by q η 1 η 2 η 3 θ 4 θ 5 θ 6 s here η j θ j and s represent the position of the origin of the body frame euler angles and the motion of the tank liquid respectively the sequence of euler angles is chosen to be yaw pitch roll the tank liquid motion s is considered positive when there is a rise in the liquid level in the vertical limb on the port side fig 2 to derive the expression for t the kinetic energy of the tank fluid it is convenient to use the velocities resolved in the body frame given by v b u v w p q r s here u v w are the translation velocities and p q r are the instantaneous angular velocities however after deriving the expression for t the velocities will have to be transformed back to the earth fixed frame to get it in terms of the generalized coordinates then once the euler lagrange equations are solved to get the dynamics the velocities and accelerations have to be converted back to the body frame to solve for the coupled equations of motion this is an extremely involved mathematical process and leads to dealing with very cumbersome expressions since the focus of this paper is to develop a practical computational model that can be applied to optimize the art a simplified linearized model is adopted all 7 dof will be considered and the dynamics will be derived with the assumption of small amplitude motions this is justified from a practical standpoint since a well tuned art will typically bring down the peak roll amplitudes quite significantly under this assumption the generalized velocity q u v w p q r s this vastly simplifies the process of solving for the system dynamics the expressions for t and u are nevertheless still involved and will not be discussed in this paper for the sake of brevity solving the euler lagrange equations and retaining only first order terms leads to the following linearized equations of motion for the art system a

e 6 a s 2 v a s 4 p a s 6 r a s s s c s 4 θ 4 c s s s τ e s here the terms τ e j j 1 6 represent the force exerted by the ship on the art τ e s represents the viscous damping due to the fluid motion

t denote the location of the center of gravity of the tank i x x t i y y t i z z t and i x z t represent the mass moments of inertia of the tank and ρ t and m t represent the density of the liquid and mass of the tank respectively the reference point is the origin of the body frame the quantities a r and a d represent the area of cross section of the reservoir and duct respectively the tank equations of motion can be put into a compact matrix form 8 m t v b c t η f where v b η and f represent the accelerations generalized displacements and external force vector given by f τ e j α j the matrices m t and c t are represented by the coefficients a i j and c i j respectively the euler lagrange equations could also be applied to the ship ocean system this leads to the system dynamics given by the usual euler s 6 dof equations of motion 9 m s v b f s v b v b η τ e here m s is the usual 6 6 mass matrix for the ship alone f s v b v b η is the 6 1 generalized force vector this includes the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads acting on the ship the force the art exerts on the ship is given by τ e for computational stability and efficiency eqs 8 and 9 are solved together as a coupled 7 dof dynamical system 10 m v b f s v b v b η c t a n k η where m m 11 m 16 0 a 2 s 0 a 4 s 0 m 61 m 66 a 6 s 0 a s 2 0 a s 4 0 a s 6 a s s and c t a n k 0 0 0 0 0 c 4 s 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 c s 4 0

all external forces are computed the acceleration vector v b is determined by solving the matrix equation 10 the velocities v b and displacements q are obtained by numerical integration a 4th order semi explicit adams bashforth multistep method is used in the present study 3 validation of the computational model before proceeding with the optimization scaled down models were fabricated and experiments were conducted to validate the computational model three sets of experiments were conducted all of which will be described below 3 1 validation of roll damping model the present optimization problem is applied to the case of a coastal research vessel requiring a reduction in the roll response using a passive art the principal particulars of the vessel are given in table 1 and the lines plan in fig 3 a 1 17 scaled model was fabricated out of fiber glass weights were added and properly distributed to correctly get the required displacement location of center of gravity and mass moments of inertia an inclining experiment was conducted to ascertain the metacentric height of the model these values were given as inputs to the numerical model in the present study the ikeda kawahara method is used to model the roll damping this is a model that has been extensively validated himeno 1981 kawahara et al 2009 to validate the roll damping model a roll decay test was conducted an accelerometer based ore motion reference unit mru was used to measure the roll angle the mru was placed at the location of the center of gravity of the model the results are shown in fig 4 as seen there is good agreement in both the predicted damped roll natural frequency as well as the damping characteristics the ikeda model predicts a slightly lower damping compared to the experiments 3 2 validation of art module the viscous damping due to the fluid motion inside the art has an important influence on the liquid motion inside the tank lewis 1989 since the analytical formulation in section 2 2 assumes the fluid to be ideal the viscous damping has to be estimated or determined in the present study the damping is determined experimentally the base design for the art was developed based on the guidelines given in lewis 1989 the principal geometric particulars are shown in table 2 a 1 17 scaled model of the art was fabricated using perspex sheets the art model is shown in fig 5 to determine the tank damping a decay test was conducted the art model was filled with water containing a colored dye and the art setup was tilted towards the starboard side both the vertical reservoirs are open to atmosphere however the starboard limb had a cut out to accommodate a air tight foam plug which was tightly secured after filling in the starboard side this ensured a differential liquid level because of suction due to the plug once the art was brought back to level surface the plug was removed thus allowing the liquid level in the tank to oscillate back and forth the liquid level on the portside limb was measured using a waveprobe the measurement from the wave probe is shown in fig 6 the damping ratio was obtained assuming an exponential decay based on the methodology used in journee 2001 the experimentally determined damping ratio was plugged into the numerical code to predict the decay characteristics of the tank this is shown in fig 7 there is a reasonably good agreement with the experimental measurements the natural period of the liquid oscillations from the experiments was established to be around 1 35 s whereas the numerical computations show a slightly higher period of approximately 1 39 s this could be attributed to some of the simplifications used in the computational model one of the major challenges when using the simplified flow model is the difficulty in defining the flow pattern around the sharp corners which in reality could be dominated by vortical structures and flow separation effects 3 3 validation of the coupled 7 dof simulation model in order to validate the coupled 7 dof model described in section 2 the vessel model was fitted with the art as shown in fig 8 the art was placed at a distance of 19 5 m from the transom with the bottom of the duct at an elevation of 1 6 m all dimensions being at full scale in order to compare the roll reduction performance of the art the two vertical reservoirs had a foam block inserted in them just above the liquid free surface level this simulated the effect of turning the art off to turn on the art effect the foam blocks were completely removed and the reservoirs exposed to the atmosphere this way the performance could be compared while ensuring the mass properties of the vessel remained exactly the same the experiments in waves were conducted in a wave basin measuring 30 m 30 m with a constant depth of 3 m to evaluate the roll response of the vessel regular waves of a fixed wave slope of h λ 1 50 were generated for a range of frequencies the model was oriented perpendicular to the wave fronts and placed beyond the region of transient waves and many wavelengths away from the parabolic wave absorbers at the far end of the tank to minimize effects of wave reflection although the model was allowed to undergo fully unrestricted 6 dof motions corresponding to the primary wave frequency the steady drift motions in the horizontal plane surge sway and yaw were controlled by way of slack lines to simulate soft mooring after each run the model was re oriented to the beam sea configuration using two guide lines as reference all the tests were conducted for an incident wave direction of 90 the results are shown in fig 9 as can be seen the initial art design helps in substantially reducing the roll motions the experimental measurements are also shown for comparison as can be seen good qualitative agreement is seen between the numerical predictions and the experiments with and without the art being active overall the computational simulations tend to slightly overpredict the responses this may be attributed to the slightly lower damping compared to the experimental damping as was seen in the decay tests figs 7 and 4 both the experiments and simulations show the typical twin peaked roll response when the art is activated having established the validity of the computational model the optimization problem can now be defined the objective function in the present problem is considered to be the area under the roll transfer function curve the objective function depends on the geometric parameters of the art for the present study the hull geometry is kept fixed although in theory the hull form and the art could be optimized in parallel the combined nonlinear time domain strip theory with the art module will be referenced by the acronym rbest art 4 genetic algorithm for optimization of the art genetic algorithm ga is part of the branch of evolutionary computing and has been found to enjoy a high probability of finding the global optimum solution mccall 2005 the technique is based on the principles of genetics and natural selection from darwin s theory of evolution namely the concept of survival of the fittest thus ga can be used as a tool for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems it assumes that the solution of a problem is an individual and can be characterized by a set of parameters each parameter is structured as a string of values typically represented in binary form the string of all parameters represents a chromosome a positive value generally known as fitness function is used to reflect the degree of goodness of the candidate for solving the problem and is closely related to the objective function throughout the genetic process the fittest chromosome has the tendency to yield good quality offspring which translates to an improved solution to the problem in a practical application of ga a population pool of chromosomes have to be installed and these can be randomly set initially the size of this population varies from one problem to the other in each cycle of the genetic operation termed a progressing process a subsequent generation is created from the chromosomes in the current population this can only be successful if a group of those chromosomes generally referred to as parents or collectively termed as mating pool are selected via a specific selection routine the genes of the parents are then mixed and recombined for the production of offspring in the next generation from this process of evolution the fittest chromosomes will generate a larger number of offspring and thus have a higher probability of surviving in the consequent generation mimicking the survival of the fittest mechanism in nature the process of evolution is continued until a favorable stopping criterion is arrived at this criterion is usually set based on the number of evolution cycles computational runs the amount of variation in the individual s fitness function between different generations or a predefined value of fitness man et al 1996 the overall flow chart for ga process is shown in fig 10 the key terminologies used in the flowchart can be explained as follows 1 fitness function biologically the fitness of an organism is typically defined as the probability that the organism will live to reproduce viability or as a function of the number of offspring the organism has fertility here the fitness function represents the relative merit of each of the candidate solutions 2 selection selection of the individuals called parents from the population pool that contribute to the population of the next generation 3 crossover combination of two parents to form offspring 4 mutation random changes to the produced offspring the mathematical form of the constrained optimization problem can be described as follows the design variables and constraint conditions are used to describe the problem the design variables are used in the hydrodynamic optimization problem for controlling the geometry of the art during the optimization procedure constraints are the values by which the design variables are limited and may be separated into two types namely equality and inequality constraints the value of the objective function is a benchmark to determine the efficiency of the design optimization procedure the art design in this case is a single objective optimization problem mathematically the standard optimization problem formulation is as follows 11 f x f 1 x f 1 x f n x x r n subject to 12 a i x 0 i 1 p 13 b i x 0 i 1 q where f x is the objective function n is the number of objective functions p is the number of equality constraints and q is the number of inequality constraints x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m l i x i u i each design variable x i varies between lower limit l i and upper limit u i the number of design variables is denoted by m the constraints define the feasible area for the optimization the design variables x must satisfy the limitations set by the constraints a i x and b i x in order to be a feasible solution the present optimization problem uses the following design parameters length of the duct l d length of the reservoir l r height of the duct h d height of the liquid in the duct h r it is to be noted that the length of the duct and the reservoir are kept equal therefore strictly speaking only the length of the duct is a design variable as far as the optimization is concerned the justification for doing so is to ensure the validity of the damping coefficient obtained from the experiments throughout the optimization process if the lengths are not equal the damping could be potentially different because of the additional vortices shed from the sharp corner introduced because of the unequal lengths in the future unequal lengths of the duct and reservoir will be considered the inequality constraints are based on the ratio of the natural frequency of the liquid in the art to the roll natural frequency of the vessel the fractional change in metacentric height δ g m g m attributed to the art free surface effect the equality constraint is chosen as the width of the art which is held constant the justification is that for the present study the hull geometry is fixed so the tank is constrained in width however this could in principle be considered as a design variable too the parameter w t ω t a n k ω s is restricted within the limits 1 06 w t 1 10 where ω t a n k is the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank and ω s is the roll natural frequency of the vessel the fractional loss in stability due to the free surface effect is bound within the limits 0 15 δ g m g m 0 3 cf zhong et al 1998 the width of the art w t a n k 4 094 m is held constant for all computations 5 interfacing of the genetic algorithm routine with the seakeeping program the interface between the optimization routine and the coupled art ship motions solver rbest art facilitates the ga routine to exchange input output information this is done by calling rbest art as an external program fig 11 shows the structure of the data exchange between ga program and the computational solver at each stage of generation the ga performs genetic operations such as selection cross over and mutation and then passes the design variables to the computational model at this point the seakeeping program evaluates the objective function namely the area under the frequency versus roll transfer function curve along with the constraint functions and then passes them back to ga the objective function is computed as 14 f r a o ω d ω here r a o ω refers to the roll response amplitude operator a simple trapezoidal rule is used to compute the objective function after each candidate solution is evaluated 6 procedure for optimizing the art the following section describes the optimization algorithm every design parameter of the art is represented by a string of 7 digits each digit represents a gene biologically speaking the number of digits is determined based on the precision level desired since three design parameters are used in the problem h r h d and l d these representations are combined to form a 21 digit genotype or chromosome an individual representing each design of the art the basic algorithm can be described as follows 1 start with a randomly generated population of size n p here n p denotes the number of individual designs one of the individuals represents the base design the initial population always contains at least one feasible design 2 compute the fitness of each individual in the population 3 repeat the following steps until n p new offspring have been created a encode each individual design form as a 21 digit genotype or chromosome b select a pair of parents from the current population the probability of selection being connected directly to the fitness and feasibility of the individual c simulate the cross over of the pair of parent genotypes at a randomly chosen digit location to form a pair of offspring the cross over probability is set to p c when no crossover takes place form two offspring that are exact copies of their respective parents d simulate the mutation of the two offspring at each digit location with the probability of mutation being p m e place the resulting offspring in the new population pool 4 replace the current population with the new population 5 continue to step 2 and repeat until convergence is achieved in the present study the number of individuals in a population n p is set to 10 an upper limit of 100 is set for the number of generations the parents are selected using the roulette wheel algorithm with the relative fitness as the hit probability the crossover probability p c is set to 0 8 and the mutation probability p m is set to 0 01 a uniform mutation operator is employed elitism is employed where the best solution from the previous generation is retained if superior in the current population it is to be noted that the optimization procedure is performed taking into consideration the constraints described in section 4 the loss in g m of the vessel due to the art free surface effect δ g m and the natural frequency of the tank ω t a n k can be calculated from eq 8 in the present study no penalty functions are used to modify the fitness function instead the constraints affect the relative fitness or ranking of each individual in the population the population is ranked according to the following scheme cf chehouri et al 2016 1 compute the fitness of each individual in the population 2 check the constraint condition for each individual based on eq 13 if violated count the number of constraints violated compute the total amount of constraint violation as b i x 3 any feasible solution with zero constraint violations gets a higher ranking over any unfeasible solution the feasible solutions are then sorted by their fitness values next the unfeasible solutions are sorted based on number of violations if the number of violations is equal the individual with lower amount of constraint violation gets a higher ranking if the number of violations and amount of constraint violation are equal the individual with a better fitness gets a higher rank the effect of this scheme is seen when selecting parents for generating offspring with feasible solutions getting preferred over unfeasible solutions elitism ensures there are always feasible solutions in the population while mutation helps maintain diversity in the population from practical design considerations some limits are also imposed on the principal dimensions of the art in order to restrict the search space and to keep the optimal art near the original one for comparison the art design parameters are limited to a variation of 30 relative to the base design table 3 7 parametric study of art for the purpose of validating the ga based optimized results an independent systematic parametric study was conducted by choosing the variants and evaluating the roll reduction in this manner the best performing art was determined the parameters of the most successful art was compared with those evolved from the ga scheme 7 1 case a influence of the length of the crossover duct and reservoir for this scenario l d the length of the crossover duct and l r the length of the reservoir were increased by up to 20 in increments of 5 while keeping the area ratio a r a d and other art parameters constant the variation of parameters is presented in table 4 the results shown in fig 12 show that the stabilizing moment increases as the length of the crossover duct and reservoir length increases 7 2 case b influence of the height of the liquid in the reservoir for this scenario the height of liquid in the reservoir h r was increased by up to 20 in increments of 5 while keeping all the other parameters constant the variation of parameters for this case is given in table 5 the results from fig 13 show that liquid height level in the reservoir has an adverse influence on the reduction of roll motions 7 3 case c influence of area ratio of the art for this case the area ratio of the art was varied between 0 34 and 0 62 table 6 shows the variation of design parameters of art for case c the results are plotted in different sub plots for clarity without clutter from the plots shown in fig 14 the better performance is seen in the case with the area ratio set between 0 45 and 0 55 the natural frequency of the art is dependent on the crossover duct area ratio increasing the duct area ratio increases the natural frequency of art the parametric study establishes that art 5 shown in table 7 with minimum area under the roll transfer function curve is the better option amongst the different variants investigated 8 results and discussion the computational scheme was run with a population size of 10 corresponding to the candidate art forms at each stage of generation to arrive at the optimized tank the main dimensions of the base design and optimized art are given in table 8 the comparison of the roll response of the optimized art from ga with the base design art 1 is shown in fig 15 for comparison the performance of art 5 based on the parametric study is also plotted on the same graph the convergence of the art parameters starting from the base design values to the optimized values using the ga is shown in fig 16 the convergence is typically achieved within 20 iterations or generations as the iteration progresses the value of the objective function reduces through the range 1 64 s 1 to 1 400 s 1 the parametric study resulted in a minima of 1 414 s 1 therefore the evolution of the most optimal art with the objective function of 1 400 s 1 confirms the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm table 9 the ga results in a substantial roll reduction of about 12 compared with the base design this corresponds to a reduction of approximately 82 in the peak roll response compared to the ship with the art effect turned off 9 summary and conclusions a genetic algorithm ga based optimization scheme has been developed and applied to optimize the performance of a passive u tube type anti roll tank fitted in the case of a sea going coastal research vessel a recently developed nonlinear time domain strip theory model rbest was used to solve the external wave body problem the strip theory formulation allows for computational efficiency and simplified body geometry definition in order to analyze the fluid flow in the art a 7 dof mathematical model has been developed using the principles of lagrangian dynamics the model is capable of handling tanks with arbitrary geometry for the present study the art model is linearized for computational efficiency and stability the art ship motion problem is solved together as a single 7 dof system which is statically and dynamically coupled in the degrees of freedom involving sway roll yaw and tank liquid motion before proceeding with the optimization scheme experiments were conducted to validate the computational model a 1 17 scale model of the candidate vessel was fabricated in fiberglass and tested to verify the mass and damping characteristics were correctly modeled a model of the base design of the art art 1 was fabricated from perspex and a decay test was conducted to obtain the fluid damping of the liquid in the tank the art decay was simulated using the experimental damping and compared favorably with the measurements the art was fitted into the vessel and motion tests were conducted in the presence of regular waves with and without the effect of the art the heading was restricted to beam seas comparisons with the experiments show good agreement for both the cases in general the computational results tended to slightly over predict the roll response this could be attributed to the under prediction in the damping a two way interface was set up between the ga routine and the fluid flow solver rbest art the principle dimensions of the art were chosen as the design variables for the optimization problem the area under the roll response transfer function was set as the objective function constraints were applied on the natural frequency of the tank relative to the roll natural frequency of the vessel and the loss of stability due to the tank free surface effect for the present investigation the geometry of the vessel was held fixed therefore the width of the tank was also held constant the optimization routine was found to rapidly converge in about 20 iterations the optimized art was found to bring down the objective function by 12 compared to the base design to validate the optimization scheme an independent parametric study was also conducted by systematically varying the geometry of the art starting from the base design the ga optimized art was found to bring down the peak roll response by about 82 when compared to the vessel with the art effect turned off overall the computational scheme was found to be stable efficient and robust the ga thus shows promise as an effective tool for ship design optimization although the present study was conducted with the hull geometry held fixed the methodology can readily be extended to include the hull geometry as a design variable the optimization could also be carried out to optimize the response for a particular design sea state these cases would be investigated in the future credit authorship contribution statement rahul subramanian conceptualization methodology formal analysis

21935,this paper presents the development of a numerical optimization tool for the design of a passive u tube type anti roll tank art system to mitigate the roll motions of a vessel a genetic algorithm ga based optimization scheme has been developed to minimize the objective function which in the present investigation is chosen to be the area under the roll response transfer function curve a practical nonlinear time domain based body exact strip theory technique is used to solve the fully coupled art ship motion problem in the optimization process the ga is linked to the fluid solver to approach an optimum art design the optimization variables are chosen to be the principal dimensions of the anti roll tank which have bearing on the roll reduction characteristics of the vessel the

effectiveness in isolation as well as when deployed in the vessel model and subjected to waves the results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the entire computational scheme keywords anti roll tank art roll stabilization tank genetic algorithm ga nonlinear seakeeping 1 introduction the roll motion of a ship is of significant practical importance it not only dictates the stability and safety aspects of the vessel but also governs the comfort levels and its safe operational limits large roll motions can induce significant transverse accelerations which could result in structural damage shifting of cargo and discomfort to the passenger and crew there is therefore great commercial interest to reduce the roll motions of a sea going vessel there are several means to control the amount of roll these include both active and passive devices roll mitigation devices include gyro stabilizers fins rudder and tanks one of the most cost effective method used is the u tube passive anti roll tank art which works on the principle of creating a fluid flow induced counter moment due to the dynamic oscillating flow of liquid from one vertical limb to the other through the cross connecting duct every time the ship rolls the geometric dimensions of the vertical limb and the cross connecting duct together decide the fluid oscillation frequency an important design aspect involves tuning the tank to ensure the fluid oscillation frequency is close to the roll natural frequency of the ship to obtain the maximum stabilization by roll reduction unlike fin stabilizers which are only effective at forward speed conditions the art is effective both in stationary and forward speed conditions the effectiveness of the art depends on many geometric parameters of the design several researchers have attempted to mathematically model the art over the years goodrich 1969 developed one of the earliest models of an art a modified version has been developed by moaleji and greig 2007 in this model the art effect on the roll motion is only via a single linear term proportional to the difference in fluid depths in the two reservoirs lloyd 1989 presented a simplified 4 dof coupling the liquid motions to the sway roll and yaw motions of the vessel recently holden et al 2011 developed a nonlinear lagrangian approach for modeling the u tube art for large roll amplitudes the body motions were restricted only to roll this work was expanded to include all degrees of freedom in holden and fossen 2012 to accurately predict the damping inside the passive art taskar et al 2014 proposed a cfd based methodology to find the art damping coefficient diebold et al 2018 presented an application of art for a barge shaped ship and the subsequent roll mitigation brought by these arts a coupled potential flow viscous solver approach was used to model the art ship motion problem genetic algorithm ga belongs to a class of artificial intelligence ai based techniques known as evolutionary algorithm ea ea takes a heuristic approach to solving problems by applying fundamental concepts in cell biology such as selection reproduction and mutation other ea based techniques include evolutionary strategies ess and evolutionary programming ep in ga the individuals are typically coded as integers the selection is done by selecting parents proportional to their fitness the genetic operators work on the individuals representing the parametric variables which are in turn usually represented at the bit level in evolutionary strategies the individuals are coded as vectors or real numbers the evolutionary programming highlights the development of behavioral models and not genetic models ep is derived from the simulation of adaptive behavior in evolution at present ga and es are amongst the most widely used optimization methods alajmi and wright 2014 ga based optimization schemes enjoy some key advantages over conventional methods such as hill climbing the main advantages include insensitivity to the initial guess solution s for multimodal optimization problems avoidance of computation of derivatives and ease of coding and implementation charbonneau 2002 in addition many engineering problems contain nonlinear constraints which can be handled in a straightforward manner chehouri et al 2016 several examples of ga based optimization techniques can be found in recent literature zhang et al 2012 employed a nonlinear programming for the optimization of anti roll tank viviani et al 2017 used a multidisciplinary optimization procedure for the self generation of re entry vehicle shapes an application of ga for vessel optimization is presented in luo and lan 2017 where a single objective genetic algorithm method was developed to minimize the resistance of a ship guha and falzarano 2015 applied a multi objective genetic algorithm optimization scheme to optimize a hull form of an ocean going vessel in terms of it is seakeeping performance bagheri et al 2014 employed single objective genetic algorithm method for ship hull form improvement for better sea keeping performance in head seas recently subramanian et al 2018 developed a new body exact scheme to predict ship roll responses in large amplitude waves this methodology has been extended in the present investigation to include an art module to implicitly solve a 7 dof dynamical system the equations of motion governing the tank dynamics have been derived from first principles using lagrangian mechanics similar to the approach used by holden et al 2011 the dynamical system can be modeled to include all the nonlinear terms in all seven degrees of freedom however with optimization being the key focus for the present study a linearized art model has been derived and used a nonlinear body exact strip theory method is used to solve the external wave body problem which has the key advantage of allowing for faster computational time and simplified body geometry definition when compared with fully three dimensional methods the coupled ship motion art simulator is linked to a ga based optimization routine to determine the optimum art size the present methodology has been applied to the case of a coastal research vessel requiring roll reduction using a passive u tube art experiments have been conducted on a 1 17 scaled model of the test vessel fitted with an art in order to validate the computational model the paper is organized in the following manner the details of the nonlinear coupled ship motion art computational model are first presented in section 2 the results of the validation studies using experiments are presented in section 3 the ga scheme is introduced in section 4 the details of the optimization procedure are given in sections 5 and 6 finally results are discussed in section 8 2 nonlinear strip theory formulation the fluid flow problem consists of two sub problems the external flow consists of the flow over the ship hull involving the response of the ship to incident waves the internal flow problem consists of the fluid flow of the liquid in the art since the key focus of the present work is the application of the optimization scheme the description of the fluid flow problem will be kept concise and presented in detail in a future publication 2 1 external flow problem the fluid flow is considered inviscid irrotational incompressible and unsteady for such a flow a velocity potential ϕ representing the perturbation potential for the absolute fluid velocity in an inertial earth fixed frame is defined the fluid particle velocity v can be written as 1 v ϕ if it is assumed that the ship is slender such that the slope of the body surface in the longitudinal direction is smaller than the slopes in the transverse direction the gradient x y z this forms the basis for the strip theory approximation where the three dimensional problem is solved as a series of individual two dimensional problems the strip wise two dimensional potential satisfies the laplace equation at each frame 2 2 ϕ y z t x 0 here ϕ ϕ y z t x shall henceforth refer to the two dimensional potential for notational convenience to set up the boundary value problem to solve the fluid flow three different right handed coordinate frames are used as in shown in fig 1 an earth fixed inertial axis x e y e z e is used to keep track of the position of the center of gravity of the ship and the euler angles a hydrodynamic frame x h y h z h translates in the horizontal calm water plane with translational velocities u v and rotational yaw rate ψ it thus follows the ship such that its origin o h is always in vertical line with the origin of the body frame o b this is the frame in which the boundary value problem is formulated a body fixed frame x b y b z b rotates and translates in all 6 dof with the body the origin of the body frame o b coincides with the center of gravity location of the ship this frame is used to compute the forces acting on the ship and to solve the coupled equations of motion the velocities u v and ψ are the instantaneous rates of the hydrodynamic frame as it follows the body which are body velocities transformed to the hydrodynamic frame the present work uses a blended method scheme the free surface boundary conditions are applied on a representative surface indicated by line o o in fig 1 given by z h ζ r t here ζ r t is a representative free surface at each station given by 3 ζ r t η i x h x s t a t i o n y h 0 t where η i x s t a t i o n and y h represent the incident wave elevation longitudinal location of a station and y coordinate in the hydrodynamic frame respectively the justification for this approach is that this is a more accurate representation of the instantaneous wetted surface of the hull the quasi linear kinematic and dynamic free surface boundary conditions for the new formulation are written as δ η δ t ϕ z v η y x h ψ η y v m η y μ η 4 on z h ζ r t δ ϕ δ t g η v ϕ y x h ψ ϕ y v m ϕ y ζ r t ϕ z μ ϕ 5 on z h ζ r t here δ δ t refers to the time derivative taken by following a free surface node the terms η and x h represent the free surface wave elevation measured from the calm water surface and the longitudinal position of the station in the hydrodynamic frame respectively when performing the time stepping the change in the position of the nodes have to be carefully incorporated additional terms are picked up due to the changing vertical position of the free surface plane o o and body position with time v m is the velocity of the moving node the last term in the eqs 4 and 5 are the damping terms that are added to generate artificial damping at the beach details for the numerical beach can be found in subramanian and beck 2015 an explicit 4th order adams bashforth moulton predictor corrector scheme is used to predict the evolution of the free surface the perturbation potential can be broken down into different components for proper bookkeeping ϕ y z t x ϕ i ϕ d ϕ r where ϕ i ϕ d ϕ r refer to the incident diffracted and radiated potential respectively the body boundary condition can thus be written in terms of its individual components in the two dimensional frame 6 ϕ d n ϕ i n on s b t 7 ϕ r n v n on s b t the velocity v used in eq 7 is the velocity of a node on the body surface with respect to the earth fixed frame and includes the rotational velocity components here the two dimensional strip theory unit normal n is used s b t denotes the wetted surface of the body on which the boundary conditions are applied in the present body exact formulation s b t is given by the intersection of the surface z h ζ r t and the exact body position fig 1 it is to be noted that computations are only performed for sections that are wetted in the far field the radiation boundary condition is imposed such that only the incident waves are incoming this is done numerically by incorporating an outer damping beach and modifying the free surface boundary conditions as given by eqs 4 and 5 all simulations are carried out in deep water and so the gradient of the perturbation potential vanishes as z this is automatically satisfied by the selection of the green function the mixed boundary value problem eqs 2 7 is solved for the perturbation potentials ϕ r and ϕ d and their derivatives in the present work a source distribution technique is used desingularised sources are placed above the free surface nodes and constant strength panels are used on the body the desingularised method avoids complicated panel quadrature and can handle higher order derivatives in a straightforward manner cao et al 1991 once the source strengths are determined the potentials and their derivatives are determined on the body and free surface once the potentials are solved the pressure at any point on the hull surface is calculated using bernoulli s equation the pressure is integrated over the hull surface to obtain the hydrostatic and external hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the hull at a given instant of time details can be found in subramanian et al 2018 and subramanian and beck 2015 to model the viscous roll damping the ikeda kawahara model is used kawahara et al 2009 this model has been extensively validated and used including by the authors subramanian et al 2018 the present computational model will be referred by the acronym rbest representative body exact strip theory 2 2 art fluid flow problem the internal flow problem consists of the fluid flow of the liquid in the art the schematic of the u tube type passive art is shown in fig 2 the present work is restricted to art with prismatic sections and sharp corners however in principle the computational model can be extended to the case of more complicated geometry the art geometry consists of two vertical reservoirs and a horizontal duct through which the liquid flows from one side to another the principle geometric features are shown in fig 2 in order to practically model the flow the following assumptions will be made the fluid will be assumed to be ideal the art is assumed open at the top to the atmosphere the liquid free surface is assumed to be flat the liquid motion from one limb to another is assumed to be smooth with no air pockets the velocity profile of the liquid motion will be considered uniform across the cross section to model the fluid flow the lagrangian dynamics will be used the system that will be considered is the art with the fluid the dynamics of the system will be the solution to the euler lagrange equations l t u d d t l q l q τ e here l is the lagrangian t is the kinetic energy of the system u is the potential energy gravitational and q is the set of generalized coordinates τ e is the set of external forces acting on the system the set of generalized coordinates are defined w r t the earth fixed frame given by q η 1 η 2 η 3 θ 4 θ 5 θ 6 s here η j θ j and s represent the position of the origin of the body frame euler angles and the motion of the tank liquid respectively the sequence of euler angles is chosen to be yaw pitch roll the tank liquid motion s is considered positive when there is a rise in the liquid level in the vertical limb on the port side fig 2 to derive the expression for t the kinetic energy of the tank fluid it is convenient to use the velocities resolved in the body frame given by v b u v w p q r s here u v w are the translation velocities and p q r are the instantaneous angular velocities however after deriving the expression for t the velocities will have to be transformed back to the earth fixed frame to get it in terms of the generalized coordinates then once the euler lagrange equations are solved to get the dynamics the velocities and accelerations have to be converted back to the body frame to solve for the coupled equations of motion this is an extremely involved mathematical process and leads to dealing with very cumbersome expressions since the focus of this paper is to develop a practical computational model that can be applied to optimize the art a simplified linearized model is adopted all 7 dof will be considered and the dynamics will be derived with the assumption of small amplitude motions this is justified from a practical standpoint since a well tuned art will typically bring down the peak roll amplitudes quite significantly under this assumption the generalized velocity q u v w p q r s this vastly simplifies the process of solving for the system dynamics the expressions for t and u are nevertheless still involved and will not be discussed in this paper for the sake of brevity solving the euler lagrange equations and retaining only first order terms leads to the following linearized equations of motion for the art system a

t denote the location of the center of gravity of the tank i x x t i y y t i z z t and i x z t represent the mass moments of inertia of the tank and ρ t and m t represent the density of the liquid and mass of the tank respectively the reference point is the origin of the body frame the quantities a r and a d represent the area of cross section of the reservoir and duct respectively the tank equations of motion can be put into a compact matrix form 8 m t v b c t η f where v b η and f represent the accelerations generalized displacements and external force vector given by f τ e j α j the matrices m t and c t are represented by the coefficients a i j and c i j respectively the euler lagrange equations could also be applied to the ship ocean system this leads to the system dynamics given by the usual euler s 6 dof equations of motion 9 m s v b f s v b v b η τ e here m s is the usual 6 6 mass matrix for the ship alone f s v b v b η is the 6 1 generalized force vector this includes the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads acting on the ship the force the art exerts on the ship is given by τ e for computational stability and efficiency eqs 8 and 9 are solved together as a

all external forces are computed the acceleration vector v b is determined by solving the matrix equation 10 the velocities v b and displacements q are obtained by numerical integration a 4th order semi explicit adams bashforth multistep method is used in the present study 3 validation of the computational model before proceeding with the optimization scaled down models were fabricated and experiments were conducted to validate the computational model three sets of experiments were conducted all of which will be described below 3 1 validation of roll damping model the present optimization problem is applied to the case of a coastal research vessel requiring a reduction in the roll response using a passive art the principal particulars of the vessel are given in table 1 and the lines plan in fig 3 a 1 17 scaled model was fabricated out of fiber glass weights were added and properly distributed to correctly get the required displacement location of center of gravity and mass moments of inertia an inclining experiment was conducted to ascertain the metacentric height of the model these values were given as inputs to the numerical model in the present study the ikeda kawahara method is used to model the roll damping this is a model that has been extensively validated himeno 1981 kawahara et al 2009 to validate the roll damping model a roll decay test was conducted an accelerometer based ore motion reference unit mru was used to measure the roll angle the mru was placed at the location of the center of gravity of the model the results are shown in fig 4 as seen there is good agreement in both the predicted damped roll natural frequency as well as the damping characteristics the ikeda model predicts a slightly lower damping compared to the experiments 3 2 validation of art module the viscous damping due to the fluid motion inside the art has an important influence on the liquid motion inside the tank lewis 1989 since the analytical formulation in section 2 2 assumes the fluid to be ideal the viscous damping has to be estimated or determined in the present study the damping is determined experimentally the base design for the art was developed based on the guidelines given in lewis 1989 the principal geometric particulars are shown in table 2 a 1 17 scaled model of the art was fabricated using perspex sheets the art model is shown in fig 5 to determine the tank damping a decay test was conducted the art model was filled with water containing a colored dye and the art setup was tilted towards the starboard side both the vertical reservoirs are open to atmosphere however the starboard limb had a cut out to accommodate a air tight foam plug which was tightly secured after filling in the starboard side this ensured a differential liquid level because of suction due to the plug once the art was brought back to level surface the plug was removed thus allowing the liquid level in the tank to oscillate back and forth the liquid level on the portside limb was measured using a waveprobe the measurement from the wave probe is shown in fig 6 the damping ratio was obtained assuming an exponential decay based on the methodology used in journee 2001 the experimentally determined damping ratio was plugged into the numerical code to predict the decay characteristics of the tank this is shown in fig 7 there is a reasonably good agreement with the experimental measurements the natural period of the liquid oscillations from the experiments was established to be around 1 35 s whereas the numerical computations show a slightly higher period of approximately 1 39 s this could be attributed to some of the simplifications used in the computational model one of the major challenges when using the simplified flow model is the difficulty in defining the flow pattern around the sharp corners which in reality could be dominated by vortical structures and flow separation effects 3 3 validation of the coupled 7 dof simulation model in order to validate the coupled 7 dof model described in section 2 the vessel model was fitted with the art as shown in fig 8 the art was placed at a distance of 19 5 m from the transom with the bottom of the duct at an elevation of 1 6 m all dimensions being at full scale in order to compare the roll reduction performance of the art the two vertical reservoirs had a foam block inserted in them just above the liquid free surface level this simulated the effect of turning the art off to turn on the art effect the foam blocks were completely removed and the reservoirs exposed to the atmosphere this way the performance could be compared while ensuring the mass properties of the vessel remained exactly the same the experiments in waves were conducted in a wave basin measuring 30 m 30 m with a constant depth of 3 m to evaluate the roll response of the vessel regular waves of a fixed wave slope of h λ 1 50 were generated for a range of frequencies the model was oriented perpendicular to the wave fronts and placed beyond the region of transient waves and many wavelengths away from the parabolic wave absorbers at the far end of the tank to minimize effects of wave reflection although the model was allowed to undergo fully unrestricted 6 dof motions corresponding to the primary wave frequency the steady drift motions in the horizontal plane surge sway and yaw were controlled by way of slack lines to simulate soft mooring after each run the model was re oriented to the beam sea configuration using two guide lines as reference all the tests were conducted for an incident wave direction of 90 the results are shown in fig 9 as can be seen the initial art design helps in substantially reducing the roll motions the experimental measurements are also shown for comparison as can be seen good qualitative agreement is seen between the numerical predictions and the experiments with and without the art being active overall the computational simulations tend to slightly overpredict the responses this may be attributed to the slightly lower damping compared to the experimental damping as was seen in the decay tests figs 7 and 4 both the experiments and simulations show the typical twin peaked roll response when the art is activated having established the validity of the computational model the optimization problem can now be defined the objective function in the present problem is considered to be the area under the roll transfer function curve the objective function depends on the geometric parameters of the art for the present study the hull geometry is kept fixed although in theory the hull form and the art could be optimized in parallel the combined nonlinear time domain strip theory with the art module will be referenced by the acronym rbest art 4 genetic algorithm for optimization of the art genetic algorithm ga is part of the branch of evolutionary computing and has been found to enjoy a high probability of finding the global optimum solution mccall 2005 the technique is based on the principles of genetics and natural selection from darwin s theory of evolution namely the concept of survival of the fittest thus ga can be used as a tool for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems it assumes that the solution of a problem is an individual and can be characterized by a set of parameters each parameter is structured as a string of values typically represented in binary form the string of all parameters represents a chromosome a positive value generally known as fitness function is used to reflect the degree of goodness of the candidate for solving the problem and is closely related to the objective function throughout the genetic process the fittest chromosome has the tendency to yield good quality offspring which translates to an improved solution to the problem in a practical application of ga a population pool of chromosomes have to be installed and these can be randomly set initially the size of this population varies from one problem to the other in each cycle of the genetic operation termed a progressing process a subsequent generation is created from the chromosomes in the current population this can only be successful if a group of those chromosomes generally referred to as parents or collectively termed as mating pool are selected via a specific selection routine the genes of the parents are then mixed and recombined for the production of offspring in the next generation from this process of evolution the fittest chromosomes will generate a larger number of offspring and thus have a higher probability of surviving in the consequent generation mimicking the survival of the fittest mechanism in nature the process of evolution is continued until a favorable stopping criterion is arrived at this criterion is usually set based on the number of evolution cycles computational runs the amount of variation in the individual s fitness function between different generations or a predefined value of fitness man et al 1996 the overall flow chart for ga process is shown in fig 10 the key terminologies used in the flowchart can be explained as follows 1 fitness function biologically the fitness of an organism is typically defined as the probability that the organism will live to reproduce viability or as a function of the number of offspring the organism has fertility here the fitness function represents the relative merit of each of the candidate solutions 2 selection selection of the individuals called parents from the population pool that contribute to the population of the next generation 3 crossover combination of two parents to form offspring 4 mutation random changes to the produced offspring the mathematical form of the constrained optimization problem can be described as follows the design variables and constraint conditions are used to describe the problem the design variables are used in the hydrodynamic optimization problem for controlling the geometry of the art during the optimization procedure constraints are the values by which the design variables are limited and may be separated into two types namely equality and inequality constraints the value of the objective function is a benchmark to determine the efficiency of the design optimization procedure the art design in this case is a single objective optimization problem mathematically the standard optimization problem formulation is as follows 11 f x f 1 x f 1 x f n x x r n subject to 12 a i x 0 i 1 p 13 b i x 0 i 1 q where f x is the objective function n is the number of objective functions p is the number of equality constraints and q is the number of inequality constraints x x 1 x 2 x 3 x m l i x i u i each design variable x i varies between lower limit l i and upper limit u i the number of design variables is denoted by m the constraints define the feasible area for the optimization the design variables x must satisfy the limitations set by the constraints a i x and b i x in order to be a feasible solution the present optimization problem uses the following design parameters length of the duct l d length of the reservoir l r height of the duct h d height of the liquid in the duct h r it is to be noted that the length of the duct and the reservoir are kept equal therefore strictly speaking only the length of the duct is a design variable as far as the optimization is concerned the justification for doing so is to ensure the validity of the damping coefficient obtained from the experiments throughout the optimization process if the lengths are not equal the damping could be potentially different because of the additional vortices shed from the sharp corner introduced because of the unequal lengths in the future unequal lengths of the duct and reservoir will be considered the inequality constraints are based on the ratio of the natural frequency of the liquid in the art to the roll natural frequency of the vessel the fractional change in metacentric height δ g m g m attributed to the art free surface effect the equality constraint is chosen as the width of the art which is held constant the justification is that for the present study the hull geometry is fixed so the tank is constrained in width however this could in principle be considered as a design variable too the parameter w t ω t a n k ω s is restricted within the limits 1 06 w t 1 10 where ω t a n k is the natural frequency of the liquid in the tank and ω s is the roll natural frequency of the vessel the fractional loss in stability due to the free surface effect is bound within the limits 0 15 δ g m g m 0 3 cf zhong et al 1998 the width of the art w t a n k 4 094 m is held constant for all computations 5 interfacing of the genetic algorithm routine with the seakeeping program the interface between the optimization routine and the coupled art ship motions solver rbest art facilitates the ga routine to exchange input output information this is done by calling rbest art as an external program fig 11 shows the structure of the data exchange between ga program and the computational solver at each stage of generation the ga performs genetic operations such as selection cross over and mutation and then passes the design variables to the computational model at this point the seakeeping program evaluates the objective function namely the area under the frequency versus roll transfer function curve along with the constraint functions and then passes them back to ga the objective function is computed as 14 f r a o ω d ω here r a o ω refers to the roll response amplitude operator a simple trapezoidal rule is used to compute the objective function after each candidate solution is evaluated 6 procedure for optimizing the art the following section describes the optimization algorithm every design parameter of the art is represented by a string of 7 digits each digit represents a gene biologically speaking the number of digits is determined based on the precision level desired since three design parameters are used in the problem h r h d and l d these representations are combined to form a 21 digit genotype or chromosome an individual representing each design of the art the basic algorithm can be described as follows 1 start with a randomly generated population of size n p here n p denotes the number of individual designs one of the individuals represents the base design the initial population always contains at least one feasible design 2 compute the fitness of each individual in the population 3 repeat the following steps until n p new offspring have been created a encode each individual design form as a 21 digit genotype or chromosome b select a pair of parents from the current population the probability of selection being connected directly to the fitness and feasibility of the individual c simulate the cross over of the pair of parent genotypes at a randomly chosen digit location to form a pair of offspring the cross over probability is set to p c when no crossover takes place form two offspring that are exact copies of their respective parents d simulate the mutation of the two offspring at each digit location with the probability of mutation being p m e place the resulting offspring in the new population pool 4 replace the current population with the new population 5 continue to step 2 and repeat until convergence is achieved in the present study the number of individuals in a population n p is set to 10 an upper limit of 100 is set for the number of generations the parents are selected using the roulette wheel algorithm with the relative fitness as the hit probability the crossover probability p c is set to 0 8 and the mutation probability p m is set to 0 01 a uniform mutation operator is employed elitism is employed where the best solution from the previous generation is retained if superior in the current population it is to be noted that the optimization procedure is performed taking into consideration the constraints described in section 4 the loss in g m of the vessel due to the art free surface effect δ g m and the natural frequency of the tank ω t a n k can be calculated from eq 8 in the present study no penalty functions are used to modify the fitness function instead the constraints affect the relative fitness or ranking of each individual in the population the population is ranked according to the following scheme cf chehouri et al 2016 1 compute the fitness of each individual in the population 2 check the constraint condition for each individual based on eq 13 if violated count the number of constraints violated compute the total amount of constraint violation as b i x 3 any feasible solution with zero constraint violations gets a higher ranking over any unfeasible solution the feasible solutions are then sorted by their fitness values next the unfeasible solutions are sorted based on number of violations if the number of violations is equal the individual with lower amount of constraint violation gets a higher ranking if the number of violations and amount of constraint violation are equal the individual with a better fitness gets a higher rank the effect of this scheme is seen when selecting parents for generating offspring with feasible solutions getting preferred over unfeasible solutions elitism ensures there are always feasible solutions in the population while mutation helps maintain diversity in the population from practical design considerations some limits are also imposed on the principal dimensions of the art in order to restrict the search space and to keep the optimal art near the original one for comparison the art design parameters are limited to a variation of 30 relative to the base design table 3 7 parametric study of art for the purpose of validating the ga based optimized results an independent systematic parametric study was conducted by choosing the variants and evaluating the roll reduction in this manner the best performing art was determined the parameters of the most successful art was compared with those evolved from the ga scheme 7 1 case a influence of the length of the crossover duct and reservoir for this scenario l d the length of the crossover duct and l r the length of the reservoir were increased by up to 20 in increments of 5 while keeping the area ratio a r a d and other art parameters constant the variation of parameters is presented in table 4 the results shown in fig 12 show that the stabilizing moment increases as the length of the crossover duct and reservoir length increases 7 2 case b influence of the height of the liquid in the reservoir for this scenario the height of liquid in the reservoir h r was increased by up to 20 in increments of 5 while keeping all the other parameters constant the variation of parameters for this case is given in table 5 the results from fig 13 show that liquid height level in the reservoir has an adverse influence on the reduction of roll motions 7 3 case c influence of area ratio of the art for this case the area ratio of the art was varied between 0 34 and 0 62 table 6 shows the variation of design parameters of art for case c the results are plotted in different sub plots for clarity without clutter from the plots shown in fig 14 the better performance is seen in the case with the area ratio set between 0 45 and 0 55 the natural frequency of the art is dependent on the crossover duct area ratio increasing the duct area ratio increases the natural frequency of art the parametric study establishes that art 5 shown in table 7 with minimum area under the roll transfer function curve is the better option amongst the different variants investigated 8 results and discussion the computational scheme was run with a population size of 10 corresponding to the candidate art forms at each stage of generation to arrive at the optimized tank the main dimensions of the base design and optimized art are given in table 8 the comparison of the roll response of the optimized art from ga with the base design art 1 is shown in fig 15 for comparison the performance of art 5 based on the parametric study is also plotted on the same graph the convergence of the art parameters starting from the base design values to the optimized values using the ga is shown in fig 16 the convergence is typically achieved within 20 iterations or generations as the iteration progresses the value of the objective function reduces through the range 1 64 s 1 to 1 400 s 1 the parametric study resulted in a minima of 1 414 s 1 therefore the evolution of the most optimal art with the objective function of 1 400 s 1 confirms the effectiveness of the genetic algorithm table 9 the ga results in a substantial roll reduction of about 12 compared with the base design this corresponds to a reduction of approximately 82 in the peak roll response compared to the ship with the art effect turned off 9 summary and conclusions a genetic algorithm ga based optimization scheme has been developed and applied to optimize the performance of a passive u tube type anti roll tank fitted in the case of a sea going coastal research vessel a recently developed nonlinear time domain strip theory model rbest was used to solve the external wave body problem the strip theory formulation allows for computational efficiency and simplified body geometry definition in order to analyze the fluid flow in the art a 7 dof mathematical model has been developed using the principles of lagrangian dynamics the model is capable of handling tanks with arbitrary geometry for the present study the art model is linearized for computational efficiency and stability the art ship motion problem is solved together as a single 7 dof system which is statically and dynamically coupled in the degrees of freedom involving sway roll yaw and tank liquid motion before proceeding with the optimization scheme experiments were conducted to validate the computational model a 1 17 scale model of the candidate vessel was fabricated in fiberglass and tested to verify the mass and damping characteristics were correctly modeled a model of the base design of the art art 1 was fabricated from perspex and a decay test was conducted to obtain the fluid damping of the liquid in the tank the art decay was simulated using the experimental damping and compared favorably with the measurements the art was fitted into the vessel and motion tests were conducted in the presence of regular waves with and without the effect of the art the heading was restricted to beam seas comparisons with the experiments show good agreement for both the cases in general the computational results tended to slightly over predict the roll response this could be attributed to the under prediction in the damping a two way interface was set up between the ga routine and the fluid flow solver rbest art the principle dimensions of the art were chosen as the design variables for the optimization problem the area under the roll response transfer function was set as the objective function constraints were applied on the natural frequency of the tank relative to the roll natural frequency of the vessel and the loss of stability due to the tank free surface effect for the present investigation the geometry of the vessel was held fixed therefore the width of the tank was also held constant the optimization routine was found to rapidly converge in about 20 iterations the optimized art was found to bring down the objective function by 12 compared to the base design to validate the optimization scheme an independent parametric study was also conducted by systematically varying the geometry of the art starting from the base design the ga optimized art was found to bring down the peak roll response by about 82 when compared to the vessel with the art effect turned off overall the computational scheme was found to be stable efficient and robust the ga thus shows promise as an effective tool for ship design optimization although the present study was conducted with the hull geometry held fixed the methodology can readily be extended to include the hull geometry as a design variable the optimization could also be carried out to optimize the response for a particular design sea state these cases would be investigated in the future credit authorship contribution statement rahul subramanian conceptualization methodology formal analysis

21936,wave induced impacts on jacket platforms generate strong vibrations in a low damping metal structure which causes severe damage to resist impact and suppress vibration a type of steel brace containing a multistable bilayered msb soft material steel column that provides a flexible combination of high stiffness and enhanced damping is designed according to the structural composite and stability mechanism finite element modeling fem simulations show that the dissipated power of the msb column is several times of magnitude higher than that of an existing multistable steel column wang et al 2019 under cyclic loading whereas the initial stiffness is similar to that of the steel column through a combination of hybrid lamination and mixed boundary theoretical methods the multistable transformation of the msb column is analyzed which indicates that the soft layer manipulates the neutral axis of bending deformation and highly enhances the damping efficiency parametric studies conducted on the lamination properties illustrate the stiffness and damping configurations of the msb module in fem simulations under impact loading a representative jacket platform embedded with dissipative braces containing msb columns exhibits a substantial increase eightfold increase in magnitude in the decay coefficients of the system compared to those of the platform embedded with braces containing existing steel columns the simulation results demonstrate the potential of the multistable composite member to obtain high stiffness and enhanced damping in marine structures keywords bilayered structure hysteretic dissipation vibration suppression 1 introduction violent impacts such as breaking wave impingement exert heavy short term loads and strong long term vibrations on jacket platforms which substantially contribute to structural damage thomas et al 2008 steel members with high stiffness are necessary for resisting short term impacts however the low damping of structural metal is prone to lasting vibrations high structural damping is required for reducing the time scale for attenuating vibration after an impact moreover structural damping is typically enhanced by adhering viscoelastic materials to structural members where the hysteresis relation of the cyclic strain and stress of the viscoelastic material dissipates vibration energy kandasamy et al 2016 according to the vibration theory of linear structures the viscoelastic material must comprise a certain proportion of the structure before it can effectively dissipate energy ni 1990 however as existing viscoelastic materials have low to moderate stiffness increasing the proportion of these materials results in a reduction in structural bearing capacity lakes 2009 the vibration mechanism of a linear structural system restricts the combination of high stiffness and enhanced damping in a structure to enhance damping in the metal members of structures researchers have considered specifically designing structures according to nonlinear vibration mechanisms bistable and multistable components have shown the potential for significant damping a bistable system with two stable equilibria separated by an unstable equilibrium which exhibits negative stiffness due to transitions between the stable equilibrium modes under cyclic loading has shown potential for enhanced damping due to potential energy transitions tong 2015 the energy dissipation capability of an individual harmonically excited bistable system von mises truss has been numerically studied and the enhanced dissipation associated with the displacement force phase change due to negative stiffness has been quantified barbarino et al 2012 however a bistable module has not been designed for load bearing because of the large motion induced when negative stiffness occurs li and fang 2019 analytically studied a nonlinear system coupled to a bistable preloaded beam and a linear spring in the oscillation this bistable system induced a reaction force in the direction opposite to the displacement due to the internal negative stiffness thereby providing enhanced dissipation power however the integration of a bistable component and linear springs in series is not suitable for a high stiffness design because the overall stiffness is limited by the low stiffness component through the special multistable buckling behavior of a press fit cylindrical column dong and lakes 2013 kalathur et al 2014 negative stiffness in equilibria transformation results in energy dissipation under cyclic compression for engineering applications a metal module has been designed in which the multistable transition of the inner asymmetric columns in the elastic state creates a hysteresis loop with an initial stiffness similar to that of the parent material under cyclic tension compression loading details would be presented in the first paragraph of section 2 the increased dissipation efficiency of this asymmetric column is consistent with the larger critical buckling load wang et al 2019 a column with a larger critical load would have a larger structural section or a shorter length which would result in excessive stiffness and insufficient deformation because the bearing and dissipation properties are dependent on the structural characteristics which are strictly restricted by the buckling mechanism it is difficult to implement the optimization design of dissipation stiffness and deformation when multistable modules are assembled with engineering structures according to the structural composite and stability mechanism a novelty multistable bilayered msb soft material steel column which provides a flexible combination of initial stiffness and hysteretic damping is proposed in this paper utilizing finite element modeling fem the dissipation behaviors of the msb column are studied and compared with those of existing multistable steel columns wang et al 2019 developing a combination of hybrid lamination and mixed boundary analytical methods the stable transformation of the msb column is studied to explain the enhanced dissipation induced by the lamination effect parametric studies conducted on the lamination properties illustrate the stiffness and damping configurations the vibration of a representative jacket platform embedded with braces containing msb columns is simulated and compared to that of the brace containing existing steel columns under impact loading 2 multistable module containing bilayer column in reference wang et al 2019 we proposed an asymmetric column characterized with press fit boundary conditions in which the flat ends of the columns are in press contact with the bearing blocks fig 1 a generally the press fit column stays straight under axial compression left subfigure in fig 1 b if the critical buckling force of the column is reached at the press fit boundary the column buckles into the local bending equilibrium mode middle subfigure in fig 1 b which decreases the compressive stiffness of the column when the compressive load increases and reaches the second critical value the press fit flat ends of the column tilt from full area contact to edge contact which introduces the global bending mode of the column with nominal pinned pinned boundaries right subfigure in fig 1 b this shift in equilibrium generates a significant additional reduction in stiffness corresponding to the stiffness reduction in the column during the multistable equilibrium transformation the potential energy is dissipated and the force displacement relation forms a hysteresis loop the increasing dissipation efficiency of this asymmetric column is consistent with the larger critical buckling load that corresponds to a larger potential energy a column with a larger critical load would have a smaller slenderness which indicates a larger structural section or a shorter length note that the multistable components must be assembled with basic structural frames for applications in marine structures as shown in fig 2 c the larger section and shorter length of multistable components would result in excessive stiffness and insufficient deformation it is difficult to implement the optimization design of dissipation stiffness and deformation because these mechanical properties are dependent on the structural characteristics which are strictly restricted by the buckling mechanism to overcome the theoretical constraints a novel bilayered soft material steel column is proposed see the schematic configuration in fig 2 a in which a soft layer such as resin is laminated on the existing asymmetric column fig 1 a as presented in subsections 2 1 and 2 2 the soft layer would subtly manipulate the buckling behavior of the bilayered column increasing the dissipation efficiency of the system by several times magnitude while keeping the initial stiffness of the bilayer column very similar to that of the existing asymmetric column fem simulations are performed to capture the dynamic behavior of the bilayered column in subsection 2 1 analytical bending and buckling models are derived to analyze the nonlinear mechanism of the bilayered column in subsection 2 2 a parametric study of the brace containing a bilayered column is performed in subsection 2 3 2 1 fem the bilayered soft material steel column fig 2 a is assembled in a module as shown in fig 2 b this design can ensure that the bilayered column is compressed during module compression and tension the inner columns are compressed when the outer frames move together module compression and the inner columns are again compressed as the frames separate module tension the geometric and material parameters of the msb column are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively steel table 2 is used for the frames the flat ends are press fit at both ends of the outer frame fig 2 b where the interaction is defined as rough tangential and hard normal contact the bilayered column model is comprised of steel adhesion epoxy interface material and soft material parts that are tied with each other in the abaqus as shown in fig 4 b the thickness of epoxy layer is set as 0 1 mm table 2 shows the mechanical property parameters of the adhering interface epoxy li et al 2017 a solid element c3d8r containing 8 nodes with hourglass control and reduced integration is utilized for all parts of this module the mesh size of main structure is set to 5 mm which enables proper descriptions of stresses and step stress gradients for the current geometry scale and the mesh of fine structures i e adhesive layer are much finer than the main structure there are 36318 elements in this model as presented in the fem simulation below the bilayered column exhibits negative stiffness when the local bending mode transforms to the global mode elastic springs are set to bear the excess load caused by the negative stiffness and to keep the brace stable these springs are modeled with spring like elastic connectors that can be defined in any connector with available components of relative motion abaqus manual an implicit dynamic analysis is performed with abaqus a sinusoidal force of 8 0 105 n amplitude and 0 25 hz frequency fig 3 a is applied to the top end of the brace the bottom end of the brace is fixed the reaction force on the top cap of the bilayered column is measured and shown in the vertical axis of fig 3 b whereas the top cap displacement of the brace is measured and shown in the lateral axis of fig 3 b when the reaction force does not reach the critical load point 1 in fig 3 b of the bilayered column with press fit boundaries the brace performs as a linear elastic module left subfigure in fig 4 and the unloading path coincides with the loading path point 0 to 1 in fig 3 b shortly after the reaction force exceeds the critical load of the boundary transformation the full area press fit boundaries become edge contact boundaries and the column directly changes from straight to global bending right subfigure in fig 4 because the stiffness of the edge contact bending column is much smaller than that of the press fit column the reaction force substantially decreases point 1 to 2 in fig 3 b and the decreased load capacity of the msb column has been inherited by the linear springs with increasing load the reaction force and displacement linearly increase for a small stiffness global bending column with edge contact boundaries point 2 to 3 in fig 3 b as the unloading process starts the reaction force displacement relation is still linear when the unloading process reaches the coincidence point of the unloading point 2 to 3 in fig 3 b and loading paths point 0 to 1 in fig 3 b the equilibrium mode jumps from global bending to axial compression while the column ends jump from edge contact to full area press fit i e the bilayered column returns to the initial state of high stiffness point 4 in fig 3 b in the cyclic loading process the bilayered column exhibits two stable equilibrium states and the cyclic change in stiffness consistent with multistable transformation creates a hysteresis loop with a high initial stiffness as shown in fig 3 b by adding the elastic force of the linear springs the displacement force relation of the module containing a bilayered column becomes a flag shaped loop fig 3 c in cyclic loading the maximal von mises stress approximately 0 389 gpa of the main structure of the bilayered column remains below the material yield strength as shown in fig 4 a and the maximal normal and shear stress of the adhesive epoxy do not exceed the material s strength as shown in fig 4 c to draw comparisons with the novel msb column the hysteretic behavior of the asymmetric column without a soft layer is also simulated the single layer column is also assembled in the module shown in fig 2 b the physical parameters of the steel column are the same as those of the main layer in the msb column shown in tables 1 and 2 in addition all others model settings such as the interaction frame material and implicit dynamics are same as those used for the module containing a msb column the reaction force displacement hysteretic relation of the inner column and displacement force hysteretic relation of the module are presented in fig 3 b and c respectively the initial stiffness of these two columns is approximately equal because of the low modulus of elasticity of the soft material as presented in the analytical analysis subsection 2 2 the critical buckling boundary transformation value of the msb column is more than two times the magnitude of that of the steel column and the area of the hysteresis loop is approximately six times the magnitude of that of the steel column the asymmetric steel column has three stable equilibria straight local bending and global bending fig 1 b based on the analytical analysis presented in subsection 2 2 the soft layer manipulates the position of the neutral axis which amplifies the equivalent bending stiffness of the bilayer column and the corresponding critical buckling load 2 2 theoretical analysis 2 2 1 elastic flexure of the bilayered column before attempting to analyze the buckling process of a msb column it is convenient to first consider the bending problem in fig 5 a a composite column with two layers labeled as materials 1 and 2 is subjected to an external bending moment m the elastic properties of materials 1 and 2 are e 1 and υ 1 and e 2 and υ 2 respectively where e is the young s modulus and υ is the poisson s ratio of the materials the msb column geometry is set to l in length w in width and t 1 and t 2 in thickness for the two layers as a result of the external moment m the bilayered column bends from a straight shape to a curved shape with a radius of curvature r following the hybrid analytical method performed by chuang and lee 2000 the relationships between m and r with a given set of materials properties and column geometry are analyzed first the two individual layers in the stress free state are separately considered as two free straight columns with equal lengths fig 5 a two bending moments were separately applied to the two columns to form a curved shape with a given r fig 5 b the amount of bending moment needed for each beam is expressed as follows 1 m i e i i i r i 1 2 where i i w t i 3 12 is the cross sectional moment of inertia for layer i note that the curvature r 1 of layer 1 should be larger than the curvature r 2 of layer 2 such that r 1 r 2 t 1 t 2 2 when the two layers fit perfectly into a composite member because r t 1 t 2 2 it is assumed that r 1 r 2 r in this bending state the strains at z t 1 for layer 1 and 2 are given as follows 2 1 ε b 1 m 1 e 1 i 1 t 1 2 2 2 ε b 2 m 2 e 2 i 2 t 2 2 according to the continuous interface z t 1 condition the normal strains must be unique at the interface a force p is applied at the centroid of each layer without rotating the column fig 5 c the resulting normal strains for layers 1 and 2 are expressed as follows 3 1 ε e 1 p e 1 w t 1 3 2 e 1 p e 1 w t 1 the net strain at the interface has a unique value 4 ε i n t ε b 1 ε e 1 ε b 2 ε e 2 by substituting eqs 2 and 3 into eq 4 we obtain the following expression 5 p t 1 t 2 2 r 1 e 1 t 1 1 e 1 t 1 the deformation of each individual layer is identical to the composite state of the column the load pair p at the two layers separately forms a couple moment m p wherein m p p t 1 t 2 2 by substituting eq 5 into this expression we obtain the following equation 6 m p t 1 t 2 2 4 r 1 e 1 t 1 1 e 1 t 1 the total moment m for bending the msb column from a straight to curved shape as presented in fig 5 e is the sum of the three moments m 1 m 2 and m p applied throughout the whole process 7 m e 1 i 1 r e 2 i 2 r t 1 t 2 2 4 r 1 e 1 t 1 1 e 2 t 2 note that for a uniform column where e 1 e 2 e and t t 1 t 2 eq 7 reduces to m e w t 1 t 2 3 12 r which is a conventional expression for a bending column based on eq 7 a bilayered column can be equivalent to a homogeneous column and the modulus times the moment of inertia of is obtained 8 k b e b i b e 1 i 1

a 1 t 1 w and a 2 t 2 w are the main cross sectional areas of the material 1 and 2 parts of column without end caps respectively 2 2 2 buckling and postbuckling of a msb column the equivalent axial and bending elastic deformation parameters k a and k b are used for buckling analysis if the maximum value of the axial load is not beyond the first critical point 1 in fig 3 b the equilibrium follows the axial deformation of the column with no lateral sway and the relation for the force f from the vertical motion u between the column ends is expressed as follows 9 f k a u 2 l where l l 1 2 l 2 2 is the half length of the column with end caps with increasing load the deformation modes transit when the initial point 1 in fig 3 b and secondary point 1 in fig 3 b buckling events occur a column model with unattached flat ends is used to analyze this buckling process the column ends are treated as parts of a circle with radius r timoshenko and gere 1963 as shown in fig 6 when the column buckles the force f line displaces by a deviation d the rotation angle of the column ends is small and the deviation can be expressed as d r θ the moment curvature relation of the slender column is expressed as follows 10 k b d y 2 x d x 2 f δ y x d where y x is the deflection at cross section location x and δ y l is the deflection of the column end eq 10 is written in the following nondimensional form 11 y λ 2 y 0 where ε π x 2 l λ 2 4 f l 2 k b π 2 and d y d ε the general solution of eq 11 is expressed as follows 12 y ε c 1 sin λ ε c 2 cos λ ε c 3 ε c 4 then the following

after first buckling can be expressed as follows 15 y c 4 1 cos 2 when the load increases the asymmetric end of the msb column induces the transformation of the press fit boundaries from full area

following expansion can be used 17 1 y 2 1 2 1 1 2 y 2 3 8 y 4 by substituting eq 16 into eq 10 and omitting the higher order terms the following expression can be obtained 18 y 1 1 2 y 2 λ 2 y d δ 0 following galerkin s theory the resulting equation must be orthogonal to the selected function cos 2 ε as shown below 19 0 π 2 y 1 1 2 y 2 λ 2 y d δ cos 2 ε d z 0 then the following expression can be

boundary conditions at the edges of the end can be considered pins and the buckling mode of the column quickly transitions into full bending toward a predesigned direction it is reasonable that an initial deformation of a pinned pinned column y i m y 0 sin ε is considered in the model to analyze the loading process and the lateral deflection function of the full column can be written as follows 25 y ε y i m ε λ 2 δ y ε e where e is the eccentric distance between the end corner loading point and the neutral axis by using the boundary conditions y 0 0 and y π 2 δ the approximate solution is

column is presented in fig 7 in fig 7 the ultimate carrying capacity is equal to f b and the tangent stiffness is close to zero near the ultimate load because the initial displacement of the column with edge contact ends depends on the loading process the stiffness of the full bending column is used to describe the loading behavior in fig 3 b the reaction force decreases to a low value point 2 that is very close to f b after the curve is beyond the peak point and the tangent stiffness of the curve points 2 3 4 is nearly zero which agrees with the tangent stiffness presented in fig 7 as the displacement decreases the tangent stiffness of the curve progressively increases and approaches the stiffness of the straight column because the column does not have a perfectly pinned boundary condition when the deformation of the column is small as shown in fig 3 b then the backward load leads to a mode transition starting from global bending and returning to axial compression which creates a prominent hysteresis loop based on the analytical equations the critical load point 1 in fig 3 b of stable transformation in the msb column can be obtained directly note that the analytical equations presented above are derived on the premise of a uniform column the antisymmetric ends of the column influence the active length of the buckling column zhou 2010 if the active length of the msb column is 2l 900 mm the critical load is very close to the value calculated by fem as shown in fig 3 b 2 3 parametric study according to the structural analysis presented above the mechanical behavior of the msb column would be influenced by the corresponding physical and geometric characteristics according to the analytical study presented above based on structural stability theory slenderness is the key factor for the buckling behavior of a slender column zhou 2010 based on eqs 8 13 and 22 the equivalent elastic deformation parameter k b of this msb column is coupled with

critical load of boundary transformation peak reaction force in fig 3 b and the dissipated energy area of the hysteresis loop in fig 3 b are chosen to characterize the bearing and damping capacities the geometric and material properties of the baseline eccentric column are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively abaqus is utilized for the simulations in this study for different values of the ratio t 2 t 1 simulations are performed by varying only the thickness t 2 and the critical load thickness ratio t 2 t 1 relation is presented in fig 8 a in fig 8 a the critical load increases with increasing thickness ratio which is consistent with the critical load increasing with larger slenderness fig 8 b shows that the dissipation energy increases when the thickness ratio increases based on eqs 22 and 24 the difference between f cr2 and f b increases as the slenderness ratio decreases and the area of the hysteresis loop increases as shown in fig 3 b for different values of the ratio e 2 e 1 simulations are performed by varying only the elastic modulus e 2 and the critical load elastic modulus ratio e 2 e 1 relation is presented in fig 8 b as expected the critical loading and dissipation energy increase with increasing elastic modulus which is consistent with the critical load increasing with larger slenderness then the effective slenderness of the inner asymmetric column is adjusted to achieve enhanced damping 2 4 stiffness damping map a maximal combination of stiffness and damping is desirable in engineering applications as defined in the material damping theory lakes 2009 the combination of stiffness and damping is the product of the absolute value of the complex young s modulus e and tanϕ ϕ is the phase angle of e lakes 2009 presented a stiffness damping

product e tanϕ is less than 0 003 gpa thus these materials are located in the lower right of the map following the theory presented by lakes 2009 the combination of stiffness and damping of the brace containing a msb column can be inferred in which the damping is obtained by referring to the area ratio of this hysteresis loop to an elliptical lissajous loop with a known phase lag e g ϕ 1 rad within the same force displacement rectangular boundaries the effective stiffness is determined by referring to the slope dividing the area enclosed by the load deformation hysteresis loop in half the solid star symbols tanϕ 0 51 rad and e 112 gpa e tanϕ 57 gpa represent the characteristics of the msb column based on the left loop of the hysteretic relation fig 3 b which shows that a damper is developed based on the postbuckling transition of an axially loaded column note that the force displacement curve in fig 3 c can also be considered to obtain effective parameters which would result in a similar figure of merit e tanϕ comprising larger stiffness and smaller damping values than those shown in fig 3 b 3 impact dissipation of an offshore jacket platform a three dimensional jacket

abaqus manual based on the slamming experiment sruthi and sriram 2017 an impact load with an amplitude of 1 35 106 n fig 10 a is imposed on the fourth floor of the platform fig 2 c the displacement history of the platform top is recorded and presented in fig 10 b after the first impact the structure freely vibrates at a frequency of 0 527 hz which is the same as the 1st natural frequency of model 1 after the second impact the vibration amplitude increases significantly and the von mises stress of the column elements solid star in the stress diagram of fig 11 a exceeds the yield stress as presented above a series of wave impacts can cause irreversible damage to structural members in a short time and the resulting vibration could induce the accumulation of fatigue damage in the long term thus it is necessary to enhance damping to dissipate the impact energy based on the simulations of model 1 the diagonal braces of the structure are replaced with the dissipative braces containing msb columns designed to attenuate the platform vibration this platform model assembled with dissipative braces is defined as model 2 considering engineering applications this brace is designed and composed of dissipative parts connections and package components as shown in fig 2 c the geometric parameters of the msb columns in this brace are optimized in accordance with the guidelines proposed in section 4 and presented in table 1 this dissipative brace is considered as a unit and modeled with t3d2 elements the hysteresis force displacement relation of this brace is determined with a user defined material umat model to validate the set of t3d2 elements and the umat code we utilize a straight member the length and cross sectional area of this member are 11 18 m and 0 035 m2 respectively the effective stress strain relations realized by the umat code are consistent with those of the braces shown in fig 2 c the 1st natural frequency is 0 5 hz for model 2 which indicates that the initial stiffness of models 1 and 2 are similar the impact load shown in fig 10 a is imposed on the model according to the displacement time history of model 2 fig 10 b the initial amplification is close to that of model 1 but rapidly decays a hysteresis loop occurs in the braces parallel to the plane of structural motion as a beneficial result the plastic elements in model 1 disappear and all the elements in this model are in the elastic range the maximal stress occurs in the element solid star in the leg that is always within the limit of elasticity under impact loading fig 11 b the impact energy transforms to potential and kinetic energy in the braces containing msb columns and dissipates to draw comparisons with the performance of the braces containing msb columns a brace

asymmetric steel column are the same as those of the main layer in the msb column table 1 all other platform model settings are the same as those in model 2 the 1st natural frequency is 0 493 hz for model 3 which indicates that the initial stiffness of models 1 2 and 3 are similar the impact load shown in fig 10 a is imposed on the model according to the displacement time history of model 3 fig

given in terms of successive displacement peak values as defined in fig 10 b model 2 η 0 08 exhibits substantially higher decay coefficients than model 3 η 0 01 the maximal stress occurs in the element solid star in the leg that is always within the limit of elasticity under impact loading fig 11 c but is larger than that of model 2 to enhance the hysteric area of the brace containing asymmetric steel column and keep initial stiffness unchanged the design of multiple column in series would be utilized as presented in reference wang et al 2019 a multi stable bi layered column is an engineering implement for obtaining a high structural stiffness and enhanced energy dissipation in application 4 conclusion an asymmetric column comprising laminated soft material and steel layers is proposed in this research to illustrate the benefits of the multistable equilibrium transition mechanism which provides enhanced hysteretic damping with high stiffness in the fem simulation of vibration the dissipated power of the msb soft material steel column is several times of magnitude higher than that of the existing multistable steel column whereas the initial stiffness of the msb column is similar to that of the steel column analytical solutions of the buckling and postbuckling behavior of the msb column are obtained based on the combination of hybrid lamination and mixed boundary theoretical methods which indicates that the soft layer manipulates the neutral axis of bending deformation and highly enhances the damping efficiency based on parametric studies utilizing fem calculations the increasing trend of the dissipation efficiency is consistent with the larger critical load of a msb column with a smaller equivalent slenderness and this trend can be adjusted by the lamination parameters for engineering applications a brace containing msb columns in series is proposed the impact induced vibration of jacket platforms assembled with the hysteretic braces is simulated by fem combined with umat code the dissipation introduced by the hysteretic braces effectively attenuates the vibrational amplitudes of the jacket platforms under wave impacts the

21936,wave induced impacts on jacket platforms generate strong vibrations in a low damping metal structure which causes severe damage to resist impact and suppress vibration a type of steel brace containing a multistable bilayered msb soft material steel column that provides a flexible combination of high stiffness and enhanced damping is designed according to the structural composite and stability mechanism finite element modeling fem simulations show that the dissipated power of the msb column is several times of magnitude higher than that of an existing multistable steel column wang et al 2019 under cyclic loading whereas the initial stiffness is similar to that of the steel column through a combination of hybrid lamination and mixed boundary theoretical methods the multistable transformation of the msb column is analyzed which indicates that the soft layer manipulates the neutral axis of bending deformation and highly enhances the damping efficiency parametric studies conducted on the lamination properties illustrate the stiffness and damping configurations of the msb module in fem simulations under impact loading a representative jacket platform embedded with dissipative braces containing msb columns exhibits a substantial increase eightfold increase in magnitude in the decay coefficients of the system compared to those of the platform embedded with braces containing existing steel columns the simulation results demonstrate the potential of the multistable composite member to obtain high stiffness and enhanced damping in marine structures keywords bilayered structure hysteretic dissipation vibration suppression 1 introduction violent impacts such as breaking wave impingement exert heavy short term loads and strong long term vibrations on jacket platforms which substantially contribute to structural damage thomas et al 2008 steel members with high stiffness are necessary for resisting short term impacts however the low damping of structural metal is prone to lasting vibrations high structural damping is required for reducing the time scale for attenuating vibration after an impact moreover structural damping is typically enhanced by adhering viscoelastic materials to structural members where the hysteresis relation of the cyclic strain and stress of the viscoelastic material dissipates vibration energy kandasamy et al 2016 according to the vibration theory of linear structures the viscoelastic material must comprise a certain proportion of the structure before it can effectively dissipate energy ni 1990 however as existing viscoelastic materials have low to moderate stiffness increasing the proportion of these materials results in a reduction in structural bearing capacity lakes 2009 the vibration mechanism of a linear structural system restricts the combination of high stiffness and enhanced damping in a structure to enhance damping in the metal members of structures researchers have considered specifically designing structures according to nonlinear vibration mechanisms bistable and multistable components have shown the potential for significant damping a bistable system with two stable equilibria separated by an unstable equilibrium which exhibits negative stiffness due to transitions between the stable equilibrium modes under cyclic loading has shown potential for enhanced damping due to potential energy transitions tong 2015 the energy dissipation capability of an individual harmonically excited bistable system von mises truss has been numerically studied and the enhanced dissipation associated with the displacement force phase change due to negative stiffness has been quantified barbarino et al 2012 however a bistable module has not been designed for load bearing because of the large motion induced when negative stiffness occurs li and fang 2019 analytically studied a nonlinear system coupled to a bistable preloaded beam and a linear spring in the oscillation this bistable system induced a reaction force in the direction opposite to the displacement due to the internal negative stiffness thereby providing enhanced dissipation power however the integration of a bistable component and linear springs in series is not suitable for a high stiffness design because the overall stiffness is limited by the low stiffness component through the special multistable buckling behavior of a press fit cylindrical column dong and lakes 2013 kalathur et al 2014 negative stiffness in equilibria transformation results in energy dissipation under cyclic compression for engineering applications a metal module has been designed in which the multistable transition of the inner asymmetric columns in the elastic state creates a hysteresis loop with an initial stiffness similar to that of the parent material under cyclic tension compression loading details would be presented in the first paragraph of section 2 the increased dissipation efficiency of this asymmetric column is consistent with the larger critical buckling load wang et al 2019 a column with a larger critical load would have a larger structural section or a shorter length which would result in excessive stiffness and insufficient deformation because the bearing and dissipation properties are dependent on the structural characteristics which are strictly restricted by the buckling mechanism it is difficult to implement the optimization design of dissipation stiffness and deformation when multistable modules are assembled with engineering structures according to the structural composite and stability mechanism a novelty multistable bilayered msb soft material steel column which provides a flexible combination of initial stiffness and hysteretic damping is proposed in this paper utilizing finite element modeling fem the dissipation behaviors of the msb column are studied and compared with those of existing multistable steel columns wang et al 2019 developing a combination of hybrid lamination and mixed boundary analytical methods the stable transformation of the msb column is studied to explain the enhanced dissipation induced by the lamination effect parametric studies conducted on the lamination properties illustrate the stiffness and damping configurations the vibration of a representative jacket platform embedded with braces containing msb columns is simulated and compared to that of the brace containing existing steel columns under impact loading 2 multistable module containing bilayer column in reference wang et al 2019 we proposed an asymmetric column characterized with press fit boundary conditions in which the flat ends of the columns are in press contact with the bearing blocks fig 1 a generally the press fit column stays straight under axial compression left subfigure in fig 1 b if the critical buckling force of the column is reached at the press fit boundary the column buckles into the local bending equilibrium mode middle subfigure in fig 1 b which decreases the compressive stiffness of the column when the compressive load increases and reaches the second critical value the press fit flat ends of the column tilt from full area contact to edge contact which introduces the global bending mode of the column with nominal pinned pinned boundaries right subfigure in fig 1 b this shift in equilibrium generates a significant additional reduction in stiffness corresponding to the stiffness reduction in the column during the multistable equilibrium transformation the potential energy is dissipated and the force displacement relation forms a hysteresis loop the increasing dissipation efficiency of this asymmetric column is consistent with the larger critical buckling load that corresponds to a larger potential energy a column with a larger critical load would have a smaller slenderness which indicates a larger structural section or a shorter length note that the multistable components must be assembled with basic structural frames for applications in marine structures as shown in fig 2 c the larger section and shorter length of multistable components would result in excessive stiffness and insufficient deformation it is difficult to implement the optimization design of dissipation stiffness and deformation because these mechanical properties are dependent on the structural characteristics which are strictly restricted by the buckling mechanism to overcome the theoretical constraints a novel bilayered soft material steel column is proposed see the schematic configuration in fig 2 a in which a soft layer such as resin is laminated on the existing asymmetric column fig 1 a as presented in subsections 2 1 and 2 2 the soft layer would subtly manipulate the buckling behavior of the bilayered column increasing the dissipation efficiency of the system by several times magnitude while keeping the initial stiffness of the bilayer column very similar to that of the existing asymmetric column fem simulations are performed to capture the dynamic behavior of the bilayered column in subsection 2 1 analytical bending and buckling models are derived to analyze the nonlinear mechanism of the bilayered column in subsection 2 2 a parametric study of the brace containing a bilayered column is performed in subsection 2 3 2 1 fem the bilayered soft material steel column fig 2 a is assembled in a module as shown in fig 2 b this design can ensure that the bilayered column is compressed during module compression and tension the inner columns are compressed when the outer frames move together module compression and the inner columns are again compressed as the frames separate module tension the geometric and material parameters of the msb column are shown in tables 1 and 2 respectively steel table 2 is used for the frames the flat ends are press fit at both ends of the outer frame fig 2 b where the interaction is defined as rough tangential and hard normal contact the bilayered column model is comprised of steel adhesion epoxy interface material and soft material parts that are tied with each other in the abaqus as shown in fig 4 b the thickness of epoxy layer is set as 0 1 mm table 2 shows the mechanical property parameters of the adhering interface epoxy li et al 2017 a solid element c3d8r containing 8 nodes with hourglass control and reduced integration is utilized for all parts of this module the mesh size of main structure is set to 5 mm which enables proper descriptions of stresses and step stress gradients for the current geometry scale and the mesh of fine structures i e adhesive layer are much finer than the main structure there are 36318 elements in this model as presented in the fem simulation below the bilayered column exhibits negative stiffness when the local bending mode transforms to the global mode elastic springs are set to bear the excess load caused by the negative stiffness and to keep the brace stable these springs are modeled with spring like elastic connectors that can be defined in any connector with available components of relative motion abaqus manual an implicit dynamic analysis is performed with abaqus a sinusoidal force of 8 0 105 n amplitude and 0 25 hz frequency fig 3 a is applied to the top end of the brace the bottom end of the brace is fixed the reaction force on the top cap of the bilayered column is measured and shown in the vertical axis of fig 3 b whereas the top cap displacement of the brace is measured and shown in the lateral axis of fig 3 b when the reaction force does not reach the critical load point 1 in fig 3 b of the bilayered column with press fit boundaries the brace performs as a linear elastic module left subfigure in fig 4 and the unloading path coincides with the loading path point 0 to 1 in fig 3 b shortly after the reaction force exceeds the critical load of the boundary transformation the full area press fit boundaries become edge contact boundaries and the column directly changes from straight to global bending right subfigure in fig 4 because the stiffness of the edge contact bending column is much smaller than that of the press fit column the reaction force substantially decreases point 1 to 2 in fig 3 b and the decreased load capacity of the msb column has been inherited by the linear springs with increasing load the reaction force and displacement linearly increase for a small stiffness global bending column with edge contact boundaries point 2 to 3 in fig 3 b as the unloading process starts the reaction force displacement relation is still linear when the unloading process reaches the coincidence point of the unloading point 2 to 3 in fig 3 b and loading paths point 0 to 1 in fig 3 b the equilibrium mode jumps from global bending to axial compression while the column ends jump from edge contact to full area press fit i e the bilayered column returns to the initial state of high stiffness point 4 in fig 3 b in the cyclic loading process the bilayered column exhibits two stable equilibrium states and the cyclic change in stiffness consistent with multistable transformation creates a hysteresis loop with a high initial stiffness as shown in fig 3 b by adding the elastic force of the linear springs the displacement force relation of the module containing a bilayered column becomes a flag shaped loop fig 3 c in cyclic loading the maximal von mises stress approximately 0 389 gpa of the main structure of the bilayered column remains below the material yield strength as shown in fig 4 a and the maximal normal and shear stress of the adhesive epoxy do not exceed the material s strength as shown in fig 4 c to draw comparisons with the novel msb column the hysteretic behavior of the asymmetric column without a soft layer is also simulated the single layer column is also assembled in the module shown in fig 2 b the physical parameters of the steel column are the same as those of the main layer in the msb column shown in tables 1 and 2 in addition all others model settings such as the interaction frame material and implicit dynamics are same as those used for the module containing a msb column the reaction force displacement hysteretic relation of the inner column and displacement force hysteretic relation of the module are presented in fig 3 b and c respectively the initial stiffness of these two columns is approximately equal because of the low modulus of elasticity of the soft material as presented in the analytical analysis subsection 2 2 the critical buckling boundary transformation value of the msb column is more than two times the magnitude of that of the steel column and the area of the hysteresis loop is approximately six times the magnitude of that of the steel column the asymmetric steel column has three stable equilibria straight local bending and global bending fig 1 b based on the analytical analysis presented in subsection 2 2 the soft layer manipulates the position of the neutral axis which amplifies the equivalent bending stiffness of the bilayer column and the corresponding critical buckling load 2 2 theoretical analysis 2 2 1 elastic flexure of the bilayered column before attempting to analyze the buckling process of a msb column it is convenient to first consider the bending problem in fig 5 a a composite column with two layers labeled as materials 1 and 2 is subjected to an external bending moment m the elastic properties of materials 1 and 2 are e 1 and υ 1 and e 2 and υ 2 respectively where e is the young s modulus and υ is the poisson s ratio of the materials the msb column geometry is set to l in length w in width and t 1 and t 2 in thickness for the two layers as a result of the external moment m the bilayered column bends from a straight shape to a curved shape with a radius of curvature r following the hybrid analytical method performed by chuang and lee 2000 the relationships between m and r with a given set of materials properties and column geometry are analyzed first the two individual layers in the stress free state are separately considered as two free straight columns with equal lengths fig 5 a two bending moments were separately applied to the two columns to form a curved shape with a given r fig 5 b the amount of bending moment needed for each beam is expressed as follows 1 m i e i i i r i 1 2 where i i w t i 3 12 is the cross sectional moment of inertia for layer i note that the curvature r 1 of layer 1 should be larger than the curvature r 2 of layer 2 such that r 1 r 2 t 1 t 2 2 when the two layers fit perfectly into a composite member because r t 1 t 2 2 it is assumed that r 1 r 2 r in this bending state the strains at z t 1 for layer 1 and 2 are given as follows 2 1 ε b 1 m 1 e 1 i 1 t 1 2 2 2 ε b 2 m 2 e 2 i 2 t 2 2 according to the continuous interface z t 1 condition the normal strains must be unique at the interface a force p is applied at the centroid of each layer without rotating the column fig 5 c the resulting normal strains for layers 1 and 2 are expressed as follows 3 1 ε e 1 p e 1 w t 1 3 2 e 1 p e 1 w t 1 the net strain at the interface has a unique value 4 ε i

composite state of the column the load pair p at the two layers separately forms a couple moment m p wherein m p p t 1 t 2 2 by substituting eq 5 into this expression we obtain the following equation 6 m p t 1 t 2 2 4 r 1 e 1 t 1 1 e 1 t 1 the total moment m for bending the msb column from a straight to curved shape as presented in fig 5 e is the sum of the three moments m 1 m 2 and m p applied throughout the whole process 7 m e 1 i 1 r e 2 i 2 r t 1 t 2 2 4 r 1 e 1 t 1 1 e 2 t 2 note that for a uniform column where e 1 e 2 e and t t 1 t 2 eq 7 reduces to m e w t 1 t 2 3 12 r which is a conventional expression for a bending column based on eq 7 a bilayered column can be equivalent to a homogeneous column and the modulus times the moment of inertia of is obtained 8 k b e b i b e 1 i 1

the axial deformation of the column with no lateral sway and the relation for the force f from the vertical motion u between the column ends is expressed as follows 9 f k a u 2 l where l l 1 2 l 2 2 is the half length of the column with end caps with increasing load the deformation modes transit when the initial point 1 in fig 3 b and secondary point 1 in fig 3 b buckling events occur a column model with unattached flat ends is used to analyze this buckling process the column ends are treated as parts of a circle with radius r timoshenko and gere 1963 as shown in fig 6 when the column buckles the force f line displaces by a deviation d the rotation angle of the column ends is small and the deviation can be expressed as d r θ the moment curvature relation of the slender column is expressed as follows 10 k b d y 2 x d x 2 f δ y x d where y x is the deflection at cross section location x and δ y l is the deflection of the column end eq 10 is written in the following nondimensional form 11 y λ 2 y 0 where ε π x 2 l λ 2 4 f l 2 k b π 2 and d y d ε the general solution of eq 11 is expressed as follows 12 y ε c 1 sin λ ε c 2 cos λ ε c 3 ε c 4 then the following

boundary conditions at the edges of the end can be considered pins and the buckling mode of the column quickly transitions into full bending toward a predesigned direction it is reasonable that an initial deformation of a pinned pinned column y i m y 0 sin ε is considered in the model to analyze the loading process and the lateral deflection function of the full column can be written as follows 25 y ε y i m ε λ 2 δ y ε e where e is the eccentric distance between the end corner loading point and the neutral axis by using the boundary conditions y 0 0 and y π 2 δ the approximate solution is

column is presented in fig 7 in fig 7 the ultimate carrying capacity is equal to f b and the tangent stiffness is close to zero near the ultimate load because the initial displacement of the column with edge contact ends depends on the loading process the stiffness of the full bending column is used to describe the loading behavior in fig 3 b the reaction force decreases to a low value point 2 that is very close to f b after the curve is beyond the peak point and the tangent stiffness of the curve points 2 3 4 is nearly zero which agrees with the tangent stiffness presented in fig 7 as the displacement decreases the tangent stiffness of the curve progressively increases and approaches the stiffness of the straight column because the column does not have a perfectly pinned boundary condition when the deformation of the column is small as shown in fig 3 b then the backward load leads to a mode transition starting from global bending and returning to axial compression which creates a prominent hysteresis loop based on the analytical equations the critical load point 1 in fig 3 b of stable transformation in the msb column can be obtained directly note that the analytical equations presented above are derived on the premise of a uniform column the antisymmetric ends of the column influence the active length of the buckling column zhou 2010 if the active length of the msb column is 2l 900 mm the critical load is very close to the value calculated by fem as shown in fig 3 b 2 3 parametric study according to the structural analysis presented above the mechanical behavior of the msb column would be influenced by the corresponding physical and geometric characteristics according to the analytical study presented above based on structural stability theory slenderness is the key factor for the buckling behavior of a slender column zhou 2010 based on eqs 8 13 and 22 the equivalent elastic deformation parameter k b of this msb column is coupled with elasticity and geometric parameters and the equivalent slenderness can be obtained 28 l t l e t 1 e 1 e 2 e 1 t 2 t 1 3 3 e 2 e 1 t 2 t 1 1 t 2 t 1 2 1 e 2 e 1 t 2 t 1 1 3 note that the thickness ratio t 2 t 1 and modulus ratio e 2 e 1 are the key parameters for the equivalent slenderness parametric variations are investigated using the indices of the ratios t 2 t 1 and e 2 e 1 and the critical load of boundary transformation peak reaction force in fig 3 b and the dissipated energy area of the hysteresis loop in fig 3 b are chosen to characterize the bearing and damping capacities the geometric and material properties of the baseline eccentric column are listed in tables 1 and 2 respectively abaqus is utilized for the simulations in this study for different values of the ratio t 2 t 1 simulations are performed by varying only the thickness t 2 and the critical load thickness ratio t 2 t 1 relation is presented in fig 8 a in fig 8 a the critical load increases with increasing thickness ratio which is consistent with the critical load increasing with larger slenderness fig 8 b shows that the dissipation energy increases when the thickness ratio increases based on eqs 22 and 24 the difference between f cr2 and f b increases as the slenderness ratio decreases and the area of the hysteresis loop increases as shown in fig 3 b for different values of the ratio e 2 e 1 simulations are performed by varying only the elastic modulus e 2 and the critical load elastic modulus ratio e 2 e 1 relation is presented in fig 8 b as expected the critical loading and dissipation energy increase with increasing elastic modulus which is consistent with the critical load increasing with larger slenderness then the effective slenderness of the inner asymmetric column is adjusted to achieve enhanced damping 2 4 stiffness damping map a maximal combination of stiffness and damping is desirable in engineering applications as defined in the material damping theory lakes 2009 the combination of stiffness and damping is the product of the absolute value of the complex young s modulus e and tanϕ ϕ is the phase angle of e lakes 2009 presented a stiffness damping map for several classes of materials fig 9 in which the thick diagonal dash line represents a constant figure of merit i e e tanϕ 0 6 gpa for example structural metals have high stiffness and low damping characteristics e g e tanϕ 0 02 gpa for steel thus these metals occupy the region to the left of that black diagonal line rubbery materials have low stiffness and high damping for which the product e tanϕ is less than 0 003 gpa thus these materials are located in the lower right of the map following the theory presented by lakes 2009 the combination of stiffness and damping of the brace containing a msb column can be inferred in which the damping is obtained by referring to the area ratio of this hysteresis loop to an elliptical lissajous loop with a known phase lag e g ϕ 1 rad within the same force displacement rectangular boundaries the effective stiffness is determined by referring to the slope dividing the area enclosed by the load deformation hysteresis loop in half the solid star symbols tanϕ 0 51 rad and e 112 gpa e tanϕ 57 gpa represent the characteristics of the msb column based on the left loop of the hysteretic relation fig 3 b which shows that a damper is developed based on the postbuckling transition of an axially loaded column note that the force displacement curve in fig 3 c can also be considered to obtain effective parameters which would result in a similar figure of merit e tanϕ comprising larger stiffness and smaller damping values than those shown in fig 3 b 3 impact dissipation of an offshore jacket platform a three dimensional jacket platform studied in a slamming experiment sruthi and sriram 2017 is considered first this five story platform fig 2 c is modeled as a conventional elastoplastic system model 1 in table 3 for a benchmark the geometric parameters are as follows the height of one story is 10 m the outer and inner diameters of the leg tube are 1 3 m and 1 22 m respectively the outer and inner diameters of the transverse brace are 0 7 m and 0 6 m respectively the length of the transverse brace is 10 m and the cross sectional area of the diagonal brace is 0 025 m2 the material of the structure is q235 steel young s modulus 2 1 gpa poisson s ratio 0 3 and yield stress 0 235 gpa the mass of the structure 4 66 105 kg and superstructure 2 4 106 kg are lumped on the joints and top joints respectively the legs are fixed at the ends to directly evaluate the effect of the dissipation braces these simulations do not consider the modal damping ratio abaqus is used to perform the implicit calculations the legs and transverse braces are modeled with b31 beam elements in which transverse shear deformation is considered abaqus manual the rods are modeled with t3d2 elements which deform along the member axis abaqus manual based on the slamming experiment sruthi and sriram 2017 an impact load with an amplitude of 1 35 106 n fig 10 a is imposed on the fourth floor of the platform fig 2 c the displacement history of the platform top is recorded and presented in fig 10 b after the first impact the structure freely vibrates at a frequency of 0 527 hz which is the same as the 1st natural frequency of model 1 after the second impact the vibration amplitude increases significantly and the von mises stress of the column elements solid star in the stress diagram of fig 11 a exceeds the yield stress as presented above a series of wave impacts can cause irreversible damage to structural members in a short time and the resulting vibration could induce the accumulation of fatigue damage in the long term thus it is necessary to enhance damping to dissipate the impact energy based on the simulations of model 1 the diagonal braces of the structure are replaced with the dissipative braces containing msb columns designed to attenuate the platform vibration this platform model assembled with dissipative braces is defined as model 2 considering engineering applications this brace is designed and composed of dissipative parts connections and package components as shown in fig 2 c the geometric parameters of the msb columns in this brace are optimized in accordance with the guidelines proposed in section 4 and presented in table 1 this dissipative brace is considered as a unit and modeled with t3d2 elements the hysteresis force displacement relation of this brace is determined with a user defined material umat model to validate the set of t3d2 elements and the umat code we utilize a straight member the length and cross sectional area of this member are 11 18 m and 0 035 m2 respectively the effective stress strain relations realized by the umat code are consistent with those of the braces shown in fig 2 c the 1st natural frequency is 0 5 hz for model 2 which indicates that the initial stiffness of models 1 and 2 are similar the impact load shown in fig 10 a is imposed on the model according to the displacement time history of model 2 fig 10 b the initial amplification is close to that of model 1 but rapidly decays a hysteresis loop occurs in the braces parallel to the plane of structural motion as a beneficial result the plastic elements in model 1 disappear and all the elements in this model are in the elastic range the maximal stress occurs in the element solid star in the leg that is always within the limit of elasticity under impact loading fig 11 b the impact energy transforms to potential and kinetic energy in the braces containing msb columns and dissipates to draw comparisons with the performance of the braces containing msb columns a brace containing an asymmetric steel column fig 1 a wang et al 2019 is designed and assembled in the jacket platform fig 2 c this platform model is defined as model 3 the geometric parameters of the asymmetric steel column are the same as those of the main layer in the msb column table 1 all other platform model settings are the same as those in model 2 the 1st natural frequency is 0 493 hz for model 3 which indicates that the initial stiffness of models 1 2 and 3 are similar the impact load shown in fig 10 a is imposed on the model according to the displacement time history of model 3 fig 10 b the initial amplification is close to that of models 1 and 2 but decays slower than that of model 2 the decay coefficient η 1 t log e d t d t t thomas et al 2008 t is the period of response is given in terms of successive displacement peak values as defined in fig 10 b model 2 η 0 08 exhibits substantially higher decay coefficients than model 3 η 0 01 the maximal stress occurs in the element solid star in the leg that is always within the limit of elasticity under impact loading fig 11 c but is larger than that of model 2 to enhance the hysteric area of the brace containing asymmetric steel column and keep initial stiffness unchanged the design of multiple column in series would be utilized as presented in reference wang et al 2019 a multi stable bi layered column is an engineering implement for obtaining a high structural stiffness and enhanced energy dissipation in application 4 conclusion an asymmetric column comprising laminated soft material and steel layers is proposed in this research to illustrate the benefits of the multistable equilibrium transition mechanism which provides enhanced hysteretic damping with high stiffness in the fem simulation of vibration the dissipated power of the msb soft material steel column is several times of magnitude higher than that of the existing multistable steel column whereas the initial stiffness of the msb column is similar to that of the steel column analytical solutions of the buckling and postbuckling behavior of the msb column are obtained based on the combination of hybrid lamination and mixed boundary theoretical methods which indicates that the soft layer manipulates the neutral axis of bending deformation and highly enhances the damping efficiency based on parametric studies utilizing fem calculations the increasing trend of the dissipation efficiency is consistent with the larger critical load of a msb column with a smaller equivalent slenderness and this trend can be adjusted by the lamination parameters for engineering applications a brace containing msb columns in series is proposed the impact induced vibration of jacket platforms assembled with the hysteretic braces is simulated by fem combined with umat code the dissipation introduced by the hysteretic braces effectively attenuates the vibrational amplitudes of the jacket platforms under wave impacts the theoretical and numerical results show that a msb column is an alternative for obtaining high structural stiffness and enhanced energy dissipation credit authorship contribution statement hui fang

21937,the reduction of wave drift forces acting on a fixed inner truncated cylinder surrounded by several additional truncated cylinders utilizing the cloaking phenomenon is studied two kinds of defects of the outer cylinders including the draft and location defects are studied to investigate their effects on the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders and the wave drift force of the inner cylinder respectively the wave interaction theory combined with higher order boundary element method is adopted to solve this wave structure interaction problem the defect effects are firstly studied at the cloaking wavenumber in which a symmetry phenomenon of the defect effects on the scattered wave energy is found then the investigation on the defect effects is carried out for a wide range of wavenumbers a wavenumber offset phenomenon of the minimum wave drift force on the inner cylinder caused by the location defects is observed finally the location defect of the entire outer cylinders is adopted to reduce the wave drift force on the inner cylinder at various wavenumbers keywords multiple floating bodies wave drift force defect effects cloaking phenomenon wave interaction theory 1 introduction offshore structures always face to the threats of ocean waves therefore protection of floating structures in waves has attracted attentions by many researchers for a long time among different threats wave drift force second order steady forces is a significant environmental factor which can damage the mooring system of floating structures instead of passively strengthening the mooring system the mooring lines can be radically protected by directly reducing the wave drift forces acting on the floating body utilizing the so called cloaking phenomenon in wave structure interaction problems cloaking means that there is no disturbed outgoing waves radiating to far field pendry et al 2006 originally proposed to cloak a body by controlling the electromagnetic waves propagating along the certain routes to avoid the space that the structure located therefore the body is invisible to the observer due to no wave scatters then cloaking phenomenon was firstly introduced to liquid waves in farhat et al 2009 by designing the viscosity of the liquid farhat et al 2009 successfully cloak a body both in numerical and experimental methods obviously no wave load including the drift force acts on the cloaked body due to that the waves propagate around the body for water waves however cloaking a body by designing the viscosity of the fluid is difficult to cloak a body in water waves besides directly controlling the wave propagation path elimination of the scattered waves of a body is an effective method generally the elimination of the scattered waves for a body in waves can be achieved by changing topography or attaching encircled bodies porter 2011 firstly proposed to eliminate the scattered waves of a vertical cylinder in shallow waters by optimizing the topography in the region surrounding this cylinder under mild slope approximation numerical results showed that the scattered wave energy of the vertical cylinder tends to be zero at a certain wavenumber with proper topography which means almost no scattered waves of the vertical cylinder radiate to infinity the results obtained in porter 2011 were then validated by a three dimensional boundary element method in newman 2012 while a practical application in reducing the wave drift force on the cylinder was proposed by porter and newman 2014 to get rid of the limitation of the water depth newman 2013 2014 put forward to respectively attach an array of small cylinders or a continuous ring to eliminate the scattered waves of a truncated cylinder in diffraction problem with the optimized dimensions of these small additional cylinders or continuous ring the scattered wave energy and the wave drift forces on the whole structure can be reduced to almost zero at a certain wavenumber using the cloaking configuration proposed in newman 2013 that a truncated cylinder surrounded by several small cylinders iida et al 2014 2015 numerically and experimentally certified that not only the wave drift force on the whole structure but also on the inner truncated cylinder can be significantly reduced to almost zero a further experimental research on the cloaking phenomenon of a truncated cylinder surrounded by eight outer cylinders was conducted by read et al 2016 to investigate the unexplored factors which affect the measurements then zhang et al 2019 numerically and experimentally investigated the wave direction effects on the wave drift force acting on a truncated cylinder at the cloaking mode it was found that the effects of the wave direction on the wave drift force of the inner cylinder is negligible if the number of the outer cylinders is more than eight considering the arrangements that a fixed truncated cylinder surrounded by a circumferential array of several cylinders zhang et al 2017 firstly found a quasi cloaking phenomenon that a periodical reduction of wave drift force during changing the distance between the inner cylinder and the outer cylinders the way of attaching bodies to reduce the wave drift force on a truncated cylinder was also extended to radiation problems miki et al 2016 attached eight truncated cylinders with only heave motion to cloak a free oscillating truncated cylinder almost no disturbed waves scattered waves and radiation waves propagates to infinity and the wave drift forces on the cloaked inner cylinder are minimized to almost zero with proper heave motion of the outer cylinders controlled by an external dynamic system instead of using multiple rigid truncated cylinders loukogeorgaki and kashiwagi 2019 minimized the wave drift force on an oscillating cylinder by surrounding it with an annular flexible plate with proper flexural rigidity of the annular plate the wave drift force on the inner oscillating cylinder can be reduced to almost zero at a specific wavenumber above all optimizing the dimension or flexural rigidity of the additional bodies to excite the cloaking mode is a significant method to reduce the wave drift force on the marine structure however some shortcomings of this method go against the further practical application in ocean engineering such as the strict correspondence between the optimized configuration of the additional bodies and the target wavenumber on the one hand some structural defects of the optimized additional bodies generated in the process of transportation or working may make the additional bodies failure in reducing the wave drift force on the inner structure for a specific wavenumber here structure defects mean any dimensional change of the optimized configuration one the other hand optimized additional bodies obtained for a specific wavenumber may not work at other wavenumbers motivated by improving the engineering applicability of the cloaking phenomenon using additional bodies to reduce the wave drift force on the marine structure in the present paper the arrangement that a fixed truncated cylinder surrounded by eight fixed truncated cylinder is studied the cloaking configuration of these eight cylinders for a specific wavenumber is obtained using a real coded genetic algorithm rcga developed in zhang et al 2018 first the structural defects of the outer cylinders including draft defects and location defects are introduced to cloaking phenomenon for water waves the scattered wave energy of all cylinders the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder and the corresponding spatial distribution of wave elevations with various structural defects at the cloaking wavenumber are analyzed it is found that the corresponding lee side outer cylinder and weather side cylinder have the same defect effects on the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders then the defect effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors of the cylinders array are investigated at other wavenumbers a wavenumner offset phenomenon is observed for the minimum wave drift forces on the inner cylinder with the location defect finally the location defects of the outer cylinders are successfully utilized to minimize the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder at various wavenumbers 2 theory an arrangement that a fixed truncated cylinder regularly surrounded by eight fixed truncated cylinders is considered as shown in fig 1 the origin of coordinate system o xyz is spaced on the origin of the inner cylinder and on the undisturbed free surface the positive z axis is downward the incident wave comes from the direction of the negative x axis both the diameter and the draft of the inner cylinder are normalized to unity 2r 0 1 0 and d 0 1 0 the radius and the draft of each outer cylinder are denoted by r i i 1 2 8 and d i i 1 2 8 respectively while the distance between each outer cylinder and the inner cylinder is denoted by l i i 1 2 8 this wave structure interaction problem is solved based on the potential theory while the laplace s equation is taken as the governing equation of the fluid field to establish this boundary value problem with linearized boundary conditions besides the global coordinate system o xyz the local coordinate systems o n x n y n z n n 0 1 2 8 fixed at the center of the n th cylinder is used based on the principle of linear superposition the velocity potential can be expressed as follows 1 φ x y z t re g ζ 0 i ω ϕ p e i ω t where 2 ϕ p ϕ i p ψ p here re in eq 1 means the real part to be taken ω and ζ 0 denote the circular frequency and amplitude of the incident waves respectively g is the gravitational acceleration p r θ z is a field point in the flow in eq 2 ϕ p is the sum of the incident wave potential ϕ i p and disturbance potential ψ p the incident wave potential ϕ i p can be introduced in cylindrical coordinate as follows 3 ϕ i p cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e

denoted by j m k 0 r the disturbance potential due to the presence of multiple floating bodies in the incident waves is denoted as ψ p as derived in kagemoto and yue 1986 the total disturbance potential ψ p for nine cylinders one inner and eight outer cylinders can be expressed as 6 ψ p n 0 8 ψ n p n 0 8 l a l n z 0 z h l 2 k 0 r n e i l θ n only progressive waves are considered in eq 6 and the evanescent waves are neglected for brevity here a l n denotes the complex amplitude of the scattered progressive waves around the n th cylinder a l n can be solved by a higher order boundary element method reported in kashiwagi 1995 the second kind of hankel function of order l is denoted by h l 2 k 0 r n rewriting the disturbance potential in the global cylindrical coordinate systems using the graf s addition theorem for bessel function ψ p can be given in the following form 7 ψ p m a m z 0 z h m 2 k 0 r e i m θ where 8 a m n 0 8 l a l n j l m k 0 l n o e i l m α n o then the entire velocity can be introduced as the sum of the incident wave potential and the disturbance wave potential 9 ϕ p ϕ i p ψ p m α m j m k 0 r a m h m 2 k 0 r z 0 z e i m θ based on the velocity

the wave drift force acting on the n th cylinder can be written as 14 f x n i f y n ρ g ζ 0 2 d 0 2 i c 0 k d 0 m 2 a m n a m 1 n α m 1 n k 0 k n 8 a m 1 k n a m n α m n k 1 k n 9 a m k n a m 1 n where 15 c 0 k 0 k k 0 2 k 2 h here the asterisk in the superscript denotes the complex conjugate the wave elevation can be obtained by the velocity potential the velocity potential can be expressed as following equation 16 φ re g η 0 2 i ω ϕ e i ω t based on the dynamic condition the wave elevation η can be obtained as 17 η p re η 0 ϕ e i ω t by dividing the velocity potential into two parts real part and imaginary part the velocity potential can be written in the form of ϕ ϕ c iϕ s and the wave elevation can be expressed as 18 η η 0 re ϕ c i ϕ s e i ω t ϕ c 2 ϕ s 2 cos ω t arctan ϕ s ϕ c η cos ω t arctan ϕ s ϕ c here η denotes the non dimensional wave elevation 3 results and discussion assuming the outer cylinders are identical thus the dimensions of outer cylinders can be respectively dented as r outer d outer and l outer here r n r outer d n d outer l n l outer n 1 2 8 the cloaking configuration of the cylinder array as shown in fig 1 is obtained by optimizing the dimensions r outer d outer l outer of the outer cylinders using rcga developed in zhang et al 2018 to minimize the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders at nondimensional wavenumber k kd 0 1 0 the water depth h is set as 5π which satisfies the deep water condition the optimized results are shown in table 1 in table 1 e single and f single f x sin g l e 2 f y sin g l e 2 respectively mean the scattered wave energy and the wave drift force of the single inner cylinder with no outer cylinders while e s opt and f 0 opt respectively mean the optimized scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders and the optimized wave drift force on the inner cylinder from the small attenuation ratios e s opt e single and f 0 opt f single it can be found that the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder are significantly reduced with the cloaking configuration 3 1 defect effects at cloaking wavenumber as shown in fig 2 two kinds of defects of the outer cylinders including a draft defect and a location defect are considered to investigate the defect effects on e s and f 0 at cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 in fig 2 the outer cylinder drawn by solid line denotes the cloaking configuration while the dashed line denotes the possible location of the outer cylinder the draft defects of each individual outer cylinder and of the entire outer cylinders are respectively studied while the location defects are investigated only for entire outer cylinders due to the symmetry about x axis of the entire cylinders array only the draft defects of half outer cylinders numbered from 1 to 4 were studied the draft defects of outer cylinders were defined as d i d i d outer opt i 1 2 3 4 outer here i means the i th outer cylinder and i equal to outer means the outer cylinders are identical moreover d i means the draft of the i th outer cylinders and d outer opt equals to 0 4765 showing in table 1 for example d 1 means that only the no 1 cylinder has a draft defect while d outer means that entire outer cylinders simultaneously have a same draft defect looking at fig 2 b the location defects of entire outer cylinders are defined as s j j 1 2 3 4 5 which means the migration distance of the outer cylinders the direction number of the location defects is denoted as j here j 1 and j 5 respectively denote the direction towards negative x axis and positive x axis while the angle between two adjacent directions is 45 first the draft defects of each outer cylinder and of entire outer cylinders were studied in the range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer the scattered wave energy e s was calculated with different draft defects as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 d i equaled to 0 0 i 1 2 3 4 outer indicate no draft defects it can be found that the draft defect of the entire outer cylinders performs a more significant effect on e s than a corresponding defect of any individual outer cylinder at d outer 0 4 the scatted wave energy e s 0 0786 is even larger than the scattered wave energy of a single inner cylinder e single 0 0728 which means the additional outer cylinders can not cloak the inner cylinder with these draft defects in fig 3 it can be observed that the effects of draft defects on e s are symmetric about the y axis in other words a draft defect of no 1 or no 2 cylinder has the same effects on e s as a corresponding defect of no 4 or no 3 cylinder respectively however the largest scattered wave energy e s 0 0054 in the range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 can be found at d 1 d 4 0 4 and it is still obviously smaller than the scattered wave energy of the single inner cylinder e single 0 0728 besides a negative draft defect for both the entire outer cylinders and any individual outer cylinder has more significant effects on e s than a corresponding positive draft defect the spatial distribution of scattered waves η s c a t t e r e d was then calculated with some typical draft defects d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer as shown in fig 4 to further investigate the effects of the draft defect on e s it should be noted that the outer cylinder with draft defects is marked in black two upper subgraphs respectively present the scattered wave distribution of the single inner cylinder and the cloaking mode non defects comparing with the results of the single inner cylinder few scattered waves exist outside the cylinder array for the cloaking mode the middle eight subgraphs show the results of d 1 0 4 d 2 0 4 d 3 0 4 and d 4 0 4 by comparing with the results of the cloaking mode it can be found that the increment of scattered waves outside the cylinder array is not obvious however looking the lower two subgraphs lots of scattered waves exist outside the cylinder array which means the draft defects of the entire outer cylinders break the cloaking mode as mentioned in fig 3 the scattered wave energy e s of d 1 0 4 should be equal to that of d 4 0 4 however the scattered waves distribution of d 1 0 4 are not absolutely identical with that of d 4 0 4 this phenomenon can be observed for other three pairs d 1 0 4 and d 4 0 4 d 2 0 4 and d 3 0 4 d 2 0 4 and d 3 0 4 the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder f 0 were calculated with different draft defects as shown in fig 5 it can be found from fig 5 that a draft defect of entire outer cylinders also perform a more significant effect on f 0 than a corresponding defect of any individual outer cylinder at most range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer the largest wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 0 0235 in the range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer can be found at d outer 0 4 and it is still obviously smaller than the wave drift force on the single inner cylinder f single 0 1192 which means the draft defects of outer cylinders perform an insignificant effect on f 0 no symmetrical effects of draft defect on f 0 can be found in fig 5 moreover a minimal f 0 can be found at d outer 0 1 which means the wave drift force on the inner cylinder can be further reduced by slightly adjusting the draft of entire outer cylinders based on the cloaking configuration fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of the free surface elevation η w a t e r at k 1 0 corresponding to several typical draft defects d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer the upper two subgraphs respectively present the free surface elevation distributions of the single inner cylinder and the cylinder array at the cloaking mode comparing with the results of the single cylinder it can be found that the free surface at upstream and downstream of the inner cylinder for cloaking mode is almost symmetric about y axis which contributes to the minimal wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder the middle eight subgraphs show the results of d 1 0 4 d 2 0 4 d 3 0 4 and d 4 0 4 by comparing with the results of the cloaking mode it can be found that the symmetry of the free surface between the upstream and downstream of the inner cylinder is slightly broken looking the lower two subgraphs the wave elevation in the lee side of the inner cylinder for d outer 0 1 becomes a little smaller which leads to a little increment of f 0 shown in fig 5 generally the draft defects of the outer cylinders individual outer cylinder and entire outer cylinders do not significantly break the symmetrical distribution of the free surface in the two sides of the inner cylinder secondly the location defects of entire outer cylinders were studied in the range of 0 0 s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 the scattered wave energy e s was calculated with different location defects as shown in fig 7 in fig 7 s j equaled to 0 0 j 1 2 3 4 5 indicates no location defects the effects of the location defect on e s are also symmetric about the y axis for example a location defect in direction 1 has the same effect on e s as a corresponding defect in direction 5 the same relation is also found for direction 2 and direction 4 moreover the scattered wave energy increases as the increment of location defects besides the location defects in x axis direction direction 1 and direction 5 perform the most significant effects on e s while the location defects in y axis direction direction 3 perform an insignificant effects on e s at s 1 s 5 0 5 the scatted wave energy e s 0 0779 is larger than the scattered wave energy of the single inner cylinder e single 0 0728 which means the cloaking mode is broken fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of scattered waves with several typical location defects s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 looking at the results of s 1 s 5 0 5 the quantities of the scattered waves outside the cylinder array are of the same order as those observed in the case of the single inner cylinder shown in fig 4 a therefore the cloaking configuration fails to cloak the inner cylinder with the location defects s 1 s 5 0 5 however for s 3 0 5 the quantities of the scattered waves outside the cylinder array are of the same order as those observed in the cloaking mode shown in fig 4 which means the additional cylinders with location defects in direction 3 can also effectively cloak the inner cylinder to some extent then the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder f 0 were calculated with various location defects as shown in fig 9 in fig 9 it can be found that the effects of location defects on f 0 are not symmetrical about y axis besides the location defects in direction 5 and 4 have more significant effects on f 0 than that in directions 1 and 2 the location defects in direction 3 perform the most insignificant effects on f 0 the largest wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 0 0779 in the range of 0 0 s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 can be found at s 5 0 5 and it is about 65 of the wave drift force on the single inner cylinder f single 0 1192 which means the draft defects in direction 5 should be carefully considered fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the free surface η w a t e r at k 1 0 with some typical draft location s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 seeing the results of s 5 0 5 the wave amplitude in the weather side of the inner cylinder is obviously larger than that in the lee side which causes the larger wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder shown in fig 9 the symmetry of the free surface between the two sides of inner cylinder for s 3 0 3 are quite well it can be concluded that the defect effects on f 0 are intimately related to the spatial distribution of free surface in the upstream and downstream of the inner cylinder thirdly to compare the defect effects between draft defects and location defects the values of e s and f 0 at k 1 0 for the typical defects are listed in table 2 defect cases of d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer and s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 are chosen as the typical defects the values of e s and f 0 for cloaking mode and the case of the single inner cylinder are also presented for reference utilizing the values in table 2 the results of e s and f 0 are respectively plotted as bar charts in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows the scattered wave energy e s with these typical defects the symmetry about y axis of the defect effects of outer cylinders on e s can be found both the draft defects and the location defects performing the same effects on e s are connected using solid line as mentioned in fig 3 the draft defects of any individual outer cylinder has insignificant effects on e s while the draft defects of the entire outer cylinders perform significant effects on e s for d outer 0 4 the scattered wave energy e s 0 0786 is even larger than the scattered wave energy of the single cylinder e single 0 0728 which means that the additional outer cylinders can not cloak the inner cylinder with this draft defect besides the location defects in x axis direction direction 1 and direction 5 perform the most significant effects on e s while the location defects in y axis direction direction 3 perform an insignificant effect on e s fig 12 shows the wave drift forces on the inner cylinder f 0 with these typical defects no symmetrical effects about y axis of these defects on f 0 can be found different with the effects on e s the draft defects of the entire outer cylinders perform an insignificant effect on f 0 however same with the effects on e s the location defects in direction 3 also perform the most insignificant effects on f 0 among different defect directions 3 2 defect effects at other wavenumbers the defect effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors of this cloaking configuration shown in table 1 were further investigated for other wavenumnbers the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 with several typical defects presented in table 2 were studied and compared with those for the non defective structure cloaking mode firstly the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 with d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer were calculated at various wavenumbers as shown in figs 13 and 14 fig 13 a shows the results of e s with draft defects of individual outer cylinder the defect effects of the individual outer cylinders on e s are again found to be symmetrical about the y axis at other wavenumbers for example draft defects of d 1 0 4 and d 4 0 4 have the same effects on e s at various wavenumbers fig 13 b shows the results of f 0 with draft defects of individual outer cylinder no symmetrical effects about y axis of the draft defects on f 0 are found generally seeing fig 13 the draft defects of individual outer cylinder perform an insignificant effect on e s and f 0 not only at the cloaking wavenumber but also at other wavenumbers fig 14 a and 14 b respectively show the results of e s and f 0 with the draft defects of entire outer cylinders the draft defects of entire outer cylinders have more obvious effects on e s and f 0 than that of individual outer cylinder moreover a draft defect of entire outer cylinder has a more significant effect on e s and f 0 at larger wavenumbers shorter waves secondly the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 with sj 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 were calculated at various wavenumbers as shown in fig 15 fig 15 a shows the results of e s with location defects of entire outer cylinders it is again observed that the defect effects of the individual outer cylinder on e s are symmetrical about the y axis at other wavenumbers for example location defects of s 1 0 5 and s 5 0 5 have the same effects on e s at various wavenumbers fig 15 b shows the results of f 0 with location defects of entire outer cylinders no symmetrical effects about y axis of location defects on f 0 are found comparing the results with the cloaking case the location defects on direction 3 perform insignificant effects on f 0 not only at k 1 0 but also at other wavenumbers while the location defects on other directions perform an obvious effect on f 0 at various wavenumbers in fig 15 b a wavenumber offset phenomenon for the minimal wave drift force on the inner cylinder with s 1 s 5 0 5 can be observed with s 1 0 5 f 0 reaches a minimum at approximately k 1 2 in other words the wavenumber corresponding to minimum f 0 is changed from k 1 0 to k 1 2 by this location defect s 1 0 5 of the entire outer cylinders similarly the results indicate that with s 5 1 0 the wavenumber corresponding to minimum f 0 is changed to approximately k 0 7 based on this interesting phenomenon the wavenumber of the minimum f 0 can be controlled by introducing a location defect of the entire outer cylinders to adapt to different wave conditions 4 reduction of f 0 at various wavenumbers using location defects as mentioned in fig 15 b a wavenumber offset phenomenon for the minimum f 0 can be observed with a location defect of entire outer cylinders therefore to make an optimized configuration obtained for a certain wavenumber also available for other wavenumbers the location defects of the entire outer cylinders are introduced to reduce the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 thus based on the optimized configuration obtained for k 1 0 shown in table 1 the wave drift forces on the inner cylinder f 0 k s x axis were calculated at different wavenumbers for various location defects in x axis direction s x axis fig 16 shows the attenuation ratios of the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 k s x axis f single k at different k values for various s x axis values here f single k denotes the wave drift force for the single inner cylinder at wavenumber k values of f 0 k s x axis f single k that less than 0 3 are shown in fig 16 in fig 16 negative s x axis denotes the location defects in negative x axis direction while the positive s x axis denotes the location defects in positive x axis direction it can be found that the value of f 0 k s x axis f single k at k 1 0 and s x axis 0 0 which corresponds to the cloaking mode non defect for k 1 0 is almost zero moreover for each wavenumber a minimum value of f 0 k s x axis f single k can be obtained with a proper value of s x axis although the absolute zero value of f 0 k s x axis f single k for a particular wavenumber can not be realized using a location defect of the entire outer cylinders the wave drift force on the inner cylinder can be significantly reduced with a proper value of s x axis for example f 0 1 4 0 8 f single 1 4 0 03 is the minimum value for k 1 4 which means that the wave drift force on the inner cylinder can be practically reduced at k 1 4 with s x axis 0 8 the values of f 0 k s x axis f single k can be smaller than 0 3 in the approximate range of 0 5 k 2 0 with proper values of s x axis in the range of 1 0 s x axis 1 0 moreover the proper value of s x axis for a certain wavenumber decreases as k increases therefore the wavenumber corresponding to minimum wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder can be controlled using the location defects in x axis direction of entire outer cylinders 5 conclusions the reduction of the wave drift force on an inner fixed truncated cylinder surrounded by eight additional truncated cylinders utilizing the cloaking phenomenon was considered in this paper the cloaking configuration of these multiple cylinders for a certain wavenumber k 1 0 was obtained using a rcga optimization scheme two kind of structural defects of the additional outer cylinders including the draft defects and the location defects were introduced to study their effects on the scattered wave energy e s the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder f 0 and the corresponding wave pattern η 1 the defect effects were firstly studied at cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 a symmetrical effect about y axis of the draft defect of individual outer cylinder on e s was found for reducing the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 by cloaking phenomenon the draft defects of individual outer cylinder are ignorable while the location defects of outer cylinders should be carefully considered these defect effects on f 0 are intimately related to the spatial distribution of free surface elevation in the weather side and lee side of the inner cylinder 2 then the defect effects were studied at other wavenumbers the symmetry about y axis of the draft defect of each outer cylinder on e s was also found at other wavenumbers in addition a wavenumber offset phenomenon of the minimum f 0 was observed which provides the potential to control the wavenumber of the minimum f 0 3 at last a location defect of the entire outer cylinders was introduced to make an optimized configuration obtained for a certain wavenumber can work for a wide frequency band it was found that the reduction of f 0 in a wide frequency band can be realized by changing the location of the entire outer cylinders in x axis direction which provides a practical method to promote the applications of cloaking phenomenon in ocean engineering credit authorship contribution statement zhigang

21937,the reduction of wave drift forces acting on a fixed inner truncated cylinder surrounded by several additional truncated cylinders utilizing the cloaking phenomenon is studied two kinds of defects of the outer cylinders including the draft and location defects are studied to investigate their effects on the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders and the wave drift force of the inner cylinder respectively the wave interaction theory combined with higher order boundary element method is adopted to solve this wave structure interaction problem the defect effects are firstly studied at the cloaking wavenumber in which a symmetry phenomenon of the defect effects on the scattered wave energy is found then the investigation on the defect effects is carried out for a wide range of wavenumbers a wavenumber offset phenomenon of the minimum wave drift force on the inner cylinder caused by the location defects is observed finally the location defect of the entire outer cylinders is adopted to reduce the wave drift force on the inner cylinder at various wavenumbers keywords multiple floating bodies wave drift force defect effects cloaking phenomenon wave interaction theory 1 introduction offshore structures always face to the threats of ocean waves therefore protection of floating structures in waves has attracted attentions by many researchers for a long time among different threats wave drift force second order steady forces is a significant environmental factor which can damage the mooring system of floating structures instead of passively strengthening the mooring system the mooring lines can be radically protected by directly reducing the wave drift forces acting on the floating body utilizing the so called cloaking phenomenon in wave structure interaction problems cloaking means that there is no disturbed outgoing waves radiating to far field pendry et al 2006 originally proposed to cloak a body by controlling the electromagnetic waves propagating along the certain routes to avoid the space that the structure located therefore the body is invisible to the observer due to no wave scatters then cloaking phenomenon was firstly introduced to liquid waves in farhat et al 2009 by designing the viscosity of the liquid farhat et al 2009 successfully cloak a body both in numerical and experimental methods obviously no wave load including the drift force acts on the cloaked body due to that the waves propagate around the body for water waves however cloaking a body by designing the viscosity of the fluid is difficult to cloak a body in water waves besides directly controlling the wave propagation path elimination of the scattered waves of a body is an effective method generally the elimination of the scattered waves for a body in waves can be achieved by changing topography or attaching encircled bodies porter 2011 firstly proposed to eliminate the scattered waves of a vertical cylinder in shallow waters by optimizing the topography in the region surrounding this cylinder under mild slope approximation numerical results showed that the scattered wave energy of the vertical cylinder tends to be zero at a certain wavenumber with proper topography which means almost no scattered waves of the vertical cylinder radiate to infinity the results obtained in porter 2011 were then validated by a three dimensional boundary element method in newman 2012 while a practical application in reducing the wave drift force on the cylinder was proposed by porter and newman 2014 to get rid of the limitation of the water depth newman 2013 2014 put forward to respectively attach an array of small cylinders or a continuous ring to eliminate the scattered waves of a truncated cylinder in diffraction problem with the optimized dimensions of these small additional cylinders or continuous ring the scattered wave energy and the wave drift forces on the whole structure can be reduced to almost zero at a certain wavenumber using the cloaking configuration proposed in newman 2013 that a truncated cylinder surrounded by several small cylinders iida et al 2014 2015 numerically and experimentally certified that not only the wave drift force on the whole structure but also on the inner truncated cylinder can be significantly reduced to almost zero a further experimental research on the cloaking phenomenon of a truncated cylinder surrounded by eight outer cylinders was conducted by read et al 2016 to investigate the unexplored factors which affect the measurements then zhang et al 2019 numerically and experimentally investigated the wave direction effects on the wave drift force acting on a truncated cylinder at the cloaking mode it was found that the effects of the wave direction on the wave drift force of the inner cylinder is negligible if the number of the outer cylinders is more than eight considering the arrangements that a fixed truncated cylinder surrounded by a circumferential array of several cylinders zhang et al 2017 firstly found a quasi cloaking phenomenon that a periodical reduction of wave drift force during changing the distance between the inner cylinder and the outer cylinders the way of attaching bodies to reduce the wave drift force on a truncated cylinder was also extended to radiation problems miki et al 2016 attached eight truncated cylinders with only heave motion to cloak a free oscillating truncated cylinder almost no disturbed waves scattered waves and radiation waves propagates to infinity and the wave drift forces on the cloaked inner cylinder are minimized to almost zero with proper heave motion of the outer cylinders controlled by an external dynamic system instead of using multiple rigid truncated cylinders loukogeorgaki and kashiwagi 2019 minimized the wave drift force on an oscillating cylinder by surrounding it with an annular flexible plate with proper flexural rigidity of the annular plate the wave drift force on the inner oscillating cylinder can be reduced to almost zero at a specific wavenumber above all optimizing the dimension or flexural rigidity of the additional bodies to excite the cloaking mode is a significant method to reduce the wave drift force on the marine structure however some shortcomings of this method go against the further practical application in ocean engineering such as the strict correspondence between the optimized configuration of the additional bodies and the target wavenumber on the one hand some structural defects of the optimized additional bodies generated in the process of transportation or working may make the additional bodies failure in reducing the wave drift force on the inner structure for a specific wavenumber here structure defects mean any dimensional change of the optimized configuration one the other hand optimized additional bodies obtained for a specific wavenumber may not work at other wavenumbers motivated by improving the engineering applicability of the cloaking phenomenon using additional bodies to reduce the wave drift force on the marine structure in the present paper the arrangement that a fixed truncated cylinder surrounded by eight fixed truncated cylinder is studied the cloaking configuration of these eight cylinders for a specific wavenumber is obtained using a real coded genetic algorithm rcga developed in zhang et al 2018 first the structural defects of the outer cylinders including draft defects and location defects are introduced to cloaking phenomenon for water waves the scattered wave energy of all cylinders the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder and the corresponding spatial distribution of wave elevations with various structural defects at the cloaking wavenumber are analyzed it is found that the corresponding lee side outer cylinder and weather side cylinder have the same defect effects on the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders then the defect effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors of the cylinders array are investigated at other wavenumbers a wavenumner offset phenomenon is observed for the minimum wave drift forces on the inner cylinder with the location defect finally the location defects of the outer cylinders are successfully utilized to minimize the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder at various wavenumbers 2 theory an arrangement that a fixed truncated cylinder regularly surrounded by eight fixed truncated cylinders is considered as shown in fig 1 the origin of coordinate system o xyz is spaced on the origin of the inner cylinder and on the undisturbed free surface the positive z axis is downward the incident wave comes from the direction of the negative x axis both the diameter and the draft of the inner cylinder are normalized to unity 2r 0 1 0 and d 0 1 0 the radius and the draft of each outer cylinder are denoted by r i i 1 2 8 and d i i 1 2 8 respectively while the distance between each outer cylinder and the inner cylinder is denoted by l i i 1 2 8 this wave structure interaction problem is solved based on the potential theory while the laplace s equation is taken as the governing equation of the fluid field to establish this boundary value problem with linearized boundary conditions besides the global coordinate system o xyz the local coordinate systems o n x n y n z n n 0 1 2 8 fixed at the center of the n th cylinder is used based on the principle of linear superposition the velocity potential can be expressed as follows 1 φ x y z t re g ζ 0 i ω ϕ p e i ω t where 2 ϕ p ϕ i p ψ p here re in eq 1 means the real part to be taken ω and ζ 0 denote the circular frequency and amplitude of the incident waves respectively g is the gravitational acceleration p r θ z is a field point in the flow in eq 2 ϕ p is the sum of the incident wave potential ϕ i p and disturbance potential ψ p the incident wave potential ϕ i p can be introduced in cylindrical coordinate as follows 3 ϕ i p cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x m α m z 0 z j m k 0 r e i m θ where 4 α m e i m π 2 z 0 z cosh k 0 z h cos k 0 h 5 k ω 2 g k 0 tanh k 0 h here h denotes the water depth the bessel function of the first kind of order m is denoted by j m k 0 r the disturbance potential due to the presence of multiple floating bodies in the incident waves is denoted as ψ p as derived in kagemoto and yue 1986 the total disturbance potential ψ p for nine cylinders one inner and eight outer cylinders can be expressed as 6 ψ p n 0 8 ψ n p n 0 8 l a l n z 0 z h l 2 k 0 r n e i l θ n only progressive waves are considered in eq 6 and the evanescent waves are neglected for brevity here a l n denotes the complex amplitude of the scattered progressive waves around the n th cylinder a l n can be solved by a higher order boundary element method reported in kashiwagi 1995 the second kind of hankel function of order l is denoted by h l 2 k 0 r n rewriting the disturbance potential in the global cylindrical coordinate systems using the graf s addition theorem for bessel function ψ p can be given in the following form 7 ψ p m a m z 0 z h m 2 k 0 r e i m θ where 8 a m n 0 8 l a l n j l m k 0 l n o e i l m α n o then the entire velocity can be introduced as the sum of the incident wave potential and the disturbance wave potential 9 ϕ p ϕ i p ψ p m α m j m k 0 r a m h m 2 k 0 r z 0 z e i m θ based on the velocity potential expressed in cylindrical coordinate systems the wave drift force can be obtained using the far field method initiated by maruo 1960 10 f x t o t a l i f y t o t a l ρ g ζ 0 2 d 0 2 i c 0 k d 0 m 2 a m a m 1 α m a m 1 α m 1 a m performing the same analytical method in the n th local coordinate system the velocity potential around the n th cylinder can be written as follows 11 ϕ n p ψ i n p

the wave drift force acting on the n th cylinder can be written as 14 f x n i f y n ρ g ζ 0 2 d 0 2 i c 0 k d 0 m 2 a m n a m 1 n α m 1 n k 0 k n 8 a m 1 k n a m n α m n k 1 k n 9 a m k n a m 1 n where 15 c 0 k 0 k k 0 2 k 2 h here the asterisk in the superscript denotes the complex conjugate the wave elevation can be obtained by the velocity potential the velocity potential can be expressed as following equation 16 φ re g η 0 2 i ω ϕ e i ω t based on the dynamic condition the wave elevation η can be obtained as 17 η p re η 0 ϕ e i ω t by dividing the velocity potential into two parts real part and imaginary part the velocity potential can be written in the form of ϕ ϕ c iϕ s and the wave elevation can be expressed as 18 η η 0 re ϕ c i ϕ s e i ω t ϕ c 2 ϕ s 2 cos ω t arctan ϕ s ϕ c η cos ω t arctan ϕ s ϕ c here η denotes the non dimensional wave elevation 3 results and discussion assuming the outer cylinders are identical thus the dimensions of outer cylinders can be respectively dented as r outer d outer and l outer here r n r outer d n d outer l n l outer n 1 2 8 the cloaking configuration of the cylinder array as shown in fig 1 is obtained by optimizing the dimensions r outer d outer l outer of the outer cylinders using rcga developed in zhang et al 2018 to minimize the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders at nondimensional wavenumber k kd 0 1 0 the water depth h is set as 5π which satisfies the deep water condition the optimized results are shown in table 1 in table 1 e single and f single f x sin g l e 2 f y sin g l e 2 respectively mean the scattered wave energy and the wave drift force of the single inner cylinder with no outer cylinders while e s opt and f 0 opt respectively mean the optimized scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders and the optimized wave drift force on the inner cylinder from the small attenuation ratios e s opt e single and f 0 opt f single it can be found that the scattered wave energy of the entire cylinders and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder are significantly reduced with the cloaking configuration 3 1 defect effects at cloaking wavenumber as shown in fig 2 two kinds of defects of the outer cylinders including a draft defect and a location defect are considered to investigate the defect effects on e s and f 0 at cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 in fig 2 the outer cylinder drawn by solid line denotes the cloaking configuration while the dashed line denotes the possible location of the outer cylinder the draft defects of each individual outer cylinder and of the entire outer cylinders are respectively studied while the location defects are investigated only for entire outer cylinders due to the symmetry about x axis of the entire cylinders array only the draft defects of half outer cylinders numbered from 1 to 4 were studied the draft defects of outer cylinders were defined as d i d i d outer opt i 1 2 3 4 outer here i means the i th outer cylinder and i equal to outer means the outer cylinders are identical moreover d i means the draft of the i th outer cylinders and d outer opt equals to 0 4765 showing in table 1 for example d 1 means that only the no 1 cylinder has a draft defect while d outer means that entire outer cylinders simultaneously have a same draft defect looking at fig 2 b the location defects of entire outer cylinders are defined as s j j 1 2 3 4 5 which means the migration distance of the outer cylinders the direction number of the location defects is denoted as j here j 1 and j 5 respectively denote the direction towards negative x axis and positive x axis while the angle between two adjacent directions is 45 first the draft defects of each outer cylinder and of entire outer cylinders were studied in the range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer the scattered wave energy e s was calculated with different draft defects as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 d i equaled to 0 0 i 1 2 3 4 outer indicate no draft defects it can be found that the draft defect of the entire outer cylinders performs a more significant effect on e s than a corresponding defect of any individual outer cylinder at d outer 0 4 the scatted wave energy e s 0 0786 is even larger than the scattered wave energy of a single inner cylinder e single 0 0728 which means the additional outer cylinders can not cloak the inner cylinder with these draft defects in fig 3 it can be observed that the effects of draft defects on e s are symmetric about the y axis in other words a draft defect of no 1 or no 2 cylinder has the same effects on e s as a corresponding defect of no 4 or no 3 cylinder respectively however the largest scattered wave energy e s 0 0054 in the range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 can be found at d 1 d 4 0 4 and it is still obviously smaller than the scattered wave energy of the single inner cylinder e single 0 0728 besides a negative draft defect for both the entire outer cylinders and any individual outer cylinder has more significant effects on e s than a corresponding positive draft defect the spatial distribution of scattered waves η s c a t t e r e d was then calculated with some typical draft defects d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer as shown in fig 4 to further investigate the effects of the draft defect on e s it should be noted that the outer cylinder with draft defects is marked in black two upper subgraphs respectively present the scattered wave distribution of the single inner cylinder and the cloaking mode non defects comparing with the results of the single inner cylinder few scattered waves exist outside the cylinder array for the cloaking mode the middle eight subgraphs show the results of d 1 0 4 d 2 0 4 d 3 0 4 and d 4 0 4 by comparing with the results of the cloaking mode it can be found that the increment of scattered waves outside the cylinder array is not obvious however looking the lower two subgraphs lots of scattered waves exist outside the cylinder array which means the draft defects of the entire outer cylinders break the cloaking mode as mentioned in fig 3 the scattered wave energy e s of d 1 0 4 should be equal to that of d 4 0 4 however the scattered waves distribution of d 1 0 4 are not absolutely identical with that of d 4 0 4 this phenomenon can be observed for other three pairs d 1 0 4 and d 4 0 4 d 2 0 4 and d 3 0 4 d 2 0 4 and d 3 0 4 the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder f 0 were calculated with different draft defects as shown in fig 5 it can be found from fig 5 that a draft defect of entire outer cylinders also perform a more significant effect on f 0 than a corresponding defect of any individual outer cylinder at most range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer the largest wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 0 0235 in the range of 0 4 d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer can be found at d outer 0 4 and it is still obviously smaller than the wave drift force on the single inner cylinder f single 0 1192 which means the draft defects of outer cylinders perform an insignificant effect on f 0 no symmetrical effects of draft defect on f 0 can be found in fig 5 moreover a minimal f 0 can be found at d outer 0 1 which means the wave drift force on the inner cylinder can be further reduced by slightly adjusting the draft of entire outer cylinders based on the cloaking configuration fig 6 presents the spatial distribution of the free surface elevation η w a t e r at k 1 0 corresponding to several typical draft defects d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer the upper two subgraphs respectively present the free surface elevation distributions of the single inner cylinder and the cylinder array at the cloaking mode comparing with the results of the single cylinder it can be found that the free surface at upstream and downstream of the inner cylinder for cloaking mode is almost symmetric about y axis which contributes to the minimal wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder the middle eight subgraphs show the results of d 1 0 4 d 2 0 4 d 3 0 4 and d 4 0 4 by comparing with the results of the cloaking mode it can be found that the symmetry of the free surface between the upstream and downstream of the inner cylinder is slightly broken looking the lower two subgraphs the wave elevation in the lee side of the inner cylinder for d outer 0 1 becomes a little smaller which leads to a little increment of f 0 shown in fig 5 generally the draft defects of the outer cylinders individual outer cylinder and entire outer cylinders do not significantly break the symmetrical distribution of the free surface in the two sides of the inner cylinder secondly the location defects of entire outer cylinders were studied in the range of 0 0 s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 the scattered wave energy e s was calculated with different location defects as shown in fig 7 in fig 7 s j equaled to 0 0 j 1 2 3 4 5 indicates no location defects the effects of the location defect on e s are also symmetric about the y axis for example a location defect in direction 1 has the same effect on e s as a corresponding defect in direction 5 the same relation is also found for direction 2 and direction 4 moreover the scattered wave energy increases as the increment of location defects besides the location defects in x axis direction direction 1 and direction 5 perform the most significant effects on e s while the location defects in y axis direction direction 3 perform an insignificant effects on e s at s 1 s 5 0 5 the scatted wave energy e s 0 0779 is larger than the scattered wave energy of the single inner cylinder e single 0 0728 which means the cloaking mode is broken fig 8 shows the spatial distribution of scattered waves with several typical location defects s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 looking at the results of s 1 s 5 0 5 the quantities of the scattered waves outside the cylinder array are of the same order as those observed in the case of the single inner cylinder shown in fig 4 a therefore the cloaking configuration fails to cloak the inner cylinder with the location defects s 1 s 5 0 5 however for s 3 0 5 the quantities of the scattered waves outside the cylinder array are of the same order as those observed in the cloaking mode shown in fig 4 which means the additional cylinders with location defects in direction 3 can also effectively cloak the inner cylinder to some extent then the wave drift forces acting on the inner cylinder f 0 were calculated with various location defects as shown in fig 9 in fig 9 it can be found that the effects of location defects on f 0 are not symmetrical about y axis besides the location defects in direction 5 and 4 have more significant effects on f 0 than that in directions 1 and 2 the location defects in direction 3 perform the most insignificant effects on f 0 the largest wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 0 0779 in the range of 0 0 s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 can be found at s 5 0 5 and it is about 65 of the wave drift force on the single inner cylinder f single 0 1192 which means the draft defects in direction 5 should be carefully considered fig 10 shows the spatial distribution of the free surface η w a t e r at k 1 0 with some typical draft location s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 seeing the results of s 5 0 5 the wave amplitude in the weather side of the inner cylinder is obviously larger than that in the lee side which causes the larger wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder shown in fig 9 the symmetry of the free surface between the two sides of inner cylinder for s 3 0 3 are quite well it can be concluded that the defect effects on f 0 are intimately related to the spatial distribution of free surface in the upstream and downstream of the inner cylinder thirdly to compare the defect effects between draft defects and location defects the values of e s and f 0 at k 1 0 for the typical defects are listed in table 2 defect cases of d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer and s j 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 are chosen as the typical defects the values of e s and f 0 for cloaking mode and the case of the single inner cylinder are also presented for reference utilizing the values in table 2 the results of e s and f 0 are respectively plotted as bar charts in figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows the scattered wave energy e s with these typical defects the symmetry about y axis of the defect effects of outer cylinders on e s can be found both the draft defects and the location defects performing the same effects on e s are connected using solid line as mentioned in fig 3 the draft defects of any individual outer cylinder has insignificant effects on e s while the draft defects of the entire outer cylinders perform significant effects on e s for d outer 0 4 the scattered wave energy e s 0 0786 is even larger than the scattered wave energy of the single cylinder e single 0 0728 which means that the additional outer cylinders can not cloak the inner cylinder with this draft defect besides the location defects in x axis direction direction 1 and direction 5 perform the most significant effects on e s while the location defects in y axis direction direction 3 perform an insignificant effect on e s fig 12 shows the wave drift forces on the inner cylinder f 0 with these typical defects no symmetrical effects about y axis of these defects on f 0 can be found different with the effects on e s the draft defects of the entire outer cylinders perform an insignificant effect on f 0 however same with the effects on e s the location defects in direction 3 also perform the most insignificant effects on f 0 among different defect directions 3 2 defect effects at other wavenumbers the defect effects on the hydrodynamic behaviors of this cloaking configuration shown in table 1 were further investigated for other wavenumnbers the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 with several typical defects presented in table 2 were studied and compared with those for the non defective structure cloaking mode firstly the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 with d i 0 4 i 1 2 3 4 outer were calculated at various wavenumbers as shown in figs 13 and 14 fig 13 a shows the results of e s with draft defects of individual outer cylinder the defect effects of the individual outer cylinders on e s are again found to be symmetrical about the y axis at other wavenumbers for example draft defects of d 1 0 4 and d 4 0 4 have the same effects on e s at various wavenumbers fig 13 b shows the results of f 0 with draft defects of individual outer cylinder no symmetrical effects about y axis of the draft defects on f 0 are found generally seeing fig 13 the draft defects of individual outer cylinder perform an insignificant effect on e s and f 0 not only at the cloaking wavenumber but also at other wavenumbers fig 14 a and 14 b respectively show the results of e s and f 0 with the draft defects of entire outer cylinders the draft defects of entire outer cylinders have more obvious effects on e s and f 0 than that of individual outer cylinder moreover a draft defect of entire outer cylinder has a more significant effect on e s and f 0 at larger wavenumbers shorter waves secondly the scattered wave energy e s and the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 with sj 0 5 j 1 2 3 4 5 were calculated at various wavenumbers as shown in fig 15 fig 15 a shows the results of e s with location defects of entire outer cylinders it is again observed that the defect effects of the individual outer cylinder on e s are symmetrical about the y axis at other wavenumbers for example location defects of s 1 0 5 and s 5 0 5 have the same effects on e s at various wavenumbers fig 15 b shows the results of f 0 with location defects of entire outer cylinders no symmetrical effects about y axis of location defects on f 0 are found comparing the results with the cloaking case the location defects on direction 3 perform insignificant effects on f 0 not only at k 1 0 but also at other wavenumbers while the location defects on other directions perform an obvious effect on f 0 at various wavenumbers in fig 15 b a wavenumber offset phenomenon for the minimal wave drift force on the inner cylinder with s 1 s 5 0 5 can be observed with s 1 0 5 f 0 reaches a minimum at approximately k 1 2 in other words the wavenumber corresponding to minimum f 0 is changed from k 1 0 to k 1 2 by this location defect s 1 0 5 of the entire outer cylinders similarly the results indicate that with s 5 1 0 the wavenumber corresponding to minimum f 0 is changed to approximately k 0 7 based on this interesting phenomenon the wavenumber of the minimum f 0 can be controlled by introducing a location defect of the entire outer cylinders to adapt to different wave conditions 4 reduction of f 0 at various wavenumbers using location defects as mentioned in fig 15 b a wavenumber offset phenomenon for the minimum f 0 can be observed with a location defect of entire outer cylinders therefore to make an optimized configuration obtained for a certain wavenumber also available for other wavenumbers the location defects of the entire outer cylinders are introduced to reduce the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 thus based on the optimized configuration obtained for k 1 0 shown in table 1 the wave drift forces on the inner cylinder f 0 k s x axis were calculated at different wavenumbers for various location defects in x axis direction s x axis fig 16 shows the attenuation ratios of the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 k s x axis f single k at different k values for various s x axis values here f single k denotes the wave drift force for the single inner cylinder at wavenumber k values of f 0 k s x axis f single k that less than 0 3 are shown in fig 16 in fig 16 negative s x axis denotes the location defects in negative x axis direction while the positive s x axis denotes the location defects in positive x axis direction it can be found that the value of f 0 k s x axis f single k at k 1 0 and s x axis 0 0 which corresponds to the cloaking mode non defect for k 1 0 is almost zero moreover for each wavenumber a minimum value of f 0 k s x axis f single k can be obtained with a proper value of s x axis although the absolute zero value of f 0 k s x axis f single k for a particular wavenumber can not be realized using a location defect of the entire outer cylinders the wave drift force on the inner cylinder can be significantly reduced with a proper value of s x axis for example f 0 1 4 0 8 f single 1 4 0 03 is the minimum value for k 1 4 which means that the wave drift force on the inner cylinder can be practically reduced at k 1 4 with s x axis 0 8 the values of f 0 k s x axis f single k can be smaller than 0 3 in the approximate range of 0 5 k 2 0 with proper values of s x axis in the range of 1 0 s x axis 1 0 moreover the proper value of s x axis for a certain wavenumber decreases as k increases therefore the wavenumber corresponding to minimum wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder can be controlled using the location defects in x axis direction of entire outer cylinders 5 conclusions the reduction of the wave drift force on an inner fixed truncated cylinder surrounded by eight additional truncated cylinders utilizing the cloaking phenomenon was considered in this paper the cloaking configuration of these multiple cylinders for a certain wavenumber k 1 0 was obtained using a rcga optimization scheme two kind of structural defects of the additional outer cylinders including the draft defects and the location defects were introduced to study their effects on the scattered wave energy e s the wave drift force acting on the inner cylinder f 0 and the corresponding wave pattern η 1 the defect effects were firstly studied at cloaking wavenumber k 1 0 a symmetrical effect about y axis of the draft defect of individual outer cylinder on e s was found for reducing the wave drift force on the inner cylinder f 0 by cloaking phenomenon the draft defects of individual outer cylinder are ignorable while the location defects of outer cylinders should be carefully considered these defect effects on f 0 are intimately related to the spatial distribution of free surface elevation in the weather side and lee side of the inner cylinder 2 then the defect effects were studied at other wavenumbers the symmetry about y axis of the draft defect of each outer cylinder on e s was also found at other wavenumbers in addition a wavenumber offset phenomenon of the minimum f 0 was observed which provides the potential to control the wavenumber of the minimum f 0 3 at last a location defect of the entire outer cylinders was introduced to make an optimized configuration obtained for a certain wavenumber can work for a wide frequency band it was found that the reduction of f 0 in a wide frequency band can be realized by changing the location of the entire outer cylinders in x axis direction which provides a practical method to promote the applications of cloaking phenomenon in ocean engineering credit authorship contribution statement zhigang

21938,caisson foundation has been widely used for offshore structures the micro mechanical analysis of the behaviors of a caisson foundation during its installation operation and failure is important but not currently available the goal of this study is to improve the understanding of the micro mechanisms in the installation operation and progressive failure processes of caisson foundation and provide guidance on the design for this the discrete element method dem is adopted to investigate the interaction of caisson foundation and sand the dem model is first validated by comparing the results of dem simulations and experiments in which similar trends are found in various load displacement curves with the validated model the micro mechanical response of soils induced by the installation process is studied firstly then the behavior of soils during the failure of the caisson foundation including particle displacement rotation and stress distribution are investigated for cases of different loading combinations in addition the fabric including contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force and its evolution are studied by dividing the soils into four different zones based on their positions and failure mechanisms at last the effect of dimensionally homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh is discussed keywords caisson foundation failure mechanism sand micromechanics microstructure discrete element method 1 introduction caisson foundation which is upside down steel or concrete tube embedded in the seabed has been widely used for offshore structures such as oil and gas platforms tension leg platforms and wind turbines compared with gravity based foundation or pile foundation it is more economical in both installation process and removal process when a caisson is lowered to the seabed the rim of the caisson cuts into the seabed due to the gravity force of the caisson because the weight of the caisson is usually not large enough to push the entire caisson into the seabed the suction force which is induced by pumping the water out of the caisson is applied to push it to the final position after the installation a caisson foundation is often subjected to a combined loading condition characterized by large overturning moment and small vertical loads extensive experimental tests were conducted to study the responses of caisson foundation subjected to various loading combinations small scale model test centrifuge test and full scale test have widely been used to study the bearing capacity penetration velocity seepage effect and soil structure interaction of caisson foundations subjected to monotonic and cyclic loadings barari and ibsen 2012 cox et al 2014 jia et al 2018 kelly et al 2006 kou et al 2019 zhu et al 2011 2019a these experiments have been successful in providing valuable data for the foundation design and predict the mechanical response of caisson foundations however they are expensive and time consuming in addition micro mechanical response of caisson foundations has been unfortunately ignored in experimental tests besides the experiments analytical methods are also used to describe the behaviors of caisson foundation such as the strain hardening plasticity model cassidy et al 2006 villalobos et al 2009 upper bond plasticity method yun and bransby 2007 hyperplasticity theory nguyen sy and houlsby 2005 or macro element method jin et al 2019c skau et al 2018 these methods have successfully provided the bear capacity and failure mechanism of caisson foundations but still cannot account for the micro mechanical response in recently years numerical simulation methods such as finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm have been more and more widely used in the study of caisson foundations achmus et al 2013 bagheri et al 2017 jin et al 2019a 2019b mehravar et al 2016 2017 some mesh free numerical methods ceccato et al 2016 he et al 2018 have also potential in the study of these soil structure interaction problems the fem fdm or mesh free methods which is in the framework of continuum mechanics has a high computational efficiency to simulate engineering scale problems but the analyses highly depend on the phenomenological models of soils adopted and the micro mechanical behavior of particles cannot be investigated the micro mechanical properties of particles have a strong influence on the macroscopic soil properties during the insertion of the caisson large compact force at the tip and interfacial shear may greatly change the initial micro structures and properties of the soil in addition during the operation and failure processes of caisson foundation the rotation of the caisson also induces anisotropy on particle fabric all these features can be achieved if the discrete element method dem is used the advantage of dem lies in that it can physically capture the behavior of particulate materials and as a discontinuous analysis method it can simulate the large deformation and discontinuous process of discrete particle assembly under quasi static and dynamic condition see cundall and strack 1979 jiang and yin 2012 2014 jiang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 2019 zhu and yin 2019 and he et al 2020 therefore it can potentially overcome the shortcomings of fem or fdm and is a powerful numerical tool for computing the motion of a large number of particles in the large deformation analyses of caisson foundation moreover for series of tests to compare each other the dem simulations can provide identical initial models which is very difficult to realize in experiments however it lacks the study of the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation up to now therefore in this paper the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation during the insertion operation and progressive failure processes is analysed using dem thanks to the advantages of dem in modeling soils at the particle scale the micro mechanical response of soil particles is investigated the dem model is first validated by comparing the results of numerical simulations and experiments then the micro mechanical analysis is focused on the effect of caisson insertion soil behaviors during the progressive foundation failure and the effect of m dh on soil behavior 2 dem model and validation 2 1 dem modeling of caisson foundation in order for the dem model to characterize the behaviors of caisson foundation it was first calibrated with the experimental results of caisson foundation subjected to planar monotonic loading foglia et al 2015 the caisson foundation model in their test has an outer diameter d of 300 mm a lid thickness t1 of 11 5 mm a skirt length d of 300 mm and a skirt thickness t of 1 5 mm fig 1 the caisson was pushed into a sand box with a dimension of 1600 mm 1600 mm 1150 mm by a vertical beam bolted on the lid the sand used in experiments has a mean diameter d50 0 14 mm and uniformity coefficient cu 1 78 respectively three types of loads were considered in the test i e vertical load v moment m and horizontal load h the pure central vertical monotonic loading test was first performed to identify the vertical bearing capacity then based on the typical range of moment dimensionally homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh of wind turbines five displacement controlled tests with different m dh ratios and constant vertical load were investigated as shown in table 1 the applied constant vertical load is 241n which includes the weight of the caisson and the measuring system it is important to mention that to achieve the research goal some assumptions and simplifications are made for example the seepage may decrease the bearing capacity of caisson foundation takahashi et al 2014 wu et al 2020 and impose risks and threats to the near infrastructures lyu et al 2019 however the soil used in this study is dry sand which is same with the experiments and the effect of ground water is not considered in addition the only shallow caisson foundation is investigated and the failure mechanism is different from caisson foundation with high length diameter ratio schneider and senders 2010 numerical tests in this study were performed using two dimensional 2d dem code pfc2d because large number of particles raise the problem of calculation efficiency in 3d and 2d simulations have been verified and successfully applied in analyses of engineering structures in terms of trend behavior fu et al 2012 jiang and yin 2012 2014 pradana et al 2019 load combinations in table 1 at normal gravity condition 1 g were conducted and named as 1 g insert 1 g 1 1 1 g 1 987 1 g 3 01 1 g 5 82 and 1 g 8 748 then the gravity was increased to 10 g to study the behavior of a prototype caisson foundation with a diameter of 10d 3 m subjected to same load combinations 10 g insert 10 g 1 1 10 g 1 987 10 g 3 01 10 g 5 82 and 10 g 8 748 the schematic diagram of the caisson foundation dem model is shown in fig 2 the testing box has a rectangular shape with 1300 mm in width and 750 mm in height and the number of soil particles in the model is around 180 000 which is determined by the size of the testing box and the relative density of the soil 0 8 in the lab tests and simulations the particle size distribution in the dem simulations is parallel to that of the tested sand and the mean grain size d50 is 2 5 mm which is approximately 18 times larger than that of the tested sand to reduce the total number of particles the caisson is modeled with a clump which is a rigid collection of disk particles rather than a wall which is a rigid surface the advantage of using the clump method lies in its similarity with real caisson on surface roughness geometry and self weigh which better reveals the micro mechanisms during the insertion operation and failure processes in addition it is also convenient to apply force and moment on a clump rather than a wall the density of the caisson particles is set to 5605 kg m3 to make sure the weight of the caisson is 241 n which is same with that of the caisson in experiments in order to obtain homogeneous specimens the multi layer with undercompaction method ucm was used to generate the dem samples jiang et al 2003 the particle interactions were governed by the linear contact model in which the linear contact force is produced by linear springs with constant normal and shear stiffness k n and k s the typical values of the stiffness k n 1 5 108 n m and k s 1 0 108 n m were given the density of sand particles is 2600 kg m3 and the friction coefficient is set as 0 5 the global relative density dr of 80 same with that in the experiments is used in the dem caisson foundation model fig 3 shows the typical mechanical behavior of the soils with initial relative density of 80 and 20 before stresses applied according to biaxial test dem simulations at the lateral stress of 400 kpa the soil samples are created as follows 1 non overlapped sand particles are randomly generated in a box and particle properties are defined 2 four equal sized walls are generated outside the particle area 3 the walls move towards soil particles so that a target confining pressure can be achieved then the sample is subjected to a vertical compression while the confining stress is kept constant the shear stress is defined as σ 1 σ 3 2 and the volumetric strain is ε 1 ε 3 where σ 1 σ 3 ε 1 and ε 3 are axial stress lateral stress axial strain and lateral strain the typical strain softening and dilatancy for dense soil are successfully reproduced for the other sample shear stress initially increases then reaches to a peak and the less dilatancy is observed the testing procedures of caisson foundation in dem are as follows a the caisson is slowly pushed into the soil at a constant velocity of 0 3 m s until the foundation fails in insertion test or reaches to the final position in constant m dh tests during which the horizontal and rotational velocity are fixed at zero b the load with constant m dh ratio is applied to the caisson and the corresponding displacements are monitored and it takes about 18 h on a workstation inter xeon e5 2697a cpu and 128 gb ram to simulate one test it should be noted that the goal of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of a caisson foundation from installation to failure with different load combinations at the microscale therefore the primary purpose of the 2d validation rather than 3d is to demonstrate that the dem model can reasonably capture the mechanical behaviors of caisson foundation at the laboratory scale and lay the foundation for the following micro mechanical analysis to extend the study to be more close to engineering scale same test simulations under 1 g were also repeated under 10 g as usually done by centrifuge note that this work also contributes microscale characteristics references for developing the micromechanical models such as zhao et al 2018a 2018b 2018c and xiong et al 2019a 2019b 2 2 results of dem simulations the comparison between experimental and numerical results of insertion test is shown in fig 4 during the tests the vertical load v in both experiments and numerical simulations increases with the vertical displacement and then reaches its plateau the value of vertical load is very low during the skirt penetration w 288 5 mm and is the result of the reaction vertical force at the tip and the wall friction once the lid of the caisson is pushed to the seabed the vertical load increases significantly until the foundation fails the bearing capacity of a caisson foundation can be estimated by the point with maximum curvature i e significant change in stiffness on the load displacement curve therefore the bearing capacities of the 1 g insert and 10 g insert tests are 52 kn and 518 kn compared with 91 66 kn in the experiment as expected the bearing capacity of 10 g insert test is almost ten times of that in the 1 g insert test as is mentioned in section 2 1 an exact match of experimental and simulated bearing capacity is of minor importance as the goal of this validation is to demonstrate that the 2d dem model can capture the macroscopic behavior and failure mechanism of caisson foundation the general evolution trend of vertical force v is very similar in all three tests which indicates that the 2d simulation is able to reproduce the progressive failure in the insert process fig 5 shows the relationship between horizontal displacement u and horizontal load h at various m dh ratios in the experiments 1 g and 10 g dem simulations horizontal load increases as the displacement increases with a decreasing slope and then becomes stable for a given horizontal displacement the test with a larger m dh requires a higher horizontal force it is also noticeable that compared with the experimental results there are some fluctuations in the results of dem simulations which is common in the dem method and could come from various factors such as the difference in timestep localized strong contact forces or localized particle velocity fig 6 shows the results of relationship between rotational displacement dθ and dimensionally homogeneous moment m d in which the dθ increases with m d and reach to a peak similar to the trend of the u h curves in fig 5 fig 7 and fig 8 present the results of horizontal displacement u versus vertical displacement w and rotational displacement dθ versus vertical displacement w which can both be characterized by a quasi linear relationship the values of displacements including both translational and rotational are close in experiments 1 g and 10 g dem simulations results also show that a foundation with a higher m dh fails at much lower horizontal displacement or rotational angle for example the horizontal bearing capacity of the foundation in test 1 g 1 1 is about four times that of the foundation in test 1 g 8 748 as is shown in fig 5 similar result is found for the bearing capacity of moment in fig 6 in other words for a specific caisson foundation the larger the overturning moment is applied to the foundation the lower bearing capacity is obtained to sum up a general consistency in the evolution trend is observed between the experimental and the numerical results which demonstrates the ability of the dem model to simulate the behavior of caisson foundation 3 micro mechanical analysis of caisson foundation 3 1 effect of caisson insertion the soil particle rotation and displacement after the caisson insertion are shown in fig 9 particles near the soil caisson interface usually experienced large rotation due to the strong interface shear force during the insertion process shown in fig 9 a according to the failure mechanism of caisson foundation proposed by schneider and senders 2010 the addition of skirts moves the shallow foundation failure mechanism to deeper soil layers therefore a triangular trapped soil wedge can be observed below the caisson skirt dashed triangle in fig 9 a which induces large particle rotations at the wedge boundaries however except for the wedge beneath the foundation no obvious shear plane can be identified which means the foundation failure has not been initiated similar observations are also reported in jin et al 2019b the wedge is found in the particle displacement field in fig 9 b and leads to large displacement gradients at the wedge boundaries the vertical ground stress distribution before and after the caisson insertion is shown in fig 10 before the insertion process the contour lines of vertical stress are quasi horizontal indicating that the vertical stress increases with the depth after the caisson is inserted the vertical stress around the skirt is slightly increased due to the shear induced dilatancy effect and the compaction effect in which soil particles move from the tip to the skirt chai et al 2014 in general in the insertion process soils inside the caisson and the trapped triangular move downwards which generates particle rotation at the boundaries and localized stress concentration around the skirt 3 2 soil behaviors during progressive foundation failure because caisson foundations are often subjected to large moments a typical failure pattern is the rotation failure the foundation failure happens when the value of moment becomes stable and is not affected by the increase of rotational angle according to the test results of rotational displacement dθ in fig 6 the foundation failure occurs at dθ equal to 5 24 mm rad which corresponds to a rotational angle of 1 therefore in order to see the progressive failure of caisson foundation the micro mechanical analysis of caisson foundation failure is investigated at three rotational angles i e 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 which represents the initial stage development stage and failure stage respectively note that the following results in this section are obtained from the test 1 g 1 1 and similar results from other tests are not repeated here 3 2 1 micro mechanical analysis of caisson foundation failure fig 11 shows the particle rotation obtained from the dem simulation 1 g 1 1 when the caisson rotational angle is 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 at the initial stage fig 11 a localized particle rotation first happens outside the right skirt of the caisson then as the caisson continues to rotate some particle rotations are generated outside the left skirt and beneath the caisson fig 11 b in the failure stage large particle rotations are mainly observed near the interface between soils and the exterior face of the skirt in addition particle rotations outside the right skirt is larger than that on the left side due to the combination of interface shear effect and the unloading effect which results in the downward movement of the particles what s more particles located within the two triangular areas experienced relatively larger rotations than the rest area and the size of the left triangle is bigger than the left one shown in fig 11 c this observation during the failure of the caisson foundation here can be explained by the difference between active failure and passive failure the active zone right triangle has a failure angle 57 close to π 4 ϕ p 2 where ϕ p is the friction angle and has the value of 26 5 bigger than that 34 close to π 4 ϕ p 2 of the passive case and thus smaller area of influence fig 12 shows the particle displacement field when the rotation angle is 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 when the rotational angle is increased from 0 2 to 1 0 the magnitude of particle displacement also increases significantly soils at the surface are subjected to larger displacement than other areas and the maximum displacement occurs at the upper right position of the foundation fig 12 also shows that the rotation center of the caisson foundation is located at the lower left part of the caisson and has a depth of 0 8d 0 76d and 0 78d corresponding to the rotational angle of 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 where d is the length of the skirt the embedded length of the caisson the positons of location center in the dem simulations are very close to 0 73d which value is proposed by fan et al 2006 for the rotation center of caisson foundations and the slight difference may come from the soil grading and properties tang et al 2016 the averaged micro pure rotation rate apr field for the caisson rotational angle of 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 is shown in fig 13 the apr is defined as 1 apr 1 n k 1 n 1 r θ 1 k r 1 θ 2 k r 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 where n is the number of contacts θ 1 k and θ 2 k are the angular velocities of two contacting particles with radii r 1 and r 2 at the microscale the apr is a transient variable relating to particle rotation sliding and particle size at the macroscale it is a non linear function of the macro rotation rate of the major principal axis of stress and contributes to the energy dissipation in granular materials jiang et al 2005 in addition apr is also closely related to the macroscopic deformation of granular materials wang and arson 2018 fig 13 shows the apr is large for soils inside the caisson in the passive region and in the active region before the foundation failure and becomes localized near the right wall of the foundation after failure fig 14 shows the vertical stress distribution compared with the vertical stress distribution after the insertion process in fig 10 b the stress near the left skirt is increased while the stress on near the right skirt is decreased when the caisson rotates anticlockwise the soils near the left are compacted due the penetration of the skirt which induces the stress increase and soils at the tip of the left skirt have the largest stress increase on the other hand soils on the on the right side are unloaded due to the removal of the skirt the force chain distribution at different loading stages is shown in fig 15 because the caisson rotates counter clockwise the magnitude and density of force chains near the upper left and the lower right of the caisson which regions are marked by the two red squares with solid lines in fig 15 c keep increasing as the rotational angle increases in addition due to the internal inverted scoop mechanism developing within the soil plug barari and ibsen 2012 contact forces between particles in the lower left part of the soil plug and the left skirt red squares with dash lines in fig 15 c are also increased 3 2 2 evolution of particle fabric the behavior of soils is known to be sensitive to the material fabric which is the topology of the internal structure of the soil particles a lot of previous studies have been qualitatively related the soil fabric change to the macroscale observations of soil response chen et al 2020 fonseca et al 2013 gao and zhao 2013 jiang et al 2019 oda et al 1982 wang et al 2019 therefore in order to better understand the failure mechanism of caisson foundation the fabric evolution from the initial stage to the failure stage is investigated in this section according to the results in section 3 2 1 and figs 11 14 soils exhibit quite different behaviors depending on their relative positions with the caisson for example soil particles inside passive or active regions have much large rotation than soils in other areas according to fig 11 in order to better describe the fabric of soils the soil particles are divided into four groups i e ls rs in out which corresponds to soil particles on the left side on the right side inside or outside of the caisson fig 16 the two triangular regions in fig 16 which consist of the ls and rs groups have the same size and shape with the passive region and active region in fig 11 caisson foundations are often subjected to large horizontal force and overturning moments the bearing capacity of horizontal force is determined by the total passive earth pressure from the passive region ls and the horizontal friction at the bottom therefore soils with large friction angle can stand higher horizontal force in terms of the bearing capacity of moment because the rotation center of the caisson foundation is located at the lower left part fig 12 soils at different regions contribution to the capacity with different mechanisms three fabric descriptors are investigated in this study i e particle contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force for a contact between two spherical particles the contact orientation is defined as the normalized vector connecting centroids of the two particles normal and shear contact forces are the force in parallel and vertical to the contact direction for a granular assembly the contact orientation distribution can be characterized by an angular distribution e θ which is given by 2 e θ 1 2 π 1 a cos 2 θ θ a where a defines the magnitude of anisotropy and θ a defines the direction of anisotropy rothenburg and bathurst 1989 similarly the normal force distribution and shear force distribution can be expressed as 3 f n θ f n 0 1 a n cos 2 θ θ n and 4 f s θ f s 0 a s sin 2 θ θ s where f n 0 f s 0 is the average normal shear force over all contacts in the assembly a n a s defines normal shear force anisotropy and θ n θ s is the principal direction of the normal shear contact force the fabric evolution of particles in the ls group when the rotational angle is 0 0 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 is shown in fig 17 in which the black lines represents the data measured in the dem simulations and red lines are the analytical approximations based on eqs 2 4 in fig 17 good agreements can be observed between the measured results and the analytical approximations before applying moments and horizontal loads to the foundation the contact orientation and normal contact force have an almost uniform angular distribution fig 17 a and b and the peak shear forces are in the vertical and horizontal direction fig 17 c these observations demonstrate that insertion process generated very slight anisotropy in the soils on the left side which conforms with the results in section 3 1 in the loading process significant anisotropy can be observed in fig 17 d l when the rotational angle is increased from 0 0 to 1 0 the contact orientation anisotropy parameters a increases from 0 07 to 0 20 while the θ a remains at 12 fig 17 a d g and j this evolution of contact orientation indicates that the magnitude of anisotropy keeps increasing but the direction remains same during the loading process the increased contact anisotropy in the upper right to low left direction is induced by the combined horizontal movement and counterclockwise rotation of the caisson similar evolution pattern is obtained for the normal contact force distribution which has the final a n and θ n equal to 0 55 and 20 respectively the evolution of contact orientation is consistent with force change in the ls region in fig 15 the combined horizontal and counter clockwise rotational movement of the caisson generated new contacts and force chains in the moving direction in addition the magnitude of contact force is also increased due to the passive movement of particles in the ls region in terms of the shear contact force the anisotropy magnitude a s keeps increasing and the anisotropy direction θ s decreases to resist the external shear force imposed by the caisson anisotropy is also generated in other areas summarized in table 2 the parameters a and a n for soils in the ls and rs groups are much larger than soils in other places which demonstrates the large anisotropy in these areas to sum up the movement of caisson which is induced by the load combination imposed on the caisson introduces anisotropy in the soils and the magnitude and direction of the anisotropy are determined by their relative position to the caisson 3 3 effect of m dh when the suction caissons are used as foundations for offshore wind turbines they are often subjected to high overturning moment two kinds of arrangements of caissons are often used as foundations for wind turbines i e the tetrapod and the monopod for the monopod condition the key issue is the performance of foundations under high overturning moment therefore the effect of the dimensionally homogeneous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh on the behavior of caisson foundations is investigated in this section the following discussions are based on the results of tests 10 g 1 1 and 10 g 8 748 however the conclusions are applicable to tests with various values of m dh fig 18 shows the particle rotation of soils when the value of m dh equals to 1 1 and 8 748 similar with the results in the 1 g 1 1 test in fig 11 c the passive failure zone and active failure zone on the left and right side of the caisson can be observed in both tests for particles inside the caisson large rotation occurs near the skirts particles in other areas experienced relatively smaller rotations the comparison of the results between fig 18 a and b shows that the passive and active failure zones are smaller in the 10 g 1 1 test in other words foundations with lower m dh ratio has larger passive and active failure zones the effect of m dh on the size of failure zones can also be identified from the results of particle displacement shown in fig 19 which clearly presents smaller sizes of two failure zones in the 10 g 1 847 test the smaller failure zone sizes provide the explanation of the lower bearing capacities of horizontal load and overturning moment in figs 5 and 6 fig 20 shows the apr field of the two tests except for a larger failure region in the 10 g 1 1 test an increased magnitude of apr can also be observed the vertical ground stress distributions of the two tests are shown in fig 21 in which similar distributions can be observed therefore the m dh ratio does not have a strong influence on the vertical stress distribution fig 22 presents the force chain distribution of the two tests in which a strong similarity is found on the locations and magnitude of the localized strong force chains therefore the effect of m dh ratio on the force chain is very slight 4 conclusion in this study the dem simulations of caisson foundation subjected to different load combinations have been conducted simulation results have the same pattern with the experimental results which indicates the validity of the dem model then the micro mechanical analysis of the behaviors of a caisson foundation during its installation operation and progressive failure have been conducted in addition the effect of dimensionally homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh is presented the conclusions of this study includes 1 in the insertion process the caisson foundation has a failure mechanism similar to the shallow foundation in which a trapped triangle can be observed large particle rotation happens near the caisson and the boundaries of the trapped triangle below the caisson in addition particles inside the caisson and the trapped triangle also have large displacement 2 in the progressive failure process the particle rotation and displacement increases with the rotational angle the majority of particle sliding which is characterized by the averaged micro pure rotation rate apr occurs before the failure of the foundation in addition the increase of vertical stress in the passive region and the decrease of vertical stress in the active region are also observed 3 the particle fabric anisotropy mainly occurs within the active and passive regions soil particles are divided into four groups depending on their relative positons with the caisson the rotational angle of the caisson induces significant fabric anisotropy which is characterized by contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force particles located in the passive region and active regions exhibits much large anisotropy magnitude compared with particles anywhere else 4 the homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh affects the size of the passive and active regions in the failure mechanism of caisson foundation larger m dh results in smaller passive and active regions this study is carried out to improve the understanding of the micro mechanisms in the installation operation and progressive failure processes of caisson foundation and provide helpful guidance on the design credit

21938,caisson foundation has been widely used for offshore structures the micro mechanical analysis of the behaviors of a caisson foundation during its installation operation and failure is important but not currently available the goal of this study is to improve the understanding of the micro mechanisms in the installation operation and progressive failure processes of caisson foundation and provide guidance on the design for this the discrete element method dem is adopted to investigate the interaction of caisson foundation and sand the dem model is first validated by comparing the results of dem simulations and experiments in which similar trends are found in various load displacement curves with the validated model the micro mechanical response of soils induced by the installation process is studied firstly then the behavior of soils during the failure of the caisson foundation including particle displacement rotation and stress distribution are investigated for cases of different loading combinations in addition the fabric including contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force and its evolution are studied by dividing the soils into four different zones based on their positions and failure mechanisms at last the effect of dimensionally homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh is discussed keywords caisson foundation failure mechanism sand micromechanics microstructure discrete element method 1 introduction caisson foundation which is upside down steel or concrete tube embedded in the seabed has been widely used for offshore structures such as oil and gas platforms tension leg platforms and wind turbines compared with gravity based foundation or pile foundation it is more economical in both installation process and removal process when a caisson is lowered to the seabed the rim of the caisson cuts into the seabed due to the gravity force of the caisson because the weight of the caisson is usually not large enough to push the entire caisson into the seabed the suction force which is induced by pumping the water out of the caisson is applied to push it to the final position after the installation a caisson foundation is often subjected to a combined loading condition characterized by large overturning moment and small vertical loads extensive experimental tests were conducted to study the responses of caisson foundation subjected to various loading combinations small scale model test centrifuge test and full scale test have widely been used to study the bearing capacity penetration velocity seepage effect and soil structure interaction of caisson foundations subjected to monotonic and cyclic loadings barari and ibsen 2012 cox et al 2014 jia et al 2018 kelly et al 2006 kou et al 2019 zhu et al 2011 2019a these experiments have been successful in providing valuable data for the foundation design and predict the mechanical response of caisson foundations however they are expensive and time consuming in addition micro mechanical response of caisson foundations has been unfortunately ignored in experimental tests besides the experiments analytical methods are also used to describe the behaviors of caisson foundation such as the strain hardening plasticity model cassidy et al 2006 villalobos et al 2009 upper bond plasticity method yun and bransby 2007 hyperplasticity theory nguyen sy and houlsby 2005 or macro element method jin et al 2019c skau et al 2018 these methods have successfully provided the bear capacity and failure mechanism of caisson foundations but still cannot account for the micro mechanical response in recently years numerical simulation methods such as finite element method fem and finite difference method fdm have been more and more widely used in the study of caisson foundations achmus et al 2013 bagheri et al 2017 jin et al 2019a 2019b mehravar et al 2016 2017 some mesh free numerical methods ceccato et al 2016 he et al 2018 have also potential in the study of these soil structure interaction problems the fem fdm or mesh free methods which is in the framework of continuum mechanics has a high computational efficiency to simulate engineering scale problems but the analyses highly depend on the phenomenological models of soils adopted and the micro mechanical behavior of particles cannot be investigated the micro mechanical properties of particles have a strong influence on the macroscopic soil properties during the insertion of the caisson large compact force at the tip and interfacial shear may greatly change the initial micro structures and properties of the soil in addition during the operation and failure processes of caisson foundation the rotation of the caisson also induces anisotropy on particle fabric all these features can be achieved if the discrete element method dem is used the advantage of dem lies in that it can physically capture the behavior of particulate materials and as a discontinuous analysis method it can simulate the large deformation and discontinuous process of discrete particle assembly under quasi static and dynamic condition see cundall and strack 1979 jiang and yin 2012 2014 jiang et al 2016 zhu et al 2018 2019 zhu and yin 2019 and he et al 2020 therefore it can potentially overcome the shortcomings of fem or fdm and is a powerful numerical tool for computing the motion of a large number of particles in the large deformation analyses of caisson foundation moreover for series of tests to compare each other the dem simulations can provide identical initial models which is very difficult to realize in experiments however it lacks the study of the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation up to now therefore in this paper the micro mechanical behavior of caisson foundation during the insertion operation and progressive failure processes is analysed using dem thanks to the advantages of dem in modeling soils at the particle scale the micro mechanical response of soil particles is investigated the dem model is first validated by comparing the results of numerical simulations and experiments then the micro mechanical analysis is focused on the effect of caisson insertion soil behaviors during the progressive foundation failure and the effect of m dh on soil behavior 2 dem model and validation 2 1 dem modeling of caisson foundation in order for the dem model to characterize the behaviors of caisson foundation it was first calibrated with the experimental results of caisson foundation subjected to planar monotonic loading foglia et al 2015 the caisson foundation model in their test has an outer diameter d of 300 mm a lid thickness t1 of 11 5 mm a skirt length d of 300 mm and a skirt thickness t of 1 5 mm fig 1 the caisson was pushed into a sand box with a dimension of 1600 mm 1600 mm 1150 mm by a vertical beam bolted on the lid the sand used in experiments has a mean diameter d50 0 14 mm and uniformity coefficient cu 1 78 respectively three types of loads were considered in the test i e vertical load v moment m and horizontal load h the pure central vertical monotonic loading test was first performed to identify the vertical bearing capacity then based on the typical range of moment dimensionally homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh of wind turbines five displacement controlled tests with different m dh ratios and constant vertical load were investigated as shown in table 1 the applied constant vertical load is 241n which includes the weight of the caisson and the measuring system it is important to mention that to achieve the research goal some assumptions and simplifications are made for example the seepage may decrease the bearing capacity of caisson foundation takahashi et al 2014 wu et al 2020 and impose risks and threats to the near infrastructures lyu et al 2019 however the soil used in this study is dry sand which is same with the experiments and the effect of ground water is not considered in addition the only shallow caisson foundation is investigated and the failure mechanism is different from caisson foundation with high length diameter ratio schneider and senders 2010 numerical tests in this study were performed using two dimensional 2d dem code pfc2d because large number of particles raise the problem of calculation efficiency in 3d and 2d simulations have been verified and successfully applied in analyses of engineering structures in terms of trend behavior fu et al 2012 jiang and yin 2012 2014 pradana et al 2019 load combinations in table 1 at normal gravity condition 1 g were conducted and named as 1 g insert 1 g 1 1 1 g 1 987 1 g 3 01 1 g 5 82 and 1 g 8 748 then the gravity was increased to 10 g to study the behavior of a prototype caisson foundation with a diameter of 10d 3 m subjected to same load combinations 10 g insert 10 g 1 1 10 g 1 987 10 g 3 01 10 g 5 82 and 10 g 8 748 the schematic diagram of the caisson foundation dem model is shown in fig 2 the testing box has a rectangular shape with 1300 mm in width and 750 mm in height and the number of soil particles in the model is around 180 000 which is determined by the size of the testing box and the relative density of the soil 0 8 in the lab tests and simulations the particle size distribution in the dem simulations is parallel to that of the tested sand and the mean grain size d50 is 2 5 mm which is approximately 18 times larger than that of the tested sand to reduce the total number of particles the caisson is modeled with a clump which is a rigid collection of disk particles rather than a wall which is a rigid surface the advantage of using the clump method lies in its similarity with real caisson on surface roughness geometry and self weigh which better reveals the micro mechanisms during the insertion operation and failure processes in addition it is also convenient to apply force and moment on a clump rather than a wall the density of the caisson particles is set to 5605 kg m3 to make sure the weight of the caisson is 241 n which is same with that of the caisson in experiments in order to obtain homogeneous specimens the multi layer with undercompaction method ucm was used to generate the dem samples jiang et al 2003 the particle interactions were governed by the linear contact model in which the linear contact force is produced by linear springs with constant normal and shear stiffness k n and k s the typical values of the stiffness k n 1 5 108 n m and k s 1 0 108 n m were given the density of sand particles is 2600 kg m3 and the friction coefficient is set as 0 5 the global relative density dr of 80 same with that in the experiments is used in the dem caisson foundation model fig 3 shows the typical mechanical behavior of the soils with initial relative density of 80 and 20 before stresses applied according to biaxial test dem simulations at the lateral stress of 400 kpa the soil samples are created as follows 1 non overlapped sand particles are randomly generated in a box and particle properties are defined 2 four equal sized walls are generated outside the particle area 3 the walls move towards soil particles so that a target confining pressure can be achieved then the sample is subjected to a vertical compression while the confining stress is kept constant the shear stress is defined as σ 1 σ 3 2 and the volumetric strain is ε 1 ε 3 where σ 1 σ 3 ε 1 and ε 3 are axial stress lateral stress axial strain and lateral strain the typical strain softening and dilatancy for dense soil are successfully reproduced for the other sample shear stress initially increases then reaches to a peak and the less dilatancy is observed the testing procedures of caisson foundation in dem are as follows a the caisson is slowly pushed into the soil at a constant velocity of 0 3 m s until the foundation fails in insertion test or reaches to the final position in constant m dh tests during which the horizontal and rotational velocity are fixed at zero b the load with constant m dh ratio is applied to the caisson and the corresponding displacements are monitored and it takes about 18 h on a workstation inter xeon e5 2697a cpu and 128 gb ram to simulate one test it should be noted that the goal of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of a caisson foundation from installation to failure with different load combinations at the microscale therefore the primary purpose of the 2d validation rather than 3d is to demonstrate that the dem model can reasonably capture the mechanical behaviors of caisson foundation at the laboratory scale and lay the foundation for the following micro mechanical analysis to extend the study to be more close to engineering scale same test simulations under 1 g were also repeated under 10 g as usually done by centrifuge note that this work also contributes microscale characteristics references for developing the micromechanical models such as zhao et al 2018a 2018b 2018c and xiong et al 2019a 2019b 2 2 results of dem simulations the comparison between experimental and numerical results of insertion test is shown in fig 4 during the tests the vertical load v in both experiments and numerical simulations increases with the vertical displacement and then reaches its plateau the value of vertical load is very low during the skirt penetration w 288 5 mm and is the result of the reaction vertical force at the tip and the wall friction once the lid of the caisson is pushed to the seabed the vertical load increases significantly until the foundation fails the bearing capacity of a caisson foundation can be estimated by the point with maximum curvature i e significant change in stiffness on the load displacement curve therefore the bearing capacities of the 1 g insert and 10 g insert tests are 52 kn and 518 kn compared with 91 66 kn in the experiment as expected the bearing capacity of 10 g insert test is almost ten times of that in the 1 g insert test as is mentioned in section 2 1 an exact match of experimental and simulated bearing capacity is of minor importance as the goal of this validation is to demonstrate that the 2d dem model can capture the macroscopic behavior and failure mechanism of caisson foundation the general evolution trend of vertical force v is very similar in all three tests which indicates that the 2d simulation is able to reproduce the progressive failure in the insert process fig 5 shows the relationship between horizontal displacement u and horizontal load h at various m dh ratios in the experiments 1 g and 10 g dem simulations horizontal load increases as the displacement increases with a decreasing slope and then becomes stable for a given horizontal displacement the test with a larger m dh requires a higher horizontal force it is also noticeable that compared with the experimental results there are some fluctuations in the results of dem simulations which is common in the dem method and could come from various factors such as the difference in timestep localized strong contact forces or localized particle velocity fig 6 shows the results of relationship between rotational displacement dθ and dimensionally homogeneous moment m d in which the dθ increases with m d and reach to a peak similar to the trend of the u h curves in fig 5 fig 7 and fig 8 present the results of horizontal displacement u versus vertical displacement w and rotational displacement dθ versus vertical displacement w which can both be characterized by a quasi linear relationship the values of displacements including both translational and rotational are close in experiments 1 g and 10 g dem simulations results also show that a foundation with a higher m dh fails at much lower horizontal displacement or rotational angle for example the horizontal bearing capacity of the foundation in test 1 g 1 1 is about four times that of the foundation in test 1 g 8 748 as is shown in fig 5 similar result is found for the bearing capacity of moment in fig 6 in other words for a specific caisson foundation the larger the overturning moment is applied to the foundation the lower bearing capacity is obtained to sum up a general consistency in the evolution trend is observed between the experimental and the numerical results which demonstrates the ability of the dem model to simulate the behavior of caisson foundation 3 micro mechanical analysis of caisson foundation 3 1 effect of caisson insertion the soil particle rotation and displacement after the caisson insertion are shown in fig 9 particles near the soil caisson interface usually experienced large rotation due to the strong interface shear force during the insertion process shown in fig 9 a according to the failure mechanism of caisson foundation proposed by schneider and senders 2010 the addition of skirts moves the shallow foundation failure mechanism to deeper soil layers therefore a triangular trapped soil wedge can be observed below the caisson skirt dashed triangle in fig 9 a which induces large particle rotations at the wedge boundaries however except for the wedge beneath the foundation no obvious shear plane can be identified which means the foundation failure has not been initiated similar observations are also reported in jin et al 2019b the wedge is found in the particle displacement field in fig 9 b and leads to large displacement gradients at the wedge boundaries the vertical ground stress distribution before and after the caisson insertion is shown in fig 10 before the insertion process the contour lines of vertical stress are quasi horizontal indicating that the vertical stress increases with the depth after the caisson is inserted the vertical stress around the skirt is slightly increased due to the shear induced dilatancy effect and the compaction effect in which soil particles move from the tip to the skirt chai et al 2014 in general in the insertion process soils inside the caisson and the trapped triangular move downwards which generates particle rotation at the boundaries and localized stress concentration around the skirt 3 2 soil behaviors during progressive foundation failure because caisson foundations are often subjected to large moments a typical failure pattern is the rotation failure the foundation failure happens when the value of moment becomes stable and is not affected by the increase of rotational angle according to the test results of rotational displacement dθ in fig 6 the foundation failure occurs at dθ equal to 5 24 mm rad which corresponds to a rotational angle of 1 therefore in order to see the progressive failure of caisson foundation the micro mechanical analysis of caisson foundation failure is investigated at three rotational angles i e 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 which represents the initial stage development stage and failure stage respectively note that the following results in this section are obtained from the test 1 g 1 1 and similar results from other tests are not repeated here 3 2 1 micro mechanical analysis of caisson foundation failure fig 11 shows the particle rotation obtained from the dem simulation 1 g 1 1 when the caisson rotational angle is 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 at the initial stage fig 11 a localized particle rotation first happens outside the right skirt of the caisson then as the caisson continues to rotate some particle rotations are generated outside the left skirt and beneath the caisson fig 11 b in the failure stage large particle rotations are mainly observed near the interface between soils and the exterior face of the skirt in addition particle rotations outside the right skirt is larger than that on the left side due to the combination of interface shear effect and the unloading effect which results in the downward movement of the particles what s more particles located within the two triangular areas experienced relatively larger rotations than the rest area and the size of the left triangle is bigger than the left one shown in fig 11 c this observation during the failure of the caisson foundation here can be explained by the difference between active failure and passive failure the active zone right triangle has a failure angle 57 close to π 4 ϕ p 2 where ϕ p is the friction angle and has the value of 26 5 bigger than that 34 close to π 4 ϕ p 2 of the passive case and thus smaller area of influence fig 12 shows the particle displacement field when the rotation angle is 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 when the rotational angle is increased from 0 2 to 1 0 the magnitude of particle displacement also increases significantly soils at the surface are subjected to larger displacement than other areas and the maximum displacement occurs at the upper right position of the foundation fig 12 also shows that the rotation center of the caisson foundation is located at the lower left part of the caisson and has a depth of 0 8d 0 76d and 0 78d corresponding to the rotational angle of 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 where d is the length of the skirt the embedded length of the caisson the positons of location center in the dem simulations are very close to 0 73d which value is proposed by fan et al 2006 for the rotation center of caisson foundations and the slight difference may come from the soil grading and properties tang et al 2016 the averaged micro pure rotation rate apr field for the caisson rotational angle of 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 is shown in fig 13 the apr is defined as 1 apr 1 n k 1 n 1 r θ 1 k r 1 θ 2 k r 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 r 1 r 2 where n is the number of contacts θ 1 k and θ 2 k are the angular velocities of two contacting particles with radii r 1 and r 2 at the microscale the apr is a transient variable relating to particle rotation sliding and particle size at the macroscale it is a non linear function of the macro rotation rate of the major principal axis of stress and contributes to the energy dissipation in granular materials jiang et al 2005 in addition apr is also closely related to the macroscopic deformation of granular materials wang and arson 2018 fig 13 shows the apr is large for soils inside the caisson in the passive region and in the active region before the foundation failure and becomes localized near the right wall of the foundation after failure fig 14 shows the vertical stress distribution compared with the vertical stress distribution after the insertion process in fig 10 b the stress near the left skirt is increased while the stress on near the right skirt is decreased when the caisson rotates anticlockwise the soils near the left are compacted due the penetration of the skirt which induces the stress increase and soils at the tip of the left skirt have the largest stress increase on the other hand soils on the on the right side are unloaded due to the removal of the skirt the force chain distribution at different loading stages is shown in fig 15 because the caisson rotates counter clockwise the magnitude and density of force chains near the upper left and the lower right of the caisson which regions are marked by the two red squares with solid lines in fig 15 c keep increasing as the rotational angle increases in addition due to the internal inverted scoop mechanism developing within the soil plug barari and ibsen 2012 contact forces between particles in the lower left part of the soil plug and the left skirt red squares with dash lines in fig 15 c are also increased 3 2 2 evolution of particle fabric the behavior of soils is known to be sensitive to the material fabric which is the topology of the internal structure of the soil particles a lot of previous studies have been qualitatively related the soil fabric change to the macroscale observations of soil response chen et al 2020 fonseca et al 2013 gao and zhao 2013 jiang et al 2019 oda et al 1982 wang et al 2019 therefore in order to better understand the failure mechanism of caisson foundation the fabric evolution from the initial stage to the failure stage is investigated in this section according to the results in section 3 2 1 and figs 11 14 soils exhibit quite different behaviors depending on their relative positions with the caisson for example soil particles inside passive or active regions have much large rotation than soils in other areas according to fig 11 in order to better describe the fabric of soils the soil particles are divided into four groups i e ls rs in out which corresponds to soil particles on the left side on the right side inside or outside of the caisson fig 16 the two triangular regions in fig 16 which consist of the ls and rs groups have the same size and shape with the passive region and active region in fig 11 caisson foundations are often subjected to large horizontal force and overturning moments the bearing capacity of horizontal force is determined by the total passive earth pressure from the passive region ls and the horizontal friction at the bottom therefore soils with large friction angle can stand higher horizontal force in terms of the bearing capacity of moment because the rotation center of the caisson foundation is located at the lower left part fig 12 soils at different regions contribution to the capacity with different mechanisms three fabric descriptors are investigated in this study i e particle contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force for a contact between two spherical particles the contact orientation is defined as the normalized vector connecting centroids of the two particles normal and shear contact forces are the force in parallel and vertical to the contact direction for a granular assembly the contact orientation distribution can be characterized by an angular distribution e θ which is given by 2 e θ 1 2 π 1 a cos 2 θ θ a where a defines the magnitude of anisotropy and θ a defines the direction of anisotropy rothenburg and bathurst 1989 similarly the normal force distribution and shear force distribution can be expressed as 3 f n θ f n 0 1 a n cos 2 θ θ n and 4 f s θ f s 0 a s sin 2 θ θ s where f n 0 f s 0 is the average normal shear force over all contacts in the assembly a n a s defines normal shear force anisotropy and θ n θ s is the principal direction of the normal shear contact force the fabric evolution of particles in the ls group when the rotational angle is 0 0 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 is shown in fig 17 in which the black lines represents the data measured in the dem simulations and red lines are the analytical approximations based on eqs 2 4 in fig 17 good agreements can be observed between the measured results and the analytical approximations before applying moments and horizontal loads to the foundation the contact orientation and normal contact force have an almost uniform angular distribution fig 17 a and b and the peak shear forces are in the vertical and horizontal direction fig 17 c these observations demonstrate that insertion process generated very slight anisotropy in the soils on the left side which conforms with the results in section 3 1 in the loading process significant anisotropy can be observed in fig 17 d l when the rotational angle is increased from 0 0 to 1 0 the contact orientation anisotropy parameters a increases from 0 07 to 0 20 while the θ a remains at 12 fig 17 a d g and j this evolution of contact orientation indicates that the magnitude of anisotropy keeps increasing but the direction remains same during the loading process the increased contact anisotropy in the upper right to low left direction is induced by the combined horizontal movement and counterclockwise rotation of the caisson similar evolution pattern is obtained for the normal contact force distribution which has the final a n and θ n equal to 0 55 and 20 respectively the evolution of contact orientation is consistent with force change in the ls region in fig 15 the combined horizontal and counter clockwise rotational movement of the caisson generated new contacts and force chains in the moving direction in addition the magnitude of contact force is also increased due to the passive movement of particles in the ls region in terms of the shear contact force the anisotropy magnitude a s keeps increasing and the anisotropy direction θ s decreases to resist the external shear force imposed by the caisson anisotropy is also generated in other areas summarized in table 2 the parameters a and a n for soils in the ls and rs groups are much larger than soils in other places which demonstrates the large anisotropy in these areas to sum up the movement of caisson which is induced by the load combination imposed on the caisson introduces anisotropy in the soils and the magnitude and direction of the anisotropy are determined by their relative position to the caisson 3 3 effect of m dh when the suction caissons are used as foundations for offshore wind turbines they are often subjected to high overturning moment two kinds of arrangements of caissons are often used as foundations for wind turbines i e the tetrapod and the monopod for the monopod condition the key issue is the performance of foundations under high overturning moment therefore the effect of the dimensionally homogeneous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh on the behavior of caisson foundations is investigated in this section the following discussions are based on the results of tests 10 g 1 1 and 10 g 8 748 however the conclusions are applicable to tests with various values of m dh fig 18 shows the particle rotation of soils when the value of m dh equals to 1 1 and 8 748 similar with the results in the 1 g 1 1 test in fig 11 c the passive failure zone and active failure zone on the left and right side of the caisson can be observed in both tests for particles inside the caisson large rotation occurs near the skirts particles in other areas experienced relatively smaller rotations the comparison of the results between fig 18 a and b shows that the passive and active failure zones are smaller in the 10 g 1 1 test in other words foundations with lower m dh ratio has larger passive and active failure zones the effect of m dh on the size of failure zones can also be identified from the results of particle displacement shown in fig 19 which clearly presents smaller sizes of two failure zones in the 10 g 1 847 test the smaller failure zone sizes provide the explanation of the lower bearing capacities of horizontal load and overturning moment in figs 5 and 6 fig 20 shows the apr field of the two tests except for a larger failure region in the 10 g 1 1 test an increased magnitude of apr can also be observed the vertical ground stress distributions of the two tests are shown in fig 21 in which similar distributions can be observed therefore the m dh ratio does not have a strong influence on the vertical stress distribution fig 22 presents the force chain distribution of the two tests in which a strong similarity is found on the locations and magnitude of the localized strong force chains therefore the effect of m dh ratio on the force chain is very slight 4 conclusion in this study the dem simulations of caisson foundation subjected to different load combinations have been conducted simulation results have the same pattern with the experimental results which indicates the validity of the dem model then the micro mechanical analysis of the behaviors of a caisson foundation during its installation operation and progressive failure have been conducted in addition the effect of dimensionally homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh is presented the conclusions of this study includes 1 in the insertion process the caisson foundation has a failure mechanism similar to the shallow foundation in which a trapped triangle can be observed large particle rotation happens near the caisson and the boundaries of the trapped triangle below the caisson in addition particles inside the caisson and the trapped triangle also have large displacement 2 in the progressive failure process the particle rotation and displacement increases with the rotational angle the majority of particle sliding which is characterized by the averaged micro pure rotation rate apr occurs before the failure of the foundation in addition the increase of vertical stress in the passive region and the decrease of vertical stress in the active region are also observed 3 the particle fabric anisotropy mainly occurs within the active and passive regions soil particles are divided into four groups depending on their relative positons with the caisson the rotational angle of the caisson induces significant fabric anisotropy which is characterized by contact orientation normal contact force and shear contact force particles located in the passive region and active regions exhibits much large anisotropy magnitude compared with particles anywhere else 4 the homogenous moment to horizontal load ratio m dh affects the size of the passive and active regions in the failure mechanism of caisson foundation larger m dh results in smaller passive and active regions this study is

21939,abnormal vibration and noise originated from friction and wear are often found in water lubricated stern tube bearings which seriously threatens the safety and concealment of underwater vehicles in order to better understand the friction induced vibration in water lubricated stern tube bearings friction pairs of rubber specimens matched with zqsn10 2 brass were tested on the water lubricated

during the ship engine start up shut down or operating in low speed or heavy load situation severe friction induced vibration and noise are usually found in the stern tube bearings which significantly impact the concealment reliability and occupant comfort of the underwater vehicles zarraga et al 2017 therefore it is crucial to investigate the mechanism of friction induced vibration in the water lubricated stern tube bearing for the purpose of finding suitable countermeasures friction induced vibration is a major issue encountered in a lot of mechanical systems wang et al 2017a typical engineering examples include vehicle brakes oberst and lai 2011 wiper blades min et al 2014 lancioni et al 2016 unno et al 2017 lubricant seals thörmann et al 2017a and train wheel rail incurves glocker et al 2009 liu and meehan 2016 zenzerovic et al 2016 literature review shows much have been done to perform analytical theoretical and experimental analysis on the dynamics of the water lubricated rubber bearings krauter et al krauter 1981 ibrahim 1992 simpson and ibrahim 1996 established the classical analytical model to simulate the operation of the water lubricated bearing and used a linear analytical model to investigate the squeal chatter vibrations of the bearing they found that the slope of the friction speed curve and the effective structural damping were the most important factors ibrahim 1992 summarized the dynamics characteristics of the water lubricated bearing from experimental tests and put forward two analytical models based on that simpson simpson and ibrahim 1996 developed a nonlinear two dimension model to analyze the dynamics of the water lubricated bearings occurrence of squeal and chatter regime was found to be influenced by the slope of the friction speed curve while other parameters such as natural frequencies damping ratios mass ratio and the initial conditions did not contribute much to the incipient squeal in the theoretical researches xiong et al 2013 proposed a two dimension finite element method considering turbulence effect from the nonlinear water film force and found that the nonlinearity effect of the water lubricated bearing was not significant and the bearing rotor system can run safely and stably at a rotating speed not exceeding 30 000 rpm zhou et al 2013a used the finite element complex eigenvalue method to assess the possibility of noise in a water lubricated bearing system thörmann et al thörmann et al 2017b conducted experimental tests to explore the influence of the relative sliding velocity and the contact normal force on the vibration response and the sound radiation wang et al wang et al 2017b studied the influence of friction and wear in a water lubricated rubber bearing on the system vibration using different rubber materials under different operating conditions in the experimental researches zhou et al 2013b developed a low noise level water lubrication rubber bearing material spb n for ship stern tube stick slip effect of spb n was analysed at the critical speed of 0 27 m s guo et al 2017 developed a biomimetic material for water lubricated stern tube bearing ke et al 2014 found that the stick slip length was an important parameter to describe the stick slip motion characteristics of the tubular rubber seals which demonstrated a direct relationship with the sliding velocity the compressive displacement the physical properties and geometrical configurations of the tubular rubber seals dong et al 2017 investigated different stick slip behaviors of the ultra high molecular weight polyethylene uhmwpe synthetic rubber sr and fiber resin composite frc polymer materials with zcusn10zn2 plates under water lubricated conditions on an umt 3 tribo tester park et al 2017 gave particular attention to the correlation between the stick slip pattern and the material properties such as the tensile strength modulus and surface energy of the polymers and the experimental results showed that the friction instability of polymers sliding on cast iron can be reduced by selecting a polymer with a high modulus and a small polar contribution of the surface energy in order to make the experimental test reflect the real working conditions of the water lubricated stern tube bearings a part of the strip on the bottom of the bearing this study is taken as the test specimen fig 1 which suffers the maximum contact stress and the facing layer is a kind of compound nitrile rubber nr still in service and processed to meet the physical requirements in table 1 of the us military specification mil dtl 17901c sh the backing material of specimens is zqsn10 2 brass with machine vision technology and high speed camera the vibration of the rubber layer of the specimens during the test was directly recorded the relationship among the friction induced vibration and the rotating speed contact pressure rubber layer hardness and thickness and lubrication condition was comprehensively studied meanwhile the mechanism of friction induced vibration in water lubricated rubber bearings was also discussed 2 experimental testing 2 1 test rig experimental tests were carried out on the water lubricated stern tube bearing test rig ssb 100 hongling et al 2012 which was built with reference to the us military specification mil dtl 17901c sh the diameter of the test spindle with the zqsn10 2 sleeve was 171 4 mm the photron sa series fastcam sa1 1 high speed camera with 102 4 102 4 in resolution ratio and more than iso 12232 ssat 100 00 in sensitivity was used to record the vibration of the rubber layer at a frequency of 500 fps as shown in fig 2 a 2 2 experiment design theoretically the friction induced vibration at each point in the rubber layer is different in amplitude because the vibration amplitude is in micro scale the deformation of the rubber layer can be regarded as elastic deformation and hence there is a certain analytical relationship among the amplitudes at each point in the rubber specimen as a result in the experimental tests three typical points i e points a b and c wear chosen to describe the bearing vibration as shown in fig 2 b point a and b with a 10 mm distance are at the interface of the brass backing and the rubber layer which indicate the motion of specimen fixture point a is 10 mm away from the left edge of the rubber layer point c is 1 mm away to the surface of the rubber layer whose motion indicates the vibration of rubber layer so point c was selected as the vibration tracked object with point a and b as two references a coordinate system was established by regarding ab line as the x axis and a perpendicular line through the midpoint of ab line as the y axis real time coordinate values of points a b and c can be acquired by machine vision technology then to find out the displacement of point c at any time in the coordinate system fig 2 c shows the relationship among point a b and c in the coordinate system where the displacements of point c in the x and y directions are labeled as p xi and p yi in order to compare the vibration amplitude we introduce the following two statistics a x and a y fig 2 d in eqs 1 and 2 to characterize the vibration amplitude of the point c in the horizontal and vertical directions 1 a x 1 10 i 1 10 p x i 1 1000 i 1 1000 p x i 2 a y 1 10 i 1 10 p y i 1 1000 i 1 1000 p y i where p x i is the top 10 maximal values of p x i and p y i is the top 10 maximal values of p y i 2 3 test specimens the specimen is prepared by the same procedure as that in the literature hongling et al 2012 the factors affecting the friction induced vibration of water lubricated rubber bearings are the contact pressure rotating speed the thickness and hardness of the rubber layer and the lubrication condition in this work we attempt to rank the importance of these factors using orthogonal test method 2 4 experimental procedure tests were carried out at the room temperature 20 25 c in water lubricated condition tap water was pumped through a rubber tube to lubricate the interface in mixed condition 4 drops tap water were left along the axial interface by a medical injector the specimens and the spindle were cleaned with acetone rinsed with tap water and dried with blow drier before tests after being fixed on the text rig the specimens rested on the spindle with load on it for 2 min then the driving motor was started and the shaft speed was increased slowly to 100 rpm within 2 min after running at this speed for 5 min the high speed camera was opened to record the movement of point a b c for 2 min the motor speed was then stepped down to 60 rpm and kept running for another 5 min and then high speed camera recorded the raw data for 2 min at this speed repeat this procedure at 30 rpm and 20 rpm to finish the experimental test for one specimen 3 experimental results and discussions fig 3 shows the images of the experimental tests central depression happens to the rubber layer at the rotating speed n 0 as shown in fig 3 a while obvious deflection toward the moving direction happens when n 0 as shown in fig 3 b specimens are tested under water lubricated mixed lubrication and dry friction conditions indicating that the friction induced vibration was slight without squeal or chatter in water lubricated condition while significant vibration accompanying with harsh squeal or severe chatter was observed in mixed lubrication and dry friction conditions during the test we got the similar trend in dry friction mixed water lubricated condition because in ordinary condition water lubricated bearings are in water lubricated condition so we choose to show the data in this condition which is more applicable to engineering practice 3 1 influence of rotating speed the effect of rotating speed on the friction induced vibration is discussed in this part fig 4 shows the real time displacement vibration of point c in x horizontal and y vertical directions on the specimen with the facing layer 12 mm in thickness and 70 shore a in hardness under the contact pressure 0 56 mpa in water lubricated condition it indicates that with the decrease of the shaft speed the vibration at point c increases gradually in both x and y directions because of the stick slip phenomenon between the rubber bearing and the shaft at low speeds severe vibration and chatters appears at 20 rpm so 20 rpm is lowest speed that the tests can continue and this results in larger displacements of point c in horizontal and vertical directions at 20 rpm than these at the other three speeds with the increase of the rotating speed the water lubrication condition is improved to decrease the proportion of direct contact between the rubber bearing and the shaft which decreased the possibility of stick slip and chatter in order to explore the frequency characteristics of the bearing vibration at point c the fourier transform was applied to the measured datasets fig 5 shows the frequency spectra of the horizontal vibration displacement of point c it shows that the vibration energy of point c in x direction under the four different speeds is mainly concentrated in the low frequencies range about 0 50 hz the same trend happens to the vibration energy of point c in y direction and the reference the frequency energy peaks at 20 rpm are much stronger than these at 30 60 and 100 rpm which indicates evidence of stick slip at low speed the similar results will get in water lubricated condition when the contact pressure is not more than 0 84 mpa when the frequencies are in the same range the amplitudes will reflect the vibration intensity so the following analysis just focus on the aptitude statistics a x a y of point c observation of tests on samples 12 mm in thickness 70 shore a in hardness 0 56 mpa in the contact pressure were carried out lubricated by tap water and the vibration amplitudes of point c on the test sample is shown in fig 6 a the horizontal displacement amplitude of point c is higher than the vertical one except at the speed of 20 rpm and it tends to decrease with the increase of speed this is because the friction induced vibration of the test sample is mainly caused by stick slip motion under this test condition the direction of motion produced by stick slip motion is generally consistent with the direction of the shaft neck tangent the point c is located about 5 mm above right the test shaft as shown in fig 2 so the angle between the stick slip direction and the horizontal direction is less than 45 so the component in the horizontal direction is larger than that in the vertical direction with the increase of rotational speed the lubrication condition of the friction pair is gradually improved and the stick slip effect is reduced so vibration amplitude of point c is gradually reduced 3 2 influence of different factors as can be seen in fig 6 a the most influential speed is 20 rpm which is consistent with the observation in figs 4 and 5 fig 6 b depicts the influence of hardness of the rubber layer the tests on the specimens with the facing layer 12 mm in thickness were carried out under the contact pressure 0 56 mpa in water lubricated condition with the rotating speed 30 rpm the results show that the vibration intensity at point c decreases with the increase of hardness this is because that the hardness increases the elastic modulus of the rubber layer increases under the same adhesive force from stick slip the deformation of the adhesion point on rubber layer decreases resulting in the decrease of displacement at point c fig 6 c shows the influence of thickness of the rubber layer the tests on the specimens with the facing layer 80 shore a in hardness under the contact pressure 0 56 mpa in water lubricated condition with the rotating speed 30 rpm the results indicate that the vibration intensity at point c generally increases with the increase of thickness this is because that the thicker the rubber layer the greater the elastic deformation under the same adhesive force from stick slip fig 6 d shows the influence of contact pressure the tests on the specimens with the facing layer 12 mm in thickness and 80 shore a in hardness in water lubricated condition with the rotating speed 30 rpm the results indicate that with the increase of contact pressure the vibration intensity at point c at the horizontal and vertical directions presents a significant increasing trend this is because the increase of contact pressure makes the lubrication condition deteriorated resulting in severe stick slip phenomenon 3 3 orthogonal test results according to the orthogonal test design in table 1 orthogonal tests have been implemented to get the statistics results of a x and a y the first 9 lines in table 2 shows the statistical results in different condition where each group of test was repeated for 4 times to get the average statistics the other 10 lines shows the result of the range analysis as the reference kui 1996 to quantify the importance of the factors in table 2 the difference between the maximum and minimum number among k 1 k 2 and k 3 is called the range the larger the range is the greater the influence of the level of this factor on the friction induced vibration the one with the greatest difference is the one with the greatest effect on the friction induced vibration which should be pay more attention to for ax the range values line 13 in table 2 of the four factors i e hardness thickness contact pressure and lubrication condition in the x direction are 0 57 0 64 1 73 and 0 39 respectively therefore the significance of these four factors to a x is in the order as the lubrication condition contact pressure hardness and thickness of the rubber layer the optimal solution to reduce the friction induced vibration is as below similar optimal solution was obtained for a y line 19 in table 2 lubrication conditions water lubrication contact pressure 0 28 mpa the hardness of rubber layer 85 shore a the thickness of rubber layer 4 mm 4 discussions up to today four kinds of friction induced vibration mechanisms have been proposed thörmann et al 2017a namely the stick slip sprag slip friction relative sliding velocity and mode coupling mechanisms the rubber facing layer of the water lubricated bearing possesses a certain degree of elasticity which may induce the occurrence of stick slip phenomenon furthermore in the experimental analysis we found significant vibration at low speed indicating that the friction induced vibration of the water lubricated stern tube bearing is mainly due to stick slip mechanism physically there are two stages in the stick slip movement the first stage is the stick where the microscopic roughness on the friction surface adheres with each other because of relative movement between the friction pairs the stickers will be torn and deform elastically the second stage is the slip with the relative motion of friction pairs the elastic deformation of the stickers continually increases until the elastic force is equal or large than the maximum static friction force then the stickers are departed and rebound the stickers continually appear and separate the vibration of the water lubricated bearing is excited the friction induced vibration is closely related to the lubrication condition of the interface during the stick slip there are also some interposition between micro protrusions from counterparts if the friction pair is in good lubrication condition a protrusion only needs a small tangential force to overcome the other protrusion to move forward furthermore if the elastic modulus of the protrusion is very low it will deform elastically and slide over another protrusion when the relative velocity of the friction pair is constant the longer it takes for the adhesion point and interposition to break off the higher the vibration energy stored by the system will be and the greater the vibration of the friction surface of the water lubricated rubber bearing will be the formation and disconnection of adhesion points and protrusions in the friction interfaces are the source of friction induced vibration the possibility of stick slip of the friction interface mainly depends on the roughness of the interface the lubrication state and the loading condition in the present work we found that the amplitude of the statistics a x and a y at point c decreases with the increase of the relative velocity of the friction pair this is because the speed increase may improve the lubrication condition a x and a y at point c also decreases with the decrease of rubber layer thickness and the increase of hardness literature qin et al 2013 shows that the friction coefficient decreases with the decrease of rubber layer thickness and hardness if the friction coefficient is reduced the force that a protrusion need to overcome an interposition is reduced and hence the vibration energy is reduced in water lubrication condition the percent of direct contact of counterparts decreases the possibility of adhesion and interposition among protrusions is reduced due to the presence of lubricating water film so the vibration energy stored in the system is low in the dry friction condition this will be on the contrary so the vibration energy in dry friction is higher than that in the water lubrication condition in the mixed lubrication condition a certain proportion of dry and wet areas exist in the system from dry area to wet area it means from dry friction or boundary lubrication condition to water lubrication or mixed lubrication condition the friction of the system has a larger variation range so the k value is the largest in the case of mixed lubrication condition because the friction coefficient in water lubrication condition is much smaller than that in dry friction condition the one that determines the friction coefficient in mixed lubrication condition is the portion of dry friction so there is little difference in k value between dry friction and semi dry friction 5 conclusions experimental tests have been performed to investigate the friction induced vibration in water lubricated stern tube bearings using the water lubricated bearing test rig sbb 100 typical influence factors such as the rotating speed contact pressure rubber layer hardness and thickness and lubrication condition were studied to reveal the friction induced vibration mechanism the main conclusions of the experimental analysis can be drawn as follows 1 by means of machine vision technology we directly proved that the stick slip mechanism is the fundamental cause of friction induced vibration in the water lubricated stern tube bearings 2 the friction induced vibration may increase with the decrease of velocity and rubber layer hardness and the increase of rubber layer thickness and contact pressure 3 the orthogonal test results show that the significance of different factors on the friction induced vibration is in order of lubrication contact pressure hardness and thickness of rubber layer future plan will investigate the life cycle degradation of the water lubricated rubber bearings declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

influence of rotating speed the effect of rotating speed on the friction induced vibration is discussed in this part fig 4 shows the real time displacement vibration of point c in x horizontal and y vertical directions on the specimen with the facing layer 12 mm in thickness and 70 shore a in hardness under the contact pressure 0 56 mpa in water lubricated condition it indicates that with the decrease of the shaft speed the vibration at point c increases gradually in both x and y directions because of the stick slip phenomenon between the rubber bearing and the shaft at low speeds severe vibration and chatters appears at 20 rpm so 20 rpm is lowest speed that the tests can continue and this results in larger displacements of point c in horizontal and vertical directions at 20 rpm than these at the other three speeds with the increase of the rotating speed the water lubrication condition is improved to decrease the proportion of direct contact between the rubber bearing and the shaft which decreased the possibility of stick slip and chatter in order to explore the frequency characteristics of the bearing vibration at point c the fourier transform was applied to the measured datasets fig 5 shows the frequency spectra of the horizontal vibration displacement of point c it shows that the vibration energy of point c in x direction under the four different speeds is mainly concentrated in the low frequencies range about 0 50 hz the same trend happens to the vibration energy of point c in y direction and the reference the frequency energy peaks at 20 rpm are much stronger than these at 30 60 and 100 rpm which indicates evidence of stick slip at low speed the similar results will get in water lubricated condition when the contact pressure is not more than 0 84 mpa when the frequencies are in the same range the amplitudes will reflect the vibration intensity so the following analysis just focus on the aptitude statistics a x a y of point c observation of tests on samples 12 mm in thickness 70 shore a in hardness 0 56 mpa in the contact pressure were carried out lubricated by tap water and the vibration amplitudes of point c on the test sample is shown in fig 6 a the horizontal displacement amplitude of point c is higher than the vertical one except at the speed of 20 rpm and it tends to decrease with the increase of speed this is because the friction induced vibration of the test sample is mainly caused by stick slip motion under this test condition the direction of motion produced by stick slip motion is generally consistent with the direction of the shaft neck tangent the point c is located about 5 mm above right the test shaft as shown in fig 2 so the angle between the stick slip direction and the horizontal direction is less than 45 so the component in the horizontal direction is larger than that in the vertical direction with the increase of rotational speed the lubrication condition of the friction pair is gradually improved and the stick slip effect is reduced so vibration amplitude of point c is gradually reduced 3 2 influence of different factors as can be seen in fig 6 a the most influential speed is 20 rpm which is consistent with the observation in figs 4 and 5 fig 6 b depicts the influence of hardness of the rubber layer the tests on the specimens with the facing layer 12 mm in thickness were carried out under the contact pressure 0 56 mpa in water lubricated condition with the rotating speed 30 rpm the results show that the vibration intensity at point c decreases with the increase of hardness this is because that the hardness increases the elastic modulus of the rubber layer increases under the same adhesive force from stick slip the deformation of the adhesion point on rubber layer decreases resulting in the decrease of displacement at point c fig 6 c shows the influence of thickness of the rubber layer the tests on the specimens with the facing layer 80 shore a in hardness under the contact pressure 0 56 mpa in water lubricated condition with the rotating speed 30 rpm the results indicate that the vibration intensity at point c generally increases with the increase of thickness this is because that the thicker the rubber layer the greater the elastic deformation under the same adhesive force from stick slip fig 6 d shows the influence of contact pressure the tests on the specimens with the facing layer 12 mm in thickness and 80 shore a in hardness in water lubricated condition with the rotating speed 30 rpm the results indicate that with the increase of contact pressure the vibration intensity at point c at the horizontal and vertical directions presents a significant increasing trend this is because the increase of contact pressure makes the lubrication condition deteriorated resulting in severe stick slip phenomenon 3 3 orthogonal test results according to the orthogonal test design in table 1 orthogonal tests have been implemented to get the statistics results of a x and a y the first 9 lines in table 2 shows the statistical results in different condition where each group of test was repeated for 4 times to get the average statistics the other 10 lines shows the result of the range analysis as the reference kui 1996 to quantify the importance of the factors in table 2 the difference between the maximum and minimum number among k 1 k 2 and k 3 is called the range the larger the range is the greater the influence of the level of this factor on the friction induced vibration the one with the greatest difference is the one with the greatest effect on the friction induced vibration which should be pay more attention to for ax the range values line 13 in table 2 of the four factors i e hardness thickness contact pressure and lubrication condition in the x direction are 0 57 0 64 1 73 and 0 39 respectively therefore the significance of these four factors to a x is in the order as the lubrication condition contact pressure hardness and thickness of the rubber layer the optimal solution to reduce the friction induced vibration is as below similar optimal solution was obtained for a y line 19 in table 2 lubrication conditions water lubrication contact pressure 0 28 mpa the hardness of rubber layer 85 shore a the thickness of rubber layer 4 mm 4 discussions up to today four kinds of friction induced vibration mechanisms have been proposed thörmann et al 2017a namely the stick slip sprag slip friction relative sliding velocity and mode coupling mechanisms the rubber facing layer of the water lubricated bearing possesses a certain degree of elasticity which may induce the occurrence of stick slip phenomenon furthermore in the experimental analysis we found significant vibration at low speed indicating that the friction induced vibration of the water lubricated stern tube bearing is mainly due to stick slip mechanism physically there are two stages in the stick slip movement the first stage is the stick where the microscopic roughness on the friction surface adheres with each other because of relative movement between the friction pairs the stickers will be torn and deform elastically the second stage is the slip with the relative motion of friction pairs the elastic deformation of the stickers continually increases until the elastic force is equal or large than the maximum static friction force then the stickers are departed and rebound the stickers continually appear and separate the vibration of the water lubricated bearing is excited the friction induced vibration is closely related to the lubrication condition of the interface during the stick slip there are also some interposition between micro protrusions from counterparts if the friction pair is in good lubrication condition a protrusion only needs a small tangential force to overcome the other protrusion to move forward furthermore if the elastic modulus of the protrusion is very low it will deform elastically and slide over another protrusion when the relative velocity of the friction pair is constant the longer it takes for the adhesion point and interposition to break off the higher the vibration energy stored by the system will be and the greater the vibration of the friction surface of the water lubricated rubber bearing will be the formation and disconnection of adhesion points and protrusions in the friction interfaces are the source of friction induced vibration the possibility of stick slip of the friction interface mainly depends on the roughness of the interface the lubrication state and the loading condition in the present work we found that the amplitude of the statistics a x and a y at point c decreases with the increase of the relative velocity of the friction pair this is because the speed increase may improve the lubrication condition a x and a y at point c also decreases with the decrease of rubber layer thickness and the increase of hardness literature qin et al 2013 shows that the friction coefficient decreases with the decrease of rubber layer thickness and hardness if the friction coefficient is reduced the force that a protrusion need to overcome an interposition is reduced and hence the vibration energy is reduced in water lubrication condition the percent of direct contact of counterparts decreases the possibility of adhesion and interposition among protrusions is reduced due to the presence of lubricating water film so the vibration energy stored in the system is low in the dry friction condition this will be on the contrary so the vibration energy in dry friction is higher than that in the water lubrication condition in the mixed lubrication condition a certain proportion of dry and wet areas exist in the system from dry area to wet area it means from dry friction or boundary lubrication condition to water lubrication or mixed lubrication condition the friction of the system has a larger variation range so the k value is the largest in the case of mixed lubrication condition because the friction coefficient in water lubrication condition is much smaller than that in dry friction condition the one that determines the friction coefficient in mixed lubrication condition is the portion of dry friction so there is little difference in k value between dry friction and semi dry friction 5 conclusions experimental tests have been performed to investigate the friction induced vibration in water lubricated stern tube bearings using the water lubricated bearing test rig sbb 100 typical influence factors such as the rotating speed contact pressure rubber layer hardness and thickness and lubrication condition were studied to reveal the friction induced vibration mechanism the main conclusions of the experimental analysis can be drawn as follows 1 by means of machine vision technology we directly proved that the stick slip mechanism is the fundamental cause of friction induced vibration in the water lubricated stern tube bearings 2 the friction induced vibration may increase with the decrease of velocity and rubber layer hardness and the increase of rubber layer thickness and contact pressure 3 the orthogonal test results show that the significance of different factors on the friction induced vibration is in order of lubrication contact pressure hardness and thickness of rubber
