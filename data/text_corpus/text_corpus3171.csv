discharge plasma was attempted to eliminate idm and control subsequent dbps formation satisfactory removal performance for idm was realized by the plasma oxidation almost 100 of idm was removed within 2 min relatively greater removal efficiency was gained at a higher plasma voltage and a lower ph level electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer revealed that reactive species oh o2 and 1o2 were responsible for idm decomposition based on analyses of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy two dimensional correlation spectroscopy three dimensional fluorescence spectrum and gas chromatography

widespread application and risks on ecosystems and humans ppcps have attracted great attention in recent years schwaiger et al 2004 evgenidou et al 2015 yang et al 2017 indometacin idm is a typical class of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and it is usually used to relieve pain and inflammation for human or animal health in medicine shao et al 2020 idm can easily be purchased over the counter making it become one of the most abused drugs zheng et al 2020 undoubtedly a large amount of residual idm will be eventually discharged into the water environment approximately 5 792 ng l 1 idm was detected in surface water in the uk and ireland zhang et al 2018 long term exposure to idm induces damages to digestive central nervous urinary and hematopoietic systems chiemerie and olusegun 2018 majeed et al 2018 reported that idm had the acute toxicity in rabbits moreover chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrogen containing disinfection byproducts dbps are easily generated during disinfection with chlorine or chloramine in the presence of indoles lin and carlson 1984 regrettably because of its low concentration and stable structure it is difficult to eliminate idm by traditional purification methods such as biotreatment and membrane filtration radjenović et al 2009 xu et al 2019 some advanced oxidation technologies have been established for idm elimination from water environment in recent years including photocatalytic degradation ferrate oxidation and peroxydisulfate oxidation huang et al 2017 li et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 among these technologies reactive oxygen species ros were responsible for idm decomposition extra catalysts materials heat and ultraviolet irradiation etc and or long time treatment were usually required for these methods to obtain great removal performance li et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 undoubtedly idm as a precursor as well as its intermediate byproducts is able to further convert to disinfection byproducts during the subsequent disinfection process shao et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 the dbps include trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetonitriles hans are highly teratogenic and carcinogenic chu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the above mentioned studies were mainly focused on evaluating idm degradation efficacy degradation process and residual toxicity but they did not focus on the formation of dbps during chlorination disinfection process after idm degradation let alone the correlations between idm degradation intermediates and dbps formation non thermal discharge plasma is a kind of advanced oxidation technology coupling optical electrical and chemical oxidation which has been extensively applied for micropollutant elimination because of its great performance rapid reactions and clean process no exogenous chemicals banaschik et al 2017 wardenier et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 when a certain voltage was applied the gas between the electrodes would be ionized by the attacks of high energy electrons because of the strong electric field then a series of chain reactions would be triggered to generate various oxidizing species o oh o2 and 1o2 etc due to its strong oxidation capacity pollutants are expected to be decomposed to small molecules and finally mineralized to co2 and h2o reducing subsequent risks previous studies demonstrated that some refractory contaminants such as dimethyl phthalate heavy metal organic complexes and large molecular weight organics could be effectively decomposed by the plasma oxidation accompanied by around 50 80 of mineralization performance wang et al 2018a 2018b more importantly the productions of nitrogen containing dbps n dbps and carbon containing dbps c dbps were significantly inhibited in the chlorination process after dissolved organic matters were decomposed by the plasma oxidation wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 these preliminarily suggested that the non thermal plasma technology is probably competent for effective idm elimination and subsequent dbps inhibition there is still a knowledge gap on underlying mechanisms of idm degradation by the plasma and the correlations between degradation intermediates and dbps formation hence non thermal plasma was used to decompose idm in this study aiming to explore the underlying degradation mechanisms and subsequent dbps control firstly idm degradation performance was investigated under various plasma voltages and ph values then the roles of ros for idm degradation were explored subsequently intermediate byproducts and decomposition processes were discussed to reveal the mechanisms and pathways of idm degradation finally the formation of dbps and their toxicities as well as the correlations with the intermediate byproducts were explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical materials analytically pure indometacin idm purity 99 was bought from

purity 99 5 was bought from guangdong guanghua sci tech co ltd 2 2 experimental setup the plasma system for idm degradation was equipped with an alternating current power source 0 30 kv 50 hz a reaction vessel electrodes gas drying tube and air pump as displayed in figure s1 in the supplementary materials the high frequency alternating current power supply ctp 2000k was bought from nanjing suman electronics co ltd china the reaction vessel was a plexiglass tube with 5 cm diameter and 35 cm height the high voltage electrode was made of a stainless steel spring with the wire diameter of 1 mm and 18 turns and each turn was spaced 1 cm apart the outside of the high voltage electrode was a quartz glass tube with the wall thickness of 1 mm and electrode was in close contacted with the quartz glass tube the quartz glass tube was played as the discharge dielectric barrier layer the gas drying tube was filled with dried allochroic silicagel to dehydrate the air then the dry air was injected into the quartz glass tube with a constant rate of 2 5 l min 1 the concentration of idm was 4 mg l 1 and the treatment volume was 0 3 l for each treatment the discharge power at the plasma voltages of 9 10 11 12 and 13 kv was 5 4 6 8 8 1 9 5 and 10 7 w respectively 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of idm was detected by high performance liquid chromatography scl 10acp shimadzu with a c18 analytical column and uv detector spd 10avp the mobile phase was the mixture of methanol and 0 02 mol l 1 ammonium acetate solution with the volume ratio of 85 15 the flow rate was 1 0 ml min 1 and the detection wavelength was 228 nm the idm removal efficiency corresponding first order kinetic constant and energy efficiency for idm decomposition were calculated as displayed in text s1 to explore the roles of ros tba bq and dabco were selected as the trapping agent of oh o2 and 1o2 respectively yuan et al 2021 ros was also identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany wang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 as described in text s2 the steady state concentrations of oh o2 and 1o2 were further calculated using nitrobenzene nb bq and furfuryl alcohol ffa as the probes respectively rao and hayon 1973 varanasi et al 2018 alexis and marcelo 2019 as described in text s3 the detection methods of nb bq and ffa are presented in table s1 uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2500 shimadzu was used to obtain the absorption spectrum of the idm solution reflecting its degradation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicotet is10 thermofisher was applied to analyse changes in the chemical structure of idm two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was used to further reveal the orders of chemical bonds changes and mechanisms of idm degradation process as depicted in text s4 the small organic acids and anions generated during the plasma treatment process were detected by ion chromatograph ics 1100 thermo fisher as described in text s5 some intermediate byproducts after idm decomposition were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7890b 5977b agilent and the operation programming was described in text s5 at time intervals the treated idm solutions were subjected to chlorination treatment as displayed in text s6 the generated dbps were analysed using gas chromatography agilent 6890 gc usa as depicted in text s6 the additive toxicity of dbps was calculated based on the concentration of dbps and its corresponding chronic mammalian cytotoxicity lc50 as depicted in text s6 the molecular weight and lc50 values of different dbps are listed in table s2 statistical analysis was carried out using spss software version 08 armonk ny usa all the tests were performed at least three replicates and the reported results were the mean values with standard deviations 3 results and discussion 3 1 idm degradation performance idm degradation performance was firstly evaluated under various plasma voltages as depicted in fig 1 a satisfactory degradation efficiency was observed at 13 kv which reached approximately 100 within 2 min of the plasma treatment it was 82 and 46 at 11 kv and 9 kv at the same treatment time 2 min respectively correspondingly the first order kinetic constants sharply increased with the plasma voltage which were 0 301 0 942 and 2 91 min 1 at 9 11 and 13 kv respectively fig 1b previous studies confirmed that higher plasma voltage favored much more ros such as oh o2 and 1o2 generation which increased the exposure of contaminants to those ros thus leading to the increase in removal performance of contaminants liu et al 2022 comparisons on idm degradation by different methods were performed and listed in table s3 photocatalytic oxidation ferrate oxidation and peroxydisulfate oxidation were the main reported methods for idm degradation huang et al 2017 li et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 huang et al 2021 various photocatalysts realized approximately 89 95 of idm degradation the energy efficiency was approximately 0 01 0 21 g kwh 1 which were 32 672 times lower than that of the plasma oxidation zhang et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 huang et al 2021 90 of idm was decomposed by ferrate oxidation within 60 min treatment zhang et al 2018 only 50 63 7 of idm was removed by peroxydisulfate oxidation the energy efficiency of uv peroxydisulfate was only 0 01 g kwh 1 which was quite lower than that of the discharge plasma li et al 2018a 2018b hence compared with these methods 100 of idm was successfully decomposed by the plasma oxidation within 2 min and the energy efficiency 6 72 g kwh 1 was much higher than those of the above mentioned methods therefore the present plasma system undoubtedly was an alternative method for idm decomposition solution ph displayed significant effects on the forms of pollutants and the activities of ros huang et al 2016 under strong acidic conditions idm was difficult to dissolve in water due to its low pka 4 5 and thus the solution ph value was above 6 0 in this study idm mainly existed in ionic forms in the selected ph range li et al 2018b the hydrogen on carboxyl group in idm was lost when it existed with the ionic form resulting in a negative charge on carboxyl oxygen atom due to delocalization effect the electron cloud density around the benzene ring would increase making it more susceptible to electrophilic attacks by oh thus promoting the degradation of idm li et al 2018a the high density of the electron cloud might contribute to the electron transfer during the reactions and accelerate the degradation process hence idm degradation performance was also assessed under different solution ph values as shown in fig 1c almost all of the idm was decomposed after 2 min of the plasma treatment under the initial solution ph 6 0 the removal efficiency declined by 6 6 18 4 and 29 4 when the initial solution ph was designed at 7 8 and 10 respectively meanwhile relatively lower first order kinetic constant was obtained at a higher solution ph value fig 1d generally acidic conditions were more favorable to ros activities and their lifetimes so better removal performances were commonly obtained anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 liu et al 2021 there were lots of h in solution under the acidic condition which could react with e aq alleviating the radical recombination reaction between oh and e aq as shown in eq 1 zheng et al 2011 excess oh possibly reacted with oh to produce o with a weak reactivity eq 2 shao et al 2018 reducing the degradation efficiency of idm this could be confirmed by the decreased fluorescence intensity of oh at a relatively higher ph value figure s2 previous studies also observed that alkaline conditions were not beneficial for idm degradation by ferrate vi oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation huang et al 2017 huang et al 2021 1 e aq h h k 2 3 1010 m 1s 1 2 oh oh h2o o k 1 3 1010 m 1s 1 3 2 roles of ros in idm degradation epr was used to detect the formation of ros and the results are shown in fig 2 a typical four line spectrum with the intensity of 1 2 2 1 and six line spectrum with the intensity of 1 1 1 1 1 1 were observed in the epr which proved the production of oh and o2 respectively zhu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the relative contents of oh and o2 increased with the applied voltage they decreased in the presence of idm compared with those in the deionized water similar with the trends of oh and o2 epr signals of 1o2 with the intensity of 1 1 1 were also observed and the relative content of 1o2 increased with the applied voltage but decreased after adding idm as depicted in fig 2b the roles and effects of ros on idm degradation were further discussed via radical trapping experiments the evolution of idm degradation efficiency with different scavengers in the plasma system is shown in fig s3 and the corresponding kinetic constants are shown in fig 2c idm degradation performance became worse with the addition of radical scavengers without any scavengers idm removal efficiency reached up to 92 2 at 12 kv after 2 min plasma treatment but it obviously decreased to 78 9 65 2 and 45 3 after adding 0 3 mmol l 1 dabco bq and tba respectively furthermore the degradation kinetic constants were declined to 0 326 min 1 0 537 min 1 and 0 789 min 1 with tba bq and dabco addition as displayed in fig 2c which resulted in 74 1 57 4 and 37 4 inhibition ratio respectively these results forcefully supported that oh o2 and 1o2 participated in the idm degradation process and oh did primary effect compared with the second order rate constants of o2 and 1o2 oh had a relatively higher second order rate constant with idm k idm oh 5 51 109 m 1s 1 zhao et al 2017 as displayed in table s4 zhang et al 2018 reported that oh and o2 both contributed to idm degradation in a bipo4 photocatalytic oxidation system moreover the steady state concentrations of ros were further calculated by adding ros probes in this system nb bq and ffa were chosen as the probes of oh o2 and 1o2 respectively and their second order rate constants were 3 0 109 9 8 108 and 1 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively rao and hayon 1973 varanasi et al 2018 alexis and marcelo 2019 as shown in fig 2d the first order kinetic constants of nb bq and ffa were 0 219 0 143 and 0 0794 min 1 respectively the calculated steady state concentrations of oh ss o2 ss and 1o2 ss were 1 2 10 12 2 4 10 12 and 1 2 10 11 mol l 1 respectively based on the above results of trapping experiments oh was considered as the main active substance for idm degradation although 1o2 ss was higher than oh ss in addition the obtained oh ss in this study was compared with those in other aops including uv h2o2 uv ps and electrochemical oxidation table s5 the oh ss in this study was comparable or even higher than that in the uv h2o2 system and electrochemical oxidation system 3 3 idm degradation process and mechanisms fig 3 a depicts the evolution of uv vis spectra of idm with the plasma treatment time there were two absorption peaks around 268 and 321 nm before the discharge plasma treatment which were assigned to ligand π π transition yang et al 2010 after 1 min of the plasma treatment these two absorption peaks disappeared proving that the molecular structures of idm were dramatically destroyed the ftir spectra of idm were also displayed significant changes in the structures of idm after the plasma treatment as depicted in fig 3b the characteristic peak at 3425 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of o h and it was strengthened after 5 min of the plasma treatment due to continuous hydroxylation caused by the ros oxidation sandt et al 2021 the peaks around 2836 cm 1 1319 cm 1 and 754 cm 1 were associated with the vibrations of c h ch3 and ch2 respectively wen et al 2018 fan et al 2019 the peak at 1682 cm 1 was attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibrations of c o in cooh fan et al 2019 the characteristic peaks around 1474 cm 1 1228 cm 1 1082 cm 1 and 839 cm 1 were responsible to the stretching vibrations of c o c o c c n and c c of idm matsumoto and tezuka 2020 rouzafzay et al 2020 jamwal et al 2021 respectively the intensities of these peaks were visibly damped after the plasma treatment demonstrating that the plasma oxidation effectively destroyed the chemical bonds of idm further leading to the generation of smaller substances huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was a means of spectral analysis based on ftir which has been widely used to disclose the orders of chemical bonds changes and mechanisms of contaminants degradation process recently chen et al 2015 ding et al 2020 herein 2d cos analysis was established to reveal the idm degradation process in the plasma system as depicted in fig 3c several auto peaks signals marked were observed on the diagonal line in the synchronous map which were corresponded to the peaks of ch2 c c c n c o c ch3 c o c o c h and oh in the ftir spectra fig 3b respectively all the positive signals of the auto peaks indicated that those chemical bonds were sensitive to the plasma treatment time in addition according to the signs of cross peaks in the synchronous map and asynchronous map it was possible to get the information of the orders of those chemical bonds changes based on the noda s rules lasch and noda 2019 for example the positive signs of φ 759 845 in the synchronous map and ψ 759 845 in the asynchronous map were displayed suggesting that the peak at 759 cm 1 ch2 changed prior to the peak at 845 cm 1 c c under the attacks of ros in the plasma treatment table s6 inversely the positive sign of φ 759 3470 in the synchronous map and the negative sign of ψ 759 3470 in the asynchronous map demonstrated that the peak at 3470 cm 1 oh changed prior to the peak at 759 cm 1 c c in the plasma treatment therefore the change orders of those chemical bonds during the idm degradation process in the plasma system were ranked as oh ch2 c c c n c o c ch3 c o c o ch chen et al 2015 lasch and noda 2019 ding et al 2020 idm degradation byproducts were further determined using gc ms and ion chromatography ic figure s4 displays gc ms graphs of idm degradation byproducts in the plasma system at different treatment times some phenols amides benzoic acids and alcohols including resorcinol 4 chlorobenzoic acid 4 chlorobenzamide n isopropylacetamide acetamide butane 1 3 diol 2 hydroxypropanoic acid ethanol 4 methoxy n phenylbenzamide n 3 acetyl 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide and 4 methoxyphenyl 4 chlorobenzoate were detected and the detailed information of these intermediate byproducts is also listed in table s7 moreover the changes of the relative contents of these byproducts with treatment time are shown in fig 4 the contents of most macromolecular byproducts such as byproducts 11 12 14 15 and 19 in table s7 increased within 2 min treatment and they subsequently decreased the contents of some smaller molecular byproducts such as byproducts 1 3 and 4 in table s7 gradually increased with the treatment time these phenomena demonstrated that the large molecules were decomposed to smaller ones during the oxidation process in addition cl no3 acetic acid and oxalic acid were also monitored and accumulated with the plasma treatment time figure s5 which further proved the mineralization of idm synchronous dechlorination denitrification and oxidative degradation of idm occurred huang et al 2021 reported that 4 chlorobenzoic acid 4 methoxy n phenylbenzamide n 3 acetyl 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide and 4 methoxyphenyl 4 chlorobenzoate were also produced during idm decomposition in a bioi photocatalytic process based on the above analyses two possible pathways of idm degradation in the plasma process are proposed in fig 5 in the pathway 1 ros attacked the c n bond in the o c n group to generate 4 chlorobenzoic acid and another intermediate the 4 chlorobenzoic acid was further oxidized to produce hydroquinone resulting in the release of cl and acetic acid which was consistent with ic data figure s5 subsequently hydroxylation reaction ring opening reaction dechlorination decarboxylation and demethylation reaction occurred by the attacks of ros to produce small molecular acids amides and alcohols until mineralized to cl no3 co2 and h2o this possible pathway was also reported by zheng et al 2020 in whose research the destruction of c n bond in the o c n group in idm by o2 and 1o2 was an important mechanism leading to the production of 4 chlorobenzoic acid huang et al 2020 also confirmed that demethylation reaction decarboxylation and ring opening reaction were happened after the c n bond in the o c n group was destroyed by g c3n4 photocatalytic oxidation in the pathway 2 the ros could attack the c c and c n bonds in the indole group leading to the production of 4 methoxy n phenylbenzamide and then it was further decomposed to 4 chlorobenzamide and n 3 acetyl 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide previous study reported that o2 and oh could attack the c n bonds in the indole group of idm in a photocatalytic oxidation process zhang et al 2018 similar phenomenon was also observed by huang et al 2017 during idm decomposition in the ferrate vi oxidation process the destruction of the c c and c n bonds in the indole group was also an important pathway for idm decomposition in the ferrous peroxydisulfate oxidation system li et al 2017 and this inference was consistent with the results of 2d cos analysis subsequently hydroxylation reaction ring opening reaction and demethylation reaction occurred by the further attacks of ros to produce small molecular acids amides and alcohols until mineralized to cl no3 co2 and h2o huang et al 2020 huang et al 2021 3 4 formation and toxicity of dbps as mentioned above some intermediate byproducts belonging to the fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were produced after the decomposition of idm these fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were important precursors of dbps during the disinfection process qiu et al 2020 lu et al 2021 correspondingly c dbps and n dbps would be inevitably formed during this process including haas thms hans and hnms fang et al 2010 kali et al 2021 fig 6 displays the dbps formation during the chlorination process after idm degradation by the plasma treatment as shown in fig 6a and b haas were mainly composed of monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa in which dcaa was considered as the primary substance with high level concentrations 120 380 ug l 1 by and large the yields of tcaa and dcaa increased after the idm was decomposed by the plasma treatment 5 min compared with untreated sample whereas few changes were observed for the formation of mcaa therefore the plasma treatment with 5 min duration in this study promoted the formation of total haas fig 6c and d display the formation of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm quite high concentration approximately 120 ug l 1 of dcan was generated from the idm sample before the plasma treatment while it dramatically decreased after the plasma treatment and even was not detected after 5 min of the plasma treatment different from dcan few changes were observed for the formation of tcnm therefore the plasma treatment with 5 min duration in this study significantly inhibited the formation of the n dbps total of tcnm and dcan previous studies reported that the precursors of haas were mostly high aromatic components like humic like substances swietlik et al 2004 xu et al 2021 the humic acid like substances were important degradation byproducts of idm by the plasma oxidation valencia et al 2014 wang et al 2016 and thus haas formation was promoted in this study because of the oxidation of ros the nitrogen groups were attacked and released with no3 during the plasma process which decreased the risk of dcan formation the total c dbps and n cbps were monitored and the c dbps accounted for major part in the total dbps and the ratio of c dbps increased while that of n dbps damped over time fig s6 the ratio of c dbps additive toxicity increased because of the accumulation of small molecules containing carbon muellner et al 2007 ding et al 2019 also found that uv h2o2 treatment increased the c dbps formation but effectively decreased the n dbps formation in addition the additive toxicities of dbps were calculated by dividing dbps concentrations with the corresponding chronic mammalian cytotoxicity lc50 values iskander et al 2020 as for the c dbps dcaa exhibited higher additive toxicity due to its higher concentration fig 7 a and b by and large the total toxicity of the total haas increased after the plasma treatment as shown in fig 7c the calculated additive toxicities of n dbps dominated in the first 0 5 min more than 70 satisfactorily the additive toxicity of dcan was effectively inhibited after the plasma treatment accordingly the toxicity of the total n dbps decreased after the plasma treatment the correlations among dbps and degradation intermediates were further analysed using pearson correlation coefficients to explain the formation of dbps during this process as shown in fig 8 the formation of tcaa was positively related to the intermediate byproducts of idm including acetamide p 0 05 and 1h indol 5 ol p 0 05 fig 8a besides a significantly positive correlation p 0 01 between dcaa and tcaa was observed fig 8b attributed to the continuous chlorination process there were no significant correlations between n dbps and c dbps but the correlation between tcnm formation and acetamide was significantly negative p 0 01 in addition the correlations among most of the intermediate byproducts were significantly positive as depicted in fig 8c which further demonstrated the conversion among those intermediate byproducts during the plasma oxidation process those results further indicated that the risk of n dbps formation was effectively reduced after the plasma treatment the correlations among these substances suggested that we should not only pay attention to the toxic dbps and directly related precursors but also extensively monitor the production of other intermediate byproducts 4 conclusions idm is a potential precursor of dbps which bring risks to human health rapid and highly effective degradation of idm by non thermal discharge plasma was realized in this study and almost 100 of idm was removed within 2 min treatment relatively higher degradation efficiency was obtained under a higher discharge voltage and a lower solution ph value epr analysis and radical quenching experiments demonstrated that oh o2 and 1o2 in the plasma system played important roles in idm decomposition process with 74 1 57 4 and 37 4 of inhibition ratio in the presence of corresponding radical scavengers respectively based on analyses of ftir uv vis 2d cos ic and gc ms sequence destruction in functional groups oh ch2 c c c n c o c ch3 c o c o and ch occurred resulting in production of no3 and degradation intermediates such as acetamide 1h indol 5 ol alcohols and organic acids the generated acetamide and 1h indol 5 ol were important precursors of haas hence leading to high concentrations of haas 120 380 μg l 1 formation with high additive toxicities in subsequent chlorination due to the destruction of nitrogen groups in idm the total contents and toxicities of n dbps tcnm and dcan were significantly inhibited relevant roadmaps among dbps and degradation intermediates suggested that direct precursors of dbps and other degradation intermediates should be both concerned in general although the risks of n dbps formation decreased after the discharge plasma treatment the risks of c dbps remained a concern therefore future work should be conducted to further improve idm degradation and mineralization performance to reduce production of acetamide and 1h indol 5 ol the discharge plasma combined with some carbon based catalytic materials or persulfates may be suitable options declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

class of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and it is usually used to relieve pain and inflammation for human or animal health in medicine shao et al 2020 idm can easily be purchased over the counter making it become one of the most abused drugs zheng et al 2020 undoubtedly a large amount of residual idm will be eventually discharged into the water environment approximately 5 792 ng l 1 idm was detected in surface water in the uk and ireland zhang et al 2018 long term exposure to idm induces damages to digestive central nervous urinary and hematopoietic systems chiemerie and olusegun 2018 majeed et al 2018 reported that idm had the acute toxicity in rabbits moreover chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrogen containing disinfection byproducts dbps are easily generated during disinfection with chlorine or chloramine in the presence of indoles lin and carlson 1984 regrettably because of its low concentration and stable structure it is difficult to eliminate idm by traditional purification methods such as biotreatment and membrane filtration radjenović et al 2009 xu et al 2019 some advanced oxidation technologies have been established for idm elimination from water environment in recent years including photocatalytic degradation ferrate oxidation and peroxydisulfate oxidation huang et al 2017 li et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 among these technologies reactive oxygen species ros were responsible for idm decomposition extra catalysts materials heat and ultraviolet irradiation etc and or long time treatment were usually required for these methods to obtain great removal performance li et al 2018b zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 undoubtedly idm as a precursor as well as its intermediate byproducts is able to further convert to disinfection byproducts during the subsequent disinfection process shao et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 the dbps include trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas halonitromethanes hnms and haloacetonitriles hans are highly teratogenic and carcinogenic chu et al 2017 liu et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 zhou et al 2021 the above mentioned studies were mainly focused on evaluating idm degradation efficacy degradation process and residual toxicity but they did not focus on the formation of dbps during chlorination disinfection process after idm degradation let alone the correlations between idm degradation intermediates and dbps formation non thermal discharge plasma is a kind of advanced oxidation technology coupling optical electrical and chemical oxidation which has been extensively applied for micropollutant elimination because of its great performance rapid reactions and clean process no exogenous chemicals banaschik et al 2017 wardenier et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 when a certain voltage was applied the gas between the electrodes would be ionized by the attacks of high energy electrons because of the strong electric field then a series of chain reactions would be triggered to generate various oxidizing species o oh o2 and 1o2 etc due to its strong oxidation capacity pollutants are expected to be decomposed to small molecules and finally mineralized to co2 and h2o reducing subsequent risks previous studies demonstrated that some refractory contaminants such as dimethyl phthalate heavy metal organic complexes and large molecular weight organics could be effectively decomposed by the plasma oxidation accompanied by around 50 80 of mineralization performance wang et al 2018a 2018b more importantly the productions of nitrogen containing dbps n dbps and carbon containing dbps c dbps were significantly inhibited in the chlorination process after dissolved organic matters were decomposed by the plasma oxidation wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 these preliminarily suggested that the non thermal plasma technology is probably competent for effective idm elimination and subsequent dbps inhibition there is still a knowledge gap on underlying mechanisms of idm degradation by the plasma and the correlations between degradation intermediates and dbps formation hence non thermal plasma was used to decompose idm in this study aiming to explore the underlying degradation mechanisms and subsequent dbps control firstly idm degradation performance was investigated under various plasma voltages and ph values then the roles of ros for idm degradation were explored subsequently intermediate byproducts and decomposition processes were discussed to reveal the mechanisms and pathways of idm degradation finally the formation of dbps and their toxicities as well as the correlations with the intermediate byproducts were explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical materials analytically pure indometacin idm purity 99 was bought from

reaction vessel electrodes gas drying tube and air pump as displayed in figure s1 in the supplementary materials the high frequency alternating current power supply ctp 2000k was bought from nanjing suman electronics co ltd china the reaction vessel was a plexiglass tube with 5 cm diameter and 35 cm height the high voltage electrode was made of a stainless steel spring with the wire diameter of 1 mm and 18 turns and each turn was spaced 1 cm apart the outside of the high voltage electrode was a quartz glass tube with the wall thickness of 1 mm and electrode was in close contacted with the quartz glass tube the quartz glass tube was played as the discharge dielectric barrier layer the gas drying tube was filled with dried allochroic silicagel to dehydrate the air then the dry air was injected into the quartz glass tube with a constant rate of 2 5 l min 1 the concentration of idm was 4 mg l 1 and the treatment volume was 0 3 l for each treatment the discharge power at the plasma voltages of 9 10 11 12 and 13 kv was 5 4 6 8 8 1 9 5 and 10 7 w respectively 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of idm was detected by high performance liquid chromatography scl 10acp shimadzu with a c18 analytical column and uv detector spd 10avp the mobile phase was the mixture of methanol and 0 02 mol l 1 ammonium acetate solution with the volume ratio of 85 15 the flow rate was 1 0 ml min 1 and the detection wavelength was 228 nm the idm removal efficiency corresponding first order kinetic constant and energy efficiency for idm decomposition were calculated as displayed in text s1 to explore the roles of ros tba bq and dabco were selected as the trapping agent of oh o2 and 1o2 respectively yuan et al 2021 ros was also identified using electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker e500 germany wang et al 2022 wu et al 2022 as described in text s2 the steady state concentrations of oh o2 and 1o2 were further calculated using nitrobenzene nb bq and furfuryl alcohol ffa as the probes respectively rao and hayon 1973 varanasi et al 2018 alexis and marcelo 2019 as described in text s3 the detection methods of nb bq and ffa are presented in table s1 uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2500 shimadzu was used to obtain the absorption spectrum of the idm solution reflecting its degradation fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nicotet is10 thermofisher was applied to analyse changes in the chemical structure of idm two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was used to further reveal the orders of chemical bonds changes and mechanisms of idm degradation process as depicted in text s4 the small organic acids and anions generated during the plasma treatment process were detected by ion chromatograph ics 1100 thermo fisher as described in text s5 some intermediate byproducts after idm decomposition were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7890b 5977b agilent and the operation programming was described in text s5 at time intervals the treated idm solutions were subjected to chlorination treatment as displayed in text s6 the generated dbps were analysed using gas chromatography agilent 6890 gc usa as depicted in text s6 the additive toxicity of dbps was calculated based on the concentration of dbps and its corresponding chronic mammalian cytotoxicity lc50 as depicted in text s6 the molecular weight and lc50 values of different dbps are listed in table s2 statistical analysis was carried out using spss software version 08 armonk ny usa all the tests were performed at least three replicates and the reported results were the mean values with standard deviations 3 results and discussion 3 1 idm degradation performance idm degradation performance was firstly evaluated under various plasma voltages as depicted in fig 1 a satisfactory degradation efficiency was observed at 13 kv which reached approximately 100 within 2 min of the plasma treatment it was 82 and 46 at 11 kv and 9 kv at the same treatment time 2 min respectively correspondingly the first order kinetic constants sharply increased with the plasma voltage which were 0 301 0 942 and 2 91 min 1 at 9 11 and 13 kv respectively fig 1b previous studies confirmed that higher plasma voltage favored much more ros such as oh o2 and 1o2 generation which increased the exposure of contaminants to those ros thus leading to the increase in removal performance of contaminants liu et al 2022 comparisons on idm degradation by different methods were performed and listed in table s3 photocatalytic oxidation ferrate oxidation and peroxydisulfate oxidation were the main reported methods for idm degradation huang et al 2017 li et al 2018a zhang et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 huang et al 2021 various photocatalysts realized approximately 89 95 of idm degradation the energy efficiency was approximately 0 01 0 21 g kwh 1 which were 32 672 times lower than that of the plasma oxidation zhang et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 huang et al 2021 90 of idm was decomposed by ferrate oxidation within 60 min treatment zhang et al 2018 only 50 63 7 of idm was removed by peroxydisulfate oxidation the energy efficiency of uv peroxydisulfate was only 0 01 g kwh 1 which was quite lower than that of the discharge plasma li et al 2018a 2018b hence compared with these methods 100 of idm was successfully decomposed by the plasma oxidation within 2 min and the energy efficiency 6 72 g kwh 1 was much higher than those of the above mentioned methods therefore the present plasma system undoubtedly was an alternative method for idm decomposition solution ph displayed significant effects on the forms of pollutants and the activities of ros huang et al 2016 under strong acidic conditions idm was difficult to dissolve in water due to its low pka 4 5 and thus the solution ph value was above 6 0 in this study idm mainly existed in ionic forms in the selected ph range li et al 2018b the hydrogen on carboxyl group in idm was lost when it existed with the ionic form resulting in a negative charge on carboxyl oxygen atom due to delocalization effect the electron cloud density around the benzene ring would increase making it more susceptible to electrophilic attacks by oh thus promoting the degradation of idm li et al 2018a the high density of the electron cloud might contribute to the electron transfer during the reactions and accelerate the degradation process hence idm degradation performance was also assessed under different solution ph values as shown in fig 1c almost all of the idm was decomposed after 2 min of the plasma treatment under the initial solution ph 6 0 the removal efficiency declined by 6 6 18 4 and 29 4 when the initial solution ph was designed at 7 8 and 10 respectively meanwhile relatively lower first order kinetic constant was obtained at a higher solution ph value fig 1d generally acidic conditions were more favorable to ros activities and their lifetimes so better removal performances were commonly obtained anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 liu et al 2021 there were lots of h in solution under the acidic condition which could react with e aq alleviating the radical recombination reaction between oh and e aq as shown in eq 1 zheng et al 2011 excess oh possibly reacted with oh to produce o with a weak reactivity eq 2 shao et al 2018 reducing the degradation efficiency of idm this could be confirmed by the decreased fluorescence intensity of oh at a relatively higher ph value figure s2 previous studies also observed that alkaline conditions were not beneficial for idm degradation by ferrate vi oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation huang et al 2017 huang et al 2021 1 e aq h h k 2 3 1010 m 1s 1 2 oh oh h2o o k 1 3 1010 m 1s 1 3 2 roles of ros in idm degradation epr was used to detect the formation of ros and the results are shown in fig 2 a typical four line spectrum with the intensity of 1 2 2 1 and six line spectrum with the intensity of 1 1 1 1 1 1 were observed in the epr which proved the production of oh and o2 respectively zhu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 the relative contents of oh and o2 increased with the applied voltage they decreased in the presence of idm compared with those in the deionized water similar with the trends of oh and o2 epr signals of 1o2 with the intensity of 1 1 1 were also observed and the relative content of 1o2 increased with the applied voltage but decreased after adding idm as depicted in fig 2b the roles and effects of ros on idm degradation were further discussed via radical trapping experiments the evolution of idm degradation efficiency with different scavengers in the plasma system is shown in fig s3 and the corresponding kinetic constants are shown in fig 2c idm degradation performance became worse with the addition of radical scavengers without any scavengers idm removal efficiency reached up to 92 2 at 12 kv after 2 min plasma treatment but it obviously decreased to 78 9 65 2 and 45 3 after adding 0 3 mmol l 1 dabco bq and tba respectively furthermore the degradation kinetic constants were declined to 0 326 min 1 0 537 min 1 and 0 789 min 1 with tba bq and dabco addition as displayed in fig 2c which resulted in 74 1 57 4 and 37 4 inhibition ratio respectively these results forcefully supported that oh o2 and 1o2 participated in the idm degradation process and oh did primary effect compared with the second order rate constants of o2 and 1o2 oh had a relatively higher second order rate constant with idm k idm oh 5 51 109 m 1s 1 zhao et al 2017 as displayed in table s4 zhang et al 2018 reported that oh and o2 both contributed to idm degradation in a bipo4 photocatalytic oxidation system moreover the steady state concentrations of ros were further calculated by adding ros probes in this system nb bq and ffa were chosen as the probes of oh o2 and 1o2 respectively and their second order rate constants were 3 0 109 9 8 108 and 1 2 108 m 1s 1 respectively rao and hayon 1973 varanasi et al 2018 alexis and marcelo 2019 as shown in fig 2d the first order kinetic constants of nb bq and ffa were 0 219 0 143 and 0 0794 min 1 respectively the calculated steady state concentrations of oh ss o2 ss and 1o2 ss were 1 2 10 12 2 4 10 12 and 1 2 10 11 mol l 1 respectively based on the above results of trapping experiments oh was considered as the main active substance for idm degradation although 1o2 ss was higher than oh ss in addition the obtained oh ss in this study was compared with those in other aops including uv h2o2 uv ps and electrochemical oxidation table s5 the oh ss in this study was comparable or even higher than that in the uv h2o2 system and electrochemical oxidation system 3 3 idm degradation process and mechanisms fig 3 a depicts the evolution of uv vis spectra of idm with the plasma treatment time there were two absorption peaks around 268 and 321 nm before the discharge plasma treatment which were assigned to ligand π π transition yang et al 2010 after 1 min of the plasma treatment these two absorption peaks disappeared proving that the molecular structures of idm were dramatically destroyed the ftir spectra of idm were also displayed significant changes in the structures of idm after the plasma treatment as depicted in fig 3b the characteristic peak at 3425 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching vibrations of o h and it was strengthened after 5 min of the plasma treatment due to continuous hydroxylation caused by the ros oxidation sandt et al 2021 the peaks around 2836 cm 1 1319 cm 1 and 754 cm 1 were associated with the vibrations of c h ch3 and ch2 respectively wen et al 2018 fan et al 2019 the peak at 1682 cm 1 was attributed to the antisymmetric stretching vibrations of c o in cooh fan et al 2019 the characteristic peaks around 1474 cm 1 1228 cm 1 1082 cm 1 and 839 cm 1 were responsible to the stretching vibrations of c o c o c c n and c c of idm matsumoto and tezuka 2020 rouzafzay et al 2020 jamwal et al 2021 respectively the intensities of these peaks were visibly damped after the plasma treatment demonstrating that the plasma oxidation effectively destroyed the chemical bonds of idm further leading to the generation of smaller substances huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 zheng et al 2020 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was a means of spectral analysis based on ftir which has been widely used to disclose the orders of chemical bonds changes and mechanisms of contaminants degradation process recently chen et al 2015 ding et al 2020 herein 2d cos analysis was established to reveal the idm degradation process in the plasma system as depicted in fig 3c several auto peaks signals marked were observed on the diagonal line in the synchronous map which were corresponded to the peaks of ch2 c c c n c o c ch3 c o c o c h and oh in the ftir spectra fig 3b respectively all the positive signals of the auto peaks indicated that those chemical bonds were sensitive to the plasma treatment time in addition according to the signs of cross peaks in the synchronous map and asynchronous map it was possible to get the information of the orders of those chemical bonds changes based on the noda s rules lasch and noda 2019 for example the positive signs of φ 759 845 in the synchronous map and ψ 759 845 in the asynchronous map were displayed suggesting that the peak at 759 cm 1 ch2 changed prior to the peak at 845 cm 1 c c under the attacks of ros in the plasma treatment table s6 inversely the positive sign of φ 759 3470 in the synchronous map and the negative sign of ψ 759 3470 in the asynchronous map demonstrated that the peak at 3470 cm 1 oh changed prior to the peak at 759 cm 1 c c in the plasma treatment therefore the change orders of those chemical bonds during the idm degradation process in the plasma system were ranked as oh ch2 c c c n c o c ch3 c o c o ch chen et al 2015 lasch and noda 2019 ding et al 2020 idm degradation byproducts were further determined using gc ms and ion chromatography ic figure s4 displays gc ms graphs of idm degradation byproducts in the plasma system at different treatment times some phenols amides benzoic acids and alcohols including resorcinol 4 chlorobenzoic acid 4 chlorobenzamide n isopropylacetamide acetamide butane 1 3 diol 2 hydroxypropanoic acid ethanol 4 methoxy n phenylbenzamide n 3 acetyl 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide and 4 methoxyphenyl 4 chlorobenzoate were detected and the detailed information of these intermediate byproducts is also listed in table s7 moreover the changes of the relative contents of these byproducts with treatment time are shown in fig 4 the contents of most macromolecular byproducts such as byproducts 11 12 14 15 and 19 in table s7 increased within 2 min treatment and they subsequently decreased the contents of some smaller molecular byproducts such as byproducts 1 3 and 4 in table s7 gradually increased with the treatment time these phenomena demonstrated that the large molecules were decomposed to smaller ones during the oxidation process in addition cl no3 acetic acid and oxalic acid were also monitored and accumulated with the plasma treatment time figure s5 which further proved the mineralization of idm synchronous dechlorination denitrification and oxidative degradation of idm occurred huang et al 2021 reported that 4 chlorobenzoic acid 4 methoxy n phenylbenzamide n 3 acetyl 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide and 4 methoxyphenyl 4 chlorobenzoate were also produced during idm decomposition in a bioi photocatalytic process based on the above analyses two possible pathways of idm degradation in the plasma process are proposed in fig 5 in the pathway 1 ros attacked the c n bond in the o c n group to generate 4 chlorobenzoic acid and another intermediate the 4 chlorobenzoic acid was further oxidized to produce hydroquinone resulting in the release of cl and acetic acid which was consistent with ic data figure s5 subsequently hydroxylation reaction ring opening reaction dechlorination decarboxylation and demethylation reaction occurred by the attacks of ros to produce small molecular acids amides and alcohols until mineralized to cl no3 co2 and h2o this possible pathway was also reported by zheng et al 2020 in whose research the destruction of c n bond in the o c n group in idm by o2 and 1o2 was an important mechanism leading to the production of 4 chlorobenzoic acid huang et al 2020 also confirmed that demethylation reaction decarboxylation and ring opening reaction were happened after the c n bond in the o c n group was destroyed by g c3n4 photocatalytic oxidation in the pathway 2 the ros could attack the c c and c n bonds in the indole group leading to the production of 4 methoxy n phenylbenzamide and then it was further decomposed to 4 chlorobenzamide and n 3 acetyl 4 hydroxyphenyl acetamide previous study reported that o2 and oh could attack the c n bonds in the indole group of idm in a photocatalytic oxidation process zhang et al 2018 similar phenomenon was also observed by huang et al 2017 during idm decomposition in the ferrate vi oxidation process the destruction of the c c and c n bonds in the indole group was also an important pathway for idm decomposition in the ferrous peroxydisulfate oxidation system li et al 2017 and this inference was consistent with the results of 2d cos analysis subsequently hydroxylation reaction ring opening reaction and demethylation reaction occurred by the further attacks of ros to produce small molecular acids amides and alcohols until mineralized to cl no3 co2 and h2o huang et al 2020 huang et al 2021 3 4 formation and toxicity of dbps as mentioned above some intermediate byproducts belonging to the fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were produced after the decomposition of idm these fulvic acid like and humic acid like substances were important precursors of dbps during the disinfection process qiu et al 2020 lu et al 2021 correspondingly c dbps and n dbps would be inevitably formed during this process including haas thms hans and hnms fang et al 2010 kali et al 2021 fig 6 displays the dbps formation during the chlorination process after idm degradation by the plasma treatment as shown in fig 6a and b haas were mainly composed of monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa in which dcaa was considered as the primary substance with high level concentrations 120 380 ug l 1 by and large the yields of tcaa and dcaa increased after the idm was decomposed by the plasma treatment 5 min compared with untreated sample whereas few changes were observed for the formation of mcaa therefore the plasma treatment with 5 min duration in this study promoted the formation of total haas fig 6c and d display the formation of dichloroacetonitrile dcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm quite high concentration approximately 120 ug l 1 of dcan was generated from the idm sample before the plasma treatment while it dramatically decreased after the plasma treatment and even was not detected after 5 min of the plasma treatment different from dcan few changes were observed for the formation of tcnm therefore the plasma treatment with 5 min duration in this study significantly inhibited the formation of the n dbps total of tcnm and dcan previous studies reported that the precursors of haas were mostly high aromatic components like humic like substances swietlik et al 2004 xu et al 2021 the humic acid like substances were important degradation byproducts of idm by the plasma oxidation valencia et al 2014 wang et al 2016 and thus haas formation was promoted in this study because of the oxidation of ros the nitrogen groups were attacked and released with no3 during the plasma process which decreased the risk of dcan formation the total c dbps and n cbps were monitored and the c dbps accounted for major part in the total dbps and the ratio of c dbps increased while that of n dbps damped over time fig s6 the ratio of c dbps additive toxicity increased because of the accumulation of small molecules containing carbon muellner et al 2007 ding et al 2019 also found that uv h2o2 treatment increased the c dbps formation but effectively decreased the n dbps formation in addition the additive toxicities of dbps were calculated by dividing dbps concentrations with the corresponding chronic mammalian cytotoxicity lc50 values iskander et al 2020 as for the c dbps dcaa exhibited higher additive toxicity due to its higher concentration fig 7 a and b by and large the total toxicity of the total haas increased after the plasma treatment as shown in fig 7c the calculated additive toxicities of n dbps dominated in the first 0 5 min more than 70 satisfactorily the additive toxicity of dcan was effectively inhibited after the plasma treatment accordingly the toxicity of the total n dbps decreased after the plasma treatment the correlations among dbps and degradation intermediates were further analysed using pearson correlation coefficients to explain the formation of dbps during this process as shown in fig 8 the formation of tcaa was positively related to the intermediate byproducts of idm including acetamide p 0 05 and 1h indol 5 ol p 0 05 fig 8a besides a significantly positive correlation p 0 01 between dcaa and tcaa was observed fig 8b attributed to the continuous chlorination process there were no significant correlations between n dbps and c dbps but the correlation between tcnm formation and acetamide was significantly negative p 0 01 in addition the correlations among most of the intermediate byproducts were significantly positive as depicted in fig 8c which further demonstrated the conversion among those intermediate byproducts during the plasma oxidation process those results further indicated that the risk of n dbps formation was effectively reduced after the plasma treatment the correlations among these substances suggested that we should not only pay attention to the toxic dbps and directly related precursors but also extensively monitor the production of other intermediate byproducts 4 conclusions idm is a potential precursor of dbps which bring risks to human health rapid and highly effective degradation of idm by non thermal discharge plasma was realized in this study and almost 100 of idm was removed within 2 min treatment relatively higher degradation efficiency was obtained under a higher discharge voltage and a lower solution ph value epr analysis and radical quenching experiments demonstrated that oh o2 and 1o2 in the plasma system played important roles in idm decomposition process with 74 1 57 4 and 37 4 of inhibition ratio in the presence of corresponding radical scavengers respectively based on analyses of ftir uv vis 2d cos ic and gc ms sequence destruction in functional groups oh ch2 c c c n c o c ch3 c o c o and ch occurred resulting in production of no3 and degradation intermediates such as acetamide 1h indol 5 ol alcohols and organic acids the generated acetamide and 1h indol 5 ol were important precursors of haas hence leading to high concentrations of haas 120 380 μg l 1 formation with high additive toxicities in subsequent chlorination due to the destruction of nitrogen groups in idm the total contents and toxicities of n dbps tcnm and dcan were significantly inhibited relevant roadmaps among dbps and degradation intermediates suggested that direct precursors of dbps and other degradation intermediates should be both concerned in general although the risks of n dbps formation decreased after the discharge plasma treatment the risks of c dbps remained a concern therefore future work should be conducted to further improve idm degradation and mineralization performance to reduce production of acetamide and 1h indol 5 ol the discharge plasma combined with some carbon based catalytic materials or persulfates may be suitable options declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15856,for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater effluent carbon based advanced treatment cbat using coagulation ozonation biofiltration and or granular activated carbon gac adsorption is a promising approach for controlling disinfection byproduct dbp formation however cbat can also favor a shift in dbp formation to more toxic brominated dbp species to protect public health treatment specific dbp formation and speciation trends need to be identified and understood first this study systematically evaluated the treatment of six wastewater effluents with four cbat process trains experimental n was 55 and measured dbp formation and speciation trends overall cbat decreased dbp formation by 90 and gac preferentially removed highly reactive effluent organic matter as indicated by lower yields of both highly forming and highly toxic classes of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps since gac treatment also induced systematic speciation changes by increasing the ratio of bromide to dissolved organic matter the second part of this study focused on understanding the health impacts of dbp speciation changes on calculated additive toxicity cat based on the evaluation of 20 dbps measured using established methods the cat values from cyto and genotoxicity metrics decreased by as much as 85 due to high levels of precursor removal by gac expanding the evaluation to include 52 dbps measured using more extensive analytical methods resulted in the same conclusions this study also developed a speciation potency metric that re scales class by class speciation trends using toxic potency factors e g cytotoxicity lc50 the observed shifts in dbp speciation after treatment increased the class level toxic potency factors by up to a factor of 4 a greater amount of precursor removal is required for treatment to reduce toxicity which was achieved with cbat trains this proposed approach of combining speciation potency with dbp yields enables evaluation of dbp associated risk with easily measured surrogates i e bromide and dissolved organic carbon doc by identifying and quantitatively comparing dbp formation and speciation trends over multiple wastewater effluents and treatment trains this study demonstrates that cbat can be a robust approach to dbp precursor removal for potable reuse keywords potable reuse halogenated dbps biofiltration gac bromine substitution additive toxicity 1 introduction drinking water utilities across the globe are expanding and diversifying their water supply portfolios to increase capacity and resilience in response to current and growing water stress lee and jepson 2020 the new water sources under consideration such as wastewater effluent wwef for potable reuse are often highly impacted by microbial and chemical contaminants national research council 2012 early adopters of potable reuse have used extensive and advanced treatment trains to control the pathogenic and chemical health risks associated with wwef as a source water gerrity et al 2013 however technology selection to address a wide range of treatment objectives in a robust and cost effective manner remains a significant challenge for utilities and insights into treatment efficacy that support such decision making are needed control of halogenated disinfection byproduct dbp formation is an important treatment objective in potable reuse to protect public health from chemical risks national research council 2012 disinfection with free chlorine remains an important method for pathogen control in many reuse scenarios but free chlorine reacts with effluent organic matter efom and halide ions which are ubiquitous in wwefs to form halogenated dbps reverse osmosis effectively controls halogenated dbp formation through efom and halide ion removal zeng et al 2016 but is costly and energy intensive particularly for brine disposal in inland locations noibi et al 2020 schimmoller and kealy 2014 alternative treatment trains are being explored especially carbon based advanced treatment cbat trains that utilize coagulation ozonation biofiltration and or granular activated carbon gac adsorption chuang et al 2019 however the cbat conditions needed to control dbp associated health risks are not yet established krasner et al 2016 therefore to identify approaches for monitoring and controlling dbp associated risk in potable reuse scenarios this study systematically evaluated dbp precursor control with cbat processes across a range of wastewater effluents the uncertainty about controlling dbp associated risk with cbat stems from the inherent tradeoff between lowering overall dbp formation but shifting toward formation of brominated species summers et al 1993 this tradeoff is centered on efom removal which can lower dbp formation through removal of organic precursors but simultaneously increases the formation of hobr via reaction between hocl and br which is not removed by cbat causing speciation shifts toward bromide containing dbps chuang et al 2019 cuthbertson et al 2019 which can be orders of magnitude more toxic than their chlorinated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 higher hobr formation can also increase molar yields of some dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetonitriles hans hua et al 2006 kanan and karanfil 2020 liu et al 2018 and result in an increase in the more toxic species after treatment if organic precursor removal is insufficient it is imperative to understand the treatment specific relationships between dbp formation and speciation to understand the conditions when cbat can be expected to lower both dbp formation and dbp associated toxicity few studies have investigated precursor control with cbat under operationally representative conditions significant dbp formation potential is expected in wwefs chen and westerhoff 2010 krasner et al 2009 though formation potential tests can underrepresent the formation of more toxic species kanan and karanfil 2020 there are studies that have used simulated distribution system conditions e g uniform formation conditions ufc summers et al 1996 to test the control of dbps and dbp associated toxicity in wwefs arnold et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 summers et al 2020 verdugo et al 2020 but those studies evaluated a limited number of wwefs and cbat process configurations therefore to support more widespread cbat implementation a systematic comparative analysis of cbat processes and treatment trains is needed to identify the conditions where the benefits of organic precursor removal outweigh the negative impacts of speciation changes on dbp associated risk development of a treatment oriented quantitative approach to compare the impacts of both dbp formation and speciation on dbp associated risk requires a class level approach because the occurrence of intra class species is not independent e g dbps within the same class form from a common set of organic precursors and their speciation reflects the extent of bromide incorporation several studies have focused on dbp class level trends for example as yields for total dbp formation arnold et al 2018 krasner et al 2008 and as bromide substitution factors for the speciation arnold et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 those metrics are used to generalize dbp occurrence trends with readily available surrogates for organic and inorganic precursors i e dissolved organic carbon doc and bromide but they are incompatible for direct comparison an alternative approach calculated additive toxicity cat has been widely used to evaluate the dbp associated quality of drinking waters allen et al 2021 cuthbertson et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and reuse waters chuang et al 2019 verdugo et al 2020 zeng and mitch 2016 the cat approach which uses the toxic potencies of all measured dbp species to calculate a weighted sum value of total dbp occurrence implicitly captures changes in both dbp formation and dbp speciation however it is difficult to generalize treatment trends with cat in its current form because it is evaluated on a species level rather than on a class level therefore a modified class level cat approach is needed in which class level toxic potency factors are identified for a range of water qualities and treatment processes that can be paired with class level dbp formation trends when calculating the weighted sums this approach would explicitly decouple the underlying formation and speciation effects and allow for generalization of those trends using surrogate parameters to support public health decision making in a more feasible practical and affordable manner we hypothesized that both the formation and speciation of halogenated dbp species in cbat treated potable reuse waters would follow predictable trends so the first objective of this study was to systematically evaluate dbp precursor control with coagulation ozonation biofiltration and gac adsorption across a range of municipal wwtp effluents with a focus on priority unregulated dbp species treatment specific changes to precursor amount and reactivity plus changes in speciation were evaluated using relationships with the amount of bromide and doc as surrogate parameters the second objective was to use those relationships to extend the cat framework to quantitatively evaluate tradeoffs between lower dbp formation and the shift to more toxic species and then to identify which treatment configurations were effective for improving dbp associated water quality across a range of possible organic precursor removal goals the goal of this approach was to enable the estimation of dbp associated risk using easily measured surrogates by leveraging the observed class level formation and speciation trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal wastewater effluents well nitrified treated wwefs were sampled upstream of disinfection in 200l barrels at four full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp and transported to the university of colorado boulder water reuse laboratory for bench scale testing five sampling events were undertaken two different days at wwtp a i e a1 in spring a2 in summer and one each at wwtp b wwtp c and wwtp d at wwtp c samples were collected both after and before full scale tertiary biofiltration c1 c2 respectively the samples were laboratory filtered 0 45 μm memtrex cartridge filter ge life sciences and stored at 4o c until use general water quality parameters for the wastewater effluents are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental matrix bench scale treatment experiments were conducted to evaluate coagulation coag ozonation o3 biofiltration biof and granular activated carbon gac adsorption as standalone processes and as four different sequential treatment trains across the six wwefs the experimental testing matrix n 55 is summarized in table s1 the o3 biof gac treatment train hypothesized to be the most widely implementable at field scale was evaluated most extensively however each treatment condition i e individual process within a given treatment train was tested on at least two and up to five different wwefs gac treatment was evaluated at specific levels of doc breakthrough ranging from 0 5 mg l to 4 mg l at up to four different runtimes per pre treatment condition for each wwef 2 3 bench scale treatment methods bench scale methods which have been previously demonstrated to simulate field scale performance for removal or transformation of dissolved organic matter were used for coagulation jar tests tseng and edwards 1999 ozonation batch or semi batch calibrated to batch differential uv254 absorbance gifford et al 2018 biofiltration recirculation single pass terry et al 2019 and gac adsorption rapid small scale column test rssct crittenden et al 1991 batch coagulation using alum was done under optimized conditions for total organic carbon toc removal i e 80 mg l coagulant dose and ph 6 5 7 adjusted with hcl in aliquots of 20l to 100l using a top mixer for coagulation experiments the wwefs were not cartridge filtered until after coagulation and sedimentation ozone was generated from pure oxygen tg 40 ozone solutions and applied to 20l aliquots to achieve a transferred dose of 1 1 mg o3 mg doc biofilters were constructed with 25 mm inner diameter glass chromatography columns and packed with pre acclimated anthracite media deff 2 mm sourced from a full scale wwtp tertiary biofilter for wwtp d biological activated carbon bac media was also evaluated it had been in use for over 10 years in a full scale tertiary biofilter indicating sufficient throughput to represent long term bac filter performance for toc removal peterson and summers 2021 biofilters were operated at a hydraulic loading rate of 244 cm hr 1 gpm ft2 under reaction rate limited conditions damköhler number ii 0 1 yielding empty bed contact times ebcts of 15 min

scale ebcts of 10 to 15 min using a proportional diffusivity design 2 4 disinfection byproducts dbp formation was evaluated under ufc i e borate buffered to ph 8 0 0 2 and dosed with sodium hypochlorite to yield a free chlorine residual of 1 0 0 4 mg l after 24 1 hours summers et al 1996 after 24 hr incubation at lab temperature 20 oc the samples were immediately quenched with ascorbic acid and preserved with sodium azide twenty dbps were measured 4 trihalomethanes tthm chloroform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane bromoform 9 haloacetic acids haa9 chloroacetic acid

analysis lau et al 2020 the dbp cytotoxic and genotoxic weighting factors i e lc50 1 and tdna50 1 potency values respectively were those reported by wagner and plewa 2017 from chinese hamster ovary cho mammalian cell assays table s5 2 5 analytical methods toc and doc were measured using a sievers 5310 toc analyzer in accordance with standard method 5310c ultraviolet absorbance was measured at

haloacetic acids were analyzed in accordance with modified epa method 552 2 and the 32 additional dbps were analyzed with solid phase extraction and gc ms see text s1 for additional details 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection byproduct formation and precursor control substantial dbp formation occurred in all six wwefs after ufc chlorination fig 1 and table s2 the average total dbp formation of the wwefs was 365 63 μg l primarily comprised of thms 195 μg l and haloacetic acids haas 154 μg l along with appreciable levels of hans 11 μg l average and haloketones 4 2 μg l this level of dbp formation reflects the higher levels of organic and inorganic precursors i e doc and bromide present in wwefs compared to conventional drinking water sources table 1 treatment provided substantial dbp control that shows the potential to achieve dbp concentrations in advanced treated wwefs that are comparable to those in conventional finished drinking waters krasner et al 2012 obolensky et al 2007 when using a full combination of all treatment processes cbat removed up to 90 or more of doc uva254 chlorine demand and dbp precursors e g doc in wwtp d was reduced from 10 mg l to 0 5 mg l after coag o3 biof gac however each treatment condition uniquely contributed to precursor control across the range of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbp species evaluated some reduced dbp formation while others yielded no change or increased dbp formation 3 1 1 coagulation ozone coagulation as the first cbat process removed a significant portion of efom including some dbp precursors fig s1 coagulation of the high toc wwtp d achieved 39 toc removal and was most effective for controlling thm dihaloacetic acid dhaa and trihaloacetic acid thaa precursors 50 to 60 removal each for the lower toc wwtp a2 coagulation was less effective with 24 toc removal and 24 thm and 40 to 50 dhaa and thaa precursor removal precursors of other dbps including haloacetonitriles and haloketones were not effectively controlled by coagulation ozonation both with and without pre coagulation resulted in similar efom oxidation across all wwefs as indicated by similar decreases in uva254 59 3 and chlorine demand 20 6 figs 1 and s1 however the impact on total dbp formation was more varied ranging from negligible to a 24 decrease table s2 a major contributing factor was the varying impacts of ozone on different organic precursor groups ozonation tended to increase the precursors of monohaloacetic acids mhaas i e 50 increase haloketones and trichloronitromethane resulting in up to a 21 µg l increase in total formation of those species in contrast ozonation had little impact on dhaa precursors but was very effective for oxidizing thaa and haloacetonitrile han4 precursors 50 and 42 decrease respectively this distinct effect of ozone on the dhaa and thaa precursors within efom is consistent with prior research on natural organic matter in surface water hua and reckhow 2013 since there were different relative abundances of dhaa and thaa precursors across the wwefs ranging from approximately equal molar basis in three wwefs to a factor of 1 5 higher dhaa abundance in the other three wwefs haa control by ozonation was most effective when thaa precursors were abundant when evaluated as a combined treatment sequence coag o3 effectively controlled precursors of the highest forming dbps including both carbonaceous and nitrogenous species with net average decrease of 49 tthm 63 haa9 and 48 han4 precursors 3 1 2 biofiltration removal of doc and total dbp precursors in biofilters without pre ozonation was less than 10 and lower than in biofilters after pre ozonation this supports the paradigm that biofiltration is useful for controlling ozone byproducts biofiltration with pre ozonation achieved 21 doc removal at 15 min ebct and then 29 doc removal at 30 min ebct which was in the range of typical reuse biofilter performance under similar operational conditions peterson and summers 2021 the observed tthm reduction 30 was similar to doc removal while higher removal of chlorine demand 43 and haa5 and haa9 precursors 47 and 40 respectively was observed ozone derived dbp precursors were particularly well controlled mhaas haloketones and trichloronitromethane precursors after increasing during ozonation were then removed in biofiltration by 71 53 and 78 respectively the average net changes after o3 biof were a 0 3 µg l increase in trichloronitromethane and decreases in mhaas and haloketones 55 and 17 respectively there was also removal of nitrogenous precursors in non ozonated biofilters e g removal of trichloronitromethane precursors by 70 and han4 precursors by 21 despite low doc removal compared to doc and carbonaceous dbp precursors han precursor removal by biofiltration was more variable across all 11 runs at 30 min ebct han4 formation was decreased in six unchanged in four and increased in one experiment inconsistent performance has been previously reported chu et al 2015 2012 liu et al 2017 selbes et al 2017 and could not be explained by or associated with specific wwefs or upstream treatment conditions the prevailing explanation for increased han formation is the generation and release of nitrogenous soluble microbial products from biofilms arnold et al 2018 chu et al 2012 which are known sources of han precursors huang et al 2013 yu and reckhow 2020 those increases however can be minimized and the control of han formation maximized by increasing ebct in biofilters with and without ozonation han4 formation at 30 min ebct was 22 lower compared to 15 min on a paired basis this impact of ebct on han precursors corresponds with changing microbial communities especially due to changes of substrate availability at different filter depths boon et al 2011 li et al 2017 moll et al 1998 3 1 3 granular activated carbon dbp formation was well controlled with gac treatment fig 1 for example haloketone and trichloronitromethane formation was very low typically below 1 µg l further the control of thm haa and han precursors was strongly associated with the breakthrough of both doc and chlorine demand specifically across the wwefs and with or without pretreatment when gac was run to the same doc breakthrough there was minimal variation in ufc dbp formation at an effluent doc of 2 mg l for example han4 formation was reduced to 2 5 0 8 µg l n 11 breakthrough of doc was faster than breakthrough of han4 formation indicating preferential control of those nitrogenous precursors compared to efom although the variance was higher compared to the carbonaceous species fig s2 future research should continue to evaluate the relationship between han formation and doc after gac treatment for wwefs since the observed relationship average yield of 1 4 µg han4 mg doc r2 0 71 fig s3 indicates the potential for using a doc treatment objective as a surrogate for han4 formation to parallel the approach proposed for tthm and haa5 e g an effluent of 2 mg l doc has been proposed as a target for meeting drinking water tthm and haa5 regulations in potable reuse arnold et al 2018 summers et al 2020 overall gac treatment demonstrated good consistency for controlling the formation of both carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps across all wwefs and pretreatments demonstrating the robustness of carbon based advanced treatment trains for controlling the overall formation of both regulated and unregulated dbps while the different pretreatment processes did not systematically impact gac effluent water quality pretreatment process selection will present gac operational considerations i e in wwtp d the doc of the gac influent was reduced from 10 mg l without pretreatment to 4 5 mg l with coag o3 biof pretreatment which will increase the gac run time to a target effluent and decrease the gac use rate and the cost of gac treatment 3 2 cbat effects on effluent organic matter reactivity an important factor that contributed to dbp precursor control was the preferential removal of the more chlorine reactive organic matter specifically cbat decreased both specific chlorine demand and specific dbp formation i e dbp yields fig 2 ozonation systematically lowered specific chlorine demand from 1 4 0 2 to 1 2 0 1 mg cl2 mg doc subsequent biofiltration and or gac treatment decreased it to about 1 0 mg cl2 mg doc the decrease of specific chlorine demand by biofiltration and gac indicates preferential removal of chlorine reactive organic matter while the effect of ozonation may be a combination of organic matter transformation e g oxidation of uv254 absorbing moieties and oxidation of chlorine reactive inorganic species such as iron or nitrite changes to yields of the different dbp classes and subclasses were also specific to the treatment condition fig 2b for example the combination of o3 biof resulted in significantly lower haa yields particularly mhaa and thaa species on a molar basis molar yields were used to evaluate the reactivity because mass yields are impacted by the concurrent shifts to heavier brominated species dbp yields in gac effluent were lower compared to the gac influent for all species typically by 40 60 and in the case of thaas by up to 90 then yields increased with longer gac runtimes as adsorption capacity was exhausted overall the dbp yields were similar across the wwefs fig 2b and consistent with previously reported yields for both carbonaceous dbps under ufc arnold et al 2018 chuang and mitch 2017 and for hans though on the lower end of the previously reported han range chen and westerhoff 2010 chuang et al 2019 kanan and karanfil 2020 chlorine dose under distribution system conditions including ufc is driven by the need to maintain a target residual for disinfection thus treatment that targets organic matter often characterized by doc and lowers the specific chlorine demand cl2 doc can reduce unintended dbp formation however the decreases in specific chlorine demand were weakly or not associated with decreases in specific dbp formation fig 2 for example after o3 biof treatment yields of thms dhaas and dhans changed by only a small amount 10 despite the large decrease in specific chlorine demand this lack of association may be the result of pre oxidation of chlorine reactive moieties by ozone that are unrelated to halogenated dbp formation e g aromatic ring cleavage in combination with the formation of high yield and low molecular weight compounds during either treatment condition for example efficient conversion of chlorine into thms and hans has been associated with specific ozone byproducts gallard and von gunten 2002 and soluble microbial products yu and reckhow 2020 respectively so those compounds could increase the apparent dbp yields after o3 biof despite an overall reduction in specific chlorine demand after gac treatment yields of thms and hans increased with increasing adsorber runtime corresponding to increasing effluent doc despite no systematic increase in specific chlorine demand the breakthrough behavior of dbp yields during gac treatment indicates preferential adsorption of dbp precursors compared to bulk efom likely by removal of portions of the bulk efom containing molecules that exhibit high yield and or have fast reacting functional groups gallard and von gunten 2002 the difference between chlorine demands and yields warrants future research to better characterize how cbat alters efom reactivity both in the conversion efficiency of chlorine into dbps and the kinetics of those dbp formation reactions 3 3 disinfection byproduct speciation bromine substitution factors the presence of bromide in the wwefs significantly impacted dbp speciation during cbat within each dbp class there was a strong relationship between dbp speciation as measured by the bromine substitution factor bsf hua and reckhow 2012 and the bromide to doc ratio fig 3 a cbat removes efom but not bromide thus increasing the br doc which resulted in more bromide substitution bsf values increased by more than a factor of 10 from as low as 0 05 in the untreated wwef to values as high as 0 8 fig 3a the treatment induced increases in br doc resulted in higher bsf until br doc values of approximately 75 µg mg above which bsf values remained relatively constant these trends were also similar to literature values from the pilot scale cbat of three other wwefs chuang et al 2019 also shown in fig 3a for comparison overall br doc was a good indicator of dbp speciation regardless of wwef or cbat treatment condition the treatment conditions that achieved the highest removal of efom resulted in the largest shifts toward brominated species fig 3b the individual treatment processes of coag o3 and biof had little impact on bsfs but the combination of o3 biof induced systematic speciation changes particularly for dhans with bsf values increasing to 0 4 subsequent gac treatment further removed doc and controlled dbp formation but it also further increased bsf values up to 0 8 the br doc threshold value of 75 µg mg was only reached by gac treatment very similar relationships between bsfs and br doc have been observed previously after gac treatment of both wwefs chuang et al 2019 krasner et al 2016 and surface water zhang et al 2020 as a result bromide substitution at early gac runtimes i e lowest doc concentrations and highest br doc was generally not higher than at longer runtimes except for thms where doc breakthrough from 1 to 3 mg l decreased bsf values from 0 7 to 0 5 high prevalence of brominated dbps should therefore be anticipated when typical wwefs are treated with cbat to potable reuse conditions i e final doc of 1 3 mg l understanding the implication of this tradeoff between improved dbp control at the expense of shifting towards more brominated species however requires a better understanding of health impacts that goes beyond the proxies of concentrations yields and bsfs 3 4 impact of treatment on calculated additive toxicities species and class level approaches the impact of treatment on dbp associated health risk was assessed first using the prevailing species level cat approach see table s5 for equation for the six wwefs and the results are shown in fig 4 the lowest cytotoxicity based cat values were achieved with gac at an effluent doc of 0 5 mg l this represented a decrease of 85 compared to the wwef values and reflects the impact of the high level of organic precursor control fig 2b despite a high propensity to form brominated species fig 3 the cat values remained lower compared to the other treatment conditions until a doc breakthrough of about 3 mg l fig 4a for the other treatment conditions which resulted in doc concentrations from 3 to 6 mg l the impact of doc removal was partially offset by the shift to more brominated species resulting in cat values within the same range as the wwefs the sensitivity of the cat approach to uncertainties in the concentration and potency values was evaluated according to mckenna et al 2020 and the resulting standard error estimates are also shown in fig 4a the toxicity reduction with gac was greater than the estimated uncertainties for each cat value which ranged from 9 13 table s9 the sensitivity of the cat approach to the exclusion of certain dbp classes was also evaluated because exclusion could lead to erroneous conclusions about treatment effectiveness mckenna et al 2020 specifically cat was recalculated for wwtp d after including formation data on 32 additional species 7 haloacetamides 7 haloacetaldehydes 6 iodinated thms 6 additional halonitromethanes and 6 additional haloacetonitriles see table s6 for concentrations overall the cat values increased by a factor of 1 7 but the trends for each treatment condition remained the same when these additional 32 dbps were included fig 4b the analysis was repeated using genotoxic potency factors and the results were similar both when 20 dbps or 52 dbps were assessed fig s4 the reduction in toxicity after gac is consistent with prior studies on four wwefs chuang et al 2019 verdugo et al 2020 and two conventional drinking waters cuthbertson et al 2019 that evaluated a similar set of dbps formed by chlorination the main toxicity drivers after treatment of this wwef which together comprised 40 70 of the total toxicity were consistently just three species one haa bromoacetic acid and two hans bromochloro and dibromoacetonitrile those three were measured in the original set of 20 dbps the additional toxicity was primarily contributed by haloacetaldehydes and haloacetamides however none of these species made up more than 10 of the total additionally the fraction of the toxicity contributed by the additional 32 dbps was reduced with treatment from 50 in the wwefs down to 35 and 18 after o3 biof and gac treatment respectively fig s5 taken together these results indicate that calculations using only the measurement of the original 20 species which rely on established methods epa methods 551 and 552 gave a similar understanding of dbp control with cbat compared to analyses that are more comprehensive but more costly and less accessible the cat analysis demonstrated the potential for cbat to achieve toxicity reduction but it is difficult to make robust generalizable conclusions regarding the impacts of treatment on cat because the cat metric does not explicitly account for the underlying formation and speciation trends i e figs 2 and 3 respectively therefore a modified class level cat approach was developed with the goal of decoupling and explicitly accounting for the underlying formation and speciation trends and in turn enabling the estimation of cat with more general and easily measured dbp surrogates i e doc and bromide for the new approach first class level toxicity factors speciation potencies were calculated using class level speciation data eq 1 speciation potency is the occurrence weighted average of known toxic potency values of all species within a dbp class or subclass shown in fig 5 a as a function of the br doc ratio the potency values from the conventional cho cytotoxicity assay data i e lc50 1 were used in fig 5a but alternative potency metrics could also be used if available for example the approach was repeated using genotoxic potency values i e tdna50 1 and the results were similar fig s6 speciation potency is analogous to bsf but can be more useful to capture the effects of bromide incorporation on health risks equation 1 1 s p e c i a t i o n p o t e n c y j 0 k l c 50 c l k j b r j 1 d b p c l k j b r j j 0 k d b p c l k j b r j where j number of br per compound k number of halogens in the subclass k 1 2 or 3 using this new approach showed that the speciation potency of each dbp class increased as br doc increased during treatment fig 5a this association is driven by the shift toward more brominated species combined with the generally higher potency of brominated dbps in the cho toxicity database cytotoxic speciation potencies were higher after gac treatment compared to the wwefs by up to a factor of 4 for thaas but still much less than the theoretical maximum amount that they could have increased e g by a factor of 20 for dhans and 28 for thaas based on shift from fully chlorinated to fully brominated species the speciation potencies were not impacted by gac runtime because the corresponding br doc values were above 75 µg mg where the highest bromide incorporation occurred second class level toxicity was calculated eq 2 and is presented in fig 5c as a function of doc concentration with this new approach cat can be approximated as a function of only surrogate parameters i e bromide and doc used in this study and the underlying constituents of the calculation dbp speciation and dbp formation are both on a molar basis which allows for direct comparison of their relative impact on the cat metric this calculation starts with regressions to identify the most representative speciation potency values as a function of br doc ratio shown as lines in fig 5a those values are multiplied by the corresponding expected class level dbp concentrations based on doc and dbp yields for a given treatment condition shown as lines for different treatment conditions in fig 5b this step results in the class level cat values for each dbp class or subclass evaluated which can be summed into the total cat value for a water sample the average yields and speciation potencies as a function of br doc and treatment condition which were used for this calculation are tabulated in the supporting information tables s7 and s8 equation 2 2 c

number the class level approach was applied in fig 5c using black lines to show the class level cat trends for each wwtp for comparison the grey line shows the overall trend using the species level approach the convergence of cat values to match the species level values for each wwtp reflects the consistency of dbp formation and speciation trends after gac treatment and the overall reduction in toxicity reflects the larger impact of precursor removal compared to the increases in speciation potencies the new approach provides similar information when compared to the traditional species level approach fig s7 but relies on significantly less and more easily measured data this is particularly helpful when extensive data is not yet available e g during the design stage or when predicting performance changes due to water quality changes especially changes in br or doc levels or is not feasible to collect due to limited resources e g financial or analytical the tradeoff of the generalized approach is higher uncertainty in the estimated cat values i e relative standard errors 20 30 before gac and 15 20 after gac table s9 those uncertainty ranges suggest that toxicity changes across whole treatment trains could be detected using class level estimations but smaller changes such as across individual treatment processes should be treated with caution future work that improves estimations for dbp yields in wastewater effluents especially for nitrogenous dbp species by incorporating new or additional surrogates into treatment specific predictive models would benefit this approach by reducing the standard errors especially compared to the relatively simple formation and speciation models used in this study to demonstrate the approach 3 5 relationships between doc removal and changes in cat along cbat trains the use of bromide and doc as surrogates for estimating toxicity revealed that cbat can be generally expected to lower dbp associated risks but different cbat configurations can be used to meet a wide range of site specific treatment goals that may not always be effective for reducing toxicity since doc removal is one of the most measured surrogates for water quality improvements its relationship with toxicity removal was evaluated to determine its potential as a helpful proxy for health risks for the various treatment trains we evaluated it was not useful for ozonation fig 6 a or biofiltration alone fig 6b both treatments resulted in relatively low doc removal 10 but were effective for toxicity removal up to 40 due to lower han formation without a significant shift to more brominated species in contrast coagulation removed significant doc up to 40 but increased toxicity which was only marginally improved with subsequent o3 fig 6a or o3 biof fig 6b together the combination coag o3 biof was very effective for toc removal but represented a risk of toxicity increase due to a combination of poor han precursor removal and a shift toward brominated species without pre coagulation though the combination of o3 biof achieved similar levels of doc removal and toxicity reduction 25 to 40 and 20 to 50 respectively especially at 30 min ebct when han precursor control was maximized fig 6b the use of gac as a final treatment condition resulted in a strong relationship between doc removal and toxicity removal fig 6c independent of upstream treatment conditions a doc breakthrough of 2 mg l or less resulted in similar reductions of corresponding toxicity 50 to 95 and doc 60 to 95 significant breakthrough of more toxic dbps occurred only after extended run times doc removal 60 effluent doc 3 mg l the toxicity removal during shorter gac run times is attributable to the greater impact of preferential adsorption of both carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbp precursors compared to the shift toward more brominated species pre treatment processes upstream of gac may be required to meet other site specific objectives e g disinfection or extending gac run times by improving efom removal but the pre treatment processes evaluated in this study were not required to achieve the lower toxicity 4 conclusions transformation and removal of effluent organic matter with cbat treatment processes coagulation ozonation biofiltration and or gac adsorption evaluated for six wwefs preferentially lowered free chlorine demand and decreased the yields of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps significant decreases in total dbp formation coincided with shifts toward formation of the more toxic species trends were identified to relate shifts in dbp speciation with the type and extent of treatment process es used using cyto and genotoxicity cho values revealed that precursor removal with o3 biof and or gac was systematically more impactful than the shift toward more potent species resulting in lower calculated additive toxicity measurement of 20 dbps using widely available and established methods captured the toxicity driving species and yielded similar evaluations of treatment efficacy compared to more extensive measurements of 52 dbps speciation potency was introduced and calculated to compare class level dbp speciation

15856,for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater effluent carbon based advanced treatment cbat using coagulation ozonation biofiltration and or granular activated carbon gac adsorption is a promising approach for controlling disinfection byproduct dbp formation however cbat can also favor a shift in dbp formation to more toxic brominated dbp species to protect public health treatment specific dbp formation and speciation trends need to be identified and understood first this study systematically evaluated the treatment of six wastewater effluents with four cbat process trains experimental n was 55 and measured dbp formation and speciation trends overall cbat decreased dbp formation by 90 and gac preferentially removed highly reactive effluent organic matter as indicated by lower yields of both highly forming and highly toxic classes of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps since gac treatment also induced systematic speciation changes by increasing the ratio of bromide to dissolved organic matter the second part of this study focused on understanding the health impacts of dbp speciation changes on calculated additive toxicity cat based on the evaluation of 20 dbps measured using established methods the cat values from cyto and genotoxicity metrics decreased by as much as 85 due to high levels of precursor removal by gac expanding the evaluation to include 52 dbps measured using more extensive analytical methods resulted in the same conclusions this study also developed a speciation potency metric that re scales class by class speciation trends using toxic potency factors e g cytotoxicity lc50 the observed shifts in dbp speciation after treatment increased the class level toxic potency factors by up to a factor of 4 a greater amount of precursor removal is required for treatment to reduce toxicity which was achieved with cbat trains this proposed approach of combining speciation potency with dbp yields enables evaluation of dbp associated risk with easily measured surrogates i e bromide and dissolved organic carbon doc by identifying and quantitatively comparing dbp formation and speciation trends over multiple wastewater effluents and treatment trains this study demonstrates that cbat can be a robust approach to dbp precursor removal for potable reuse keywords potable reuse halogenated dbps biofiltration gac bromine substitution additive toxicity 1 introduction drinking water utilities across the globe are expanding and diversifying their water supply portfolios to increase capacity and resilience in response to current and growing water stress lee and jepson 2020 the new water sources under consideration such as wastewater effluent wwef for potable reuse are often highly impacted by microbial and chemical contaminants national research council 2012 early adopters of potable reuse have used extensive and advanced treatment trains to control the pathogenic and chemical health risks associated with wwef as a source water gerrity et al 2013 however technology selection to address a wide range of treatment objectives in a robust and cost effective manner remains a significant challenge for utilities and insights into treatment efficacy that support such decision making are needed control of halogenated disinfection byproduct dbp formation is an important treatment objective in potable reuse to protect public health from chemical risks national research council 2012 disinfection with free chlorine remains an important method for pathogen control in many reuse scenarios but free chlorine reacts with effluent organic matter efom and halide ions which are ubiquitous in wwefs to form halogenated dbps reverse osmosis effectively controls halogenated dbp formation through efom and halide ion removal zeng et al 2016 but is costly and energy intensive particularly for brine disposal in inland locations noibi et al 2020 schimmoller and kealy 2014 alternative treatment trains are being explored especially carbon based advanced treatment cbat trains that utilize coagulation ozonation biofiltration and or granular activated carbon gac adsorption chuang et al 2019 however the cbat conditions needed to control dbp associated health risks are not yet established krasner et al 2016 therefore to identify approaches for monitoring and controlling dbp associated risk in potable reuse scenarios this study systematically evaluated dbp precursor control with cbat processes across a range of wastewater effluents the uncertainty about controlling dbp associated risk with cbat stems from the inherent tradeoff between lowering overall dbp formation but shifting toward formation of brominated species summers et al 1993 this tradeoff is centered on efom removal which can lower dbp formation through removal of organic precursors but simultaneously increases the formation of hobr via reaction between hocl and br which is not removed by cbat causing speciation shifts toward bromide containing dbps chuang et al 2019 cuthbertson et al 2019 which can be orders of magnitude more toxic than their chlorinated analogues wagner and plewa 2017 higher hobr formation can also increase molar yields of some dbps including trihalomethanes thms and haloacetonitriles hans hua et al 2006 kanan and karanfil 2020 liu et al 2018 and result in an increase in the more toxic species after treatment if organic precursor removal is insufficient it is imperative to understand the treatment specific relationships between dbp formation and speciation to understand the conditions when cbat can be expected to lower both dbp formation and dbp associated toxicity few studies have investigated precursor control with cbat under operationally representative conditions significant dbp formation potential is expected in wwefs chen and westerhoff 2010 krasner et al 2009 though formation potential tests can underrepresent the formation of more toxic species kanan and karanfil 2020 there are studies that have used simulated distribution system conditions e g uniform formation conditions ufc summers et al 1996 to test the control of dbps and dbp associated toxicity in wwefs arnold et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 summers et al 2020 verdugo et al 2020 but those studies evaluated a limited number of wwefs and cbat process configurations therefore to support more widespread cbat implementation a systematic comparative analysis of cbat processes and treatment trains is needed to identify the conditions where the benefits of organic precursor removal outweigh the negative impacts of speciation changes on dbp associated risk development of a treatment oriented quantitative approach to compare the impacts of both dbp formation and speciation on dbp associated risk requires a class level approach because the occurrence of intra class species is not independent e g dbps within the same class form from a common set of organic precursors and their speciation reflects the extent of bromide incorporation several studies have focused on dbp class level trends for example as yields for total dbp formation arnold et al 2018 krasner et al 2008 and as bromide substitution factors for the speciation arnold et al 2018 chuang et al 2019 chuang and mitch 2017 krasner et al 2016 those metrics are used to generalize dbp occurrence trends with readily available surrogates for organic and inorganic precursors i e dissolved organic carbon doc and bromide but they are incompatible for direct comparison an alternative approach calculated additive toxicity cat has been widely used to evaluate the dbp associated quality of drinking waters allen et al 2021 cuthbertson et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 and reuse waters chuang et al 2019 verdugo et al 2020 zeng and mitch 2016 the cat approach which uses the toxic potencies of all measured dbp species to calculate a weighted sum value of total dbp occurrence implicitly captures changes in both dbp formation and dbp speciation however it is difficult to generalize treatment trends with cat in its current form because it is evaluated on a species level rather than on a class level therefore a modified class level cat approach is needed in which class level toxic potency factors are identified for a range of water qualities and treatment processes that can be paired with class level dbp formation trends when calculating the weighted sums this approach would explicitly decouple the underlying formation and speciation effects and allow for generalization of those trends using surrogate parameters to support public health decision making in a more feasible practical and affordable manner we hypothesized that both the formation and speciation of halogenated dbp species in cbat treated potable reuse waters would follow predictable trends so the first objective of this study was to systematically evaluate dbp precursor control with coagulation ozonation biofiltration and gac adsorption across a range of municipal wwtp effluents with a focus on priority unregulated dbp species treatment specific changes to precursor amount and reactivity plus changes in speciation were evaluated using relationships with the amount of bromide and doc as surrogate parameters the second objective was to use those relationships to extend the cat framework to quantitatively evaluate tradeoffs between lower dbp formation and the shift to more toxic species and then to identify which treatment configurations were effective for improving dbp associated water quality across a range of possible organic precursor removal goals the goal of this approach was to enable the estimation of dbp associated risk using easily measured surrogates by leveraging the observed class level formation and speciation trends 2 materials and methods 2 1 municipal wastewater effluents well nitrified treated wwefs were sampled upstream of disinfection in 200l barrels at four full scale municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp and transported to the university of colorado boulder water reuse laboratory for bench scale testing five sampling events were undertaken two different days at wwtp a i e a1 in spring a2 in summer and one each at wwtp b wwtp c and wwtp d at wwtp c samples were collected both after and before full scale tertiary biofiltration c1 c2 respectively the samples were laboratory filtered 0 45 μm memtrex cartridge filter ge life sciences and stored at 4o c until use general water quality parameters for the wastewater effluents are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental matrix bench scale treatment experiments were conducted to evaluate coagulation coag ozonation o3 biofiltration biof and granular activated carbon gac adsorption as standalone processes and as four different sequential treatment trains across the six wwefs the experimental testing matrix n 55 is summarized in table s1 the o3 biof gac treatment train hypothesized to be the most widely implementable at field scale was evaluated most extensively however each treatment condition i e individual process within a given treatment train was tested on at least two and up to five different wwefs gac treatment was evaluated at specific levels of doc breakthrough ranging from 0 5 mg l to 4 mg l at up to four different runtimes per pre treatment condition for each wwef 2 3 bench scale treatment methods bench scale methods which have been previously demonstrated to simulate field scale performance for removal or transformation of dissolved organic matter were used for coagulation jar tests tseng and edwards 1999 ozonation batch or semi batch calibrated to batch differential uv254 absorbance gifford et al 2018 biofiltration recirculation single

i e 80 mg l coagulant dose and ph 6 5 7 adjusted with hcl in aliquots of 20l to 100l using a top mixer for coagulation experiments the wwefs were not cartridge filtered until after coagulation and sedimentation ozone was generated from pure oxygen tg 40 ozone solutions and applied to 20l aliquots to achieve a transferred dose of 1 1 mg o3 mg doc biofilters were constructed with 25 mm inner diameter glass chromatography columns and packed with pre acclimated anthracite media deff 2 mm sourced from a full scale wwtp tertiary biofilter for wwtp d biological activated carbon bac media was also evaluated it had been in use for over 10 years in a full scale tertiary biofilter indicating sufficient throughput to represent long term bac filter performance for toc removal peterson and

scale ebcts of 10 to 15 min using a proportional diffusivity design 2 4 disinfection byproducts dbp formation was evaluated under ufc i e borate buffered to ph 8 0 0 2 and dosed with sodium hypochlorite to yield a free chlorine residual of 1 0 0 4 mg l after 24 1 hours summers et al 1996 after 24 hr incubation at lab temperature 20 oc the samples were immediately quenched with ascorbic acid and preserved with sodium azide twenty dbps were measured 4 trihalomethanes tthm chloroform bromodichloromethane chlorodibromomethane bromoform 9 haloacetic acids haa9 chloroacetic acid

haloacetic acids were analyzed in accordance with modified epa method 552 2 and the 32 additional dbps were analyzed with solid phase extraction and gc ms see text s1 for additional details 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection byproduct formation and precursor control substantial dbp formation occurred in all six wwefs after ufc chlorination fig 1 and table s2 the average total dbp formation of the wwefs was 365 63 μg l primarily comprised of thms 195 μg l and haloacetic acids haas 154 μg l along with appreciable levels of hans 11 μg l average and haloketones 4 2 μg l this level of dbp formation reflects the higher levels of organic and inorganic precursors i e doc and bromide present in wwefs compared to conventional drinking water sources table 1 treatment provided substantial dbp control that shows the potential to achieve dbp concentrations in advanced treated wwefs that are comparable to those in conventional finished drinking waters krasner et al 2012 obolensky et al 2007 when using a full combination of all treatment processes cbat removed up to 90 or more of doc uva254 chlorine demand and dbp precursors e g doc in wwtp d was reduced from 10 mg l to 0 5 mg l after coag o3 biof gac however each treatment condition uniquely contributed to precursor control across the range of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbp species evaluated some reduced dbp formation while others yielded no change or increased dbp formation 3 1 1 coagulation ozone coagulation as the first cbat process removed a significant portion of efom including some dbp precursors fig s1 coagulation of the high toc wwtp d achieved 39 toc removal and was most effective for controlling thm dihaloacetic acid dhaa and trihaloacetic acid thaa precursors 50 to 60 removal each for the lower toc wwtp a2 coagulation was less effective with 24 toc removal and 24 thm and 40 to 50 dhaa and thaa precursor removal precursors of other dbps including haloacetonitriles and haloketones were not effectively controlled by coagulation ozonation both with and without pre coagulation resulted in similar efom oxidation across all wwefs as indicated by similar decreases in uva254 59 3 and chlorine demand 20 6 figs 1 and s1 however the impact on total dbp formation was more varied ranging from negligible to a 24 decrease table s2 a major contributing factor was the varying impacts of ozone on different organic precursor groups ozonation tended to increase the precursors of monohaloacetic acids mhaas i e 50 increase haloketones and trichloronitromethane resulting in up to a 21 µg l increase in total formation of those species in contrast ozonation had little impact on dhaa precursors but was very effective for oxidizing thaa and haloacetonitrile han4 precursors 50 and 42 decrease respectively this distinct effect of ozone on the dhaa and thaa precursors within efom is consistent with prior research on natural organic matter in surface water hua and reckhow 2013 since there were different relative abundances of dhaa and thaa precursors across the wwefs ranging from approximately equal molar basis in three wwefs to a factor of 1 5 higher dhaa abundance in the other three wwefs haa control by ozonation was most effective when thaa precursors were abundant when evaluated as a combined treatment sequence coag o3 effectively controlled precursors of the highest forming dbps including both carbonaceous and nitrogenous species with net average decrease of 49 tthm 63 haa9 and 48 han4 precursors 3 1 2 biofiltration removal of doc and total dbp precursors in biofilters without pre ozonation was less than 10 and lower than in biofilters after pre ozonation this supports the paradigm that biofiltration is useful for controlling ozone byproducts biofiltration with pre ozonation achieved 21 doc removal at 15 min ebct and then 29 doc removal at 30 min ebct which was in the range of typical reuse biofilter performance under similar operational conditions peterson and summers 2021 the observed tthm reduction 30 was similar to doc removal while higher removal of chlorine demand 43 and haa5 and haa9 precursors 47 and 40 respectively was observed ozone derived dbp precursors were particularly well controlled mhaas haloketones and trichloronitromethane precursors after increasing during ozonation were then removed in biofiltration by 71 53 and 78 respectively the average net changes after o3 biof were a 0 3 µg l increase in trichloronitromethane and decreases in mhaas and haloketones 55 and 17 respectively there was also removal of nitrogenous precursors in non ozonated biofilters e g removal of trichloronitromethane precursors by 70 and han4 precursors by 21 despite low doc removal compared to doc and carbonaceous dbp precursors han precursor removal by biofiltration was more variable across all 11 runs at 30 min ebct han4 formation was decreased in six unchanged in four and increased in one experiment inconsistent performance has been previously reported chu et al 2015 2012 liu et al 2017 selbes et al 2017 and could not be explained by or associated with specific wwefs or upstream treatment conditions the prevailing explanation for increased han formation is the generation and release of nitrogenous soluble microbial products from biofilms arnold et al 2018 chu et al 2012 which are known sources of han precursors huang et al 2013 yu and reckhow 2020 those increases however can be minimized and the control of han formation maximized by increasing ebct in biofilters with and without ozonation han4 formation at 30 min ebct was 22 lower compared to 15 min on a paired basis this impact of ebct on han precursors corresponds with changing microbial communities especially due to changes of substrate availability at different filter depths boon et al 2011 li et al 2017 moll et al 1998 3 1 3 granular activated carbon dbp formation was well controlled with gac treatment fig 1 for example haloketone and trichloronitromethane formation was very low typically below 1 µg l further the control of thm haa and han precursors was strongly associated with the breakthrough of both doc and chlorine demand specifically across the wwefs and with or without pretreatment when gac was run to the same doc breakthrough there was minimal variation in ufc dbp formation at an effluent doc of 2 mg l for example han4 formation was reduced to 2 5 0 8 µg l n 11 breakthrough of doc was faster than breakthrough of han4 formation indicating preferential control of those nitrogenous precursors compared to efom although the variance was higher compared to the carbonaceous species fig s2 future research should continue to evaluate the relationship between han formation and doc after gac treatment for wwefs since the observed relationship average yield of 1 4 µg han4 mg doc r2 0 71 fig s3 indicates the potential for using a doc treatment objective as a surrogate for han4 formation to parallel the approach proposed for tthm and haa5 e g an effluent of 2 mg l doc has been proposed as a target for meeting drinking water tthm and haa5 regulations in potable reuse arnold et al 2018 summers et al 2020 overall gac treatment demonstrated good consistency for controlling the formation of both carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps across all wwefs and pretreatments demonstrating the robustness of carbon based advanced treatment trains for controlling the overall formation of both regulated and unregulated dbps while the different pretreatment processes did not systematically impact gac effluent water quality pretreatment process selection will present gac operational considerations i e in wwtp d the doc of the gac influent was reduced from 10 mg l without pretreatment to 4 5 mg l with coag o3 biof pretreatment which will increase the gac run time to a target effluent and decrease the gac use rate and the cost of gac treatment 3 2 cbat effects on effluent organic matter reactivity an important factor that contributed to dbp precursor control was the preferential removal of the more chlorine reactive organic matter specifically cbat decreased both specific chlorine demand and specific dbp formation i e dbp yields fig 2 ozonation systematically lowered specific chlorine demand from 1 4 0 2 to 1 2 0 1 mg cl2 mg doc subsequent biofiltration and or gac treatment decreased it to about 1 0 mg cl2 mg doc the decrease of specific chlorine demand by biofiltration and gac indicates preferential removal of chlorine reactive organic matter while the effect of ozonation may be a combination of organic matter transformation e g oxidation of uv254 absorbing moieties and oxidation of chlorine reactive inorganic species such as iron or nitrite changes to yields of the different dbp classes and subclasses were also specific to the treatment condition fig 2b for example the combination of o3 biof resulted in significantly lower haa yields particularly mhaa and thaa species on a molar basis molar yields were used to evaluate the reactivity because mass yields are impacted by the concurrent shifts to heavier brominated species dbp yields in gac effluent were lower compared to the gac influent for all species typically by 40 60 and in the case of thaas by up to 90 then yields increased with longer gac runtimes as adsorption capacity was exhausted overall the dbp yields were similar across the wwefs fig 2b and consistent with previously reported yields for both carbonaceous dbps under ufc arnold et al 2018 chuang and mitch 2017 and for hans though on the lower end of the previously reported han range chen and westerhoff 2010 chuang et al 2019 kanan and karanfil 2020 chlorine dose under distribution system conditions including ufc is driven by the need to maintain a target residual for disinfection thus treatment that targets organic matter often characterized by doc and lowers the specific chlorine demand cl2 doc can reduce unintended dbp formation however the decreases in specific chlorine demand were weakly or not associated with decreases in specific dbp formation fig 2 for example after o3 biof treatment yields of thms dhaas and dhans changed by only a small amount 10 despite the large decrease in specific chlorine demand this lack of association may be the result of pre oxidation of chlorine reactive moieties by ozone that are unrelated to halogenated dbp formation e g aromatic ring cleavage in combination with the formation of high yield and low molecular weight compounds during either treatment condition for example efficient conversion of chlorine into thms and hans has been associated with specific ozone byproducts gallard and von gunten 2002 and soluble microbial products yu and reckhow 2020 respectively so those compounds could increase the apparent dbp yields after o3 biof despite an overall reduction in specific chlorine demand after gac treatment yields of thms and hans increased with increasing adsorber runtime corresponding to increasing effluent doc despite no systematic increase in specific chlorine demand the breakthrough behavior of dbp yields during gac treatment indicates preferential adsorption of dbp precursors compared to bulk efom likely by removal of portions of the bulk efom containing molecules that exhibit high yield and or have fast reacting functional groups gallard and von gunten 2002 the difference between chlorine demands and yields warrants future research to better characterize how cbat alters efom reactivity both in the conversion efficiency of chlorine into dbps and the kinetics of those dbp formation reactions 3 3 disinfection byproduct speciation bromine substitution factors the presence of bromide in the wwefs significantly impacted dbp speciation during cbat within each dbp class there was a strong relationship between dbp speciation as measured by the bromine substitution factor bsf hua and reckhow 2012 and the bromide to doc ratio fig 3 a cbat removes efom but not bromide thus increasing the br doc which resulted in more bromide substitution bsf values increased by more than a factor of 10 from as low as 0 05 in the untreated wwef to values as high as 0 8 fig 3a the treatment induced increases in br doc resulted in higher bsf until br doc values of approximately 75 µg mg above which bsf values remained relatively constant these trends were also similar to literature values from the pilot scale cbat of three other wwefs chuang et al 2019 also shown in fig 3a for comparison overall br doc was a good indicator of dbp speciation regardless of wwef or cbat treatment condition the treatment conditions that achieved the highest removal of efom resulted in the largest shifts toward brominated species fig 3b the individual treatment processes of coag o3 and biof had little impact on bsfs but the combination of o3 biof induced systematic speciation changes particularly for dhans with bsf values increasing to 0 4 subsequent gac treatment further removed doc and controlled dbp formation but it also further increased bsf values up to 0 8 the br doc threshold value of 75 µg mg was only reached by gac treatment very similar relationships between bsfs and br doc have been observed previously after gac treatment of both wwefs chuang et al 2019 krasner et al 2016 and surface water zhang et al 2020 as a result bromide substitution at early gac runtimes i e lowest doc concentrations and highest br doc was generally not higher than at longer runtimes except for thms where doc breakthrough from 1 to 3 mg l decreased bsf values from 0 7 to 0 5 high prevalence of brominated dbps should therefore be anticipated when typical wwefs are treated with cbat to potable reuse conditions i e final doc of 1 3 mg l understanding the implication of this tradeoff between improved dbp control at the expense of shifting towards more brominated species however requires a better understanding of health impacts that goes beyond the proxies of concentrations yields and bsfs 3 4 impact of treatment on calculated additive toxicities species and class level approaches the impact of treatment on dbp associated health risk was assessed first using the prevailing species level cat approach see table s5 for equation for the six wwefs and the results are shown in fig 4 the lowest cytotoxicity based cat values were achieved with gac at an effluent doc of 0 5 mg l this represented a decrease of 85 compared to the wwef values and reflects the impact of the high level of organic precursor control fig 2b despite a high propensity to form brominated species fig 3 the cat values remained lower compared to the other treatment conditions until a doc breakthrough of about 3 mg l fig 4a for the other treatment conditions which resulted in doc concentrations from 3 to 6 mg l the impact of doc removal was partially offset by the shift to more brominated species resulting in cat values within the same range as the wwefs the sensitivity of the cat approach to uncertainties in the concentration and potency values was evaluated according to mckenna et al 2020 and the resulting standard error estimates are also shown in fig 4a the toxicity reduction with gac was greater than the estimated uncertainties for each cat value which ranged from 9 13 table s9 the sensitivity of the cat approach to the exclusion of certain dbp classes was also evaluated because exclusion could lead to erroneous conclusions about treatment effectiveness mckenna et al 2020 specifically cat was recalculated for wwtp d after including formation data on 32 additional species 7 haloacetamides 7 haloacetaldehydes 6 iodinated thms 6 additional halonitromethanes and 6 additional haloacetonitriles see table s6 for concentrations overall the cat values increased by a factor of 1 7 but the trends for each treatment condition remained the same when these additional 32 dbps were included fig 4b the analysis was repeated using genotoxic potency factors and the results were similar both when 20 dbps or 52 dbps were assessed fig s4 the reduction in toxicity after gac is consistent with prior studies on four wwefs chuang et al 2019 verdugo et al 2020 and two conventional drinking waters cuthbertson et al 2019 that evaluated a similar set of dbps formed by chlorination the main toxicity drivers after treatment of this wwef which together comprised 40 70 of the total toxicity were consistently just three species one haa bromoacetic acid and two hans bromochloro and dibromoacetonitrile those three were measured in the original set of 20 dbps the additional toxicity was primarily contributed by haloacetaldehydes and haloacetamides however none of these species made up more than 10 of the total additionally the fraction of the toxicity contributed by the additional 32 dbps was reduced with treatment from 50 in the wwefs down to 35 and 18 after o3 biof and gac treatment respectively fig s5 taken together these results indicate that calculations using only the measurement of the original 20 species which rely on established methods epa methods 551 and 552 gave a similar understanding of dbp control with cbat compared to analyses that are more comprehensive but more costly and less accessible the cat analysis demonstrated the potential for cbat to achieve toxicity reduction but it is difficult to make robust generalizable conclusions regarding the impacts of treatment on cat because the cat metric does not explicitly account for the underlying formation and speciation trends i e figs 2 and 3 respectively therefore a modified class level cat approach was developed with the goal of decoupling and explicitly accounting for the underlying formation and speciation trends and in turn enabling the estimation of cat with more general and easily measured dbp surrogates i e doc and bromide for the new approach first class level toxicity factors speciation potencies were calculated using class level speciation data eq 1 speciation potency is the occurrence weighted average of known toxic potency values of all species within a dbp class or subclass shown in fig 5 a as a function of the br doc ratio the potency values from the conventional cho cytotoxicity assay data i e lc50 1 were used in fig 5a but alternative potency metrics could also be used if available for example the approach was repeated using genotoxic potency values i e tdna50 1 and the results were similar fig s6 speciation potency is analogous to bsf but can be more useful to capture the effects of bromide incorporation on health risks equation 1 1 s p e c i a t i o n p o t e n c y j 0 k l c 50 c l k j b r j 1 d b p c l k j b r j j 0 k d b p c l k j b r j where j number of br per compound k number of halogens in the subclass k 1 2 or 3 using this new approach showed that the speciation potency of each dbp class increased as br doc increased during treatment fig 5a this association is driven by the shift toward more brominated species combined with the generally higher potency of brominated dbps in the cho toxicity database cytotoxic speciation potencies were higher after gac treatment compared to the wwefs by up to a factor of 4 for thaas but still much less than the theoretical maximum amount that they could have increased e g by a factor of 20 for dhans and 28 for thaas based on shift from fully chlorinated to fully brominated species the speciation potencies were not impacted by gac runtime because the corresponding br doc values were above 75 µg mg where the highest bromide incorporation occurred second class level toxicity was calculated eq 2 and is presented in fig 5c as a function of doc concentration with this new approach cat can be approximated as a function of only surrogate parameters i e bromide and doc used in this study and the underlying constituents of the calculation dbp speciation and dbp formation are both on a molar basis which allows for direct comparison of their relative impact on the cat metric this calculation starts with regressions to identify the most representative speciation potency values as a function of br doc ratio shown as lines in fig 5a those values are multiplied by the corresponding expected class level dbp concentrations based on doc and dbp yields for a given treatment condition shown as lines for different treatment conditions in fig 5b this step results in the class level cat values for each dbp class or subclass evaluated which can be summed into the total cat value for a water sample the average yields and speciation potencies as a function of br doc and treatment condition which were used for this calculation are tabulated in the supporting information tables s7 and s8 equation 2 2 c

number the class level approach was applied in fig 5c using black lines to show the class level cat trends for each wwtp for comparison the grey line shows the overall trend using the species level approach the convergence of cat values to match the species level values for each wwtp reflects the consistency of dbp formation and speciation trends after gac treatment and the overall reduction in toxicity reflects the larger impact of precursor removal compared to the increases in speciation potencies the new approach provides similar information when compared to the traditional species level approach fig s7 but relies on significantly less and more easily measured data this is particularly helpful when extensive data is not yet available e g during the design stage or when predicting performance changes due to water quality changes especially changes in br or doc levels or is not feasible to collect due to limited resources e g financial or analytical the tradeoff of the generalized approach is higher uncertainty in the estimated cat values i e relative standard errors 20 30 before gac and 15 20 after gac table s9 those uncertainty ranges suggest that toxicity changes across whole treatment trains could be detected using class level estimations but smaller changes such as across individual treatment processes should be treated with caution future work that improves estimations for dbp yields in wastewater effluents especially for nitrogenous dbp species by incorporating new or additional surrogates into treatment specific predictive models would benefit this approach by reducing the standard errors especially compared to the relatively simple formation and speciation models used in this study to demonstrate the approach 3 5 relationships between doc removal and changes in cat along cbat trains the use of bromide and doc as surrogates for estimating toxicity revealed that cbat can be generally expected to lower dbp associated risks but different cbat configurations can be used to meet a wide range of site specific treatment goals that may not always be effective for reducing toxicity since doc removal is one of the most measured surrogates for water quality improvements its relationship with toxicity removal was evaluated to determine its potential as a helpful proxy for health risks for the various treatment trains we evaluated it was not useful for ozonation fig 6 a or biofiltration alone fig 6b both treatments resulted in relatively low doc removal 10 but were effective for toxicity removal up to 40 due to lower han formation without a significant shift to more brominated species in contrast coagulation removed significant doc up to 40 but increased toxicity which was only marginally improved with subsequent o3 fig 6a or o3 biof fig 6b together the combination coag o3 biof was very effective for toc removal but represented a risk of toxicity increase due to a combination of poor han precursor removal and a shift toward brominated species without pre coagulation though the combination of o3 biof achieved similar levels of doc removal and toxicity reduction 25 to 40 and 20 to 50 respectively especially at 30 min ebct when han precursor control was maximized fig 6b the use of gac as a final treatment condition resulted in a strong relationship between doc removal and toxicity removal fig 6c independent of upstream treatment conditions a doc breakthrough of 2 mg l or less resulted in similar reductions of corresponding toxicity 50 to 95 and doc 60 to 95 significant breakthrough of more toxic dbps occurred only after extended run times doc removal 60 effluent doc 3 mg l the toxicity removal during shorter gac run times is attributable to the greater impact of preferential adsorption of both carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbp precursors compared to the shift toward more brominated species pre treatment processes upstream of gac may be required to meet other site specific objectives e g disinfection or extending gac run times by improving efom removal but the pre treatment processes evaluated in this study were not required to achieve the lower toxicity 4 conclusions transformation and removal of effluent organic matter with cbat treatment processes coagulation ozonation biofiltration and or gac adsorption evaluated for six wwefs preferentially lowered free chlorine demand and decreased the yields of carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps significant decreases in total dbp formation coincided with shifts toward formation of the more toxic species trends were identified to relate shifts in dbp speciation with the type and extent of treatment process es used using cyto and genotoxicity cho values revealed that precursor removal with o3 biof and or gac was systematically more impactful than the shift toward more potent species resulting in lower calculated additive toxicity measurement of 20 dbps using widely available and established methods captured the toxicity driving species and yielded similar evaluations of treatment efficacy compared to more extensive measurements of 52 dbps speciation potency was introduced and calculated to compare class level dbp speciation trends with class level dbp formation trends this approach leverages those trends to estimate dbp associated risk with easily measured surrogate parameters and to identify the treatment conditions where toxicity decreases or increases can be expected use of o3 biof and or gac was effective for control of a wide range of dbp precursors and it resulted in improved dbp associated water quality despite a shift to the formation of the more toxic species the exception occurred when pre coagulation was used without final gac coag o3 biof while that treatment train can potentially meet doc treatment targets it could result in toxicity increases especially if han precursor control during biofiltration is not effective declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15857,we designed and validated a sensitive continuous in situ remotely reporting tryptophan like fluorescence sensor and coupled it with a machine learning model to predict high risk fecal contamination in water 10 colony forming units cfu 100ml e coli we characterized the sensor s response to multiple fluorescence interferents with benchtop analysis the sensor s minimum detection limit mdl of tryptophan dissolved in deionized water was 0 05 ppb p 0 01 and its mdl of the correlation to e coli present in wastewater effluent was 10 cfu 100 ml p 0 01 fluorescence response declined exponentially with increased water temperature and a correction factor was calculated inner filter effects which cause signal attenuation at high concentrations were shown to have negligible impact in an operational context biofouling was demonstrated to increase the fluorescence signal by approximately 82 in a certain context while mineral scaling reduced the sensitivity of the sensor by approximately 5 after 24 hours with a scaling solution containing 8 times the mineral concentration of the colorado river a machine learning model was developed with tlf measurements as the primary feature to output fecal contamination risk levels established by the world health organization a training and validation data set for the model was built by installing four sensors on boulder creek colorado for 88 days and enumerating 298 grab samples for e coli with membrane filtration the machine learning model incorporated a proxy feature for fouling time since last cleaning which improved model performance a binary classification model was able to predict high risk fecal contamination with 83 accuracy 95 ci 78 87 sensitivity of 80 and specificity of 86 a model distinguishing between all world health organization established risk categories performed with an overall accuracy of 64 integrating tlf measurements into an ml model allows for anomaly detection and noise reduction permitting contamination prediction despite biofilm or mineral scaling formation on the sensor s lenses real time detection of high risk fecal contamination could contribute to a major step forward in terms of microbial water quality monitoring for human health keywords tryptophan like fluorescence coiforms microbial contamination groundwater indicator instrumentation iot 1 introduction as many as two billion people worldwide use a drinking water source that is contaminated with feces bain et al 2014a unicef who 2021 who 2019 at least 122 million people globally still use surface water as their main drinking water source who 2020 drinking fecally contaminated water causes adverse health effects including diarrhea and stunting particularly among children under 5 in low and middle income countries clasen et al 2007 goddard et al 2020 pickering et al 2019 diarrheal diseases are the fifth leading cause of morbidity for people of all ages and the third leading cause for children ages 0 9 abbafati 2020 approximately 60 of all diarrheal deaths are related to water quality globally prüss ustün et al 2019 outbreaks are common in high income countries as well deflorio barker et al 2021 at least 40 million people in the united states rely on domestic wells for their drinking water supply which are not regulated by the u s environmental protection agency epa johnson et al 2019 between 1971 and 2008 30 of all waterborne outbreaks in the u s were associated with the consumption of untreated groundwater craun et al 2010 the epa estimates that approximately 16 4 million cases of acute gastrointestinal illness are due to unsafe drinking water in the united states annually messner 2006 1 1 microbial water quality monitoring in both academic research and professional practice estimates of contamination are mostly based on infrequent point measurements with small sample sizes bain et al 2014a more frequent testing is often limited by the established methods used to identify fecal contamination the world health organization who recommends escherichia coli e coli as the primary indicator of fecal contamination in drinking water unicef 2016 water service providers researchers and governmental organizations responsible for measuring water quality use e coli or other fecal indicator bacteria fib to estimate health risk related to fecal contamination fib are quantified by retrieving a sample from the water point taking it to the lab and culturing for 18 24 hours these tests on average cost 21 including consumables equipment lab and logistics delaire et al 2017 the high costs training requirements and time it takes to receive results can result in water service providers and drinking water consumers missing contamination events sorensen et al 2018b since fecal contamination of water sources is variable temporally seasonally and associated with extreme weather events studies and water service providers often underestimate contamination and exposure rates kostyla et al 2015 these limitations not only cause unknown exposure to fecal contamination but also erroneous predictions of contaminated water s effect on diarreal incidence globally bain et al 2014b fecal detection in drinking water is motivated to reduce risk of contamination events that are harmful to human health the who has grouped risk of fecal contamination in drinking water in terms of e coli concentrations across five risk categories low 1 9 cfu 100 ml intermediate 10 99 cfu 100 ml high 100 999 cfu 100 ml and very high 1000 cfu 100 ml who 1997 the association between e coli counts in drinking water and diarreal disease is often weak and variable brown et al 2008 gruber et al 2014 nevertheless there is evidence that exposure to e coli is associated with negative health outcomes gruber et al 2014 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been used widely as a tool for estimating the risks associated with exposures to pathogens in the environment qmra generally uses a dose response model that predicts the probability of infection given a dose exposure magnitude haas et al 2014 studies on the association between fib in drinking water and diarrhea show a dose response effect consistent with the who risk categories there is very little evidence of increased odds of diarrhea with contamination levels between 1 and 10 cfu 100ml e coli the category designated as low risk hodge et al 2016 this combined with the fact that concentrations of indicator organisms can be variable in surface waters makes establishing a fecal contamination risk level in terms of health extremely complex large spikes of contamination can be concurrent with rainfall defecation directly into source waters or washing of contaminated items like diapers levy et al 2009 the size and frequency of these spikes in contamination can be variable and will often be missed by traditional microbial water testing enger et al 2013 multiple studies show that compared to consistent low risk levels of fecal contamination high risk spikes of fecal contamination are of highest risk to human health yet there is currently no way to detect them in real time brown and clasen 2012 daly and harris 2021 haas and betz 1996 1 2 tryptophan like fluorescence there is an opportunity for risk based rapid and in situ fecal contamination measurements in drinking water nowicki et al 2021 offenbaume et al 2020 the united nations children s fund unicef published a target product profile for rapid detection of e coli using low cost per sample products unicef 2016 among several potential methods fluorescence spectroscopy has shown to be an effective water quality monitoring tool capable of detecting microbial contamination corsi et al 2021 baker et al 2015 nowicki et al 2019 sorensen et al 2018b one specific fluorescence parameter capable of detecting microbial contamination is tryptophan like fluorescence tlf also known as peak t1 fox et al 2017 henderson et al 2009 tlf has an excitation wavelength λ e x of 275 nm and an emission wavelength λ e m around 260 nm coble et al 1991 tlf has been shown to correlate to e coli in groundwater and surface water sorensen et al 2020b the presence of tlf in water can indicate that tryptophan is present on its own as free molecules or bound in proteins peptides or humic structures where microbial activity is occurring hudson et al 2008 tryptophan and its derivatives may be intracellular or extracellular both of which will display tlf if intracellular they are expected in bacteria as structural and functional proteins used in metabolic pathways metabolic byproducts and endospore formation as extracellular molecules they would be found as secreted signaling molecules metabolic byproducts exotoxins and cellular debris fox et al 2017 tryptophan contains an amine group a carboxylic acid group and a side chain indole group the indole moiety allows tryptophan to fluoresce making it one of three known amino acids in addition to tyrosine and phenylalanine with this property hudson et al 2007 while indole is widespread in nature high concentrations are found in mammalian intestinal tracts and wastes feces extracellular indole concentrations have been measured as high as 0 5 mm in suspended cultures of e coli lee et al 2015 the intracellular and or extracellular nature of tlf seems to depend on the type and source of the water sorensen et al 2020 found that tlf in groundwater was predominately extracellular 96 after measuring tlf levels before and after filtration at 0 22 μ m sorensen et al 2020b fox et al 2017 found that the majority of tlf signal 75 is intracellular in origin from lab grown bacteria inoculated in media fox et al 2017 since the yield of indole depends on the amount of exogenous tryptophan it s logical that in wastewater or surface water where extracellular tryptophan is more available tlf would be more extracellular than in lab grown settings li and young 2013 1 3 technology development opportunities several sensitive portable tlf sensors are available but they are not designed or marketed for autonomous in situ continuous operation their output is either in arbitrary units au or ppb of tryptophan values which do not take into account various environmental and physical parameters that will interfere with their signal for example two tlf measurements of samples with the same amount of contamination at two different temperatures will output different au or tryptophan concentration values temperature ph and turbidity can all influence a tlf signal although these impacts are most significant outside of typical target detection ranges increasing water temperature will reduce fluorescence intensity signal quenching can be 15 in waters with low ph below 4 5 and turbidity may have varying impacts on the signal depending on the contents of the water baker et al 2007 guilbault 1973 reynolds 2003 another limit to reading absolute value outputs from a tlf sensor is background fluorescence noise in aquatic environments fluorescence noise comes from other fluorophores outside those which are trying to be measured and it is variable between waters can reduce dynamic range and snr potentially causing a high number of false positives in addition proteins in organic waste xenobiotic compounds and diesel pollution have all been shown to fluoresce in the tlf region sorensen et al 2018a in drinking water there are multiple peaks of fluorescent dissolved organic matter dom that can overlap with tlf and could give rise to an apparent tlf signal humic like fluorescence hlf can raise the baseline tlf for samples with low tlf also increasing false positives ward et al 2020 if only absolute value outputs are used a signal to noise ratio snr will decrease with increased background noise causing ambiguity when comparing measurements between sources or time periods hlf signals are related to organic compounds in sediment or soil and are generally truly dissolved baker et al 2007 tlf hlf ratios have been shown to better predict dom concentrations and wastewater effluent concentrations in water better than just one of the two peaks sorensen et al 2018b ulliman et al 2020 on the contrary sorensen et al 2018 showed that tlf and hlf follow the same temporal trends in online monitoring of untreated groundwater and that it is unnecessary to monitor both of the fluorescent peaks at one time when monitoring groundwater derived sources sorensen et al 2018b ward et al 2020 found that hlf can raise the tlf baseline causing low concentrations of fecal contamination to be masked by a baseline noise signal ward et al 2020 other challenges to continuous monitoring with a tlf sensor primarily include biofouling mineral scaling and baseline drift that attenuate and ambiguate the signal the extent of biofouling varies as a function of the type and contents of water all aquatic sensors will be impacted by biofouling if given enough time deployed coble et al 2014 biofouling can impact fluorescence data by either decreasing or increasing the signal the fouling material can physically block both excitation or emission light to decrease the signal if the fouling material fluoresces at the same wavelength measured by the sensor it can increase the signal delauney et al 2010 in order to utilize a fluorescence sensor that will be impacted by biofouling some form of mitigation needs to take place current anti biofouling techniques include shutters plates and wipers for open faced sensors copper tubing and tubing covered with foil or black tape to block light has been used for flow through instruments manov et al 2004 other techniques include pressured air to clean surfaces nanocoating technologies or nano treated plastics to prevent biofilm adhesion all of these techniques contain limitations mechanical systems can easily brake or cause obstruction in light paths and coatings can interfere with excitation or emission intensity hard water with excess calcium and magnesium may cause mineral scaling on a sensor s optical windows the taste threshold set by who for the calcium ion is in the range of 100 300 mg l and lower for magnesium hardness of water is the combined mineral concentration hardness above 200 mg l may cause scale deposition over time on any hardware which interacts with the water when hardness falls below 100mg l it tends to have a low buffering capacity and can be more corrosive to pipes who 2017 calcium carbonate c a c o 3 has a high refractive index transmitted light decreases as a function of increasing refractive index leading sensor signals to decrease as minerals begin to scale minerals also have high reflectivity which can cause scattering or higher signal output but a lower overall sensitivity of a sensor okazaki et al 2017 while multiple studies have shown that tlf has the potential to be a rapid and reliable indicator of fecal contamination sorensen et al 2016 2021 2015 ward et al 2020 there have also been studies that show poor correlation between tlf and e coli and tlf and thermotolerant coliforms ttcs in certain cases bridgeman et al 2015 ward et al 2021 this disagreement between studies is due to the nature of tlf its variability between sources and how it relates to other water quality parameters ward et al 2020 for these reasons analysis on multivariate datasets that include site specific information may be able to improve outcome variability between site locations and water sources an approach to reduce signal drift due to fouling or scaling high false positive and false negative rates in the output of a tlf sensor is through machine learning ml based synthetic calibration to enact noise reduction and anomaly detection that enables alarm threshold detection joslyn and lipor 2018 through a combination of low cost robust hardware design and ml it may be possible to address the signal drift limitations as well as improve upon the sensitivity true positive rate and specificity true negative rate of a sensor system ml could allow for the integration of site and sensor specific baseline calibration through the detection of sudden and large changes in tlf rather than relying on a universal threshold for all sensors as well as input from other important data sources like sensor characteristics seasonality nearby sensor data and data features serving as proxies for fouling ml might eliminate the need to measure multiple optical properties such as hlf along with tlf it s possible that an ml model would be able to discover noise patterns caused by hlf and detect tlf peaks through the increased baseline for an in situ tlf sensor to be able to report data in real or near time multivariate data analysis must be conducted in order to detect anomalies or predict contamination risk levels anomaly detection is a process of discovering patterns in a dataset that do not conform to expected notions of normal behavior or fit in a dataset chandola et al 2009 ml tools have been shown to provide opportunities to overcome many limitations of in situ real time monitoring sensors saboe et al 2021 with the support of past data known as training data ml can analyze future data trends to offer insights that would not otherwise be available ml is able to optimize data collection processes and prediction of parameters by leveraging additional datasets to decipher trends and signal patterns syafrudin et al 2018 the potential to use ml to interpret tlf data from an online sensor that will be subjected to fouling and other interferents has not yet been investigated despite successful applications for other types of water quality data hou et al 2013 jin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in this study we design and validated an in situ near time remotely reporting tlf sensor system for the detection of fecal contamination risk in surface water following suggestions and thresholds established in the literature the sensor system was designed to differentiate among who designated risk levels correlated to fib concentration tlf measurements are best utilized to distinguish between these risk categories rather than providing a direct enumeration of microbial contamination ward et al 2020 sorensen et al 2018 proposed a threshold of 1 3 ppb tryptophan concentration for classifying low risk sources 1 9 cfu 100ml thus the goal design limit of detection was set to 1 ppb dissolved tryptophan sorensen et al 2018a along with the design and validation of the sensor system we report on the characterization of multiple potential fluorescence quenching parameters that may influence the operational limits of a continuous tlf sensor system we report on the impact of temperature on the sensor s signal because temperature correction factor development is sensor specific watras et al 2011 we do not report on the impacts of ph or turbidity on the sensor s signal because these interactions are well established in the literature baker et al 2007 khamis et al 2015 spencer et al 2007 we report on the impacts of biofouling and mineral scaling on the ability of the sensor to detect contamination we also examine the impact of chlorine on the sensor signal when dosed in both contaminated and uncontaminated waters this study also investigates coupling the sensor with an ml data system to compensate for biofouling scaling and background fluorescence noise in order to detect contamination events that are most harmful to human health i e short bursts of high risk contamination finally the sensor and ml system were deployed and validated in a field implementation 2 methods 2 1 sensor design the sensor hardware design was based on our previously published work that demonstrated the application of high power ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds to excite tryptophan like fluorophores at 275 nm and a uv photodiode paired with a bandpass filter centered around 357 nm capable of detecting fecal contamination in drinking water for a relatively low cost bedell et al 2020 we have updated the design of the sensor to achieve the following design goals 1 autonomous in situ functionality 2 high sensitivity to tryptophan concentrations 3 simple maintenance and cleaning of optics 4 range and gain levels applicable to groundwater surface water or treated water 5 detect and measure proxies for fouling as features for the machine learning model 2 1 1 electrical fluorescence measurements are generally taken using a light source to excite emissions and a photodetector to measure emission outputs these instruments need to be optimized to emit and measure at the wavelengths of interest light levels emitted from tlf measurements are on the magnitude of picoamps and require amplification to increase the signal to noise ratio snr for an in situ sensor a microcontroller solar power and gateway for sending data remotely must also be included in the design an overall system diagram of the design can be seen in fig 1 a broadcom silicon photomultiplier chip sipm www broadcom com was used to detect fluorescence emissions an sipm is a sensitive solid state photodetector made of an array of single photon avalanche diodes spads connected in parallel compared to photomultiplier tubes which are used in most high sensitive tlf sensors sipms are less vulnerable to magnetic fields more robust and compact and require low bias voltage and power broadcom 2019 sipms are capable of very high 10 5 10 7 internal gain μ the gain is directly related to the input bias voltage small changes in the bias voltage can potentially create significant changes in measurements thus in the electrical design the bias voltage was measured by the analog to digital converter adc a bias of approximately 32v is required for the sipm sensor to be used a transimpedance amplifier tia was used to amplify the measured current output into usable voltage the fluorescence light levels present in even low concentration tryptophan solutions were higher than what the broadcom sipm is intended for thus it is functionally acting like a highly sensitive highly efficient photodiode two high powered uv leds seoul viosys with outputs centered around 275 10 nm were set perpendicular to the sipm these leds were chosen for their high power and wavelength precision around 275 nm seoul viosys 2018 the precision around 275 nm ensures the measured fluorescence is in the tlf region a particle boron from particle industries inc was used as the main microcontroller boron has an integrated long term evolution lte modem which allows for upgrades in the field and real time data feedback without physical access the particle boron controlled signal measurement from a water temperature sensor sparkfun electronics ambient enclosure temperature via 1 wire sensor located on the main pcb sipm bias voltage and sipm output also controlled by the boron was pulsing the two uv leds a 12v peristaltic pump to pull water through the sensor charging of a 3 7v lithium ion battery via 10w solar panel voltaic systems and data storage to a microsd card for backup and buffering if the lte connection got lost the uv led driver was designed to drive the led to a constant current pulsed in the millisecond ms range it is important for the led current to be very stable when on since any variation in the current will couple into the output measurement furthermore since different water samples may have very different levels of fluorescent response and noise the led current setpoint is variable instead of fixed the setpoint voltage given to the led driver circuit to follow is provided by a digital to analog converter dac the uv led driver circuit is composed of an op amp constant current source using a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor mosfet and a sense resistor for current feedback gain between the input voltage and the output current is set by this feedback resistor block circuit diagrams for the sipm board and led driver board are shown in fig e 16 measurements from the sensor were sent through the lte gateway to an online database the parameters collected from the sensor are shown in table a 3 2 1 2 mechanical the sensor uses a uv quartz flow through cuvette from fireflysci www fireflysci com the pathlength of the cuvette is 1 cm the leds and sipm pcb boards are mounted orthogonal onto a high precision 3d printed sleeve that slides onto the cuvette mounted on the sleeve between the sipm and the cuvette is a bandpass filter centered around 357 22 nm www edmundoptics com abrasion resistant rubber tubing is used to connect the cuvette to the peristaltic pump the main pcb board cuvette sleeve and pump are mounted in a polycase waterproof enclosure with a custom 3d printed mount the enclosure is mounted on a universal camera stake with tamper resistant screws so it can be easily and securely staked into the ground sensor and mounting design is shown in fig 2 2 2 lab validation lab validation was conducted to measure the signal sensitivity of the sensor to parameter changes in water all results from lab validation experiments tryptophan sensitivity e coli sensitivity wastewater sensitivity temperature correction biofouling and scaling were analyzed in r version 4 0 5 analysis of variance anova as well as t tests were conducted on the outputs to examine the statistical significance of experimental effects 2 2 1 tryptophan sensitivity standard l tryptophan solutions made with sigma aldrich reagent grade l tryptophan were made by mixing 1000 ml of type 1 ultrapure deionized di water astm d1193 91 and 0 1 g powdered tryptophan for 30 min to create a solution of 100 ppm tryptophan this stock solution was used to prepare serial dilutions of 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 3 10 30 70 ppb l tryptophan standards each solution was kept for a maximum of 72 hours before testing the sensor was rinsed by pumping di water through for 60 seconds to collect data for each solution starting with the lowest concentration di water and ending with the highest concentration 100 ppb the inlet tube was placed in the solution and the outlet tube placed in a waste container ten tlf measurements from the sensor with 80 samples averaged per measurement were taken for each solution the sensor was rinsed between each solution by running di water through for 30 seconds 2 2 2 wastewater sensitivity wastewater effluent was collected from the boulder wastewater treatment facility and stored at 4 c until it was used for testing for a maximum of 5 days standard dilutions were made by mixing di water and wastewater effluent to prepare 10 12 5 25 50 and 100 dilutions of wastewater effluent the ph of di and each wastewater effluent dilution was measured since di water exposed to air has the potential to be acidic table b 4 each solution was used within 48 hours of the time it was made sensor data for each dilution starting with the lowest concentration di and ending with the highest concentration 100 wastewater effluent dilutions was collected and analyzed using the same method that was used to collect the tryptophan data membrane filtration was used to enumerate e coli and total coliforms tc present in each dilution by plating a filter with m coliblue24 broth epa approved hach co 10029 method m coliblue24 broth indicates e coli colonies by blue coloration resulting from specific activity of β glucuronidase and tc by red coloration resulting from specific activity of β galactosidase tallon et al samples were plated in triplicates and incubated at 35 c for 18 24 hours 2 2 3 water temperature variation and correction tryptophan solutions were made following the methods described above each solution di water 1 3 10 30 70 100 200 ppb was refrigerated overnight at 4 c solutions were removed from the refrigerator one at a time and tested in ascending concentration solutions were placed on a hotplate stirrer and stirred during the entirety of the test heat was applied when the solution began to reach room temperature the temperature of the water was monitored using a thermocouple from 7 c to 35 c measurements were taken by the sensor at least three times per degree celsius this experiment lasted 8 5 hrs total or around 1 h for each solution a temperature correction factor was developed by fitting the output data to the following functional relationship established by watras et al 2011 watras et al 2011 1 t l f m t l f r e ρ t m t r where t is temperature c ρ is the temperature coefficient c 1 the subscripts r and m stand for the reference and measured values fitting negative exponential curves to the data and solving for ρ gives the ability to correct the data to a desired temperature 2 2 4 inner filter effects all fluorescence signal can be subjected to inner filter effects ife at high concentrations ife occurs when a portion of the excitation light is absorbed before it reaches the point in the sample where fluorescence occurs this is known as primary ife re absorption can also occur with a portion of the light emitted from the fluorophore before it reaches a detector known as secondary ife kubista et al 1994 ifes result in a attenuation of fluorescence signal if quantitative results of concentration are desired corrections must be made for ifes if a qualitative result of risk level of concentration is desired corrections may not be necessary samples from the wastewater sensitivity experiment were collected from the dilutions made and set aside each dilution was run on a uv visible spectrophotometer agilent cary 400 to collect absorbance data for 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm increments using a 1 cm path length cuvette the spectrophotometer used had a maximum absorbance of 1 and a scan rate of 600 nm min the absorbance data were used to calculate the impact of possible inner filter effects ife on the sensor s output kubista et al 1994 ife corrected measurements were then calculated using eq 2 2 f c o r r f o b s 10 a λ e x a λ e m 2 where f c o r r is the sensor s corrected fluorescence signal f o b s is the sensor s observed fluorescence signal a λ e x is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength and a λ e m is the fluorescence observed at the emission wavelength 2 2 5 chlorination impact to determine the impact of chlorine on the sensor s output 0 24 ml of bleach was added to 1000 ml wastewater effluent a 50 ppb tryptophan solution and di water once 0 24 ml of bleach was added to each dilution they were mixed for 30 minutes the ph of di and wastewater effluent was measured before bleach was added and after bleach was mixed in each solution for 30 minutes total chlorine present was measured at minute 1 and 30 free chlorine was measured at minute 30 10 measurements with the sensor were taken for each solution wastewater effluent wastewater effluent bleach 50 ppb tryptophan 50 ppb tryptophan bleach di water di bleach the concentration of e coli and tc before and 30 minutes after the addition of bleach were enumerated by membrane filtration using the method described above 2 2 6 biofouling estimation to establish biofilm growth and estimate its impact on sensor signal two sensors sampled tap water from a bucket that was occasionally spiked with wastewater effluent for four weeks the tap water was spiked with wastewater effluent then the sensors took a sample and then the bucket was cleaned and refilled with tap water grab samples were taken three times a day and enumerated for e coli and total coliforms by membrane filtration using the methods described above biofilm growth was inferred through proxy markers such as plating the contents on the cuvette s walls and benchtop fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems these markers estimated the presence or ab sense of biofilms the general assumption was that the proxy substance being measured was directly related to biofilm existence on the cuvette walls azeredo et al 2017 it is possible for biofilm to form on the walls of the tubing but it will not directly impact measurements in each sensor the cuvette was cleaned periodically before cleaning the biofilm growth was qualified with spectral analysis to create eems and quantified with membrane filtration fluorescence of the biofilm growth was collected using a fluorescence spectrofluorimeter fluoromax 4 emission wavelengths were measured from 300 to 400 nm in 2 nm increments excitation wavelengths from 300 to 240 nm in 10 nm increments and the excitation and emission bandpass was set to 5 nm and a 0 25 sec integration time absorbance data were collected using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer agilent cary 4000 which has a maximum absorbance of 1 and a scan rate of 600 nm min absorbance spectra were measured from a wavelength of 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals after fluorescence and absorbance data were collected the eems were corrected using stardom r package version 1 1 14 pucher et al 2019 the r package stardom corrects inner filtering rayleigh and raman scattering and then subtracts background and baseline signal using data from a cuvette containing only di water tc and e coli inside the cuvette were enumerated through membrane filtration using the methods described above the cuvette was filled with a solution of pbs and water shaken for 30 secs to detach biofilm this was performed 15 times 10 ml of this solution was passed through a membrane filter 2 2 7 mineral scaling mineral scaling experiments were conducted using a scaling model solution at a concentration factor of eight compared to the composition of the colorado river consisting of calcium chloride dihydrate 0 0164 m magnesium sulfate 0 0105 m and sodium sulfate 0 0145 m rahardianto et al 2006 this solution contains eight times that of the mineral concentration found in the colorado river thus it can be estimated that in a field implementation of the sensor it would take at least eight times as long to achieve the level of scaling shown in this experiment the gypsum saturation index si was calculated in terms of eq 3 with visual minteq to find the degree of supersaturation of the scaling model solution https vminteq lwr kth se 3 s i c a 2 s o 4 2 k s p c a 2 s o 4 where ca2 and so4 2 are the activities of each of the ions and ksp is the solubility constant for gypsum the saturation index was found to be 1 01 making it supersaturated which significantly increases the likely hood of mineral scaling to occur before each experiment di water was cycled through the cuvette in the sensor for 2 hours then the scaling model solution was added and cycled through the cuvette for 24 hours to form scaling on the cuvette walls to analyze the impact of mineral scaling on the sensor s signal the mean sensitivity of the sensor s signal to 50 ppb tryptophan was compared before and after the scaling experiment 2 3 field validation in order to validate the sensor s functionality in the field four sensors were placed on boulder creek in boulder colorado in the summer of 2021 for 88 days 2 3 1 study area boulder creek flows out of the foothills and through boulder colorado the creek is a tributary of the south platte river and its flow is primarily derived from snow melt and minor springs west of the city boulder has a semi arid climate with an mean rainfall of 21 in annually murphy 2006 the section of boulder creek that was tested typically has a ph between 6 8 and 8 5 turbidity 10 ntus hardness between 30 and 1130 mg l temperature between 10 c and 25 c and doc between 2 and 8 mg l during the time of field deployment the main sources of fecal contamination in the creek are from humans living around the creek instream recreation leaking sanitary sewer lines failing septic systems or animals barber et al 2000 murphy 2006 four sensors were placed on boulder creek to monitor the fecal contamination at sites upstream within and downstream of the city fig 3 2 3 2 sensor sample collection sensors were set to sample the water in the creek every 10 minutes the sensor inlet and outlet tubes were submerged under the water but above the creek floor by securing them to holes in a ceramic brick the sampling sequence of the sensors was as follows water was pumped through the sensor for 20 seconds to flush a wait time was set to 2 seconds after pumping was complete so air bubbles were able to dissipate to take a measurement the leds were pulsed on for approximately 1000 ms and 80 readings taken from the sipm were averaged water was then pumped through again for 5 seconds and another measurement taken this was repeated for a total of three measurements every 10 minutes in order to provide a diverse range of gain outputs and decrease saturation events the current provided to the leds was set to 10 50 100 and 200ma one data point was recorded at each current level for each measurement for this context it was discovered that none of the current input levels performed better than the other thus to summarize one characteristic voltage per e coli enumeration voltage output normalized by current level was averaged for each measurement voltage from the in situ sensor was standardized to 20 c using water temperature measurements prior to being normalized the data were transmitted over cellular networks to an online database 2 3 3 training set development a training and validation data set of laboratory enumerated microbial contamination was developed in order to build and validate the ml model with the sensor data water samples were collected at each sensor site approximately 13 times per week for 13 weeks samples were collected from sensor sites as close to the inlet tube as possible and within 1 minute of the sensor taking a fluorescence reading in order to match ground truth to sensor measurements a phone based survey tool www mwater co was used to log and organize sampling data samples were collected in 50 ml sample bottles put into a cooler and transported to the lab for processing within two hours of collection membrane filtration was used to enumerate e coli and tc 10 ml of sample water was filtered through a 0 45 μ m filter then incubated using methods described above samples were plated in triplicates and averaged the outputs from the enumeration were multiplied by 10 to report in cfu 100ml plates were enumerated by counting the number of colonies present after incubation the data for number of e coli coliforms and tc were recorded in mwater the time the e coli sample was taken was matched with the sensor measurement taken contemporaneously this subset formed the training and testing datasets for modeling categorical e coli presence in the water was the desired response variable and several inputs were hypothesized to explain whether contamination was present namely continuous tlf measurements from the in situ sensor the date and time of sensor installation removal replacement and any cuvette cleaning events were also recorded in mwater 2 3 4 machine learning model a binary model was developed to predict whether a sample was at least at the who high risk level 100 cfus e coli 100 ml vs 100 cfus 100 ml another model for multinomial classification investigated performance at predicting the correct of five who risk categories thus continuous e coli measurements where characterized by number of cfus per 100 ml of water at very low risk 0 1 low risk 1 10 intermediate risk 11 100 high risk 101 1000 and very high risk 1000 who 1997 supervised ml models empirically find the best model fit by reducing the difference between the observed and predicted outcome ensemble ml also known as super learning applies multiple models learners to the same data and selects the optimal combination of them through cross validation van der laan et al 2007 for binary classification of contamination risk there were 8 candidate learners logistic regression lasso regression random forest pavlov 2019 gradient boosted decision tree xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 three k nearest neighbors zhang 2016 with k equal to 5 10 or 15 and a null model the multinomial classification considered up to 5 learners lasso regression random forest xgboost independent binomials and a null model ensemble learners are proven to perform as well as or better than any single candidate algorithm and minimizing cross validated risk controls for over fitting of the final ensemble model van der laan et al 2007 polley and van der laan 2010 modeling and feature design respected an internal four fold stratified cross validation structure balanced on risk category model features are the independent variables that can predict fecal contamination risk category the primary explanatory feature was the retrieved voltage from the in situ sensor standardized and normalized relative voltage was explained by the z score difference from rolling 7 day average and percentile the signal voltage is dependent on the input voltage and this variable was included as a potential effect modifier as biofouling and mineral scaling are likely to impact the sensor signal the number of hours since the optical sensor was cleaned was included as a feature in the model as a proxy for fouling coble et al 2014 each sensor was cleaned 2 3 times throughout the data collection period cleaning events were dictated by over saturation of the sensor or when the sensor was not functioning correctly an estimate of daily municipal rainfall was retrieved from noaa physical sciences laboratory and included as a model feature it is well known fecal contamination varies seasonally with rainfall kostyla et al 2015 water temperature was used as a feature and corrected to 20 c using eq 1 the temperature of the sipm will impact its output for this reason temperature inside the sensor enclosure was included as a feature kuznetsov 2018 field experimentation was conducted from june september 2021 so a variable of consecutive days since start of the experiment attempts to capture any remaining unexplained seasonality during this summer the ability to identify instances of high risk contamination from the sensor data and other input variables is evaluated by a receiver operating characteristic roc curve and area under the curve auc and cross validated accuracy and rates of misclassification discretized models output the predicted probability of a data point belonging to an outcome category predicted probabilities are assigned to categories based on whether they are above or below a set threshold determining the threshold is a trade off between sensitivity and specificity sensitivity is the proportion of correctly identified high risk events while specificity is the proportion of correctly identified instances of non high risk the roc curve plots sensitivity by one minus specificity and visually demonstrates the compromise between sensitivity and specificity youden s j statistic is often used as a threshold value and assumes both are equally important the auc demonstrates how good the model is at discriminating high risk overall despite the choice of threshold while accuracy is the percent of data points where predicted and observed high risk agree after implementing the threshold the null or no information rate is the expected accuracy based on the prevalence of the outcome the false negative rate fnr one minus sensitivity is relative to the number of underestimated instances of actual high risk conversely one minus specificity is equal to the false positive rate fpr and is the proportion of wrongly identified cases of high risk use among observed lower than high risk contamination additionally a variable importance plot indicates the relative information gained from each feature variable importance was measured by the risk ratio between the full model and a model on modified data where any dependence between the outcome and the respective feature is removed by permutation random sampling without replacement the performance of the multinomial model was evaluated with accuracy and true positive and negative rates all data management and analysis was conducted in r statistical computing software r core team 2019 the machine learning model was implemented in the r package sl3 coyle et al 2021 3 results 3 1 laboratory characterization 3 1 1 tryptophan sensitivity the sensor is able to produce a signal that was significantly different between di and 0 05 ppb tryptophan p value 0 01 t 8 for all current levels at a range of current inputs to the leds fig 4 thus the design goal of 1 ppb tryptophan signifying low risk contamination according to sorensen et al 2018 was met sorensen et al 2018a as the current to the leds increases the sensitivity at low concentrations of tryptophan increases as the current decreases a higher range of tryptophan concentrations is detectable 3 1 2 e coli sensitivity the sensor was able to produce signals that were significantly different between di and p value 0 01 t 4 2 e coli concentrations in a 5 wastewater effluent dilution which was enumerated through membrane filtration and contained 10 cfu 100ml which signifies intermediate risk contamination fig 5 the r 2 between e coli concentrations in the wastewater effluent dilutions and sensor output was 0 92 there was a drop in sensor output in the range of 1000 cfu 100ml the drop in sensor output can be attributed partly to ife but could also be a result of light scatter from particles the absorbance data collected on the benchtop spectrophotometer shows increasing absorbance as the concentrations increase the calculated corrected fluorescence due to ife increases the r 2 between e coli and sensor output to 0 95 table 1 the graphed comparison of the r 2 between measured and corrected output from the sensor can be seen in supplemental material 2 3 1 3 chlorination impact adding bleach to solutions of di water 50 ppb of tryptophan and to wastewater effluent significantly lowered the signal from the sensor fig 6 30 minutes after bleach was added to 50 ppb tryptophan the signal from the sensor lowered to a value below the signal measured for di 30 minutes after bleach was added to wastewater effluent the signal from the sensor was 40 lower than it was without the addition of bleach the ph of di water 50 ppb tryptophan and wastewater effluent was 6 67 6 82 and 7 02 before bleach was added and 8 07 8 21 and 7 32 30 minutes after bleach was added respectively the free chlorine present after 30 minutes in each solution was 5 9 5 5 and 5 6 mg l for the di 50 ppb tryptophan and wastewater effluent respectively 3 1 4 temperature sensitivity fluorescence output from the sensor declined with increased water temperature fig 7 the higher the concentration of tryptophan in the water the more significant impact water temperature has on the signal similarly to watras et al 2011 fluorescence declined exponentially with water temperature at all concentrations tested thus the methods for temperature correction of a fluorescence sensor described in that study were followed watras et al 2011 eq 1 was fit to each concentration and the mean ρ was averaged to be 0 03 using this value for ρ in eq 1 the effect of temperature can mostly be removed from the raw data with an mean standard deviation of 0 01 v for all concentrations fig 7b for the lower concentrations correcting the data causes a small increase of the sensor output with temperature 3 1 5 biofouling sensitivity as wastewater effluent was introduced to the sensor for extended periods of time an increase in the sensors signal was observed even when only sampling di water fig 8 a this signal increase is assumed to be attributable to biofilm growth on the inside walls of the cuvette spectral eems for a biofouled cuvette using the clean cuvette as a blank show an increase in signal in the tlf range fig 8b the enumeration of contents on the cuvette walls through membrane filtration show an average of 1080 cfu 100 ml of total coliforms and 10 cfu 100 ml of e coli monitoring absorbance in a cuvette with biofilms present will impact the outcome of the beer lambert law as it relies on path length and the concentration of a solution inside the cuvette varying the absorbance path length from 0 01 to 5 cm impacted scale of the results but since only the presence absence of increased fluorescence was of concern these impacts were disregarded since the cuvettes were filled only with di water the increase in fluorescence in fig 8b is inferred to be a proxy for presence of biofilms e coli enumeration showed 10 cfu 100ml were present inside the cuvette after this eem was taken taking the difference in signal from directly after a spike of wastewater was introduced and the bucket was cleaned signal drop and directly before the next spike of wastewater was introduced resulted in a mean signal growth of 82 due to biofouling of the lens spikes in the sensor signal from contamination can be observed through biofouling induced signal increase fig 8 as little as 17 cfu 100ml show a significant increase in signal even with a heavily biofouled lens there is an instance of sensor signal spike with no e coli present in the wastewater effluent an instance like this may be characterized as a false positive but could also indicate that there was a contamination event at a previous time but all live fib had died off 3 1 6 mineral scaling sensitivity mineral scaling showed a 5 reduction in sensitivity of the sensor s ability to detect 50 ppb tryptophan the 5 reduction in sensitivity was calculated by taking the difference in mean of the sensor s signal with a clean cuvette and a cuvette with mineral scaling between 50 ppb tryptophan dilution and di mineral scaling on the inside of the cuvette showed a 42 4 increase in absorbance at a wavelength of 275 nm and 38 1 increase at 360 nm percent increase was calculated using absorbance data collected on the uv vis before and after scaling occurred data presented in a study conducted by rahardianto et al 2006 shows that scaling increases with increasing supersaturation or increasing the saturation index rahardianto et al 2006 based on the results of other studies that investigate the affects of mineral scaling on fluorescence sensor signals it would be reasonable to assume that if the rate of scaling were to increase transmittance will decrease leading to an even larger decrease of sensitivity okazaki et al 2017 3 2 field validation e coli enumerated through membrane filtration in boulder creek ranged from 0 to 9580 cfus 100 ml with a mean of 120 cfus 100 ml over 298 observations the data were balanced between categories indicative of less than high risk contamination and high risk or above contamination table 2 few observations were in the low and very high risk categories the number of tc was also enumerated in each sample the who does not recommend tcs be used as a water quality or public health measure who 2017 therefore we did not undertake a machine learning model to predict tcs but confirmed that our methods distinguished between e coli and tc prevalence in the surface water of the creek measured tcs ranged from 77 11 440 cfus 100 ml mean 2700 cfus 100 ml sd 2000 cfus 100 ml there was only one observation of tcs below the who high risk category for e coli of 100 cfus 100 ml linear correlation between the number of e coli and tcs during the field experiment was 0 54 raw voltage readings below zero and above 2 8 v were dropped due to sensor non functionality or over saturation respectively enumeration of e coli occurred at 298 independent observations between 69 and 82 from each sampling site 3 2 1 dichotomized high risk 100 cfus 100 ml of contamination a machine learning model with tlf from in situ sensors as the principal feature identified high risk of fecal contamination in surface water with impressive skill the roc curve fig 9 demonstrates that both high sensitivity and specificity were achievable and that from the auc the model had a probability of 86 of accurately discriminating high contamination risk the sensitivity and specificity at the chosen predicted probability threshold were 80 and 86 respectively accuracy of detection of high risk contamination fig 10 was 83 95 ci 78 87 and significantly different from the null information rate 53 p value 0 001 one sided exact binomial test false positive and false negative rates were 20 and 14 given the sensor alerted to high risk contamination it was 87 likely that the water sample contained e coli at 100 cfus 100 ml or greater i e the positive predictive value fig 11 displays the ranking of model variables from most to least important for predictive performance the variable importance plot confirms that tlf is informative to the identification of high fecal contamination risk in water when using a remote in situ uninterrupted monitoring sensor randomizing sensor voltage increased model error by nearly 45 compared to a model preserving the observed sensor reading the relative importance of cleaning of the sensor to remove biofilm and scaling an increase in model risk of about 16 indicated that these phenomena also impacted the field experiment relative voltage temperature of the internal sensor board seasonality and the bias voltage demonstrated importance to detection of high risk contamination the sensor voltage z score amount of rainfall and water temperature did not appear informative a risk ratio close to or less than 1 0 the effect of water temperature was incorporated when standardizing the sensor voltage to 20 c the sensor sites covered a transect with one sensor upstream of the city of boulder in boulder canyon two sensors in the city of boulder and one just outside the urban area the contamination levels varied between sites as well as the accuracy of the binary classification model fig 12 the sensor with the highest accuracy boulder canyon had the least amount of contamination the sensor with the lowest accuracy had the most variation in contamination across all five risk levels the effect of daily streamflow on e coli prevalence was investigated but due to a high instance of missing data 53 in boulder creek during the summer of 2021 and the sparsity of this type of data in many contexts it was not retained in the final model when it was included with an additional missing indicator variable analysis not shown accuracy to detect high risk contamination improved but not significantly 85 vs 83 95 ci 78 87 3 2 2 categorical risk of contamination overall accuracy of a model detecting one of five contamination risk categories simultaneously was 64 95 ci 58 70 and significantly better than null accuracy 49 p value 0 001 one sided exact binomial test this model was still best at differentiating the high risk category with a true positive rate of 83 and a true negative rate of 69 fig 13 it performed moderately well at detecting intermediate risk with true positive and true negative rates of 65 and 73 respectively the combined sensor and machine learning algorithm system was not able to detect very low low or very high contamination true positive rates were never greater than 11 and true negative rates were not revealing of actual performance despite being very high because of low sample prevalence of e coli at these risk levels table 2 however when very high risk was incorrectly specified it was usually prescribed to the next closest category 85 of incidence of e coli over 1000 cfus 100 ml was classified as high to very high risk 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity the high sensitivity of the sensor to e coli detection can be attributed both to the integration of the sipm and the use of a machine learning model to compensate for fouling and improve noise reduction despite high concentrations of tcs in the water the sensor and ml model were able to predict levels of e coli which would suggest fecal contamination this finding supports the contribution of fecal contamination to tlf rather than the overall bacterial population in the water this result may be attributable to exogenous tryptophan present in fecal contamination which is directly related to the concentration of indole produced by the microbial concentration present causing a higher fluorescence output li and young 2013 the ability of fluorescence to distinguish between tc and fecal indicator organisms deserves more study especially in waters with less bacterial load such as groundwater or treated drinking water systems the bill of materials 1 000 and detection limit of 0 05 ppb tryptophan is competitive with similar probe style sensors not designed for continuous use sorensen et al 2018a sensor detection limits reported in the literature range from 0 1 ppb to 0 17 ppb khamis et al 2015 simões and dong 2018 the variable gain option integrated into the firmware of the sensor allows for the user to decide between higher sensitivity or higher range of output these options allow the sensor to be useful in a variety of different environments from surface water to groundwater to tap water this was achieved through varying the current levels to the leds though variable gain is not new to tlf sensors the integration of it into a ml model is we found no specific gain level contributed to better performance of the model for surface water where the sensor was tested it was theorized that a larger range might be more important than high sensitivity since there is high background fluorescence but that was not the case more investigation should be conducted on whether gain levels can impact performance of the sensor in waters with less background fluorescence noise like groundwater or treated water laboratory experiments showed that ife and possible light scattering impact the sensor s signal significantly the sensor s signal may be attenuated from absorption of either the excitation or emission wavelengths and or light scattering from particles nonetheless the ml model was able to predict high risk contamination with great skill since ife impacts high concentrations of contamination its impacts on the signal may not present a problem for differentiating between high risk and not high risk contamination light scattering occurring in the sensor s cuvette may increase it s signal along side tlf if this is the case the skill of the ml model may be attributed not only to the correlation between tlf and microbial activity but also turbidity increase which has also been shown to predict fecal contamination in some cases dorner et al 2007 sorensen et al 2020 through adding bleach to di water di with 50 ppb of tryptophan and wastewater effluent this study attempted to examine how chlorine impacts the sensor s signal in a study by alimova et al bleach completely decomposed tryptophan in lab grown e coli including the destruction of the indole ring and possibly destroyed most of the cell s proteins and amino acids alimova et al 2005 if this is the case the significant signal that remains in the wastewater after the addition of bleach might be extracellular material other than tryptophan and its derivatives there could be overlap with another fluorophore that is continuing to persist despite the bleach the sensor could be picking up signals outside of the tlf range since the bandpass range on the sensor is 44 nm more investigation should be done to determine what is fluorescing once tryptophan and its derivatives have been decomposed despite the fluorescence signal that remains after the addition to bleach in wastewater effluent a 40 drop in signal after the addition of bleach indicates that the sensor could be used to monitor the functionality of water distribution systems that use chlorine as their main disinfectant 4 2 machine learning system temperature biofouling mineral scaling turbidity and hlf signals will all impact tlf signals the decision to only monitor tlf and temperature from the sensor itself was made to simplify the mechanical and electrical design as well as the data analysis and collection processes adding more data sources like absorption or hlf measurements could greatly improve the ml model s performance ulliman et al 2020 despite multiple parameters interfering with the signal an ml model was able to predict high risk contamination with fpr and fnr of 20 and 14 respectively the ml model is able to learn the hidden features and patterns in the data to detect anomalies that relate to fecal contamination through the input of data sources other than just the tlf output from the sensor an integral feature in the model was the input of time since cleaning that represents a proxy for fouling through this feature the model is able to distinguish between increased signal due to fouling and increased signal due to fecal contamination in the water the fnr and fpr values are higher than demonstrated by sorenson et al who found a fpr and fnr of 4 and 17 respectively but that study was done using a field portable submersible fluorimeter that could be cleaned before and after each use and that study was performed using groundwater which has significantly less background fluorescence noise sorensen et al 2018a the unicef tpp has a minimum performance requirement of fpr and fnr 10 but they are also not requiring a continuously monitoring product a slightly lower accuracy might be a trade of for an enormous increase in data also judging by the performance of the sensor in water with less contamination we predict that if the sensor were to be validated in water with less background fluorescence like groundwater or treated water the fpr and fnr would lower significantly while others including sorensen et al 2018a have demonstrated a relationship between tlf and fecal indicator organisms with logistic regression this approach would have been inadequate in our study the accuracy of indicating levels of high risk contamination from fluorescence output with logistic regression analysis not shown was 64 95 ci 58 70 compared to an accuracy of 83 with our ml model furthermore the auc achieved with a logistic regression model was nearly no better than random chance at 0 55 compared to the much higher auc of 0 86 we achieved the ml model outperformed statistical methods previously used to predict water contamination with tlf while the ml model helps to prolong time periods between cleaning maintenance and cleaning will still be necessary these time periods between cleaning will depend on the context and contents of the water being tested future work will consist of incorporating a time to clean output from the model by monitoring a steady increase or decrease in voltage output from the sensor we could theoretically set an alarm when the voltage shows a consistent high or consistent low that signals excessive biofouling or mineral scaling depending on the use case of the sensor the output of the ml model in terms of risk categories may be used as more of an early warning system or supplemental data source for utilities or water service providers the sensor system may be a trigger for more extensive traditional fecal contamination enumeration methods when a more precise measurement is needed 4 3 going beyond e coli recent literature challenges e coli as the preferred microbial water quality indicator nowicki et al 2021 initial findings around e coli as an indicator for fecal contamination relied on the fact that e coli was mainly associated with the gastrointenstinal tract and thus associated with feces from humans and animals the secondary habitat for e coli water sediment soil and flora was thought to induce a net negative growth rate which implied short term host persistence savageau 1983 in the last few decades this assumption has been challenged by the increased discovery and characterization of naturalized e coli populations bergholz et al 2011 nowicki et al 2021 recommends tlf sensors along side sanitary inspections and traditional water quality monitoring to begin to differentiate between naturalized e coli and contamination events nowicki et al 2021 since the ml model developed in this study uses e coli as a training set this model may not assist in differentiating between naturalized e coli and contamination events interesting further research would be to investigate if it would be possible to train the ml model with other forms of ground truth that may more accurately depict fecal contamination that would be harmful to human health better water quality characterization is needed to capture the high temporal variability in water quality with more data on the temporal variation of fecal contamination better assessment of exposures and their impacts on human health will be possible daly and harris 2021 the sensor system described in this paper has the ability monitor contamination in real time and to predict high risk spikes of contamination with high accuracy sensitivity and specificity the implantation of this sensor into water service providers or consumers monitoring systems could be a huge step forward for microbial water quality analysis because it is able to predict magnitudes of contamination that are most harmful to human health 5 feedback informed accountability just as important as the functionality of the technology is its ease of use and ability to integrate into current water management practices now that the sensor s functionality in a certain context has been realized the integration of the sensor and its data platform into water systems needs to be considered a web based data interpretation program needs to be designed to alert water service providers or users of possible contamination in a matter that is clear and makes sense to the end user the end goal of the sensor is to be implemented into a drinking water system to improve the service provider or consumer s capacity to detect manage and mitigate fecal contamination risk levels water quality improvement based on sensor data requires considerable on going technical and planning support in order to maximize the benefits of the investment however to achieve this goal service providers must be trained on how to read the sensor data and have the ability to understand the results produced while also being able to apply that information to decision making around improvements in the water systems and have sufficient financial and human resources to carry out repairs when deemed necessary thomas and brown 2020 proposed eight characteristics of feedback of greatest utility in environmental health and engineering for global development the first of these is that the feedback should be developed in partnership with communities and service providers the design of the sensor feedback mechanism should be developed in partnership with end users their water quality information needs should be assessed and prioritized these needs may change based on the use case of the sensor the other feedback criterion are that that the usage of the data is incentivized cost effective transparent actionable timely objective and relevant thomas and brown 2020 in all cases an alarm from the tlf sensor should trigger an action if the sensor is being used in a water distribution or treatment system the alarm would trigger more extensive traditional testing to determine magnitude and origin of contamination if the sensor is installed in a household system in combination with treatment technology the alarm would trigger maintenance or filter replacement on the treatment technology incentives for these actions are clear mitigating contamination to continue providing or consuming clean water utilization of sensor data to trigger contamination investigation is extremely cost effective when the costs to conduct traditional testing on a similar temporal scale is considered the information provided from the sensor is clearly relevant timely and objective and the mitigation is actionable the transparent nature of the sensor data would be up to the water service provider keeping this information transparent and available to consumers would support in incentivizing action or motivating consumers to treat their own water when needed 6 future work design work has begun on advancing the technology from prototype to product the next iteration of the design will be in partnership with a home treatment system the target user for this design will be people that utilize well water for their drinking water well water is particularly vulnerable to contamination through septic system malfunction and proximity to livestock private groundwater supplies are not regulated by the us epa putting the responsibly of water testing and treatment onto the homeowners murphy et al 2020 many point of use pou water treatment technologies have been developed that are proven to be effective at treating multiple contaminants are highly commoditized and cost effective but have no way of offering real time performance monitoring wu et al 2021 for these reasons we are designing an in home sensor system to be paired with a treatment technology the sensor will be a miniturized version of the design built in this paper be able to be installed in line with a houses main water line and also have a cleaning function where a user injects cleaning solution through the sensor when extensive fouling has occurred the sensor s data will be sent through the user s wifi to an online database where the ml model will be applied to predict risk level a mobile app will be developed in order to alert the user if contamination is detected once contamination is detected a maintenance or replacement procedure will need to take place with the treatment technology a prototype of this sensor can be seen in fig 14 declaration of competing interest the authors declare the

15857,we designed and validated a sensitive continuous in situ remotely reporting tryptophan like fluorescence sensor and coupled it with a machine learning model to predict high risk fecal contamination in water 10 colony forming units cfu 100ml e coli we characterized the sensor s response to multiple fluorescence interferents with benchtop analysis the sensor s minimum detection limit mdl of tryptophan dissolved in deionized water was 0 05 ppb p 0 01 and its mdl of the correlation to e coli present in wastewater effluent was 10 cfu 100 ml p 0 01 fluorescence response declined exponentially with increased water temperature and a correction factor was calculated inner filter effects which cause signal attenuation at high concentrations were shown to have negligible impact in an operational context biofouling was demonstrated to increase the fluorescence signal by approximately 82 in a certain context while mineral scaling reduced the sensitivity of the sensor by approximately 5 after 24 hours with a scaling solution containing 8 times the mineral concentration of the colorado river a machine learning model was developed with tlf measurements as the primary feature to output fecal contamination risk levels established by the world health organization a training and validation data set for the model was built by installing four sensors on boulder creek colorado for 88 days and enumerating 298 grab samples for e coli with membrane filtration the machine learning model incorporated a proxy feature for fouling time since last cleaning which improved model performance a binary classification model was able to predict high risk fecal contamination with 83 accuracy 95 ci 78 87 sensitivity of 80 and specificity of 86 a model distinguishing between all world health organization established risk categories performed with an overall accuracy of 64 integrating tlf measurements into an ml model allows for anomaly detection and noise reduction permitting contamination prediction despite biofilm or mineral scaling formation on the sensor s lenses real time detection of high risk fecal contamination could contribute to a major step forward in terms of microbial water quality monitoring for human health keywords tryptophan like fluorescence coiforms microbial contamination groundwater indicator instrumentation iot 1 introduction as many as two billion people worldwide use a drinking water source that is contaminated with feces bain et al 2014a unicef who 2021 who 2019 at least 122 million people globally still use surface water as their main drinking water source who 2020 drinking fecally contaminated water causes adverse health effects including diarrhea and stunting particularly among children under 5 in low and middle income countries clasen et al 2007 goddard et al 2020 pickering et al 2019 diarrheal diseases are the fifth leading cause of morbidity for people of all ages and the third leading cause for children ages 0 9 abbafati 2020 approximately 60 of all diarrheal deaths are related to water quality globally prüss ustün et al 2019 outbreaks are common in high income countries as well deflorio barker et al 2021 at least 40 million people in the united states rely on domestic wells for their drinking water supply which are not regulated by the u s environmental protection agency epa johnson et al 2019 between 1971 and 2008 30 of all waterborne outbreaks in the u s were associated with the consumption of untreated groundwater craun et al 2010 the epa estimates that approximately 16 4 million cases of acute gastrointestinal illness are due to unsafe drinking water in the united states annually messner 2006 1 1 microbial water quality monitoring in both academic research and professional practice estimates of contamination are mostly based on infrequent point measurements with small sample sizes bain et al 2014a more frequent testing is often limited by the established methods used to identify fecal contamination the world health organization who recommends escherichia coli e coli as the primary indicator of fecal contamination in drinking water unicef 2016 water service providers researchers and governmental organizations responsible for measuring water quality use e coli or other fecal indicator bacteria fib to estimate health risk related to fecal contamination fib are quantified by retrieving a sample from the water point taking it to the lab and culturing for 18 24 hours these tests on average cost 21 including consumables equipment lab and logistics delaire et al 2017 the high costs training requirements and time it takes to receive results can result in water service providers and drinking water consumers missing contamination events sorensen et al 2018b since fecal contamination of water sources is variable temporally seasonally and associated with extreme weather events studies and water service providers often underestimate contamination and exposure rates kostyla et al 2015 these limitations not only cause unknown exposure to fecal contamination but also erroneous predictions of contaminated water s effect on diarreal incidence globally bain et al 2014b fecal detection in drinking water is motivated to reduce risk of contamination events that are harmful to human health the who has grouped risk of fecal contamination in drinking water in terms of e coli concentrations across five risk categories low 1 9 cfu 100 ml intermediate 10 99 cfu 100 ml high 100 999 cfu 100 ml and very high 1000 cfu 100 ml who 1997 the association between e coli counts in drinking water and diarreal disease is often weak and variable brown et al 2008 gruber et al 2014 nevertheless there is evidence that exposure to e coli is associated with negative health outcomes gruber et al 2014 quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been used widely as a tool for estimating the risks associated with exposures to pathogens in the environment qmra generally uses a dose response model that predicts the probability of infection given a dose exposure magnitude haas et al 2014 studies on the association between fib in drinking water and diarrhea show a dose response effect consistent with the who risk categories there is very little evidence of increased odds of diarrhea with contamination levels between 1 and 10 cfu 100ml e coli the category designated as low risk hodge et al 2016 this combined with the fact that concentrations of indicator organisms can be variable in surface waters makes establishing a fecal contamination risk level in terms of health extremely complex large spikes of contamination can be concurrent with rainfall defecation directly into source waters or washing of contaminated items like diapers levy et al 2009 the size and frequency of these spikes in contamination can be variable and will often be missed by traditional microbial water testing enger et al 2013 multiple studies show that compared to consistent low risk levels of fecal contamination high risk spikes of fecal contamination are of highest risk to human health yet there is currently no way to detect them in real time brown and clasen 2012 daly and harris 2021 haas and betz 1996 1 2 tryptophan like fluorescence there is an opportunity for risk based rapid and in situ fecal contamination measurements in drinking water nowicki et al 2021 offenbaume et al 2020 the united nations children s fund unicef published a target product profile for rapid detection of e coli using low cost per sample products unicef 2016 among several potential methods fluorescence spectroscopy has shown to be an effective water quality monitoring tool capable of detecting microbial contamination corsi et al 2021 baker et al 2015 nowicki et al 2019 sorensen et al 2018b one specific fluorescence parameter capable of detecting microbial contamination is tryptophan like fluorescence tlf also known as peak t1 fox et al 2017 henderson et al 2009 tlf has an excitation wavelength λ e x of 275 nm and an emission wavelength λ e m around 260 nm coble et al 1991 tlf has been shown to correlate to e coli in groundwater and surface water sorensen et al 2020b the presence of tlf in water can indicate that tryptophan is present on its own as free molecules or bound in proteins peptides or humic structures where microbial activity is occurring hudson et al 2008 tryptophan and its derivatives may be intracellular or extracellular both of which will display tlf if intracellular they are expected in bacteria as structural and functional proteins used in metabolic pathways metabolic byproducts and endospore formation as extracellular molecules they would be found as secreted signaling molecules metabolic byproducts exotoxins and cellular debris fox et al 2017 tryptophan contains an amine group a carboxylic acid group and a side chain indole group the indole moiety allows tryptophan to fluoresce making it one of three known amino acids in addition to tyrosine and phenylalanine with this property hudson et al 2007 while indole is widespread in nature high concentrations are found in mammalian intestinal tracts and wastes feces extracellular indole concentrations have been measured as high as 0 5 mm in suspended cultures of e coli lee et al 2015 the intracellular and or extracellular nature of tlf seems to depend on the type and source of the water sorensen et al 2020 found that tlf in groundwater was predominately extracellular 96 after measuring tlf levels before and after filtration at 0 22 μ m sorensen et al 2020b fox et al 2017 found that the majority of tlf signal 75 is intracellular in origin from lab grown bacteria inoculated in media fox et al 2017 since the yield of indole depends on the amount of exogenous tryptophan it s logical that in wastewater or surface water where extracellular tryptophan is more available tlf would be more extracellular than in lab grown settings li and young 2013 1 3 technology development opportunities several sensitive portable tlf sensors are available but they are not designed or marketed for autonomous in situ continuous operation their output is either in arbitrary units au or ppb of tryptophan values which do not take into account various environmental and physical parameters that will interfere with their signal for example two tlf measurements of samples with the same amount of contamination at two different temperatures will output different au or tryptophan concentration values temperature ph and turbidity can all influence a tlf signal although these impacts are most significant outside of typical target detection ranges increasing water temperature will reduce fluorescence intensity signal quenching can be 15 in waters with low ph below 4 5 and turbidity may have varying impacts on the signal depending on the contents of the water baker et al 2007 guilbault 1973 reynolds 2003 another limit to reading absolute value outputs from a tlf sensor is background fluorescence noise in aquatic environments fluorescence noise comes from other fluorophores outside those which are trying to be measured and it is variable between waters can reduce dynamic range and snr potentially causing a high number of false positives in addition proteins in organic waste xenobiotic compounds and diesel pollution have all been shown to fluoresce in the tlf region sorensen et al 2018a in drinking water there are multiple peaks of fluorescent dissolved organic matter dom that can overlap with tlf and could give rise to an apparent tlf signal humic like fluorescence hlf can raise the baseline tlf for samples with low tlf also increasing false positives ward et al 2020 if only absolute value outputs are used a signal to noise ratio snr will decrease with increased background noise causing ambiguity when comparing measurements between sources or time periods hlf signals are related to organic compounds in sediment or soil and are generally truly dissolved baker et al 2007 tlf hlf ratios have been shown to better predict dom concentrations and wastewater effluent concentrations in water better than just one of the two peaks sorensen et al 2018b ulliman et al 2020 on the contrary sorensen et al 2018 showed that tlf and hlf follow the same temporal trends in online monitoring of untreated groundwater and that it is unnecessary to monitor both of the fluorescent peaks at one time when monitoring groundwater derived sources sorensen et al 2018b ward et al 2020 found that hlf can raise the tlf baseline causing low concentrations of fecal contamination to be masked by a baseline noise signal ward et al 2020 other challenges to continuous monitoring with a tlf sensor primarily include biofouling mineral scaling and baseline drift that attenuate and ambiguate the signal the extent of biofouling varies as a function of the type and contents of water all aquatic sensors will be impacted by biofouling if given enough time deployed coble et al 2014 biofouling can impact fluorescence data by either decreasing or increasing the signal the fouling material can physically block both excitation or emission light to decrease the signal if the fouling material fluoresces at the same wavelength measured by the sensor it can increase the signal delauney et al 2010 in order to utilize a fluorescence sensor that will be impacted by biofouling some form of mitigation needs to take place current anti biofouling techniques include shutters plates and wipers for open faced sensors copper tubing and tubing covered with foil or black tape to block light has been used for flow through instruments manov et al 2004 other techniques include pressured air to clean surfaces nanocoating technologies or nano treated plastics to prevent biofilm adhesion all of these techniques contain limitations mechanical systems can easily brake or cause obstruction in light paths and coatings can interfere with excitation or emission intensity hard water with excess calcium and magnesium may cause mineral scaling on a sensor s optical windows the taste threshold set by who for the calcium ion is in the range of 100 300 mg l and lower for magnesium hardness of water is the combined mineral concentration hardness above 200 mg l may cause scale deposition over time on any hardware which interacts with the water when hardness falls below 100mg l it tends to have a low buffering capacity and can be more corrosive to pipes who 2017 calcium carbonate c a c o 3 has a high refractive index transmitted light decreases as a function of increasing refractive index leading sensor signals to decrease as minerals begin to scale minerals also have high reflectivity which can cause scattering or higher signal output but a lower overall sensitivity of a sensor okazaki et al 2017 while multiple studies have shown that tlf has the potential to be a rapid and reliable indicator of fecal contamination sorensen et al 2016 2021 2015 ward et al 2020 there have also been studies that show poor correlation between tlf and e coli and tlf and thermotolerant coliforms ttcs in certain cases bridgeman et al 2015 ward et al 2021 this disagreement between studies is due to the nature of tlf its variability between sources and how it relates to other water quality parameters ward et al 2020 for these reasons analysis on multivariate datasets that include site specific information may be able to improve outcome variability between site locations and water sources an approach to reduce signal drift due to fouling or scaling high false positive and false negative rates in the output of a tlf sensor is through machine learning ml based synthetic calibration to enact noise reduction and anomaly detection that enables alarm threshold detection joslyn and lipor 2018 through a combination of low cost robust hardware design and ml it may be possible to address the signal drift limitations as well as improve upon the sensitivity true positive rate and specificity true negative rate of a sensor system ml could allow for the integration of site and sensor specific baseline calibration through the detection of sudden and large changes in tlf rather than relying on a universal threshold for all sensors as well as input from other important data sources like sensor characteristics seasonality nearby sensor data and data features serving as proxies for fouling ml might eliminate the need to measure multiple optical properties such as hlf along with tlf it s possible that an ml model would be able to discover noise patterns caused by hlf and detect tlf peaks through the increased baseline for an in situ tlf sensor to be able to report data in real or near time multivariate data analysis must be conducted in order to detect anomalies or predict contamination risk levels anomaly detection is a process of discovering patterns in a dataset that do not conform to expected notions of normal behavior or fit in a dataset chandola et al 2009 ml tools have been shown to provide opportunities to overcome many limitations of in situ real time monitoring sensors saboe et al 2021 with the support of past data known as training data ml can analyze future data trends to offer insights that would not otherwise be available ml is able to optimize data collection processes and prediction of parameters by leveraging additional datasets to decipher trends and signal patterns syafrudin et al 2018 the potential to use ml to interpret tlf data from an online sensor that will be subjected to fouling and other interferents has not yet been investigated despite successful applications for other types of water quality data hou et al 2013 jin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 in this study we design and validated an in situ near time remotely reporting tlf sensor system for the detection of fecal contamination risk in surface water following suggestions and thresholds established in the literature the sensor system was designed to differentiate among who designated risk levels correlated to fib concentration tlf measurements are best utilized to distinguish between these risk categories rather than providing a direct enumeration of microbial contamination ward et al 2020 sorensen et al 2018 proposed a threshold of 1 3 ppb tryptophan concentration for classifying low risk sources 1 9 cfu 100ml thus the goal design limit of detection was set to 1 ppb dissolved tryptophan sorensen et al 2018a along with the design and validation of the sensor system we report on the characterization of multiple potential fluorescence quenching parameters that may influence the operational limits of a continuous tlf sensor system we report on the impact of temperature on the sensor s signal because temperature correction factor development is sensor specific watras et al 2011 we do not report on the impacts of ph or turbidity on the sensor s signal because these interactions are well established in the literature baker et al 2007 khamis et al 2015 spencer et al 2007 we report on the impacts of biofouling and mineral scaling on the ability of the sensor to detect contamination we also examine the impact of chlorine on the sensor signal when dosed in both contaminated and uncontaminated waters this study also investigates coupling the sensor with an ml data system to compensate for biofouling scaling and background fluorescence noise in order to detect contamination events that are most harmful to human health i e short bursts of high risk contamination finally the sensor and ml system were deployed and validated in a field implementation 2 methods 2 1 sensor design the sensor hardware design was based on our previously published work that demonstrated the application of high power ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds to excite tryptophan like fluorophores at 275 nm and a uv photodiode paired with a bandpass filter centered around 357 nm capable of detecting fecal contamination in drinking water for a relatively low cost bedell et al 2020 we have updated the design of the sensor to achieve the following design goals 1 autonomous in situ functionality 2 high sensitivity to tryptophan concentrations 3 simple maintenance and cleaning of optics 4 range and gain levels applicable to groundwater surface water or treated water 5 detect and measure proxies for fouling as features for the machine learning model 2 1 1 electrical fluorescence measurements are generally taken using a light source to excite emissions and a photodetector to measure emission outputs these instruments need to be optimized to emit and measure at the wavelengths of interest light levels emitted from tlf measurements are on the magnitude of picoamps and require amplification to increase the signal to noise ratio snr for an in situ sensor a microcontroller solar power and gateway for sending data remotely must also be included in the design an overall system diagram of the design can be seen in fig 1 a broadcom silicon photomultiplier chip sipm www broadcom com was used to detect fluorescence emissions an sipm is a sensitive solid state photodetector made of an array of single photon avalanche diodes spads connected in parallel compared to photomultiplier tubes which are used in most high sensitive tlf sensors sipms are less vulnerable to magnetic fields more robust and compact and require low bias voltage and power broadcom 2019 sipms are capable of very high 10 5 10 7 internal gain μ the gain is directly related to the input bias voltage small changes in the bias voltage can potentially create significant changes in measurements thus in the electrical design the bias voltage was measured by the analog to digital converter adc a bias of approximately 32v is required for the sipm sensor to be used a transimpedance amplifier tia was used to amplify the measured current output into usable voltage the fluorescence light levels present in even low concentration tryptophan solutions were higher than what the broadcom sipm is intended for thus it is functionally acting like a highly sensitive highly efficient photodiode two high powered uv leds seoul viosys with outputs centered around 275 10 nm were set perpendicular to the sipm these leds were chosen for their high power and wavelength precision around 275 nm seoul viosys 2018 the precision around 275 nm ensures the measured fluorescence is in the tlf region a particle boron from particle industries inc was used as the main microcontroller boron has an integrated long term evolution lte modem which allows for upgrades in the field and real time data feedback without physical access the particle boron controlled signal measurement from a water temperature sensor sparkfun electronics ambient enclosure temperature via 1 wire sensor located on the main pcb sipm bias voltage and sipm output also controlled by the boron was pulsing the two uv leds a 12v peristaltic pump to pull water through the sensor charging of a 3 7v lithium ion battery via 10w solar panel voltaic systems and data storage to a microsd card for backup and buffering if the lte connection got lost the uv led driver was designed to drive the led to a constant current pulsed in the millisecond ms range it is important for the led current to be very stable when on since any variation in the current will couple into the output measurement furthermore since different water samples may have very different levels of fluorescent response and noise the led current setpoint is variable instead of fixed the setpoint voltage given to the led driver circuit to follow is provided by a digital to analog converter dac the uv led driver circuit is composed of an op amp constant current source using a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor mosfet and a sense resistor for current feedback gain between the input voltage and the output current is set by this feedback resistor block circuit diagrams for the sipm board and led driver board are shown in fig e 16 measurements from the sensor were sent through the lte gateway to an online database the parameters collected from the sensor are shown in table a 3 2 1 2 mechanical the sensor uses a uv quartz flow through cuvette from fireflysci www fireflysci com the pathlength of the cuvette is 1 cm the leds and sipm pcb boards are mounted orthogonal onto a high precision 3d printed sleeve that slides onto the cuvette mounted on the sleeve between the sipm and the cuvette is a bandpass filter centered around 357 22 nm www edmundoptics com abrasion resistant rubber tubing is used to connect the cuvette to the peristaltic pump the main pcb board cuvette sleeve and pump are mounted in a polycase waterproof enclosure with a custom 3d printed mount the enclosure is mounted on a universal camera stake with tamper resistant screws so it can be easily and securely staked into the ground sensor and mounting design is shown in fig 2 2 2 lab validation lab validation was conducted to measure the signal sensitivity of the sensor to parameter changes in water all results from lab validation experiments tryptophan sensitivity e coli sensitivity wastewater sensitivity temperature correction biofouling and scaling were analyzed in r version 4 0 5 analysis of variance anova as well as t tests were conducted on the outputs to examine the statistical significance of experimental effects 2 2 1 tryptophan sensitivity standard l tryptophan solutions made with sigma aldrich reagent grade l tryptophan were made by mixing 1000 ml of type 1 ultrapure deionized di water astm d1193 91 and 0 1 g powdered tryptophan for 30 min to create a solution of 100 ppm tryptophan this stock solution was used to prepare serial dilutions of 0 05 0 1 0 5 1 3 10 30 70 ppb l tryptophan standards each solution was kept for a maximum of 72 hours before testing the sensor was rinsed by pumping di water through for 60 seconds to collect data for each solution starting with the lowest concentration di water and ending with the highest concentration 100 ppb the inlet tube was placed in the solution and the outlet tube placed in a waste container ten tlf measurements from the sensor with 80 samples averaged per measurement were taken for each solution the sensor was rinsed between each solution by running di water through for 30 seconds 2 2 2 wastewater sensitivity wastewater effluent was collected from the boulder wastewater treatment facility and stored at 4 c until it was used for testing for a maximum of 5 days standard dilutions were made by mixing di water and wastewater effluent to prepare 10 12 5 25 50 and 100 dilutions of wastewater effluent the ph of di and each wastewater effluent dilution was measured since di water exposed to air has the potential to be acidic table b 4 each solution was used within 48 hours of the time it was made sensor data for each dilution starting with the lowest concentration di and ending with the highest concentration 100 wastewater effluent dilutions was collected and analyzed using the same method that was used to collect the tryptophan data membrane filtration was used to enumerate e coli and total coliforms tc present in each dilution by plating a filter with m coliblue24 broth epa approved hach co 10029 method m coliblue24 broth indicates e coli colonies by blue coloration resulting from specific activity of β glucuronidase and tc by red coloration resulting from specific activity of β galactosidase tallon et al samples were plated in triplicates and incubated at 35 c for 18 24 hours 2 2 3 water temperature variation and correction tryptophan solutions were made following the methods described above each solution di water 1 3 10 30 70 100 200 ppb was refrigerated overnight at 4 c solutions were removed from the refrigerator one at a time and tested in ascending concentration solutions were placed on a hotplate stirrer and stirred during the entirety of the test heat was applied when the solution began to reach room temperature the temperature of the water was monitored using a thermocouple from 7 c to 35 c measurements were taken by the sensor at least three times per degree celsius this experiment lasted 8 5 hrs total or around 1 h for each solution a temperature correction factor was developed by fitting the output data to the following functional relationship established by watras et al 2011 watras et al 2011 1 t l f m t l f r e ρ t m t r where t is temperature c ρ is the temperature coefficient c 1 the subscripts r and m stand for the reference and measured values fitting negative exponential curves to the data and solving for ρ gives the ability to correct the data to a desired temperature 2 2 4 inner filter effects all fluorescence signal can be subjected to inner filter effects ife at high concentrations ife occurs when a portion of the excitation light is absorbed before it reaches the point in the sample where fluorescence occurs this is known as primary ife re absorption can also occur with a portion of the light emitted from the fluorophore before it reaches a detector known as secondary ife kubista et al 1994 ifes result in a attenuation of fluorescence signal if quantitative results of concentration are desired corrections must be made for ifes if a qualitative result of risk level of concentration is desired corrections may not be necessary samples from the wastewater sensitivity experiment were collected from the dilutions made and set aside each dilution was run on a uv visible spectrophotometer agilent cary 400 to collect absorbance data for 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm increments using a 1 cm path length cuvette the spectrophotometer used had a maximum absorbance of 1 and a scan rate of 600 nm min the absorbance data were used to calculate the impact of possible inner filter effects ife on the sensor s output kubista et al 1994 ife corrected measurements were then calculated using eq 2 2 f c o r r f o b s 10 a λ e x a λ e m 2 where f c o r r is the sensor s corrected fluorescence signal f o b s is the sensor s observed fluorescence signal a λ e x is the absorbance at the excitation wavelength and a λ e m is the fluorescence observed at the emission wavelength 2 2 5 chlorination impact to determine the impact of chlorine on the sensor s output 0 24 ml of bleach was added to 1000 ml wastewater effluent a 50 ppb tryptophan solution and di water once 0 24 ml of bleach was added to each dilution they were mixed for 30 minutes the ph of di and wastewater effluent was measured before bleach was added and after bleach was mixed in each solution for 30 minutes total chlorine present was measured at minute 1 and 30 free chlorine was measured at minute 30 10 measurements with the sensor were taken for each solution wastewater effluent wastewater effluent bleach 50 ppb tryptophan 50 ppb tryptophan bleach di water di bleach the concentration of e coli and tc before and 30 minutes after the addition of bleach were enumerated by membrane filtration using the method described above 2 2 6 biofouling estimation to establish biofilm growth and estimate its impact on sensor signal two sensors sampled tap water from a bucket that was occasionally spiked with wastewater effluent for four weeks the tap water was spiked with wastewater effluent then the sensors took a sample and then the bucket was cleaned and refilled with tap water grab samples were taken three times a day and enumerated for e coli and total coliforms by membrane filtration using the methods described above biofilm growth was inferred through proxy markers such as plating the contents on the cuvette s walls and benchtop fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems these markers estimated the presence or ab sense of biofilms the general assumption was that the proxy substance being measured was directly related to biofilm existence on the cuvette walls azeredo et al 2017 it is possible for biofilm to form on the walls of the tubing but it will not directly impact measurements in each sensor the cuvette was cleaned periodically before cleaning the biofilm growth was qualified with spectral analysis to create eems and quantified with membrane filtration fluorescence of the biofilm growth was collected using a fluorescence spectrofluorimeter fluoromax 4 emission wavelengths were measured from 300 to 400 nm in 2 nm increments excitation wavelengths from 300 to 240 nm in 10 nm increments and the excitation and emission bandpass was set to 5 nm and a 0 25 sec integration time absorbance data were collected using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer agilent cary 4000 which has a maximum absorbance of 1 and a scan rate of 600 nm min absorbance spectra were measured from a wavelength of 200 to 800 nm at 1 nm intervals after fluorescence and absorbance data were collected the eems were corrected using stardom r package version 1 1 14 pucher et al 2019 the r package stardom corrects inner filtering rayleigh and raman scattering and then subtracts background and baseline signal using data from a cuvette containing only di water tc and e coli inside the cuvette were enumerated through membrane filtration using the methods described above the cuvette was filled with a solution of pbs and water shaken for 30 secs to detach biofilm this was performed 15 times 10 ml of this solution was passed through a membrane filter 2 2 7 mineral scaling mineral scaling experiments were conducted using a scaling model solution at a concentration factor of eight compared to the composition of the colorado river consisting of calcium chloride dihydrate 0 0164 m magnesium sulfate 0 0105 m and sodium sulfate 0 0145 m rahardianto et al 2006 this solution contains eight times that of the mineral concentration found in the colorado river thus it can be estimated that in a field implementation of the sensor it would take at least eight times as long to achieve the level of scaling shown in this experiment the gypsum saturation index si was calculated in terms of eq 3 with visual minteq to find the degree of supersaturation of the scaling model solution https vminteq lwr kth se 3 s i c a 2 s o 4 2 k s p c a 2 s o 4 where ca2 and so4 2 are the activities of each of the ions and ksp is the solubility constant for gypsum the saturation index was found to be 1 01 making it supersaturated which significantly increases the likely hood of mineral scaling to occur before each experiment di water was cycled through the cuvette in the sensor for 2 hours then the scaling model solution was added and cycled through the cuvette for 24 hours to form scaling on the cuvette walls to analyze the impact of mineral scaling on the sensor s signal the mean sensitivity of the sensor s signal to 50 ppb tryptophan was compared before and after the scaling experiment 2 3 field validation in order to validate the sensor s functionality in the field four sensors were placed on boulder creek in boulder colorado in the summer of 2021 for 88 days 2 3 1 study area boulder creek flows out of the foothills and through boulder colorado the creek is a tributary of the south platte river and its flow is primarily derived from snow melt and minor springs west of the city boulder has a semi arid climate with an mean rainfall of 21 in annually murphy 2006 the section of boulder creek that was tested typically has a ph between 6 8 and 8 5 turbidity 10 ntus hardness between 30 and 1130 mg l temperature between 10 c and 25 c and doc between 2 and 8 mg l during the time of field deployment the main sources of fecal contamination in the creek are from humans living around the creek instream recreation leaking sanitary sewer lines failing septic systems or animals barber et al 2000 murphy 2006 four sensors were placed on boulder creek to monitor the fecal contamination at sites upstream within and downstream of the city fig 3 2 3 2 sensor sample collection sensors were set to sample the water in the creek every 10 minutes the sensor inlet and outlet tubes were submerged under the water but above the creek floor by securing them to holes in a ceramic brick the sampling sequence of the sensors was as follows water was pumped through the sensor for 20 seconds to flush a wait time was set to 2 seconds after pumping was complete so air bubbles were able to dissipate to take a measurement the leds were pulsed on for approximately 1000 ms and 80 readings taken from the sipm were averaged water was then pumped through again for 5 seconds and another measurement taken this was repeated for a total of three measurements every 10 minutes in order to provide a diverse range of gain outputs and decrease saturation events the current provided to the leds was set to 10 50 100 and 200ma one data point was recorded at each current level for each measurement for this context it was discovered that none of the current input levels performed better than the other thus to summarize one characteristic voltage per e coli enumeration voltage output normalized by current level was averaged for each measurement voltage from the in situ sensor was standardized to 20 c using water temperature measurements prior to being normalized the data were transmitted over cellular networks to an online database 2 3 3 training set development a training and validation data set of laboratory enumerated microbial contamination was developed in order to build and validate the ml model with the sensor data water samples were collected at each sensor site approximately 13 times per week for 13 weeks samples were collected from sensor sites as close to the inlet tube as possible and within 1 minute of the sensor taking a fluorescence reading in order to match ground truth to sensor measurements a phone based survey tool www mwater co was used to log and organize sampling data samples were collected in 50 ml sample bottles put into a cooler and transported to the lab for processing within two hours of collection membrane filtration was used to enumerate e coli and tc 10 ml of sample water was filtered through a 0 45 μ m filter then incubated using methods described above samples were plated in triplicates and averaged the outputs from the enumeration were multiplied by 10 to report in cfu 100ml plates were enumerated by counting the number of colonies present after incubation the data for number of e coli coliforms and tc were recorded in mwater the time the e coli sample was taken was matched with the sensor measurement taken contemporaneously this subset formed the training and testing datasets for modeling categorical e coli presence in the water was the desired response variable and several inputs were hypothesized to explain whether contamination was present namely continuous tlf measurements from the in situ sensor the date and time of sensor installation removal replacement and any cuvette cleaning events were also recorded in mwater 2 3 4 machine learning model a binary model was developed to predict whether a sample was at least at the who high risk level 100 cfus e coli 100 ml vs 100 cfus 100 ml another model for multinomial classification investigated performance at predicting the correct of five who risk categories thus continuous e coli measurements where characterized by number of cfus per 100 ml of water at very low risk 0 1 low risk 1 10 intermediate risk 11 100 high risk 101 1000 and very high risk 1000 who 1997 supervised ml models empirically find the best model fit by reducing the difference between the observed and predicted outcome ensemble ml also known as super learning applies multiple models learners to the same data and selects the optimal combination of them through cross validation van der laan et al 2007 for binary classification of contamination risk there were 8 candidate learners logistic regression lasso regression random forest pavlov 2019 gradient boosted decision tree xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 three k nearest neighbors zhang 2016 with k equal to 5 10 or 15 and a null model the multinomial classification considered up to 5 learners lasso regression random forest xgboost independent binomials and a null model ensemble learners are proven to perform as well as or better than any single candidate algorithm and minimizing cross validated risk controls for over fitting of the final ensemble model van der laan et al 2007 polley and van der laan 2010 modeling and feature design respected an internal four fold stratified cross validation structure balanced on risk category model features are the independent variables that can predict fecal contamination risk category the primary explanatory feature was the retrieved voltage from the in situ sensor standardized and normalized relative voltage was explained by the z score difference from rolling 7 day average and percentile the signal voltage is dependent on the input voltage and this variable was included as a potential effect modifier as biofouling and mineral scaling are likely to impact the sensor signal the number of hours since the optical sensor was cleaned was included as a feature in the model as a proxy for fouling coble et al 2014 each sensor was cleaned 2 3 times throughout the data collection period cleaning events were dictated by over saturation of the sensor or when the sensor was not functioning correctly an estimate of daily municipal rainfall was retrieved from noaa physical sciences laboratory and included as a model feature it is well known fecal contamination varies seasonally with rainfall kostyla et al 2015 water temperature was used as a feature and corrected to 20 c using eq 1 the temperature of the sipm will impact its output for this reason temperature inside the sensor enclosure was included as a feature kuznetsov 2018 field experimentation was conducted from june september 2021 so a variable of consecutive days since start of the experiment attempts to capture any remaining unexplained seasonality during this summer the ability to identify instances of high risk contamination from the sensor data and other input variables is evaluated by a receiver operating characteristic roc curve and area under the curve auc and cross validated accuracy and rates of misclassification discretized models output the predicted probability of a data point belonging to an outcome category predicted probabilities are assigned to categories based on whether they are above or below a set threshold determining the threshold is a trade off between sensitivity and specificity sensitivity is the proportion of correctly identified high risk events while specificity is the proportion of correctly identified instances of non high risk the roc curve plots sensitivity by one minus specificity and visually demonstrates the compromise between sensitivity and specificity youden s j statistic is often used as a threshold value and assumes both are equally important the auc demonstrates how good the model is at discriminating high risk overall despite the choice of threshold while accuracy is the percent of data points where predicted and observed high risk agree after implementing the threshold the null or no information rate is the expected accuracy based on the prevalence of the outcome the false negative rate fnr one minus sensitivity is relative to the number of underestimated instances of actual high risk conversely one minus specificity is equal to the false positive rate fpr and is the proportion of wrongly identified cases of high risk use among observed lower than high risk contamination additionally a variable importance plot indicates the relative information gained from each feature variable importance was measured by the risk ratio between the full model and a model on modified data where any dependence between the outcome and the respective feature is removed by permutation random sampling without replacement the performance of the multinomial model was evaluated with accuracy and true positive and negative rates all data management and analysis was conducted in r statistical computing software r core team 2019 the machine learning model was implemented in the r package sl3 coyle et al 2021 3 results 3 1 laboratory characterization 3 1 1 tryptophan sensitivity the sensor is able to produce a signal that was significantly different between di and 0 05 ppb tryptophan p value 0 01 t 8 for all current levels at a range of current inputs to the leds fig 4 thus the design goal of 1 ppb tryptophan signifying low risk contamination according to sorensen et al 2018 was met sorensen et al 2018a as the current to the leds increases the sensitivity at low concentrations of tryptophan increases as the current decreases a higher range of tryptophan concentrations is detectable 3 1 2 e coli sensitivity the sensor was able to produce signals that were significantly different between di and p value 0 01 t 4 2 e coli concentrations in a 5 wastewater effluent dilution which was enumerated through membrane filtration and contained 10 cfu 100ml which signifies intermediate risk contamination fig 5 the r 2 between e coli concentrations in the wastewater effluent dilutions and sensor output was 0 92 there was a drop in sensor output in the range of 1000 cfu 100ml the drop in sensor output can be attributed partly to ife but could also be a result of light scatter from particles the absorbance data collected on the benchtop spectrophotometer shows increasing absorbance as the concentrations increase the calculated corrected fluorescence due to ife increases the r 2 between e coli and sensor output to 0 95 table 1 the graphed comparison of the r 2 between measured and corrected output from the sensor can be seen in supplemental material 2 3 1 3 chlorination impact adding bleach to solutions of di water 50 ppb of tryptophan and to wastewater effluent significantly lowered the signal from the sensor fig 6 30 minutes after bleach was added to 50 ppb tryptophan the signal from the sensor lowered to a value below the signal measured for di 30 minutes after bleach was added to wastewater effluent the signal from the sensor was 40 lower than it was without the addition of bleach the ph of di water 50 ppb tryptophan and wastewater effluent was 6 67 6 82 and 7 02 before bleach was added and 8 07 8 21 and 7 32 30 minutes after bleach was added respectively the free chlorine present after 30 minutes in each solution was 5 9 5 5 and 5 6 mg l for the di 50 ppb tryptophan and wastewater effluent respectively 3 1 4 temperature sensitivity fluorescence output from the sensor declined with increased water temperature fig 7 the higher the concentration of tryptophan in the water the more significant impact water temperature has on the signal similarly to watras et al 2011 fluorescence declined exponentially with water temperature at all concentrations tested thus the methods for temperature correction of a fluorescence sensor described in that study were followed watras et al 2011 eq 1 was fit to each concentration and the mean ρ was averaged to be 0 03 using this value for ρ in eq 1 the effect of temperature can mostly be removed from the raw data with an mean standard deviation of 0 01 v for all concentrations fig 7b for the lower concentrations correcting the data causes a small increase of the sensor output with temperature 3 1 5 biofouling sensitivity as wastewater effluent was introduced to the sensor for extended periods of time an increase in the sensors signal was observed even when only sampling di water fig 8 a this signal increase is assumed to be attributable to biofilm growth on the inside walls of the cuvette spectral eems for a biofouled cuvette using the clean cuvette as a blank show an increase in signal in the tlf range fig 8b the enumeration of contents on the cuvette walls through membrane filtration show an average of 1080 cfu 100 ml of total coliforms and 10 cfu 100 ml of e coli monitoring absorbance in a cuvette with biofilms present will impact the outcome of the beer lambert law as it relies on path length and the concentration of a solution inside the cuvette varying the absorbance path length from 0 01 to 5 cm impacted scale of the results but since only the presence absence of increased fluorescence was of concern these impacts were disregarded since the cuvettes were filled only with di water the increase in fluorescence in fig 8b is inferred to be a proxy for presence of biofilms e coli enumeration showed 10 cfu 100ml were present inside the cuvette after this eem was taken taking the difference in signal from directly after a spike of wastewater was introduced and the bucket was cleaned signal drop and directly before the next spike of wastewater was introduced resulted in a mean signal growth of 82 due to biofouling of the lens spikes in the sensor signal from contamination can be observed through biofouling induced signal increase fig 8 as little as 17 cfu 100ml show a significant increase in signal even with a heavily biofouled lens there is an instance of sensor signal spike with no e coli present in the wastewater effluent an instance like this may be characterized as a false positive but could also indicate that there was a contamination event at a previous time but all live fib had died off 3 1 6 mineral scaling sensitivity mineral scaling showed a 5 reduction in sensitivity of the sensor s ability to detect 50 ppb tryptophan the 5 reduction in sensitivity was calculated by taking the difference in mean of the sensor s signal with a clean cuvette and a cuvette with mineral scaling between 50 ppb tryptophan dilution and di mineral scaling on the inside of the cuvette showed a 42 4 increase in absorbance at a wavelength of 275 nm and 38 1 increase at 360 nm percent increase was calculated using absorbance data collected on the uv vis before and after scaling occurred data presented in a study conducted by rahardianto et al 2006 shows that scaling increases with increasing supersaturation or increasing the saturation index rahardianto et al 2006 based on the results of other studies that investigate the affects of mineral scaling on fluorescence sensor signals it would be reasonable to assume that if the rate of scaling were to increase transmittance will decrease leading to an even larger decrease of sensitivity okazaki et al 2017 3 2 field validation e coli enumerated through membrane filtration in boulder creek ranged from 0 to 9580 cfus 100 ml with a mean of 120 cfus 100 ml over 298 observations the data were balanced between categories indicative of less than high risk contamination and high risk or above contamination table 2 few observations were in the low and very high risk categories the number of tc was also enumerated in each sample the who does not recommend tcs be used as a water quality or public health measure who 2017 therefore we did not undertake a machine learning model to predict tcs but confirmed that our methods distinguished between e coli and tc prevalence in the surface water of the creek measured tcs ranged from 77 11 440 cfus 100 ml mean 2700 cfus 100 ml sd 2000 cfus 100 ml there was only one observation of tcs below the who high risk category for e coli of 100 cfus 100 ml linear correlation between the number of e coli and tcs during the field experiment was 0 54 raw voltage readings below zero and above 2 8 v were dropped due to sensor non functionality or over saturation respectively enumeration of e coli occurred at 298 independent observations between 69 and 82 from each sampling site 3 2 1 dichotomized high risk 100 cfus 100 ml of contamination a machine learning model with tlf from in situ sensors as the principal feature identified high risk of fecal contamination in surface water with impressive skill the roc curve fig 9 demonstrates that both high sensitivity and specificity were achievable and that from the auc the model had a probability of 86 of accurately discriminating high contamination risk the sensitivity and specificity at the chosen predicted probability threshold were 80 and 86 respectively accuracy of detection of high risk contamination fig 10 was 83 95 ci 78 87 and significantly different from the null information rate 53 p value 0 001 one sided exact binomial test false positive and false negative rates were 20 and 14 given the sensor alerted to high risk contamination it was 87 likely that the water sample contained e coli at 100 cfus 100 ml or greater i e the positive predictive value fig 11 displays the ranking of model variables from most to least important for predictive performance the variable importance plot confirms that tlf is informative to the identification of high fecal contamination risk in water when using a remote in situ uninterrupted monitoring sensor randomizing sensor voltage increased model error by nearly 45 compared to a model preserving the observed sensor reading the relative importance of cleaning of the sensor to remove biofilm and scaling an increase in model risk of about 16 indicated that these phenomena also impacted the field experiment relative voltage temperature of the internal sensor board seasonality and the bias voltage demonstrated importance to detection of high risk contamination the sensor voltage z score amount of rainfall and water temperature did not appear informative a risk ratio close to or less than 1 0 the effect of water temperature was incorporated when standardizing the sensor voltage to 20 c the sensor sites covered a transect with one sensor upstream of the city of boulder in boulder canyon two sensors in the city of boulder and one just outside the urban area the contamination levels varied between sites as well as the accuracy of the binary classification model fig 12 the sensor with the highest accuracy boulder canyon had the least amount of contamination the sensor with the lowest accuracy had the most variation in contamination across all five risk levels the effect of daily streamflow on e coli prevalence was investigated but due to a high instance of missing data 53 in boulder creek during the summer of 2021 and the sparsity of this type of data in many contexts it was not retained in the final model when it was included with an additional missing indicator variable analysis not shown accuracy to detect high risk contamination improved but not significantly 85 vs 83 95 ci 78 87 3 2 2 categorical risk of contamination overall accuracy of a model detecting one of five contamination risk categories simultaneously was 64 95 ci 58 70 and significantly better than null accuracy 49 p value 0 001 one sided exact binomial test this model was still best at differentiating the high risk category with a true positive rate of 83 and a true negative rate of 69 fig 13 it performed moderately well at detecting intermediate risk with true positive and true negative rates of 65 and 73 respectively the combined sensor and machine learning algorithm system was not able to detect very low low or very high contamination true positive rates were never greater than 11 and true negative rates were not revealing of actual performance despite being very high because of low sample prevalence of e coli at these risk levels table 2 however when very high risk was incorrectly specified it was usually prescribed to the next closest category 85 of incidence of e coli over 1000 cfus 100 ml was classified as high to very high risk 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity the high sensitivity of the sensor to e coli detection can be attributed both to the integration of the sipm and the use of a machine learning model to compensate for fouling and improve noise reduction despite high concentrations of tcs in the water the sensor and ml model were able to predict levels of e coli which would suggest fecal contamination this finding supports the contribution of fecal contamination to tlf rather than the overall bacterial population in the water this result may be attributable to exogenous tryptophan present in fecal contamination which is directly related to the concentration of indole produced by the microbial concentration present causing a higher fluorescence output li and young 2013 the ability of fluorescence to distinguish between tc and fecal indicator organisms deserves more study especially in waters with less bacterial load such as groundwater or treated drinking water systems the bill of materials 1 000 and detection limit of 0 05 ppb tryptophan is competitive with similar probe style sensors not designed for continuous use sorensen et al 2018a sensor detection limits reported in the literature range from 0 1 ppb to 0 17 ppb khamis et al 2015 simões and dong 2018 the variable gain option integrated into the firmware of the sensor allows for the user to decide between higher sensitivity or higher range of output these options allow the sensor to be useful in a variety of different environments from surface water to groundwater to tap water this was achieved through varying the current levels to the leds though variable gain is not new to tlf sensors the integration of it into a ml model is we found no specific gain level contributed to better performance of the model for surface water where the sensor was tested it was theorized that a larger range might be more important than high sensitivity since there is high background fluorescence but that was not the case more investigation should be conducted on whether gain levels can impact performance of the sensor in waters with less background fluorescence noise like groundwater or treated water laboratory experiments showed that ife and possible light scattering impact the sensor s signal significantly the sensor s signal may be attenuated from absorption of either the excitation or emission wavelengths and or light scattering from particles nonetheless the ml model was able to predict high risk contamination with great skill since ife impacts high concentrations of contamination its impacts on the signal may not present a problem for differentiating between high risk and not high risk contamination light scattering occurring in the sensor s cuvette may increase it s signal along side tlf if this is the case the skill of the ml model may be attributed not only to the correlation between tlf and microbial activity but also turbidity increase which has also been shown to predict fecal contamination in some cases dorner et al 2007 sorensen et al 2020 through adding bleach to di water di with 50 ppb of tryptophan and wastewater effluent this study attempted to examine how chlorine impacts the sensor s signal in a study by alimova et al bleach completely decomposed tryptophan in lab grown e coli including the destruction of the indole ring and possibly destroyed most of the cell s proteins and amino acids alimova et al 2005 if this is the case the significant signal that remains in the wastewater after the addition of bleach might be extracellular material other than tryptophan and its derivatives there could be overlap with another fluorophore that is continuing to persist despite the bleach the sensor could be picking up signals outside of the tlf range since the bandpass range on the sensor is 44 nm more investigation should be done to determine what is fluorescing once tryptophan and its derivatives have been decomposed despite the fluorescence signal that remains after the addition to bleach in wastewater effluent a 40 drop in signal after the addition of bleach indicates that the sensor could be used to monitor the functionality of water distribution systems that use chlorine as their main disinfectant 4 2 machine learning system temperature biofouling mineral scaling turbidity and hlf signals will all impact tlf signals the decision to only monitor tlf and temperature from the sensor itself was made to simplify the mechanical and electrical design as well as the data analysis and collection processes adding more data sources like absorption or hlf measurements could greatly improve the ml model s performance ulliman et al 2020 despite multiple parameters interfering with the signal an ml model was able to predict high risk contamination with fpr and fnr of 20 and 14 respectively the ml model is able to learn the hidden features and patterns in the data to detect anomalies that relate to fecal contamination through the input of data sources other than just the tlf output from the sensor an integral feature in the model was the input of time since cleaning that represents a proxy for fouling through this feature the model is able to distinguish between increased signal due to fouling and increased signal due to fecal contamination in the water the fnr and fpr values are higher than demonstrated by sorenson et al who found a fpr and fnr of 4 and 17 respectively but that study was done using a field portable submersible fluorimeter that could be cleaned before and after each use and that study was performed using groundwater which has significantly less background fluorescence noise sorensen et al 2018a the unicef tpp has a minimum performance requirement of fpr and fnr 10 but they are also not requiring a continuously monitoring product a slightly lower accuracy might be a trade of for an enormous increase in data also judging by the performance of the sensor in water with less contamination we predict that if the sensor were to be validated in water with less background fluorescence like groundwater or treated water the fpr and fnr would lower significantly while others including sorensen et al 2018a have demonstrated a relationship between tlf and fecal indicator organisms with logistic regression this approach would have been inadequate in our study the accuracy of indicating levels of high risk contamination from fluorescence output with logistic regression analysis not shown was 64 95 ci 58 70 compared to an accuracy of 83 with our ml model furthermore the auc achieved with a logistic regression model was nearly no better than random chance at 0 55 compared to the much higher auc of 0 86 we achieved the ml model outperformed statistical methods previously used to predict water contamination with tlf while the ml model helps to prolong time periods between cleaning maintenance and cleaning will still be necessary these time periods between cleaning will depend on the context and contents of the water being tested future work will consist of incorporating a time to clean output from the model by monitoring a steady increase or decrease in voltage output from the sensor we could theoretically set an alarm when the voltage shows a consistent high or consistent low that signals excessive biofouling or mineral scaling depending on the use case of the sensor the output of the ml model in terms of risk categories may be used as more of an early warning system or supplemental data source for utilities or water service providers the sensor system may be a trigger for more extensive traditional fecal contamination enumeration methods when a more precise measurement is needed 4 3 going beyond e coli recent literature challenges e coli as the preferred microbial water quality indicator nowicki et al 2021 initial findings around e coli as an indicator for fecal contamination relied on the fact that e coli was mainly associated with the gastrointenstinal tract and thus associated with feces from humans and animals the secondary habitat for e coli water sediment soil and flora was thought to induce a net negative growth rate which implied short term host persistence savageau 1983 in the last few decades this assumption has been challenged by the increased discovery and characterization of naturalized e coli populations bergholz et al 2011 nowicki et al 2021 recommends tlf sensors along side sanitary inspections and traditional water quality monitoring to begin to differentiate between naturalized e coli and contamination events nowicki et al 2021 since the ml model developed in this study uses e coli as a training set this model may not assist in differentiating between naturalized e coli and contamination events interesting further research would be to investigate if it would be possible to train the ml model with other forms of ground truth that may more accurately depict fecal contamination that would be harmful to human health better water quality characterization is needed to capture the high temporal variability in water quality with more data on the temporal variation of fecal contamination better assessment of exposures and their impacts on human health will be possible daly and harris 2021 the sensor system described in this paper has the ability monitor contamination in real time and to predict high risk spikes of contamination with high accuracy sensitivity and specificity the implantation of this sensor into water service providers or consumers monitoring systems could be a huge step forward for microbial water quality analysis because it is able to predict magnitudes of contamination that are most harmful to human health 5 feedback informed accountability just as important as the functionality of the technology is its ease of use and ability to integrate into current water management practices now that the sensor s functionality in a certain context has been realized the integration of the sensor and its data platform into water systems needs to be considered a web based data interpretation program needs to be designed to alert water service providers or users of possible contamination in a matter that is clear and makes sense to the end user the end goal of the sensor is to be implemented into a drinking water system to improve the service provider or consumer s capacity to detect manage and mitigate fecal contamination risk levels water quality improvement based on sensor data requires considerable on going technical and planning support in order to maximize the benefits of the investment however to achieve this goal service providers must be trained on how to read the sensor data and have the ability to understand the results produced while also being able to apply that information to decision making around improvements in the water systems and have sufficient financial and human resources to carry out repairs when deemed necessary thomas and brown 2020 proposed eight characteristics of feedback of greatest utility in environmental health and engineering for global development the first of these is that the feedback should be developed in partnership with communities and service providers the design of the sensor feedback mechanism should be developed in partnership with end users their water quality information needs should be assessed and prioritized these needs may change based on the use case of the sensor the other feedback criterion are that that the usage of the data is incentivized cost effective transparent actionable timely objective and relevant thomas and brown 2020 in all cases an alarm from the tlf sensor should trigger an action if the sensor is being used in a water distribution or treatment system the alarm would trigger more extensive traditional testing to determine magnitude and origin of contamination if the sensor is installed in a household system in combination with treatment technology the alarm would trigger maintenance or filter replacement on the treatment technology incentives for these actions are clear mitigating contamination to continue providing or consuming clean water utilization of sensor data to trigger contamination investigation is extremely cost effective when the costs to conduct traditional testing on a similar temporal scale is considered the information provided from the sensor is clearly relevant timely and objective and the mitigation is actionable the transparent nature of the sensor data would be up to the water service provider keeping this information transparent and available to consumers would support in incentivizing action or motivating consumers to treat their own water when needed 6 future work design work has begun on advancing the technology from prototype to product the next iteration of the design will be in partnership with a home treatment system the target user for this design will be people that utilize well water for their drinking water well water is particularly vulnerable to contamination through septic system malfunction and proximity to livestock private groundwater supplies are not regulated by the us epa putting the responsibly of water testing and treatment onto the homeowners murphy et al 2020 many point of use pou water treatment technologies have been developed that are proven to be effective at treating multiple contaminants are highly commoditized and cost effective but have no way of offering real time performance monitoring wu et al 2021 for these reasons we are designing an in home sensor system to be paired with a treatment technology the sensor will be a miniturized version of the design built in this paper be able to be installed in line with a houses main water line and also have a cleaning function where a user injects cleaning solution through the sensor when extensive fouling has occurred the sensor s data will be sent through the user s wifi to an online database where the ml model will be applied to predict risk level a mobile app will be developed in order to alert the user if contamination is detected once contamination is detected a maintenance or replacement procedure will need to take place with the treatment technology a prototype of this sensor can be seen in fig 14 declaration of competing interest the authors declare the

15858,although ammonia recovery from wastewater can be environmentally friendly and energy efficient compared to the conventional haber bosch process there is a lack of research on the reuse of the recovered ammonia to exhibit a complete picture of resource recovery in this study a microbial electrochemical system mes was used to recover ammonia from a mixture of anaerobic digester ad centrate and food wastewater at a volume ratio of 3 1 more than 60 of ammonia nitrogen was recovered with energy consumption of 2 7 kwh kg 1 n the catholyte of the mes which contained the recovered ammonia was used to prepare fertilizers to support the growth of a model plant arabidopsis thaliana it was observed that a thaliana grown on the mes generated fertilizer amended with extra potassium phosphorus and trace elements showed comparable sizes and an even lower death rate 0 than the control group 24 that was added with a commercial fertilizer rna seq analyses were used to examine a thaliana genetic responses to the mes generated fertilizers or the commercial counterpart the comparative study offered metabolic insights into a thaliana physiologies subject to the recovered nitrogen fertilizers the results of this study have demonstrated the potential application of using the recovered ammonia from ad centrate as a nitrogen source in fertilizer and identified the necessity of supplementing other nutrient elements graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrochemical systems resource recovery digester centrate arabidopsis thaliana rna sequencing 1 introduction nitrogen plays an indispensable role in living organisms and thus is a key element for agricultural production ammonia nitrogen can be synthesized by nitrogen fixing bacteria and the haber bosch process the latter of which requires an extensive energy input accounting for 1 of the world s total energy usage and 1 4 of the global carbon dioxide emissions annually kyriakou et al 2020 wastewaters can contain a large amount of nitrogen compounds because of kitchen and toilet wastes being discharged to sewage the concentration of ammonia nitrogen can be tens of hundreds mg per liter in some wastewaters like anaerobic digester ad centrate or landfill leachate due to the toxic effects and a major component for causing eutrophication ammonia nitrogen must be substantially reduced in a wastewater typically via biological nitrification denitrification other biological methods such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation bhattacharjee et al 2017 nawaz et al 2021 and shortcut nitrification denitrification lu et al 2021 paredes et al 2007 have been employed to effectively remove ammonia nitrogen ammonia nitrogen can also be removed using a stripping method that consumes a substantial amount of energy and chemicals park and kim 2015 sustainable nitrogen management during wastewater treatment expects to recover valuable nitrogen compounds which will not only decrease energy chemical consumption by removal but also produce valuable nitrogen resources that reduce the need for ammonia synthesis by the energy intensive haber bosch process in general there are three approaches for recovering nh4 n from a wastewater physical chemical and biological processes physical processes take advantage of the positive charge of nh4 which can transfer and be adsorbed due to the electric force for example capacitive deionization can accumulate the wastewater nh4 n up to 927 mg l 1 zhang et al 2019 or a special aluminosilicate adsorbent can selectively recover 90 of nh4 n from wastewater manto et al 2018 however it is difficult to separate nh4 from other competing ions e g na and ca2 unless special adsorbents are used chemical processes usually involve ph adjustment to recover nitrogen either as precipitates e g struvite wang et al 2015 or ammonia gas dos santos et al 2020 at a cost of chemicals that are used to adjust ph and energy to remove water or provide aeration biological nitrogen recovery can be realized by microalgae that convert nh4 n or no3 to biomass with a high protein component which can be used to produce biodiesel or other health supplements vasconcelos fernandes et al 2015 this approach is limited by the slow growth of microalgae and potential inhibition by a high concentration of nh4 n wang et al 2018 an emerging technology for nitrogen recovery is based on microbial electrochemical systems mes which couple biological chemical and physical processes driven by bioelectricity generation from biological oxidation of organic matter with a relatively low energy consumption kelly and he 2014 nitrogen often exists in a wastewater as nh4 and can migrate in an electric field in an mes this migration allows nh4 to be separated from a wastewater and then concentrated in the recovering solution such as a catholyte kuntke et al 2014 or a special solution in a microbial resource recovery cell chen et al 2015 the mes technology has been studied to recover nh4 n from a variety of wastewaters including domestic wastewaters livestock wastewaters landfill leachate and source separated urine ye et al 2018 the nh4 n recovery efficiency of an mes typically varies between 60 and 90 affected by the initial nh4 n concentration in a wastewater applied current density and the concentrations of other cations in the recovery solution arredondo et al 2015 desloover et al 2012 the mes can achieve an nh4 n recovery rate of 0 02 11 57 kgn m 3 d 1 zou and he 2018 and would consume 0 8 8 5 kwh kg 1 n zou and he 2018 although this energy consumption may become higher when an mes is scaled up it has potential to be comparable to or even less than 8 12 kwh kg 1 n by the harbor bosch process giddey et al 2017 in addition recovery of ammonia eliminates the need for hydrogen that is required to synthesize ammonium by the harbor bosch process we must know that resource recovery is not completed until the recovered resource is applied although it is well acknowledged that the recovered nitrogen may be used as fertilizer in agriculture this has not been well examined with experimental proof to fill the knowledge gap in nitrogen recovery and reuse this study aimed to extract ammonia from a real ad centrate using an mes and then apply the recovered ammonia to support the growth of a model plant real food wastewater was used to supplement carbon source the specific objectives were to 1 optimize the ratio of ad centrate and food wastewater to achieve enhanced nitrogen recovery performance of the mes 2 investigate the efficacy of using the recovered ammonia as fertilizer and its effects on plant morphology and 3 explore the effects of the recovered fertilizer on the tested plants at a transcriptional level 2 methods 2 1 mes setup and operation a bench scale mes was built consisting of an anode chamber and a cathode chamber each of which had an effective volume of 336 ml 6 cm 16 cm 3 5 cm fig s1 the anode electrode was made of two carbon brushes length 15 cm diameter 3 cm that were electrically connected the cathode electrode included carbon cloth coated with 5 mg cm 2 activated carbon and a piece of stainless steel mesh 5 5 cm 15 5 cm l316 10 mesh as a current collector the anode and cathode chambers were separated by a piece of cation exchange membrane cem membranes international inc ringwood nj usa with an effective cross section area of 96 cm2 a power supply provided a constant voltage of 0 8 v montpart et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 across the anode electrode and cathode electrode and an external resistor was connected in the circuit to monitor the current generation the anode of the mes was inoculated with the effluent collected from the anode of a microbial fuel cell that had been operated to treat a municipal wastewater for over three months liu et al 2021 during the start up phase a synthetic anolyte was fed to the mes anode containing per 1 l 1 g naac 0 153 g nh4cl 0 031 g kh2po4 0 032 g cacl2 0 066 g mgso4 0 5 g nahco3 and 1 ml trace elements largust t angenent 2001 the initial catholyte was 50 mm phosphorus buffer saline both electrolytes were recirculated between the anode cathode chambers and the external containers to select electrochemically active bacteria eab the external resistor was gradually reduced from 5400 to 1 ω after the start up phase the anolyte was changed to a mixture of ad centrate and food wastewater with different volume ratios ad centrate was collected from the missouri river wastewater treatment plant st louis mo usa and the food wastewater was sampled from the dining service of washington university in st louis the food wastewater had an initial ph of 6 14 0 04 conductivity of 0 95 0 03 ms cm 1 cod of 2050 10 mg l 1 nh4 n 5 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 1 mg l 1 meanwhile the catholyte was changed to tap water to prevent ammonia from leaving the solution a ph control meter was used to keep the catholyte ph below 8 by adding 0 2 m sulfuric acid after each operational cycle of 24 h the anolyte was replaced with a fresh influent solution and the catholyte was replaced with tap water the removed catholyte was then used to prepare the fertilizer for further tests 2 2 experiment design 2 2 1 preparation of testing fertilizers nitrogen recovery in the mes was studied for the effect of the volume ratio between ad centrate and food wastewater and three ratios were investigated at 1 1 3 1 and 7 1 i e 50 25 and 12 5 food wastewater was used to examine the amount of electrons from food wastewater needed for migrating ammonium from ad centrate the key parameters including current generation conductivity ph cod and nh4 n concentrations were examined once an optimal ratio was determined the mes was operated to produce a catholyte that was used to prepare fertilizer table s1 for comparison and reference house fertilizer 15 16 17 peat lite jr peters inc pa usa was used group a and analyzed for its ph conductivity and major cations and anions the catholyte collected from the mes was diluted to achieve a similar total nitrogen concentration to the house fertilizer then the diluted catholyte was divided into three groups to prepare the testing fertilizers group b was the diluted catholyte without any additional chemicals group c contained kh2po4 and k2hpo4 to make the similar concentrations of potassium and phosphorus to those in group a group d on the top of group c was supplemented with several trace elements at the concentrations comparable to that of group a h3bo3 mncl2 4h2o fecl2 4h2o cuso4 5h2o zncl2 and na2moo4 2h2o in a pre experiment in which plants were provided with tap water only we did not observe the healthy growth of plants as expected because the test with deficient nutrients was already included plant growth on tap water only was not further studied or included in the comparison the ph of all fertilizer groups was adjusted between 6 5 and 7 0 using h2so4 or naoh the nitric acid was not used because it could bring extra nitrogen into the catholyte we did not use the hydrochloric acid as former research proved that high chloride concentrations would inhibit the growth of the model plant that was studied here 2 2 2 applying fertilizers to arabidopsis thaliana plant growth with the prepared fertilizer was conducted in the jeanette goldfarb plant growth facility jgpgf of washington university in st louis st louis mo usa arabidopsis thaliana was chosen as a model plant due to its low demand for hydration and fast growth rate five to eight weeks five parallel pots named by position using numbers 1 through 5 each of which contained five plants named by position using numbers 1 through 5 as well were employed under each condition group a through d for example an individual plant with a name a13 meant that it was in group a pot 1 and the third plant in the pot 1 commercial soil for seed germination and propagation bm2 berger quebec city canada was used as the media containing peat moss perlite vermiculite dolomitic and calcitic limestone all plants grew in the same reach in chamber in the jgpgf that controlled the temperature at 21 and moisture at 50 light with 175 μmol intensity was provided 8 h d to prevent flowering under a short daylight condition that would allow us to directly compare the size of a thaliana without considering the nutrition for flowers after seeding all plants were kept in the chamber without any nutrition for 2 weeks starting from the third week each pot was watered with 20 ml house fertilizer or the prepared fertilizers every other day for another 5 weeks the first day of fertilizing was numbered as day 0 and the last day was day 36 2 3 analyses and measurements 2 3 1 evaluation of mes performance the voltage of the mes was monitored using a multimeter 2700 keithley instruments inc cleveland oh usa the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod in both the anolyte and the catholyte were analyzed using a spectrophotometer dr 890 hach company loveland co usa the solution ph was measured with a bench ph meter oakton instruments vernon hills il usa the solution conductivity was measured using a bench conductivity meter mettler toledo columbus oh usa the concentrations of cations and anions were measured using ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the concentrations of trace elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion 2000 perkinelmer downers grove il usa the electron ion transfer

distance between the tips of two leaves in the direction perpendicular to the length every 6 days during the 5 week fertilizing period then the leaves in groups a b and d were collected for rna extraction and library construction those three groups represented commercial fertilizer a original catholyte b and fully supplemented catholyte d those leave samples were cleaned with rna free water dried with kimtech wipers and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen novogene https en novogene com provided rna seq and data analysis methods of rna extraction and library construction are described in the supporting information all the plants above the surface of the soil were collected to measure their wet weights with an analytical balance if the wet weight of a plant was lower than 0 05 g usually with flaccid and dried leaves noodén and penney 2001 we considered it as dead in the present study then all plants were placed in coin envelopes and dried in drying oven at 60 overnight and the dry weights were also measured we conducted one way anova of groups a c and d in terms of the sizes and weights of all the live plants using origin software α 0 05 and tukey method is used for multiple comparison adjustment 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonia recovery in the mes 3 1 1 effect of wastewater volume ratio ammonia recovery in the mes was investigated with the varied ratio between ad centrate and food wastewater to determine an optimal combination of ammonia input ad centrate and organic supply food wastewater the results are summarized in fig 1 and table s2 it was observed that current generation exhibited a typical batch profile reaching the highest after a fresh anolyte was supplied and then decreased when the organics were consumed fig 1a the highest peak current of 25 ma was obtained with the ratio 3 1 although the peak current with 7 1 was higher than that with 1 1 the current generation with 7 1 decreased more sharply resulting the lowest total coulomb of 836 23 c the highest coulomb production of 1241 27 c was obtained with the ratio of 3 1 followed by 1035 35 c with 1 1 the highest electricity generation with the ratio 3 1 was a result of the combined effects of both cod concentration and the influent conductivity the initial cod concentration in the anolyte was 1620 28 1156 20 and 940 25 mg l 1 with the ratio 1 1 3 1 and 7 1 fig 1b which was affected by the amount of food wastewater the final cod concentration with three ratios was 992 23 771 16 and 754 20 mg l 1 resulting in removal efficiency of 38 8 1 4 33 3 1 4 and 19 8 2 2 respectively the residue cod was mostly from ad centrate that could not be easily utilized by eab and it is recommend that the treated anolyte should be returned to the mainstream treatment system like that for treating ad effluent centrate although the ratio 7 1 had the lowest cod input its initial conductivity of 5 91 0 06 ms cm 1 was the highest followed by 5 52 0 04 ms cm 1 3 1 and 3 80 0 08 ms cm 1 1 1 fig 1c suggesting that more ad centrate would increase the solution conductivity and thus decrease the internal resistance of the mes in the present mes a low volumetric ratio 1 1 brought in more organics from food wastewater but had a lower conductivity less ad centrate leading to a relatively lower peak current due to a high internal resistance that could last for a longer period of time due to sufficient organic supply a high ratio 7 1 generated a high peak current instantly benefited from its high conductivity and thus a lower internal resistance but the current generation could not last longer due to less organic input this combined effects from both organic input and solution conductivity led to the best performance of electricity generation with the ratio of 3 1 the nh4 n concentrations in the anolyte and the catholyte followed the similar trend as the conductivity fig 1c 1f with three ratios 70 3 1 1 68 6 1 5 47 8 1 2 of nh4 n was removed from the anolyte which had an initial nh4 n concentration of 393 12 626 12 and 690 8 mg l 1 respectively the final nh4 n concentration in the catholyte was 407 12 mg l 1 when the volume ratio was 3 1 higher than 310 8 and 280 2 mg l 1 with 1 1 and 7 1 the transport efficiency of ammonium ions was similar under different conditions 51 6 56 5 and 57 7 respectively indicating that more than 50 of electric charge could be used to move ammonium ions the rest of electric charge was likely used to migrate other cations the energy used to recover ammonia nitrogen were estimated 3 0 2 7 and 2 6 kwh kg 1 n under three conditions comparable with other studies kuntke et al 2018 qin et al 2018 hydrogen gas could also be produced from the mes cathode but it was not collected in this study theoretically the production of hydrogen gas might be able to offset some energy consumption as well although its collection and conversion would require additional efforts 3 1 2 extended operation because of the highest nh4 n concentration in the catholyte and a relatively lower energy consumption the volume ratio of 3 1 was employed in a longer term operation of the mes for producing the catholyte that was then used to prepare fertilizer in a period of three weeks the mes was able to perform consistently for current generation fig 2 a the average nh4 n concentration recovered in the catholyte of the mes was 294 17 mg l 1 fig 2b the reason for a lower nh4 n concentration was because we collected a new ad centrate which had a lower nh4 n concentration than the previous one actual wastewater centrate can have varied concentrations of contaminants as a result the initial nh4 n concentration after mixing with food wastewater was 465 7 mg l 1 lower than 626 12 mg l 1 in fig 1e because the recovered catholyte would need to be diluted a varied initial nh4 n concentration did not affect the nh4 n concentration in the testing fertilizers the conductivity of both anolyte and catholyte were stable in this period fig s2a and b likewise the anolyte ph was also stable fig s2c but the final ph of the catholyte varied from 6 to 8 fig s2d influenced by the addition of acids 3 2 characterization of the prepared fertilizer the key components of the house fertilizer are shown in table s3 s4 used as a reference to prepare three different testing fertilizers to investigate the effects of major nutrient elements e g nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and trace elements it should be noted that nitrogen existed in both ammonium and nitrate in the house fertilizer group a while only ammonia nitrogen was present in the other groups however the total nitrogen concentrations were similar among all groups our preliminary experiment found that there was no significant difference in the growth of a thaliana between the fertilizer containing ammonia nitrogen only and a mixture of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen fig s3 likely due to the conversion of some ammonia to nitrate via nitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria that were present in the soil the catholyte of the mes contained 44 0 1 8 mg l 1 of potassium and a few other elements but had no phosphorus fig s4 because cem allows only cations such as nh4 to migrate from the anolyte to the catholyte and would reject po4 3 ions six trace elements were analyzed in the catholyte according to the receipt of the house fertilizer listed in table s2 three trace elements had very low concentrations molybdenum 1 1 0 2 μg l 1 boron 30 μg l 1 and copper 30 μg l 1 the other three trace elements had relatively higher concentrations though still lower than the target concentrations listed in table s4 based on the element concentrations in the catholyte and house fertilizer two more testing fertilizers were prepared the cation and anion compositions of all four fertilizers are shown in fig 3 a and 3b one can see that the sulfate concentration in the testing fertilizers group b c and d was much higher than that in the house fertilizer because sulfuric acid was used to maintain the catholyte ph under 8 to prevent the escape of recovered ammonium from the catholyte and to further adjust the fertilize ph to 6 5 7 0 3 3 application of fertilizer to support plant growth four groups of fertilizers were applied to the plants every other day as described in the method section visual observation found that group a and group d grew better than the other two groups and had fewer dead plants 6 out of 25 for group a and 0 out of 25 for group d compared to 20 dead plants out of 25 in groups b and 10 out of 25 in group c during the five week fertilizing period fig 4 the occurrence of dead plants in group a was not expected and might be related to the intense competition among the plants for nutrient and light the plants that were growing more slowly could be more disadvantageous in the later phase when the faster growing plants shaded light with their larger leaves the poor growth of a thaliana in group b was mainly due to the lack of phosphorus and potassium which are related to the health of roots and stems of plants the growth of group c plants might have been limited by the low concentrations of important trace elements the growth of plants was monitored via measuring their length and width every six days fig 5 and compared by anova table 1 because most plants in group b died during the fertilizing period they were excluded from the measurement both the length and the width were similar among these three groups at 0 day after kept at reach in chamber for two weeks without fertilization p 0 05 however the difference began to appear after different fertilizers was applied for example the leaf length showed a significant difference between group a and other groups p 0 05 after 18 days nearly all groups showed significant differences in terms of leaf length and width the anova results of wet weights and dry weights suggest that there was no significant difference between group c and d p 0 05 while they both differed significantly from group a p 0 05 we inferred that the trace elements did not have much effect on the total mass of a thaliana as potassium and phosphorus but they had some impact on the size of the plants 3 4 effect of fertilizers on expressed genes gene expression of the leaves of a thaliana in group a b and d were analyzed to investigate the effect of applied fertilizers as shown in table s5 high rates of clean reads 94 44 and q30 90 86 are obtained the distances and correlations in terms of the expressed genes in different groups are demonstrated by principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation analysis in fig s5 and s6 higher similarity between groups a and d than groups a and b was found by comparing the distances between different samples on the pca plot additionally fig s5 shows that the correlation coefficients r2 between the paired samples from group a and d were 0 823 0 853 larger than those between group a and b 0 801 0 827 the number of differentially expressed genes are listed in the co expression venn diagram fig s7a all groups shared 14 883 genes indicating over 94 of the detected genes in three groups showed no significant difference p 0 05 group a and d shared 931 similar genes that are expressed significantly differently in group b larger than the 282 uniquely existing in group a and b this can explain the stressed physiological characteristics size and weight when group b are compared with other groups according to the cluster analysis results based on the fpkm results from rna sequencing group d has larger similarity to group a compared with group b fig s7b although the above results acquired from differential expressed genes degs indicate that the extra nutrients added to the catholyte played an important role to support the growth of a thaliana the nitrogen ammonia recovered from digester centrate was a potential nitrogen source because less than 6 genes were expressed differently in group a that was fed with house fertilizer furthermore we examined individual genes to reveal plant physiological responses based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database the top 20 genes that were mostly up or down regulated between each group are listed in table s6 log2 fold changes are in the ranges from 7 to 11 there are several interesting findings first when comparing differentially expressed genes between groups a and d against group b genes related to phosphate starvation were shown to be upregulated in group b indicating that phosphate supplementation in the commercial fertilizer and the recovered nitrogen fertilizer from group d is essential for healthy plant growth second udp glycosyltransferase ugt 76f2 was upregulated in groups a and d when compared to group b ugt is responsible for many critical biological functions like detoxification cuticle formation and olfaction zhou et al 2019 this gene is not upregulated when only nh4 is present indicating impaired cell function in the absence of additional nutrients third genes related to late embryogenesis abundant lea proteins related to plants environmental stress response such as water stress tolerance were downregulated in groups a and d when compared to group b goyal et al 2005 hundertmark and hincha 2008 moreover an lea protein gene was significantly downregulated in group d when compared to group a log2 fold change of 7 490 these observations indicates that group d fertilizer may allow plants to better mitigate environmental stresses fourth two genes related to auxin response were found to be downregulated in group d compared to group a auxin is a phytohormone that is often included in commercial fertilizers rocha et al 2020 which influences plant growth and development finally these individual genes with mostly drastic changes in expressions were not related to central metabolism therefore we further examined the genes in central carbon pathways table s7 the highest similarity was seen again between groups a and d log2 fold changes were well below one unit expression of genes related to central carbon metabolism glycolysis tca cycle and pentose phosphate pathway are most similar between groups a and d further suggesting the recovered fertilizer with nutrient supplements had similar effect on plant central pathways to the commercial fertilizer additional analysis has been performed to examine photosynthesis energy and nitrogen metabolisms with gene ontology go when group b was compared with group a with go enrichment 4500 4293 and 4141 degs were found in biological process cellular component and molecular functions respectively among all the 3652 go terms 224 terms showed significant enrichment and the first 20 terms were listed in fig 6 a biological process and cellular component related to photosynthesis showed the largest difference for example thylakoid is the site for the light dependent photosynthesis process and four thylakoid terms enriched significantly with more than 200 degs in each term additionally photosynthesis and photosystem terms also showed significant enrichment indicating the photosynthetic processes were affected if phosphorus potassium and other trace elements were missing when group d was compared with group a with go enrichment only 2083 1994 and 1874 degs were identified in the three categories 214 out of 3323 go terms were found to change significantly however when the corresponding terms were selected terms of photosystem go 0 009 521 plastoglobule go 0 010 287 photosynthetic electron transport chain go 0 009 767 and photosystem ⅱ go 0 009 523 were not significantly different p 0 05 from those in group a fig 6b indicating that a thaliana in group d had more similar photosynthetic performance to group a than those in group b when kegg enrichment analysis was performed between group b and group a 1228 degs were found in 115 pathways and 13 pathways including photosynthesis ath00195 oxidative phosphorylation ath00190 nitrogen metabolism ath00910 etc were significantly different between group b and group a fig 7 a on the other hand when group d was compared with group a only 596 degs were found in 108 different pathways in a thaliana in addition the number of significantly different pathways decreased to 7 although the other two pathways 2 oxocarboxylic acid metabolism ath01210 and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis ath00290 were not listed in fig 7b considering the small number of pathways 7 out of hundreds of pathways in a thaliana listed in kegg database were affected significantly between group d and group a we infer that our test fertilizers with nitrogen recovered directly from actual digester centrate are appropriate to support the growth of a thaliana 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated a complete process of nitrogen recovery from real digester centrate and reuse as a part of fertilizer for plant growth the results can be inspiring to achieve economic and sustainable nutrient recovery from wastewater with the following main conclusions 1 when the digester centrate was mixed with food wastewater ata volume ratio of 3 1 the mes achieved the best performance with an average current of 4 8 ma and over 60 nitrogen recovery efficiency the transport efficiency of ammonium ions was 57 and the energy consumption was estimated to be 2 7 kwh kg 1 n 2 after three prepared testing fertilizers being applied to a thaliana group d showed the best growth results with the largest final size and weight close to group a watered with house fertilizer as a control group d had the least dead plant after five weeks compared with 6 20 and 10 out of 25 for group a b and c respectively 3 plant rna sequencing analysis showed that a thaliana grown on fully supplemented fertilizer had the highest similarity of differentially expressed genes compared to the commercial fertilizer with the fewest genes related to central cellular metabolic processes 4 the potential application of the fertilizer recovered from wastewater warrants further investigation of a detailed analysis of the health impact caused by heavy metals e g cr and cd examination of other representative plants and exploration of low cost sources of supplementary nutrient elements to amend the prepared fertilizer

15858,although ammonia recovery from wastewater can be environmentally friendly and energy efficient compared to the conventional haber bosch process there is a lack of research on the reuse of the recovered ammonia to exhibit a complete picture of resource recovery in this study a microbial electrochemical system mes was used to recover ammonia from a mixture of anaerobic digester ad centrate and food wastewater at a volume ratio of 3 1 more than 60 of ammonia nitrogen was recovered with energy consumption of 2 7 kwh kg 1 n the catholyte of the mes which contained the recovered ammonia was used to prepare fertilizers to support the growth of a model plant arabidopsis thaliana it was observed that a thaliana grown on the mes generated fertilizer amended with extra potassium phosphorus and trace elements showed comparable sizes and an even lower death rate 0 than the control group 24 that was added with a commercial fertilizer rna seq analyses were used to examine a thaliana genetic responses to the mes generated fertilizers or the commercial counterpart the comparative study offered metabolic insights into a thaliana physiologies subject to the recovered nitrogen fertilizers the results of this study have demonstrated the potential application of using the recovered ammonia from ad centrate as a nitrogen source in fertilizer and identified the necessity of supplementing other nutrient elements graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial electrochemical systems resource recovery digester centrate arabidopsis thaliana rna sequencing 1 introduction nitrogen plays an indispensable role in living organisms and thus is a key element for agricultural production ammonia nitrogen can be synthesized by nitrogen fixing bacteria and the haber bosch process the latter of which requires an extensive energy input accounting for 1 of the world s total energy usage and 1 4 of the global carbon dioxide emissions annually kyriakou et al 2020 wastewaters can contain a large amount of nitrogen compounds because of kitchen and toilet wastes being discharged to sewage the concentration of ammonia nitrogen can be tens of hundreds mg per liter in some wastewaters like anaerobic digester ad centrate or landfill leachate due to the toxic effects and a major component for causing eutrophication ammonia nitrogen must be substantially reduced in a wastewater typically via biological nitrification denitrification other biological methods such as anaerobic ammonia oxidation bhattacharjee et al 2017 nawaz et al 2021 and shortcut nitrification denitrification lu et al 2021 paredes et al 2007 have been employed to effectively remove ammonia nitrogen ammonia nitrogen can also be removed using a stripping method that consumes a substantial amount of energy and chemicals park and kim 2015 sustainable nitrogen management during wastewater treatment expects to recover valuable nitrogen compounds which will not only decrease energy chemical consumption by removal but also produce valuable nitrogen resources that reduce the need for ammonia synthesis by the energy intensive haber bosch process in general there are three approaches for recovering nh4 n from a wastewater physical chemical and biological processes physical processes take advantage of the positive charge of nh4 which can transfer and be adsorbed due to the electric force for example capacitive deionization can accumulate the wastewater nh4 n up to 927 mg l 1 zhang et al 2019 or a special aluminosilicate adsorbent can selectively recover 90 of nh4 n from wastewater manto et al 2018 however it is difficult to separate nh4 from other competing ions e g na and ca2 unless special adsorbents are used chemical processes usually involve ph adjustment to recover nitrogen either as precipitates e g struvite wang et al 2015 or ammonia gas dos santos et al 2020 at a cost of chemicals that are used to adjust ph and energy to remove water or provide aeration biological nitrogen recovery can be realized by microalgae that convert nh4 n or no3 to biomass with a high protein component which can be used to produce biodiesel or other health supplements vasconcelos fernandes et al 2015 this approach is limited by the slow growth of microalgae and potential inhibition by a high concentration of nh4 n wang et al 2018 an emerging technology for nitrogen recovery is based on microbial electrochemical systems mes which couple biological chemical and physical processes driven by bioelectricity generation from biological oxidation of organic matter with a relatively low energy consumption kelly and he 2014 nitrogen often exists in a wastewater as nh4 and can migrate in an electric field in an mes this migration allows nh4 to be separated from a wastewater and then concentrated in the recovering solution such as a catholyte kuntke et al 2014 or a special solution in a microbial resource recovery cell chen et al 2015 the mes technology has been studied to recover nh4 n from a variety of wastewaters including domestic wastewaters livestock wastewaters landfill leachate and source separated urine ye et al 2018 the nh4 n recovery efficiency of an mes typically varies between 60 and 90 affected by the initial nh4 n concentration in a wastewater applied current density and the concentrations of other cations in the recovery solution arredondo et al 2015 desloover et al 2012 the mes can achieve an nh4 n recovery rate of 0 02 11 57 kgn m 3 d 1 zou and he 2018 and would consume 0 8 8 5 kwh kg 1 n zou and he 2018 although this energy consumption may become higher when an mes is scaled up it has potential to be comparable to or even less than 8 12 kwh kg 1 n by the harbor bosch process giddey et al 2017 in addition recovery of ammonia eliminates the need for hydrogen that is required to synthesize ammonium by the harbor bosch process we must know that resource recovery is not completed until the recovered resource is applied although it is well acknowledged that the recovered nitrogen may be used as fertilizer in agriculture this has not been well examined with experimental proof to fill the knowledge gap in nitrogen recovery and reuse this study aimed to extract ammonia from a real ad centrate using an mes and then apply the recovered ammonia to support the growth of a model plant real food wastewater was used to supplement carbon source the specific objectives were to 1 optimize the ratio of ad centrate and food wastewater to achieve enhanced nitrogen recovery performance of the mes 2 investigate the efficacy of using the recovered ammonia as fertilizer and its effects on plant morphology and 3 explore the effects of the recovered fertilizer on the tested plants at a

mg l 1 nh4 n 5 mg l 1 and po4 3 p 1 mg l 1 meanwhile the catholyte was changed to tap water to prevent ammonia from leaving the solution a ph control meter was used to keep the catholyte ph below 8 by adding 0 2 m sulfuric acid after each operational cycle of 24 h the anolyte was replaced with a fresh influent solution and the catholyte was replaced with tap water the removed catholyte was then used to prepare the fertilizer for further tests 2 2 experiment design 2 2 1 preparation of testing fertilizers nitrogen recovery in the mes was studied for the effect of the volume ratio between ad centrate and food wastewater and three ratios were investigated at 1 1 3 1 and 7 1 i e 50 25 and 12 5 food wastewater was used to examine the amount of electrons from food wastewater needed for migrating ammonium from ad centrate the key parameters including current generation conductivity ph cod and nh4 n concentrations were examined once an optimal ratio was determined the mes was operated to produce a catholyte that was used to prepare fertilizer table s1 for comparison and reference house fertilizer 15 16 17 peat lite jr peters inc pa usa was used group a and analyzed for its ph conductivity and major cations and anions the catholyte collected from the mes was diluted to achieve a similar total nitrogen concentration to the house fertilizer then the diluted catholyte was divided into three groups to prepare the testing fertilizers group b was the diluted catholyte without any additional chemicals group c contained kh2po4 and k2hpo4 to make the similar concentrations of potassium and phosphorus to those in group a group d on the top of group c was supplemented with several trace elements at the concentrations comparable to that of group a h3bo3 mncl2 4h2o fecl2 4h2o cuso4 5h2o zncl2 and na2moo4 2h2o in a pre experiment in which plants were provided with tap water only we did not observe the healthy growth of plants as expected because the test with deficient nutrients was already included plant growth on tap water only was not further studied or included in the comparison the ph of all fertilizer groups was adjusted between 6 5 and 7 0 using h2so4 or naoh the nitric acid was not used because it could bring extra nitrogen into the catholyte we did not use the hydrochloric acid as former research proved that high chloride concentrations would inhibit the growth of the model plant that was studied here 2 2 2 applying fertilizers to arabidopsis thaliana plant growth with the prepared fertilizer was conducted in the jeanette goldfarb plant growth facility jgpgf of washington university in st louis st louis mo usa arabidopsis thaliana was chosen as a model plant due to its low demand for hydration and fast growth rate five to eight weeks five parallel pots named by position using numbers 1 through 5 each of which contained five plants named by position using numbers 1 through 5 as well were employed under each condition group a through d for example an individual plant with a name a13 meant that it was in group a pot 1 and the third plant in the pot 1 commercial soil for seed germination and propagation bm2 berger quebec city canada was used as the media containing peat moss perlite vermiculite dolomitic and calcitic limestone all plants grew in the same reach in chamber in the jgpgf that controlled the temperature at 21 and moisture at 50 light with 175 μmol intensity was provided 8 h d to prevent flowering under a short daylight condition that would allow us to directly compare the size of a thaliana without considering the nutrition for flowers after seeding all plants were kept in the chamber without any nutrition for 2 weeks starting from the third week each pot was watered with 20 ml house fertilizer or the prepared fertilizers every other day for another 5 weeks the first day of fertilizing was numbered as day 0 and the last day was day 36 2 3 analyses and measurements 2 3 1 evaluation of mes performance the voltage of the mes was monitored using a multimeter 2700 keithley instruments inc cleveland oh usa the concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand cod in both the anolyte and the catholyte were analyzed using a spectrophotometer dr 890 hach company loveland co usa the solution ph was measured with a bench ph meter oakton instruments vernon hills il usa the solution conductivity was measured using a bench conductivity meter mettler toledo columbus oh usa the concentrations of cations and anions were measured using ion chromatography thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the concentrations of trace elements were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry nexion 2000 perkinelmer downers grove il usa the electron ion transfer efficiency te for nh4 migration was calculated according to eq 1 1 t e f v c f m 0 t i d t 100 where i is the current ma t is the total cycle time s c f is the final concentration of nh4 n mg l 1 in

catholyte l 2 3 2 analysis of plant morphology and gene expression the individual plant was analyzed for its length determined by the longest distance between the tips of two leaves and width the distance between the tips of two leaves in the direction perpendicular to the length every 6 days during the 5 week fertilizing period then the leaves in groups a b and d were collected for rna extraction and library construction those three groups represented commercial fertilizer a original catholyte b and fully supplemented catholyte d those leave samples were cleaned with rna free water dried with kimtech wipers and frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen novogene https en novogene com provided rna seq and data analysis methods of rna extraction and library construction are described in the supporting information all the plants above the surface of the soil were collected to measure their wet weights with an analytical balance if the wet weight of a plant was lower than 0 05 g usually with flaccid and dried leaves noodén and penney 2001 we considered it as dead in the present study then all plants were placed in coin envelopes and dried in drying oven at 60 overnight and the dry weights were also measured we conducted one way anova of groups a c and d in terms of the sizes and weights of all the live plants using origin software α 0 05 and tukey method is used for multiple comparison adjustment 3 results and discussion 3 1 ammonia recovery in the mes 3 1 1 effect of wastewater volume ratio ammonia recovery in the mes was investigated with the varied ratio between ad centrate and food wastewater to determine an optimal combination of ammonia input ad centrate and organic supply food wastewater the results are summarized in fig 1 and table s2 it was observed that current generation exhibited a typical batch profile reaching the highest after a fresh anolyte was supplied and then decreased when the organics were consumed fig 1a the highest peak current of 25 ma was obtained with the ratio 3 1 although the peak current with 7 1 was higher than that with 1 1 the current generation with 7 1 decreased more sharply resulting the lowest total coulomb of 836 23 c the highest coulomb production of 1241 27 c was obtained with the ratio of 3 1 followed by 1035 35 c with 1 1 the highest electricity generation with the ratio 3 1 was a result of the combined effects of both cod concentration and the influent conductivity the initial cod concentration in the anolyte was 1620 28 1156 20 and 940 25 mg l 1 with the ratio 1 1 3 1 and 7 1 fig 1b which was affected by the amount of food wastewater the final cod concentration with three ratios was 992 23 771 16 and 754 20 mg l 1 resulting in removal efficiency of 38 8 1 4 33 3 1 4 and 19 8 2 2 respectively the residue cod was mostly from ad centrate that could not be easily utilized by eab and it is recommend that the treated anolyte should be returned to the mainstream treatment system like that for treating ad effluent centrate although the ratio 7 1 had the lowest cod input its initial conductivity of 5 91 0 06 ms cm 1 was the highest followed by 5 52 0 04 ms cm 1 3 1 and 3 80 0 08 ms cm 1 1 1 fig 1c suggesting that more ad centrate would increase the solution conductivity and thus decrease the internal resistance of the mes in the present mes a low volumetric ratio 1 1 brought in more organics from food wastewater but had a lower conductivity less ad centrate leading to a relatively lower peak current due to a high internal resistance that could last for a longer period of time due to sufficient organic supply a high ratio 7 1 generated a high peak current instantly benefited from its high conductivity and thus a lower internal resistance but the current generation could not last longer due to less organic input this combined effects from both organic input and solution conductivity led to the best performance of electricity generation with the ratio of 3 1 the nh4 n concentrations in the anolyte and the catholyte followed the similar trend as the conductivity fig 1c 1f with three ratios 70 3 1 1 68 6 1 5 47 8 1 2 of nh4 n was removed from the anolyte which had an initial nh4 n concentration of 393 12 626 12 and 690 8 mg l 1 respectively the final nh4 n concentration in the catholyte was 407 12 mg l 1 when the volume ratio was 3 1 higher than 310 8 and 280 2 mg l 1 with 1 1 and 7 1 the transport efficiency of ammonium ions was similar under different conditions 51 6 56 5 and 57 7 respectively indicating that more than 50 of electric charge could be used to move ammonium ions the rest of electric charge was likely used to migrate other cations the energy used to recover ammonia nitrogen were estimated 3 0 2 7 and 2 6 kwh kg 1 n under three conditions comparable with other studies kuntke et al 2018 qin et al 2018 hydrogen gas could also be produced from the mes cathode but it was not collected in this study theoretically the production of hydrogen gas might be able to offset some energy consumption as well although its collection and conversion would require additional efforts 3 1 2 extended operation because of the highest nh4 n concentration in the catholyte and a relatively lower energy consumption the volume ratio of 3 1 was employed in a longer term operation of the mes for producing the catholyte that was then used to prepare fertilizer in a period of three weeks the mes was able to perform consistently for current generation fig 2 a the average nh4 n concentration recovered in the catholyte of the mes was 294 17 mg l 1 fig 2b the reason for a lower nh4 n concentration was because we collected a new ad centrate which had a lower nh4 n concentration than the previous one actual wastewater centrate can have varied concentrations of contaminants as a result the initial nh4 n concentration after mixing with food wastewater was 465 7 mg l 1 lower than 626 12 mg l 1 in fig 1e because the recovered catholyte would need to be diluted a varied initial nh4 n concentration did not affect the nh4 n concentration in the testing fertilizers the conductivity of both anolyte and catholyte were stable in this period fig s2a and b likewise the anolyte ph was also stable fig s2c but the final ph of the catholyte varied from 6 to 8 fig s2d influenced by the addition of acids 3 2 characterization of the prepared fertilizer the key components of the house fertilizer are shown in table s3 s4 used as a reference to prepare three different testing fertilizers to investigate the effects of major nutrient elements e g nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and trace elements it should be noted that nitrogen existed in both ammonium and nitrate in the house fertilizer group a while only ammonia nitrogen was present in the other groups however the total nitrogen concentrations were similar among all groups our preliminary experiment found that there was no significant difference in the growth of a thaliana between the fertilizer containing ammonia nitrogen only and a mixture of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen fig s3 likely due to the conversion of some ammonia to nitrate via nitrification by ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria that were present in the soil the catholyte of the mes contained 44 0 1 8 mg l 1 of potassium and a few other elements but had no phosphorus fig s4 because cem allows only cations such as nh4 to migrate from the anolyte to the catholyte and would reject po4 3 ions six trace elements were analyzed in the catholyte according to the receipt of the house fertilizer listed in table s2 three trace elements had very low concentrations molybdenum 1 1 0 2 μg l 1 boron 30 μg l 1 and copper 30 μg l 1 the other three trace elements had relatively higher concentrations though still lower than the target concentrations listed in table s4 based on the element concentrations in the catholyte and house fertilizer two more testing fertilizers were prepared the cation and anion compositions of all four fertilizers are shown in fig 3 a and 3b one can see that the sulfate concentration in the testing fertilizers group b c and d was much higher than that in the house fertilizer because sulfuric acid was used to maintain the catholyte ph under 8 to prevent the escape of recovered ammonium from the catholyte and to further adjust the fertilize ph to 6 5 7 0 3 3 application of fertilizer to support plant growth four groups of fertilizers were applied to the plants every other day as described in the method section visual observation found that group a and group d grew better than the other two groups and had fewer dead plants 6 out of 25 for group a and 0 out of 25 for group d compared to 20 dead plants out of 25 in groups b and 10 out of 25 in group c during the five week fertilizing period fig 4 the occurrence of dead plants in group a was not expected and might be related to the intense competition among the plants for nutrient and light the plants that were growing more slowly could be more disadvantageous in the later phase when the faster growing plants shaded light with their larger leaves the poor growth of a thaliana in group b was mainly due to the lack of phosphorus and potassium which are related to the health of roots and stems of plants the growth of group c plants might have been limited by the low concentrations of important trace elements the growth of plants was monitored via measuring their length and width every six days fig 5 and compared by anova table 1 because most plants in group b died during the fertilizing period they were excluded from the measurement both the length and the width were similar among these three groups at 0 day after kept at reach in chamber for two weeks without fertilization p 0 05 however the difference began to appear after different fertilizers was applied for example the leaf length showed a significant difference between group a and other groups p 0 05 after 18 days nearly all groups showed significant differences in terms of leaf length and width the anova results of wet weights and dry weights suggest that there was no significant difference between group c and d p 0 05 while they both differed significantly from group a p 0 05 we inferred that the trace elements did not have much effect on the total mass of a thaliana as potassium and phosphorus but they had some impact on the size of the plants 3 4 effect of fertilizers on expressed genes gene expression of the leaves of a thaliana in group a b and d were analyzed to investigate the effect of applied fertilizers as shown in table s5 high rates of clean reads 94 44 and q30 90 86 are obtained the distances and correlations in terms of the expressed genes in different groups are demonstrated by principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation analysis in fig s5 and s6 higher similarity between groups a and d than groups a and b was found by comparing the distances between different samples on the pca plot additionally fig s5 shows that the correlation coefficients r2 between the paired samples from group a and d were 0 823 0 853 larger than those between group a and b 0 801 0 827 the number of differentially expressed genes are listed in the co expression venn diagram fig s7a all groups shared 14 883 genes indicating over 94 of the detected genes in three groups showed no significant difference p 0 05 group a and d shared 931 similar genes that are expressed significantly differently in group b larger than the 282 uniquely existing in group a and b this can explain the stressed physiological characteristics size and weight when group b are compared with other groups according to the cluster analysis results based on the fpkm results from rna sequencing group d has larger similarity to group a compared with group b fig s7b although the above results acquired from differential expressed genes degs indicate that the extra nutrients added to the catholyte played an important role to support the growth of a thaliana the nitrogen ammonia recovered from digester centrate was a potential nitrogen source because less than 6 genes were expressed differently in group a that was fed with house fertilizer furthermore we examined individual genes to reveal plant physiological responses based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes database the top 20 genes that were mostly up or down regulated between each group are listed in table s6 log2 fold changes are in the ranges from 7 to 11 there are several interesting findings first when comparing differentially expressed genes between groups a and d against group b genes related to phosphate starvation were shown to be upregulated in group b indicating that phosphate supplementation in the commercial fertilizer and the recovered nitrogen fertilizer from group d is essential for healthy plant growth second udp glycosyltransferase ugt 76f2 was upregulated in groups a and d when compared to group b ugt is responsible for many critical biological functions like detoxification cuticle formation and olfaction zhou et al 2019 this gene is not upregulated when only nh4 is present indicating impaired cell function in the absence of additional nutrients third genes related to late embryogenesis abundant lea proteins related to plants environmental stress response such as water stress tolerance were downregulated in groups a and d when compared to group b goyal et al 2005 hundertmark and hincha 2008 moreover an lea protein gene was significantly downregulated in group d when compared to group a log2 fold change of 7 490 these observations indicates that group d fertilizer may allow plants to better mitigate environmental stresses fourth two genes related to auxin response were found to be downregulated in group d compared to group a auxin is a phytohormone that is often included in commercial fertilizers rocha et al 2020 which influences plant growth and development finally these individual genes with mostly drastic changes in expressions were not related to central metabolism therefore we further examined the genes in central carbon pathways table s7 the highest similarity was seen again between groups a and d log2 fold changes were well below one unit expression of genes related to central carbon metabolism glycolysis tca cycle and pentose phosphate pathway are most similar between groups a and d further suggesting the recovered fertilizer with nutrient supplements had similar effect on plant central pathways to the commercial fertilizer additional analysis has been performed to examine photosynthesis energy and nitrogen metabolisms with gene ontology go when group b was compared with group a with go enrichment 4500 4293 and 4141 degs were found in biological process cellular component and molecular functions respectively among all the 3652 go terms 224 terms showed significant enrichment and the first 20 terms were listed in fig 6 a biological process and cellular component related to photosynthesis showed the largest difference for example thylakoid is the site for the light dependent photosynthesis process and four thylakoid terms enriched significantly with more than 200 degs in each term additionally photosynthesis and photosystem terms also showed significant enrichment indicating the photosynthetic processes were affected if phosphorus potassium and other trace elements were missing when group d was compared with group a with go enrichment only 2083 1994 and 1874 degs were identified in the three categories 214 out of 3323 go terms were found to change significantly however when the corresponding terms were selected terms of photosystem go 0 009 521 plastoglobule go 0 010 287 photosynthetic electron transport chain go 0 009 767 and photosystem ⅱ go 0 009 523 were not significantly different p 0 05 from those in group a fig 6b indicating that a thaliana in group d had more similar photosynthetic performance to group a than those in group b when kegg enrichment analysis was performed between group b and group a 1228 degs were found in 115 pathways and 13 pathways including photosynthesis ath00195 oxidative phosphorylation ath00190 nitrogen metabolism ath00910 etc were significantly different between group b and group a fig 7 a on the other hand when group d was compared with group a only 596 degs were found in 108 different pathways in a thaliana in addition the number of significantly different pathways decreased to 7 although the other two pathways 2 oxocarboxylic acid metabolism ath01210 and valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis ath00290 were not listed in fig 7b considering the small number of pathways 7 out of hundreds of pathways in a thaliana listed in kegg database were affected significantly between group d and group a we infer that our test fertilizers with nitrogen recovered directly from actual digester centrate are appropriate to support the growth of a thaliana 4 conclusions this study has demonstrated a complete process of nitrogen recovery from real digester centrate and reuse as a part of fertilizer for plant growth the results can be inspiring to achieve economic and sustainable nutrient recovery from wastewater with the following main conclusions 1 when the digester centrate was mixed with food wastewater ata volume ratio of 3 1 the mes achieved the best performance with an average current of 4 8 ma and over 60 nitrogen recovery efficiency the transport efficiency of ammonium ions was 57 and the energy consumption was estimated to be 2 7 kwh kg 1 n 2 after three prepared testing fertilizers being applied to a thaliana group d showed the best growth results with the largest final size and weight close to group a watered with house fertilizer as a control group d had the least dead plant after five weeks compared with 6 20 and 10 out of 25 for group a b and c respectively 3 plant rna sequencing analysis showed that a thaliana grown on fully supplemented fertilizer had the highest similarity of differentially expressed genes compared to the commercial fertilizer with the fewest genes related to central cellular metabolic processes 4 the potential application of the fertilizer recovered from wastewater warrants further investigation of a detailed analysis of the health impact caused by heavy metals e g cr and cd examination of other representative plants and exploration of low cost sources of supplementary nutrient elements to amend the prepared fertilizer

current clarification basin design guidance imposes significant costs to stakeholders the total cost of a single clarification basin ranges from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions united states dollar usd li and sansalone 2022a south carolina sea grant consortium 2019 as shown in fig s1 see online supplemental materials a critical factor that escalates basin cost is the current adoption of presumptive basin performance based on residence time rt or hydraulic residence time hrt or surface overflow rate sor models li and sansalone 2022a spelman and sansalone 2021 to provide a model alternative a more robust algebraic model for basin clarification has recently been proposed based on symbolic regression sr and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations li and sansalone 2022a however this model did not address 1 basin geometrics e g horizontal aspect ratio baffle geometry or 2 geometric optimization for basin planning or retrofit a frequent impetus for geometric optimization or retrofits is where basin expansion is not spatially viable or economical due to infrastructure constraints rt and sor models are inadequate to provide robust guidance for clarification basin performance nor do these models accurately reproduce the physical scaling behavior for clarification basin and similar systems e g primary and secondary clarifiers hydrodynamic separators li and sansalone 2022b as a result the cost effectiveness of basins is compromised specifically the total cost of clarification systems scales non linearly and exponentially with system performance measured as total pm separation δ as defined in section 2 this exponential scaling behavior of a clarification system is suggested by li and sansalone 2022a spelman and sansalone 2021 stamou et al 1989 howard et al 2012 such exponential scaling behavior of a clarification system has major implications for the geometrics and retrofit of urban water basins improving basin pm clarification and pm partitioned contaminants by simply enlarging system dimension is not an economical and sustainable approach irrespective of conflicts with proximate land infrastructure and lost opportunity costs resulting from basin expansion a potential solution to overcome the current cost barrier of basin design geometrics e g a common and generalizable plain polygon basin shape is to enhance system performance through beneficial manipulation of intra basin dynamics such intra basin geometric retrofits can be implemented by internal structures such as baffles as compared to expanding the bulk dimensions increased basin surface area and volume studies demonstrate that through configuring internal baffles basin transport dynamics can be manipulated and trained to generate conditions for enhancing pm and pm associated contaminant separation ahmed et al 1996 asgharzadeh et al 2011 garofalo and sansalone 2018 goula et al 2008 howard et al 2011 jamshidnia and firoozabadi 2010 li et al 2021a despite the potential benefits configuring baffled clarification systems is challenging li et al 2021a b li and sansalone 2021a elucidate the nonlinearity in the iterations between turbulence structure and pm fate in response to internal baffle placement as a result the solution to baffle configuration within a basin is not trivial there is not a singular set of baffle geometrics that guarantees enhanced pm clarification compared to an unbaffled basin of the same shape surface area and volume li and sansalone 2021b demonstrates that a conventional baffling approach e g array of parallel baffles may yield neither the optimal system clarification performance nor the optimal design cost benefit especially for basin with a high horizontal aspect ratio i e a long linear basin in addition there is not a singular and or universal baffle configuration that can be implemented across disparate basin geometrics and loadings optimal baffle configurations for pm separation are dependent on basin geometrics and loadings li et al 2021a a baffle configuration that improves system clarification for one set of basin geometry and loading conditions does not ensure the same level of clarification enhancement for another system geometry and loadings in some cases adverse effects of baffling are observed imam et al 1983 li et al 2021a li and sansalone 2022b li et al 2021c liu et al 2010 currently no tool exists to robustly and efficiently plan optimize and or retrofit basin infrastructure for urban water management common tools e g rt based empirical models surface overflow rate sor

optimization evaluations with an intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor of 16 cores there is a pressing need for a tool to provide cost effective basin geometrics including intra basin baffles or retrofit

further information on evolutionary optimization and rt based methods are provided in the online supplemental materials 2 1 basin design as a non linear constrained optimization problem fig 1 illustrates the geometric configuration of a generic baffled polygon clarification basin the polygon basin shape is the most prevalent and generalizable basin geometry as shown in fig s2 and therefore is considered herein li and sansalone 2021b 2022a this study primarily focuses on designing the basin permanent pool geometries to achieve the existing presumptive regulation criteria of 80 pm separation beckingham et al 2019 california stormwater quality association 2003 clar et al 2004 florida administration code 2005 united states environmental protection agency 2009 vijay and barbara 2019 the basin design can be mathematically conceptualized as a non linear constrained optimization problem given the hydrologic conditions of the watershed draining to the basin and the constituent loading characteristics x l o a d the objective of basin design is to find a set of design parameters such as the bulk geometry x b u l k and baffle configuration x b a f f l e that yields the minimal total basin cost j while providing sufficient treatment performance measured as total pm separation δ and meeting the regulation criteria e g 80 this non linear constrained optimization problem is defined in eq 1 1 min x b u l k x b a f f l e j x b u l k x b a f f l e subject to δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d regulation criteria in this equation x b u l k l x l y h l i l o is the design parameter vector of the basin permanent pool bulk geometry where l x l y and h are length width and depth of the permanent pool volume l i and l o are the horizontal distance of the inlet and outlet center line to the origin x b a f f l e n b l b α is the design parameter vector n b is number of baffles l b is the baffle length and α is baffle angle and uniform baffle spacing l x b l x n b 1 is considered x l o a d q ν ρ f ρ p m is the basin loading vector where q is mean wet season flowrate ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ f and ρ p are the density of the fluid and pm m is the pm particle size distribution psd j is the total cost function δ is the basin total pm separation as defined in eqs 2 and 3 in this study pm separation refers to δ j unless total pm separation δ is specified 2 δ j c j i c j e c j i 3 δ j m j δ j in this equation c j i and c j e are the influent and effluent concentration of the j particle i e j th discretized particle size or size range m j is the mass fraction of the j particle of a heterodisperse psd in this study three heterodisperse psd that are commonly observed in rainfall runoff are examined kim and sansalone 2008 sansalone et al 1998 as summarized in table 1 in this optimization problem the hydrologic conditions of a watershed draining to the basin and the constituent loading characteristics x l o a d are input parameters which are defined by the user based on a watershed data and existing runoff chemistry databases or presumptive runoff chemistry the basin total cost function j can be developed and defined as a closed form expression based on the unit land construction and maintenance costs see section 2 3 the challenge of this optimization process is the evaluation of the basin total pm separation as a function of basin design parameters δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d evaluating the basin total pm separation as a function of basin design parameters requires resolving the dynamics of the turbulent transport and pm fate that are modified by the basin geometry and baffle configurations the existing presumptive and lumped model e g rt based empirical model sor swmm are agnostic to all of these parameters and therefore cannot be applied currently the viable approach is using transport resolving simulation techniques of cfd li and sansalone 2021b however cfd requires higher computational resources with the wall time of a single cfd basin simulation ranging from 2 to 12 h as illustrated by eq 1 the basin design optimization is carried out by iteratively evaluating δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d if cfd is directly invoked as the evaluation engine a complete basin design optimization cycle e g 2000 design evaluations can take 0 46 to 2 7 year wall time with an intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor of 16 cores although such a high computation expense can be accelerated and facilitated with modern high performance computing hpc this is computationally expensive for routine engineering practice in civil and environmental engineering cee to circumvent this issue in the following section a data driven ml framework is developed as a more computationally efficient surrogate of cfd for basin performance inference and design optimization 2 2 data driven ml framework for clarification basin performance inference and design optimization fig 2 illustrates the flowchart for developing and applying a data driven ml model framework for basin performance inference and optimization this framework is comprised of three 3 stages 1 basin performance database generation with cfd fig 2a 2 ml model formulation and training with pytorch fig 2b 3 integration of developed ml model with an optimization library of dakota fig 2c the methodology of each stage is detailed in the following subsections 2 2 1 stage 1 baffled basin performance database generation with cfd robust ml model development requires a large and diverse database brunton and kutz 2019 in this study a validated cfd model for basin simulation was used to generate a large database for ml model development the formulation and validation of the cfd model is described elsewhere li and sansalone 2021b 2022a li et al 2021c and in the online supplemental materials briefly given a set of inputs x x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d the cfd model solves the depth averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and a set of pm transport equations simultaneously for n p 10 discretized pm diameters with psd settling velocity ranging from 9 0 10 4 mm s to 1 6 10 2 mm s as illustrated in fig 2 this range of pm settling velocity is equivalent to a pm diameter range of 1 μ m to 1000 μ m for the siliceous pm density of 2650 kg m 3 or 4 06 μ m to 7 9 mm for organic pm density of 1100 kg m 3 the cfd model employed the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm versteeg and malalasekera 2007 and was implemented with a finite volume method fvm library openfoam weller et al 1998 the cfd model computed the basin pm separation δ j for each pm diameter based on eq 2 based on which basin total pm separation δ was calculated by eq 3 to illustrate the results through the methodology shown in fig 2 six 6 families of basin designs with 0 i e plain basin design without baffles 1 3 5 7 and 9 baffles were examined over a wide range of design configurations and basin loading conditions latin hypercube sampling lhs was used to select the basin design configurations x in the design parameter space for cfd simulations table 2 summarizes the parameter range of the basin bulk geometry baffle configuration and loading condition in lhs sampling these parameter ranges were selected based on the common bulk basin geometric configurations x b u l k and baffle geometric configurations x b a f f

designs of paired datasets x y were generated from the cfd simulations the generation of the entire database takes approximately 26 days with 1500 3000 cores on the hpc at university of florida available hpc cores vary with time and computational load university of florida 2022 the data sparsity ratio n s a m p l e 1 n d i m n s a m p l e is number of samples n d i m is the dimension of input matrix x is estimated to be 3 22 which is comparable to the data sparsity ratio of 1 217 2 825 in recent studies using ml for aircraft wing shape design li et al 2018 li and zhang 2021a the data sparsity ratio is not commonly reported in recent ml literature for water systems 2 2 2 stage 2 ml model formulation and training data driven modeling of basin clarification performance resembles the classic ml problem of supervised learning brunton and kutz 2019 french et al 1992 a wide range of supervised ml models exists chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 such as decision tree dt random forest rf support vector machine svm k nearest neighbors knn and artificial neural network ann in this study ann was used because of model flexibility demonstrated performance and benefit of direct feature gradient evaluation through the automatic differentiation ad see section 2 2 3 garcía alba et al 2019 li and sansalone 2022a recknagel et al 1997 other models such as dt and rf can also be used see table s1 in online supplemental materials however the gradients need to be additionally approximated with numerical methods e g central difference in supervised ml given a number of paired data x y ml models are trained to learn the non linear relationship that maps from inputs x to outputs y as a natural ml model formulation basin design parameters i e basin geometric features loading conditions can be selected as ml model inputs x and the ml model output y can be the basin total pm separation δ as illustrated by eq 4 or other basin performance parameters e g effluent suspended sediment concentration ssc total suspended solids tss while based on such a formulation ml models can be developed common in recent ml literature for water systems this ml model formulation is not data efficient nor physically robust specifically the influence of the psd m or m j to total pm separation as illustrated by eq 3 is not explicitly considered by the ml model but assumed as a potential learnable component which the ml model does not guarantee to capture if ever in addition buckingham π theorem and dimensional analysis sonin 2001 of basin turbulent transport and pm fate show that the basin total pm separation is intrinsically a function of nondimensional similarity groups e g hazen number reynolds number etc instead of the dimensional quantities e g x in eq 4 li et al 2021a li and sansalone 2022a 2022b the ml model formulation of eq 4 however does not preserve the dynamic similarity underlying the basin pm fate and may hinder efforts to generalize the ml model 4 x x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d and y δ to directly enforce the influence of a psd eq 3 and the dynamic similarity for the fate of pm in a basin an alternative ml model formulation was developed fig 2e illustrates the model formulation and ann structure the ann model has the following execution sequences 1 the psd of the pm load m in x l o a d was discretized into n p 10 particle diameters d p dickenson and sansalone 2012 as shown in fig 2f fig s5 illustrates that 10 ten discretized pm diameters are sufficient to characterize the pm separation in the basin 2 with the current d p highlighted with red circle in fig 2f all dimensional basin design parameters x in the input layer were transformed into nondimensional similarity groups which are denoted as transformed input x the transformations and expressions of nondimensional similarity groups follows ar h l x l y ar v l m h l m l x l y ϕ i l i l y ϕ o l o l y ϕ b l b l y slr q a a l x l y r e slr l m ν h a w s slr where w s is the particle quiescent settling velocity calculated based on the stokes drag law with the schiller naumann finite reynolds number drag correction model balachandar and eaton 2010 schiller and naumann 1935 3 the transformed input x was then scaled by the standard deviation i e classic feature scaling in ml and fed to a classic fully connected neural network fcnn with m hidden layers and n hidden neurons the fcnn outputs the pm separation δ j for the current particle diameters highlighted by red circle as shown in fig 2g the forward mapping operation also known as forward propagation from the first to the second hidden layer in the ann is defined in eq 5 the forward mapping operation from other layers to their subsequent layers follows the same mapping rule the forward mapping in ann is automatically handled by a python based imperative high performance deep learning library pytorch paszke et al 2019 5 g w 1 0 2 w 1 1 2 w 1 2 2 w 1 η 1 2 w 1 η 2 w 2 0 2 w 2 1 2 w 2 2 2 w 2 η 1

notation is a n by η 1 weights matrix note that w n 0 2 accounts for biases η and n are the index of the hidden neurons of the first ann layer σ η 1 and the second ann layer σ n 2 g is the activation function 4 the ann model looped over each discretized particle diameter d p repeated the above steps and predicted the pm separation of each discretized particle diameter δ j in the psd with the basin psd m j and ann predicted pm separation of each discretized particle diameter δ j the basin total integrated across all particle diameters pm separation δ can be calculated based on eq 3 based on the cfd generated database from stage 1 training validation and test of the above ann model were carried out by the following steps 1 the cfd generated database 1 2 10 5 was randomly divided into 9 6 10 4 training 1 2 10 4 validation and 1 2 10 4 test dataset with a splitting ratio of 8 1 1 ng 2018 the bivariate relationships and histogram of data pairs in training validation and test dataset are illustrated by the scatter plot matrices in figs s6 s8 2 based on the training dataset the ann model parameters i e weights w were learned by minimizing the ann model output with respect to cfd simulations as illustrated by eqs 6 and 7 the ann model training was performed with pytorch a two stage ann training strategy was applied the ann model was first trained with an adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 for 1 10 5 iterations and then refined with a limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno lbfgs algorithm fletcher 2000 for another 8 10 4 iterations directly applying lbfgs quasi newton method to ann training at the initial stage can often encounter numerical difficulties such as inaccurate approximation of hessian resulting in diminished learning progress therefore a two stage ann training strategy was implemented a first order method adam optimizer is more robust at the initial stage of ann training xu and darve 2020 2021 and therefore was applied as a precursor optimizer before lbfgs additionally double precision float64 was used to prevent early stops in the lbfgs optimizer the wall clock time of training an ann with 28 hidden neurons and 7 hidden layers was approximately 2 5 h on a single intel xeon cpu e5 2630 v3 processor with 8 cores in the ann model the hyperbolic tangent tanh was applied as the activation function the standard logistic function was used in the output layer li and sansalone 2022a demonstrated that using such a logistic function to bound the predicted pm separation can improve the model training the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons were determined by hyperparameter optimization based on the validation dataset the validation dataset was also used to control the learning process such as learning rate and learning epochs to mitigate potential model overfitting ng 2018 the hyperparameter optimization results are shown in the section ml model training and hyperparameter optimization in online supplemental

to the mse and coefficient of determination r 2 that are reported for pm separation δ j the performance of trained ann models was also examined for total pm separation δ of the three 3 psds see table 1 because i clarification basins are typically loaded by a heterodisperse psd rather than a monodisperse psd or single particle diameter spelman and sansalone 2017 and ii the total gravimetric pm separation is the evaluation metric that currently adopted by regulatory agencies for basin performance st johns river water management district 2018 2 2 3 stage 3 ml based basin cost effectiveness optimization once the ann was trained and tested in stage 2 the trained ann model was used to evaluate basin performance in the basin cost optimization in eq 1 as illustrated in fig 2c in contrast to ann model training i e back propagation forward propagation of the ann model for basin performance inference has minimal computational expenses with an execution time of milliseconds in this study an open source multilevel parallel framework for optimization dakota developed by sandia national laboratory was adopted and coupled with pytorch for basin cost optimization adams et al 2020 dakota provides a wide range of constrained optimization algorithms such as the method of feasible directions mfd pattern search and evolutionary algorithm ea compared to the derivative free method the gradient based method has higher efficiency and convergence rate however the gradient based method requires access to the gradient e g d δ d x which in many situations is either not available or difficult to estimate accurately such as with a cfd based evaluation engine in addition to computation efficiency an additional benefit provided by the ann model is that the gradient value d δ d x can be computed exactly by the method of automatic differentiation ad therefore in this study a hybrid evolutionary gradient optimization strategy was developed for basin optimization eq 1 adams et al 2020 li and zhang 2021a in which the gradient was directly computed by pytorch through the torch autograd grad function and interfaced to dakota additionally in the optimization the discrete variable of baffle numbers n b 0 1 3 5 7 9 was initially treated as a continuous variable so derivatives are available for gradient based optimization i e derivatives do not exist for discrete variable once the optimal solution was obtained by the process a local search algorithm was applied in the vicinity of a solution to ensure the discreteness of n b the above sections illustrate the complete methodology of integrating the trained ann model with dakota for basin cost optimization eq 1 except the formulation of the basin cost function j which is detailed in the next section 2 3 basin life cycle costs lcc analysis basin initial costs e g land acquisition costs construction costs and operation maintenance o m costs were assessed using lcc note that lost opportunity land use costs were not included and results in lcc analysis as a conservative estimation the basin cost category adopted by this study was based on several basin cost estimation tools and guidance heaney et al 2002 minnesota pollution control agency 2021 mott macdonald 2016 noaa office for coastal management 2015 sample et al 2003 water environment research foundation 2009 since the basin costs can vary significantly between countries and within regions of a country due to the difference in materials and labor cost burnett and mothorpe 2018 canadian nursery landscape association 2021 international stormwater bmp database 2021 taylor 2014 weiss et al 2005 this study as an example considered a typical basin cost for florida usa extension of this study to other countries and regions can be facilitated by adjusting the unit costs table 3 summarizes the unit cost by categories the land acquisition cost was estimated based on 43 engineering reports provided by the florida department of transportation fdot as shown in fig s13 the basin construction cost i e excavation grading etc were determined with state wide averaged costs in the fdot executed construction contracts during the

hyperparameter optimization see online supplemental materials was first examined for pm separation δ j eq 2 the developed ann model demonstrates high predictive capability with the coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 998 0 998 and 0 998 for training validation and test dataset as illustrated in fig s14 see online supplemental materials note that this r 2 is a conservative estimate and is computed only to evaluate 0 0 δ j 1 0 range trivial solutions such as δ j 0 0 and δ j 1 0 that corresponds to minimal pm separation in the case of smaller pm diameters e g d p 10 μm and complete pm separation in the case of larger pm diameters e g d p 500 μm were not included in this reported r 2 li and sansalone 2022a 2020 this is because including these trivial solutions although increasing the r 2 can result in biased evaluation and false confidence in the model the developed ann model also illustrates a good generalizability minimal performance degradation r 2 decrease less than 0 001 of ann model was observed from training to the test dataset which was not seen by the ann model during the model training and hyperparameter optimization since the basin never receives pm loading as a single particle diameter the ultimate ann performance of interest is total pm separation δ with a heterodisperse psd that represents the gravimetric distribution of pm diameters for the imposed basin loading fig 3 summarizes the predictive capability of the proposed ann model for total pm separation δ over three 3 common psds table 1 consistent with the good performance of ann in the pm separation based evaluation the predictive capability of the developed ann model for total pm separation is also high with the r 2 ranging from 0 986 to 0 988 the root mean square errors rmse between ann model and cfd database are 0 017 0 014 0 008 for finer medium coarser psd 3 2 visualization of basin performance and cost response to basin design features basin performance as total pm separation δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d is a high dimension function of nine 9 transformed input variables as illustrated in fig 2c functions with dimensions higher than three 3 are challenging to visualize directly therefore two dimensional 2d slices of function δ were visualized by a variable fixing approach fig 4 illustrates the normalized basin total pm separation responses to different baffle configurations i e baffle number n b normalized baffle length ϕ b and baffle angle α under various basin horizontal aspect ratios ar h to facilitate this visualization other design variables are fixed basin surface area a 1600 m 2 mean wet season flowrate q 0 1 m 3 s basin permanent pool depth h 2 m heterodisperse medium psd relative inlet location ϕ i 0 5 and relative outlet location ϕ o 0 5 fig 4 results are organized in rows each row representing the number of baffles tested columns are organized by horizontal aspect ratios the baffle length axis is inset vertically on each plot and the baffle angle axis is inset horizontally on each plot in the first row at a baffle number n b 1 there is no clear trend in the basin performance as total pm separated response to baffling different basin response patterns are observed for different basin horizontal aspect ratios in contrast basins with higher baffle numbers of n b 5 and 7 show more structured and similar response patterns the basin response contour is divided into four 4 quadrants by ϕ b 0 5 i e baffle extend to half the width of the basin and α 90 i e baffle perpendicular to the streamwise direction of flow from inlet to outlet of the basin baffle with longer lengths are observed to be more effective at improving the basin performance for all basin aspect ratios examined higher basin performance is consistently observed in the first quadrant α 90 ϕ b 0 5 which physically corresponds to baffle configurations that extend beyond half the basin width and points upstream such as the top right baffle configuration in fig 2d lower basin performance are observed in the third quadrant α 90 ϕ b 0 5 where the short baffle is configured pointing downstream these observations are consistent with and can be explained by the cfd results for example the bottom left baffle configuration in fig 2d are for a small baffling angle and short baffle lengths and results indicate that this configuration is less effective in reducing flow short circuiting and therefore not ideal for pm separation enhancement overall the basin performance generally increases as the baffle length increase and baffle angle increase although this trend can be additionally influenced by the other factors such as inlet and outlet locations as shown in fig s15 the basin horizontal aspect ratio ar h has a significant influence on the increase in basin performance provided by baffling without baffles as the basin horizontal aspect ratio increases basin performance also increases meanwhile introducing baffles to a higher horizontal aspect ratio basin configuration i e long linear results in an increase in performance that is reduced relative to a lower horizontal aspect ratio basin configuration i e square polygon these observations are consistent with previous studies of li and sansalone 2021b persson et al 1999 in which the long linear basin configuration was shown to yield favorable hydrodynamic conditions for pm separation the question is whether a higher basin aspect ratio if possible in a design phase yet not as likely in a retrofit scenario is more cost effective than the baffled basin design fig 5 shows the basin cost and performance as total pm separation response to the variation of the basin horizontal aspect ratio and baffle length in this visualization baffle number n b and baffle angle α are fixed at nine 9 and 90 other fixed design variables are identical to the previous visualization example of fig 4 fig 5a illustrates that as the basin horizontal aspect ratio increases the basin total cost increases even though the basin permanent pool surface area a is constant this is because a basin with a higher horizontal aspect ratio requires more of a maintenance berm area and therefore higher cost as indicated by eq 11 the maintenance berm area a b e r m is a monotonic increasing function for ar h 1 0 to analyze the relationship between the basin cost and basin performance the isolines of basin cost in fig 5a is plotted on top of the basin total pm separation in fig 5b fig 5b illustrates at a lower basin performance and cost regime j 0 97 million usd for the same basin cost basin with higher horizontal aspect ratio and shorter baffle length yield higher performance than basin with lower horizontal aspect ratio and longer baffle length this behavior however is reversed for the higher basin performance and cost regime j 0 97 million usd for the same basin cost baffling is a more cost effective approach to enhance basin performance than increasing the horizontal aspect ratio note that these observed response structures are a presentation of the pm separation based on basin physics learned by the ann model and are not influenced by the selection of the ann model as shown in fig s16 a different ann model 28 hidden neurons and 5 hidden layers also yield the same response structure these results delineate the complexity of basin design when basin performance and cost are considered simultaneously in particular the transition for cost effective basin design from the higher horizontal aspect ratio to the longer baffle length as the desired basin performance increases indicates there is no a singular basin configuration that would consistently yield optimal basin cost for all total pm separation range the cost effective basin configuration depends on the desired basin performance these results suggest that a well informed scientific decision and cost effective basin design requires considering all these effects and balancing the trade off between the basin performance and the costs 11 a b e r m a s i t e a 12 2 a a r h 1 a r h 148 84 3 3 comparison of cost effectiveness of basin design features to examine the effectiveness of the proposed ml based basin design method the developed ml model was applied for an existing basin and watershed hydrologic conditions loading the basin in southwest florida 26 09 06 1 n 81 46 02 2 w this site receives runoff generated by airport and commercial land use catchments through a dendritic municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 the mean wet season flowrate at this site is 0 1 m 3 s and the loading is a heterodisperse psd note that developed ml models are not limited to this specific basin and watershed loading condition and can be robustly applied to a wide range of conditions as summarized in table

event samples further details about this site location are provided at florida department of transportation 2016 fig 6 compares the cost effectiveness of proposed ml based baffled basin designs to common plain basin designs e g square and circular and also residence time rt based design guidelines currently adopted by many regulatory agencies three 3 heterodisperse psds that range from coarser to finer as shown in fig 6g are examined in fig 6a c and e in fig 6a c and e the ml designs blue cross markers are the pareto frontiers identified by the proposed ml based basin design method cfd simulations were performed to further verify these pareto frontiers with mae of 0 023 0 015 and 0 006 for the finer medium and coarser psds pareto frontiers represent the most cost effective basin designs and are therefore computed fig 7 illustrates the computation of a pareto frontier in stage 3 of the proposed framework fig 2 a random set of basin designs i e population was first initialized with population size of 50 an initial population size of 50 was sufficient for the optimization to progress although a higher population size can also be selected li and sansalone 2021b subsequently the evolutionary algorithm iteratively improved the basin performance while reducing the basin design cost by optimizing the design configuration as shown in fig 7a and b additional illustration of evolutionary algorithm is provided by eq s1 and fig s17 in the supplemental materials the resulting optimal solutions are the pareto frontier which indicates the most cost effective basin designs using the proposed ml based basin design method in fig 6a c and e the square and circular designs orange and green markers are the square and circular basin designs with different surface areas the performance of these square and circular designs are determined through cfd the rt design represent the current rt based basin design guideline adopted by the state of florida florida department of environmental protection 2020 harper and baker 2003 the expression of this rt based design guideline harper and baker 2003 is shown in eq s2 fig 6b d and f illustrates the resulting cost j associated with these different basin design methods for achieving a presumptive regulatory criteria of 80 pm separation removal the proposed ml based basin design method consistently yields lower basin cost than the other basin designs across the entire spectrum of total pm separation for each heterodisperse psd considered finer medium coarser as a function of each psd considered the resulted basin costs for achieving 80 total pm separation with the ml design is 4 7x to 8x lower than the square and circular basin designs with respect to the existing rt based design the ml model design yields a significant reduction in cost by 5 6x 27 8x and 83 5x for finer medium and coarser psd this increased cost reduction for the ml design compared to the rt design as the psd is transformed from a finer to coarser gravimetric particle diameter gradation results from rt based design methods that do not consider the influence of the psd for pm separation these results illustrates the significant benefits of applying the proposed ml based basin design approach the results also illustrate that the psd as the substrate for partitioning distribution of solutes and pathogens and as the vehicle for constituent transport fate is a critical input for a basin design or design retrofit 4 discussion 4 1 need for methodological evolution for basin design and implementation functioning as a unit operation uo basins are widely implemented to sequester particulate matter pm as well as pm bound chemicals and pathogens whether for storm waste potable water or combined sewer overflow treatment in recent decades there has been a worldwide increase in the implementation of wet detention or retention as a type of green infrastructure for urban water cycle management despite the ubiquitous implementation of basins in the built environs the practice of basin planning and design has not been advanced beyond the rt based methods since brune 1953 methods that are commonly implemented through regulatory guidance beckingham et al 2019 california stormwater quality association 2003 clar et al 2004 florida administration code 2005 florida department of environmental protection 2020 st johns river water management district 2018 united states environmental protection agency 2009 vijay and barbara 2019 there are many fundamental limitations of rt based models e g neglecting psd chemical partitioning basin geometrics hydrodynamics this study further reveals the major assumptions and constraints implicitly imposed by the rt based models and lumped models in general for basin geometrics retrofits is that system performance can only be improved by enlarging the system dimensions fig 6c conceptually illustrates an example for a basin retrofit where basin performance is impaired and requires an improvement from the existing impaired baseline of 60 to the presumptive guidance 80 target this is the common situation for most florida basins designed based on rt to meet 80 presumptive guidance there are two approaches to achieve this goal namely methods a and b method a is increasing the basin performance through enlarging the system dimensions this approach is indeed what is suggested and facilitated by the existing rt based basin design method to achieve desired basin performance increasing the basin dimension with respect to rt method a of enlarging the basin is technically simple to implement and has been widely adopted by regulatory and engineering stakeholders however this approach is not economical because enlarging the basin system dimensions results in direct increase in system cost irrespective of adjacent infrastructure conflicts and costs as illustrated by fig 6c if method a is used the basin cost increases exponentially with respect to a required level of basin performance in contrast to method a method b proposed by this study seeks to escape from the scaling characteristics that are constrained by current basin design and jump to a more cost effective basin design scaling through manipulating the basin turbulent transport and pm fate dynamics with design optimization compared to method a method b is technically more sophisticated specifically common urban water management tools such as the rt based method sor and even swmm fail to consider detailed basin configuration and cannot be applied to guide basin design optimization transport resolving simulation tools such as cfd are needed to capture the response of basin performance to the basin configuration notwithstanding the added complexity method b generates very significant economic benefit compared to method a as illustrated by fig 6c improving the basin performance to the target 80 with method b can save 7 0 million usd in comparison to method a furthermore method b has another distinct advantage for impaired basin retrofit in which spatial basin expansion is often constrained by surrounding infrastructure that has been built after the initial basin construction in such a scenario spatial basin expansion in method a is economically prohibitive if modifying or demolishing such infrastructure is even possible the application of method a is even less economical when the lost opportunity land cost is further considered in contrast method b proposed by this study can be effectively applied to impaired basin retrofits since basin performance can be improved by configuring intra basin baffles and basin spatial expansion is unnecessary applying method b with the proposed ml based tool for impaired basin retrofit is readily achieved by adjusting the optimization problem statement eq 1 as illustrated by eq 12 for an impaired basin retrofit the proposed framework optimizes design baffle configuration x b a f f l e for minimizing retrofit cost while improving and restoring basin performance with respect to the regulatory criteria 12 min x b a f f l e j x b a f f l e subject to δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d regulation criteria evolving the existing engineering practice and regulatory guidance from the rt based method to more advanced cfd ml based approaches yield significant benefits for cost effective basin design and implementation furthermore the developed ml based basin design and optimization framework eliminate the challenges of direct application of cfd based optimization in engineering practice such as complex model configuration and higher computational expense liu et al 2020 the developed ml based tool does not require user knowledge of cfd nor ml a full scale basin design optimization can be carried out with the developed ml based tool in minutes on a personal laptop as compared to days with a conventional cfd based approach on an hpc to streamline the basin design and optimization process in engineering practice and reduce the barrier of using the developed ml based tool an immediate future step of this study is to develop a user friendly web based graphic user interface gui 4 2 prevalence of exponential scaling in water treatment systems this study demonstrates that when system cost effectiveness characteristics are subject to exponential scaling increasing the system performance by simply enlarging the system dimension is not an economical approach a significantly more economical approach to system design is by manipulating the intra basin hydrodynamics through design optimization essentially training the flow although exponential scaling in this study is illustrated for pm separation in clarification systems the exponential scaling behavior is likely also present in many other unit operations and processes for water treatment for example continuous stirred tank reactors with tank in series cstr tis model is widely applied for modeling full scale water unit process treatment systems with chemical and biological reactions such as chlorination disinfection and activated sludge processes grady et al 2011 guo et al 2021 pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 the system treatment performance δ modeled by the classic cstr tis model fair et al 1968 grady et al 2011 huber et al 2006 is shown in eq 13 as function of system volume v steady state loading flowrate q first order reaction rate constant k and number of hypothetical tanks n the system treatment performance is defined based on percent removal of a constituent of interest similar to a pm separation outcome the examined range of k and n are selected based on studies for disinfection systems pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 zhang et al 2014b fig 8 shows that irrespective to the selection reaction rate constant k and number of tanks n the system cost effectiveness generally follows the exponential scaling at the system performance range 0 2 δ 0 8 this observation implies if the water treatment system can be represented by the cstr tis model as is the case for chlorination systems and activated sludge processes the cost effectiveness scaling would follow exponential scaling future research is needed to verify this observation with full scale physical modeling or numerical simulation 13 δ 1 1 k v n q n in this equation δ is system treatment performance i e percent removal v is system volume q is steady state loading flowrate k is first order reaction rate and n is number of tanks nevertheless if exponential scaling presents the cost effective system design should also focus on manipulating the system treatment dynamics such as through optimizing system design as demonstrated by this study similarly the proposed ml based system design and optimization tool can also be extended to and developed for other water treatment processes and systems with minimal effort at the availability of higher fidelity cfd databases and or hpc resources for example in the chlorination process instead of expanding the system bulk dimension better design cost effectiveness can be potentially achieved by strategically configuring baffles following the proposed ml based design optimization framework a cfd model can be developed and validated for a chlorination process the validated chlorination cfd model can be used to generate a database for ml model development by evaluating a wide range of design configurations and loading conditions the ml model can be trained validated and tested based on a cfd generated database once the ml model is developed and deployed the cost effective chlorination system design optimization can be performed within a few seconds in engineering practice this proposed ml based system design and optimization framework can also be used to optimize the turbulent mixing and aeration system configuration in the activated sludge processes to improve the system performance and reduce energy consumption the proposed framework is not limited to water treatment systems with only bulk fluid by formulating and developing robust cfd models this same proposed framework can also be applied to design and optimize water treatment systems operating under permeable media flow conditions such as filters adsorption reactors and other types of green infrastructure such as bioretention cells and bioswales 5 conclusion this study developed a machine learning ml based tool of basin design geometrics and retrofit for cost effective clarification basin implementation in urban water management this tool was developed in three stages 1 generation of a basin performance database through computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations 2 formulation of an artificial neural network ann model based on dynamic similarity and trained for basin performance inference using the cfd generated database 3 leveraging the automatic differentiation ad of ann to develop an ann model that was integrated with the optimization library dakota for basin design optimization based on the developed ann model the basin performance and cost responses to various design configuration features were illustrated the potential of using internal baffles to augment basin design cost effectiveness without the need of basin expansion was investigated the efficacy of a developed ml based basin design and optimization tool was examined for a basin and watershed hydrologic condition in southwest florida with an existing monitoring database the basin design generated by the developed ml model was compared with common basin designs and existing design criteria rt based presumptive guidance the results of this study yield the following conclusions ml models such as ann are effective surrogate models for basin performance examination as a function of geometric features and loadings based on the generated database of the higher fidelity cfd model that can be verified and interpreted physically the trained ann model yield high predictive capability for pm separation eq 2 the coefficient of determination r 2 of ann model on training validation and test dataset are 0 998 0 998 and 0 998 fig s14 in supplemental materials moreover the developed ann model based on dynamic similarity illustrates high generalizability with minimal performance degradation from the training dataset to the test dataset r 2 decreases less than 0 001 the developed ann model also demonstrates good performance based on total pm separation eq 3 with the r 2 of 0 988 0 986 and 0 986 for finer medium and coarser psds fig 3 basin performance and cost illustrate complex response structures to basin geometric features a longer baffle length with a higher baffling angle i e pointing upstream as illustrated in fig 1 is more effective for enhancing basin performance however this basin performance response pattern is complicated by the basin horizontal aspect ratio as a higher basin horizontal aspect ratio can also increase basin pm separation the multi objective analysis illustrates that when the cost and basin performance are considered simultaneously there exists a unique transitional behavior between higher horizontal aspect ratio basin and longer baffle length fig 5 a basin with a higher horizontal aspect ratio at lower target basin performance is a more cost effective design in contrast at higher targeted performance level a basin with longer baffles is a more cost effective design the developed ml based design and optimization framework demonstrates significant economic benefits for design geometrics whether for basin planning or basin retrofits in the application to a basin and watershed hydrologic loading in southwest florida ml designs consistently dominate i e more cost effective the common basin external geometries i e square and circular basin and existing residence time rt or hydraulic residence time hrt based guidance irrespective of psd for achieving presumptive regulatory criteria of 80 pm removal i e pm separation the ml design yields 4 7x to 8x lower cost than the common basin geometries compared to the existing rt based guidance the ml design show 5 6x to 83 5x cost reduction as a function of the psd the developed ml based design and retrofit framework represents a promising tool for augmenting cost effective basin engineering and implementation in urban water management apart from demonstrating significant cost reduction capability the proposed ml based framework completely eliminates two 2 major obstacles associated with the direct application of advanced simulation tools such as cfd for current civil and environmental engineering practice identified by american society of civil engineers asce complex advanced model configuration and high computational expense the developed ml based framework requires the user s knowledge and skill in neither cfd nor ml furthermore because the forward propagation with the ann model requires minimal computational resources milliseconds a full scale basin design optimization with the developed ml based framework can be performed in minutes on a personal laptop a major constraint implicitly imposed by the existing rt based guideline or any empirical and or lumped model for cost effective system design is that the system performance can only be improved by enlarging the system dimensions this study demonstrates that when system cost effectiveness characteristics are subject to exponential scaling increasing the system performance by simply enlarging the system dimensions results in a significant increase in system cost if lost opportunity land costs and infrastructure adjacency costs are considered the cost of basin expansion is even more prohibitive instead the cost effective system design should focus on manipulating the system treatment dynamics through optimization of basin geometric features such as with retrofit baffles in addition to basin systems illustrated in this study the wide application of continuous stirred reactors with tank in series cstr tis model also indicates many other water treatment processes and systems are potentially subject to exponential cost benefit scaling future research is needed to verify this observation notwithstanding the developed ml based framework in this study can also be extended and adapted to other unit operation and process systems declaration of competing

15859,clarification basins are ubiquitous water treatment units applied across urban water systems diverse applications include stormwater systems stabilization lagoons equalization storage and green infrastructure residence time rt surface overflow rate sor and the storm water management model swmm are readily implemented but are not formulated to optimize basin geometrics because transport dynamics remain unresolved as a result basin design yields high costs from hundreds of thousands to tens of million usd basin optimization and retrofits can benefit from more robust and efficient

current clarification basin design guidance imposes significant costs to stakeholders the total cost of a single clarification basin ranges from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions united states dollar usd li and sansalone 2022a south carolina sea grant consortium 2019 as shown in fig s1 see online supplemental materials a critical factor that escalates basin cost is the current adoption of presumptive basin performance based on residence time rt or hydraulic residence time hrt or surface overflow rate sor models li and sansalone 2022a spelman and sansalone 2021 to provide a model alternative a more robust algebraic model for basin clarification has recently been proposed based on symbolic regression sr and computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations li and sansalone 2022a however this model did not address 1 basin geometrics e g horizontal aspect ratio baffle geometry or 2 geometric optimization for basin planning or retrofit a frequent impetus for geometric optimization or retrofits is where basin expansion is not spatially viable or economical due to infrastructure constraints rt and sor models are inadequate to provide robust guidance for clarification basin performance nor do these models accurately reproduce the physical scaling behavior for clarification basin and similar systems e g primary and secondary clarifiers hydrodynamic separators li and sansalone 2022b as a result the cost effectiveness of basins is compromised specifically the total cost of clarification systems scales non linearly and exponentially with system performance measured as total pm separation δ as defined in section 2 this exponential scaling behavior of a clarification system is suggested by li and sansalone 2022a spelman and sansalone 2021 stamou et al 1989 howard et al 2012 such exponential scaling behavior of a clarification system has major implications for the geometrics and retrofit of urban water basins improving basin pm clarification and pm partitioned contaminants by simply enlarging system dimension is not an economical and sustainable approach irrespective of conflicts with proximate land infrastructure and lost opportunity costs resulting from basin expansion a potential solution to overcome the current cost barrier of basin design geometrics e g a common and generalizable plain polygon basin shape is to enhance system performance through beneficial manipulation of intra basin dynamics such intra basin geometric retrofits can be implemented by internal structures such as baffles as compared to expanding the bulk dimensions increased basin surface area and volume studies demonstrate that through configuring internal baffles basin transport dynamics can be manipulated and trained to generate conditions for enhancing pm and pm associated contaminant separation ahmed et al 1996 asgharzadeh et al 2011 garofalo and sansalone 2018 goula et al 2008 howard et al 2011 jamshidnia and firoozabadi 2010 li et al 2021a despite the potential benefits configuring baffled clarification systems is challenging li et al 2021a b li and sansalone 2021a elucidate the nonlinearity in the iterations between turbulence structure and pm fate in response to internal baffle placement as a result the solution to baffle configuration within a basin is not trivial there is not a singular set of baffle geometrics that guarantees enhanced pm clarification compared to an unbaffled basin of the same shape surface area and volume li and sansalone 2021b demonstrates that a conventional baffling approach e g array of parallel baffles may yield neither the optimal system clarification performance nor the optimal design cost benefit especially for basin with a high horizontal aspect ratio i e a long linear basin in addition there is not a singular and or universal baffle configuration that can be implemented across disparate basin geometrics and loadings optimal baffle configurations for pm separation are dependent on basin geometrics and loadings li et al 2021a a baffle configuration that improves system clarification for one set of basin geometry and loading conditions does not ensure the same level of clarification enhancement for another system geometry and loadings in some cases adverse effects of baffling are observed imam et al 1983 li et al 2021a li and sansalone 2022b li et al 2021c liu et al 2010 currently no tool exists to robustly and efficiently plan optimize and or retrofit basin infrastructure for urban water management common tools e g rt based empirical models surface overflow rate sor models lumped dynamic models such as storm water management model swmm are easy to use but are inadequate to guide basin optimization because basin transport dynamics are unresolved with these tools more advanced cfd based design methods e g cfd models coupled with optimization algorithm li and sansalone 2021b while demonstrating significant benefits in scientific research are complex and computationally expensive for routine engineering application liu et al 2020 e g an estimated wall time the actual time taken to execute the computation of 0 46 to 2 7 years for 2000 design optimization evaluations with an intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor of 16 cores there is a pressing need for a tool to provide cost effective basin geometrics including intra basin baffles or retrofit implementation as green infrastructure and accelerate the translation of research outcomes to engineering practice to address this need this study presents an efficient and robust basin geometrics optimization and retrofit framework and tool with machine learning ml based on a deep learning library pytorch paszke et al 2019 and an optimization library of dakota adams et al 2020 ml offers a wealth of solutions to extract information and patterns from data that can be translated into knowledge and inform the engineering design of basin infrastructure ml has been increasingly applied to the water science field such as water chemistry load prediction chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 li et al 2022 thompson and dickenson 2021 and real time flooding control bartos and kerkez 2021 bartos et al 2019 mullapudi et al 2020 ml can also be used to develop surrogate models for higher fidelity models compared to higher fidelity models ml models once trained are more computationally efficient trained ml models can serve as robust stands in for applications where a large number of iterations computations are needed such as parameter space exploration and design optimization adams et al 2020 ml based surrogate modeling approach recently has been applied to urban hydrology bermúdez et al 2018 yang et al 2020 zahura et al 2020 aircraft wing design li and zhang 2021a 2021b hydro power turbine design masood et al 2021 and fusion plasma simulation dong et al 2021 building on this previous research this study develops and extends the ml based surrogate modeling approach to basin infrastructure design and optimization the specific objectives tasks and methodology of this study are 1 creating a diverse and robust database for ml model training with cfd simulations of pm separation in baffled basins over a wide range of basin geometries e g length width depth etc loading conditions and baffle configurations e g length spacing angle 2 training and assessing the predictive capability of developed ml model for basin pm separation inference 3 developing a framework for robust and efficient basin optimization by leveraging and coupling the automatic differentiation ad in pytorch with a optimization library of dakota and 4 examining the effectiveness of proposed basin geometric planning and optimization method with respect to the existing guidance and common basin configurations 2 materials and methods as an outline of materials and methods section 2 1 provides background information mathematical conceptualization and generalization of basin design as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem section 2 2 and 2 3 illustrate the methodology that solves this constrained optimization problem specifically section 2 2 presents the detailed development of the ml model as an efficient basin design performance evaluation engine section 2 3 formulates a basin cost model based on life cycle costs lcc analysis further modeling information and further information on evolutionary optimization and rt based methods are provided in the online supplemental materials 2 1 basin design as a non linear constrained optimization problem fig 1 illustrates the geometric configuration of a generic baffled polygon clarification basin the polygon basin shape is the most prevalent and generalizable basin geometry as shown in fig s2 and therefore is considered herein li and sansalone 2021b 2022a this study primarily focuses on designing the basin permanent pool geometries to achieve the existing presumptive regulation criteria of 80 pm separation beckingham et al 2019 california stormwater quality association 2003 clar et al 2004 florida administration code 2005 united states environmental protection agency 2009 vijay and barbara 2019 the basin design can be mathematically conceptualized as a non linear constrained optimization problem given the hydrologic conditions of the watershed draining to the basin and the constituent loading characteristics x l o a d the objective of basin design is to find a set of design parameters such as the bulk geometry x b u l k and baffle configuration x b a f f l e that yields the minimal total basin cost j while providing sufficient treatment performance measured as total pm separation δ and meeting the regulation criteria e g 80 this non linear constrained optimization problem is defined in eq 1 1 min x b u l k x b a f f l e j x b u l k x b a f f l e subject to δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d regulation criteria in this equation x b u l k l x l y h l i l o is the design parameter vector of the basin permanent pool bulk geometry where l x l y and h are length width and depth of the permanent pool volume l i and l o are the horizontal distance of the inlet and outlet center line to the origin x b a f f l e n b l b α is the design parameter vector n b is number of baffles l b is the baffle length and α is baffle angle and uniform baffle spacing l x b l x n b 1 is considered x l o a d q ν ρ f ρ p m is the basin loading vector where q is mean wet season flowrate ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid ρ f and ρ p are the density of the fluid and pm m is the pm particle size distribution psd j is the total cost function δ is the basin total pm separation as defined in eqs 2 and 3 in this study pm separation refers to δ j unless total pm separation δ is specified 2 δ j c j i c j e c j i 3 δ j m j δ j in this equation c j i and c j e are the influent and effluent concentration of the j particle i e j th discretized particle size or size range m j is the mass fraction of the j particle of a heterodisperse psd in this study three heterodisperse psd that are commonly observed in rainfall runoff are examined kim and sansalone 2008 sansalone et al 1998 as summarized in table 1 in this optimization problem the hydrologic conditions of a watershed draining to the basin and the constituent loading characteristics x l o a d are input parameters which are defined by the user based on a watershed data and existing runoff chemistry databases or presumptive runoff chemistry the basin total cost function j can be developed and defined as a closed form expression based on the unit land construction and maintenance costs see section 2 3 the challenge of this optimization process is the evaluation of the basin total pm separation as a function of basin design parameters δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d evaluating the basin total pm separation as a function of basin design parameters requires resolving the dynamics of the turbulent transport and pm fate that are modified by the basin geometry and baffle configurations the existing presumptive and lumped model e g rt based empirical model sor swmm are agnostic to all of these parameters and therefore cannot be applied currently the viable approach is using transport resolving simulation techniques of cfd li and sansalone 2021b however cfd requires higher computational resources with the wall time of a single cfd basin simulation ranging from 2 to 12 h as illustrated by eq 1 the basin design optimization is carried out by iteratively evaluating δ x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d if cfd is directly invoked as the evaluation engine a complete basin design optimization cycle e g 2000 design evaluations can take 0 46 to 2 7 year wall time with an intel xeon e5 2698 v3 processor of 16 cores although such a high computation expense can be accelerated and facilitated with modern high performance computing hpc this is computationally expensive for routine engineering practice in civil and environmental engineering cee to circumvent this issue in the following section a data driven ml framework is developed as a more computationally efficient surrogate of cfd for basin performance inference and design optimization 2 2 data driven ml framework for clarification basin performance inference and design optimization fig 2 illustrates the flowchart for developing and applying a data driven ml model framework for basin performance inference and optimization this framework is comprised of three 3 stages 1 basin performance database generation with cfd fig 2a 2 ml model formulation and training with pytorch fig 2b 3 integration of developed ml model with an optimization library of dakota fig 2c the methodology of each stage is detailed in the following subsections 2 2 1 stage 1 baffled basin performance database generation with cfd robust ml model development requires a large and diverse database brunton and kutz 2019 in this study a validated cfd model for basin simulation was used to generate a large database for ml model development the formulation and validation of the cfd model is described elsewhere li and sansalone 2021b 2022a li et al 2021c and in the online supplemental materials briefly given a set of inputs x x b u l k x b a f f l e x l o a d the cfd model solves the depth averaged reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and a set of pm transport equations simultaneously for n p 10 discretized pm diameters with psd settling velocity ranging from 9 0 10 4 mm s to 1 6 10 2 mm s as illustrated in fig 2 this range of pm settling velocity is equivalent to a pm diameter range of 1 μ m to 1000 μ m for the siliceous pm density of 2650 kg m 3 or 4 06 μ m to 7 9 mm for organic pm density of 1100 kg m 3 the cfd model employed the pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm versteeg and malalasekera 2007 and was implemented with a finite volume method fvm library openfoam weller et al 1998 the cfd model computed the basin pm separation δ j for each pm diameter based on eq 2 based on which basin total pm separation δ was calculated by eq 3 to illustrate the results through the methodology shown in fig 2 six 6 families of basin designs with 0 i e plain basin design without baffles 1 3 5 7 and 9 baffles were examined over a wide range of design configurations and basin loading conditions latin hypercube sampling lhs was used to select the basin design configurations x in the design parameter space for cfd simulations table 2 summarizes the parameter range of the basin bulk geometry baffle configuration and loading condition in lhs sampling these parameter ranges were selected based on the common bulk basin geometric configurations x b u l k and baffle geometric configurations x b a f f l e garofalo and sansalone 2018 guzman et al 2018 khan et al 2017 li and sansalone 2022a zhang et al 2014a in total 1 2 10 5 number 2000 design conditions 10 particle diameters 6 families of basin designs of paired datasets x y were generated from the cfd simulations the generation of the entire database takes approximately 26 days with 1500 3000 cores on the hpc at university of florida available hpc cores vary with time and computational load university of florida 2022 the data sparsity ratio n s a m p l e 1 n d i m n s a m p l e is number of samples n d i m is the dimension of input matrix x is estimated to be 3 22 which is comparable to the data sparsity ratio of 1 217 2 825 in recent studies using ml for aircraft wing shape design li et al 2018 li and zhang 2021a the data sparsity ratio is not commonly reported in recent ml literature for water systems 2 2 2 stage 2 ml model formulation and training data driven modeling of basin clarification performance resembles the classic ml problem of supervised learning brunton and kutz 2019 french et al 1992 a wide range of supervised ml models exists chen et al 2020 huang et al 2021 such as decision tree dt random forest rf support vector machine svm k nearest neighbors knn and artificial neural network ann in this study ann was used because of model flexibility demonstrated performance and benefit of direct feature gradient evaluation through the automatic differentiation ad see section 2 2 3 garcía alba et al 2019 li and sansalone 2022a recknagel et al 1997 other models such as dt and rf can also be used see table s1 in online supplemental materials however the gradients need to be additionally approximated with numerical methods e g central difference in supervised ml given a number of paired data x y ml models are trained to learn the non linear relationship that maps from inputs x to outputs y as a natural ml model formulation basin design parameters i e basin geometric features loading conditions can be selected as ml model inputs x and the ml model output y can be the basin total pm separation δ as illustrated by eq 4 or other basin performance parameters e g effluent suspended sediment concentration ssc total suspended solids tss while based on such a formulation ml models can be developed common in recent ml literature for water systems this ml model formulation is not data efficient nor physically robust specifically the influence of the psd m or m j to total pm separation as illustrated by eq 3 is not explicitly considered by the ml model but assumed as a potential learnable component which the ml model does not guarantee to capture if ever in addition buckingham π theorem and dimensional analysis sonin 2001 of basin turbulent transport and pm fate show that the basin total pm separation is intrinsically a function of nondimensional similarity groups e g hazen number reynolds number etc instead of the dimensional quantities e g x in eq 4 li et al 2021a li and

a f f l e x l o a d and y δ to directly enforce the influence of a psd eq 3 and the dynamic similarity for the fate of pm in a basin an alternative ml model formulation was developed fig 2e

dickenson and sansalone 2012 as shown in fig 2f fig s5 illustrates that 10 ten discretized pm diameters are sufficient to characterize the pm separation in the basin 2 with the current d p highlighted with red circle in fig 2f all dimensional basin design parameters x in the input layer were transformed into nondimensional similarity groups which are denoted as transformed input x the

naumann 1935 3 the transformed input x was then scaled by the standard deviation i e classic feature scaling in ml and fed to a classic fully connected neural network fcnn with m hidden layers and n hidden neurons the fcnn outputs the pm separation δ j for the current particle diameters highlighted by red circle as shown in fig 2g the forward mapping operation also known as forward propagation from the first to the second hidden layer in the ann is defined in eq 5 the forward mapping operation from other layers to their subsequent layers follows the same mapping rule the forward mapping in

function 4 the ann model looped over each discretized particle diameter d p repeated the above steps and predicted the pm separation of each discretized particle diameter δ j in the psd with the basin psd m j and ann predicted pm separation of each discretized particle diameter δ j the basin total integrated across all particle diameters pm separation δ can be calculated based on eq 3 based on the cfd generated database from stage 1 training validation and test of the above ann model were carried out by the following steps 1 the cfd generated database 1 2 10 5 was randomly divided into 9 6 10 4 training 1 2 10 4 validation and 1 2 10 4 test dataset with a splitting ratio of 8 1 1 ng 2018 the bivariate relationships and histogram of data pairs in training validation and test dataset are illustrated by the scatter plot matrices in figs s6 s8 2 based on the training dataset the ann model parameters i e weights w were learned by minimizing the ann model output with respect to cfd simulations as illustrated by eqs 6 and 7 the ann model training was performed with pytorch a two stage ann training strategy was applied the ann model was first trained with an adam algorithm kingma and ba 2014 for 1 10 5 iterations and then refined with a limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno lbfgs algorithm fletcher 2000 for another 8 10 4 iterations directly applying lbfgs quasi newton method to ann training at the initial stage can often encounter numerical difficulties such as inaccurate approximation of hessian resulting in diminished learning progress therefore a two stage ann training strategy was implemented a first order method adam optimizer is more robust at the initial stage of ann training xu and darve 2020 2021 and therefore was applied as a precursor optimizer before lbfgs additionally double precision float64 was used to prevent early stops in the lbfgs optimizer the wall clock time of training an ann with 28 hidden neurons and 7 hidden layers was approximately 2 5 h on a single intel xeon cpu e5 2630 v3 processor with 8 cores in the ann model the hyperbolic tangent tanh was applied as the activation function the standard logistic function was used in the output layer li and sansalone 2022a demonstrated that using such a logistic function to bound the predicted pm separation can improve the model training the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons were determined by hyperparameter optimization based on the validation dataset the validation dataset was also used to control the learning process such as learning rate and learning epochs to mitigate potential model overfitting ng 2018 the hyperparameter optimization results are shown in the section ml model training and hyperparameter optimization in online supplemental

optimization once the ann was trained and tested in stage 2 the trained ann model was used to evaluate basin performance in the basin cost optimization in eq 1 as illustrated in fig 2c in contrast to ann model training i e back propagation forward propagation of the ann model for basin performance inference has minimal computational expenses with an execution time of milliseconds in this study an open source multilevel parallel framework for optimization dakota developed by sandia national laboratory was adopted and coupled with pytorch for basin cost optimization adams et al 2020 dakota provides a wide range of constrained optimization algorithms such as the method of feasible directions mfd pattern search and evolutionary algorithm ea compared to the derivative free method the gradient based method has higher efficiency and convergence rate however the gradient based method requires access to the gradient e g d δ d x which in many situations is either not available or difficult to estimate accurately such as with a cfd based evaluation engine in addition to computation efficiency an additional benefit provided by the ann model is that the gradient value d δ d x can be computed exactly by the method of automatic differentiation ad therefore in this study a hybrid evolutionary gradient optimization strategy was developed for basin optimization eq 1 adams et al 2020 li and zhang 2021a in which the gradient was directly computed by pytorch through the torch autograd grad function and interfaced to dakota additionally in the optimization the discrete variable of baffle numbers n b 0 1 3 5 7 9 was initially treated as a continuous variable so derivatives are available for gradient based optimization i e derivatives do not exist for discrete variable once the optimal solution was obtained by the process a local search algorithm was applied in the vicinity of a solution to ensure the discreteness of n b the above sections illustrate the complete methodology of integrating the trained ann model with dakota for basin cost optimization eq 1 except the formulation of the basin cost function j which is detailed in the next section 2 3 basin life cycle costs lcc analysis basin initial costs e g land acquisition costs construction costs and operation maintenance o m costs were assessed using lcc note that lost opportunity land use costs were

minnesota pollution control agency 2021 mott macdonald 2016 noaa office for coastal management 2015 sample et al 2003 water environment research foundation 2009 since the basin costs can vary

facilitated by adjusting the unit costs table 3 summarizes the unit cost by categories the land acquisition cost was estimated based on 43 engineering reports provided by the florida department of

hyperparameter optimization see online supplemental materials was first examined for pm separation δ j eq 2 the developed ann model demonstrates high predictive capability with the coefficient of

computed only to evaluate 0 0 δ j 1 0 range trivial solutions such as δ j 0 0 and δ j 1 0 that corresponds to minimal pm separation in the case of smaller pm diameters e g d p 10 μm and complete pm separation in the case of larger pm diameters e g d p 500 μm were not included in this reported r 2 li and sansalone 2022a 2020 this is because including these trivial solutions although increasing the r 2 can result in biased evaluation and false confidence in the model the developed ann model also illustrates a good generalizability minimal performance degradation r 2 decrease less than 0 001 of ann model was observed from training to the test dataset which was not seen by the ann model during the model training and hyperparameter optimization since the basin never receives pm loading as a single particle diameter the ultimate ann performance of interest is total pm separation δ with a heterodisperse psd that represents the gravimetric distribution of pm diameters for the imposed basin loading fig 3 summarizes the predictive capability of the proposed ann model for total pm separation δ over three 3 common psds table 1 consistent with the good performance of ann in the pm separation based evaluation the predictive capability of the developed ann model for total pm separation is also high with the r 2 ranging from 0 986 to 0 988 the root mean square errors rmse between ann model and cfd database are 0 017 0 014 0 008 for finer medium coarser psd 3 2 visualization of basin performance and cost response to basin design features basin performance as total pm separation δ x b u l

directly therefore two dimensional 2d slices of function δ were visualized by a variable fixing approach fig 4 illustrates the normalized basin total pm separation responses to different baffle configurations i e baffle number n b normalized baffle length ϕ b and baffle angle α under various basin horizontal aspect ratios ar h to facilitate this visualization other design variables are fixed basin surface area a 1600 m 2 mean wet season flowrate q 0 1 m 3 s basin permanent pool depth h 2 m heterodisperse medium psd relative inlet location ϕ i 0 5 and relative outlet location ϕ o 0 5 fig 4 results are organized in rows each row representing the number of baffles tested columns are organized by horizontal aspect ratios the baffle length axis is inset vertically on each plot and the baffle angle axis is inset horizontally on each plot in the first row at a baffle number n b 1 there is no clear trend in the basin performance as total pm separated response to baffling different basin response patterns are observed for different basin horizontal aspect ratios in contrast basins with higher baffle numbers of n b 5 and 7 show more structured and similar response patterns the basin response contour is divided into four 4 quadrants by ϕ b 0 5 i e baffle extend to half the width of the basin and α 90 i e baffle perpendicular to the streamwise direction of flow from inlet to outlet of the basin baffle with longer lengths are observed to be more effective at improving the basin performance for all basin aspect ratios examined higher basin performance is consistently observed in the first quadrant α 90 ϕ b 0 5 which physically corresponds to baffle configurations that extend beyond half the basin width and points upstream such as the top right baffle configuration in fig 2d lower basin performance are observed in the third quadrant α 90 ϕ b 0 5 where the short baffle is configured pointing downstream these observations are consistent with and can be explained by the cfd results for example the bottom left baffle configuration in fig 2d are for a small baffling angle and short baffle lengths and results indicate that this configuration is less effective in reducing flow short circuiting and therefore not ideal for pm separation enhancement overall the basin performance generally increases as the baffle length increase and baffle angle increase although this trend can be additionally influenced by the other factors such as inlet and outlet locations as shown in fig s15 the basin horizontal aspect ratio ar h has a significant influence on the increase in basin performance provided by baffling without baffles as the basin horizontal aspect ratio increases basin performance also increases meanwhile introducing baffles to a higher horizontal aspect ratio basin configuration i e long linear results in an increase in performance that is reduced relative to a lower horizontal aspect ratio basin configuration i e square polygon these observations are consistent with previous studies of li and sansalone 2021b persson et al 1999 in which the long linear basin configuration was shown to yield favorable hydrodynamic conditions for pm separation the question is whether a higher basin aspect ratio if possible in a design phase yet not as likely in a retrofit scenario is more cost effective than the baffled basin design fig 5 shows the basin cost and performance as total pm separation response to the variation of the basin horizontal aspect ratio and baffle length in this visualization baffle number n b and baffle angle α are fixed at nine 9 and 90 other fixed design variables are identical to the previous visualization example of fig 4 fig 5a illustrates that as the basin horizontal aspect ratio increases the basin total cost increases even though the basin permanent pool surface area a is constant this is because a basin with a higher horizontal aspect ratio requires more of a maintenance berm area and therefore higher cost as indicated by eq 11 the maintenance berm area a b e r m is a monotonic increasing function for ar h 1 0 to analyze the relationship between the basin cost and basin performance the isolines of basin cost in fig 5a is plotted on top of the basin total pm separation in fig 5b fig 5b illustrates at a lower basin performance and cost regime j 0 97 million usd for the same basin cost basin with higher horizontal aspect ratio and shorter baffle length yield higher performance than basin with lower horizontal aspect ratio and longer baffle length this behavior however is reversed for the higher basin performance and cost regime j 0 97 million usd for the same basin cost baffling is a more cost effective approach to enhance basin performance than increasing the horizontal aspect ratio note that these observed response structures are a presentation of the pm separation based on basin physics learned by the ann model and are not influenced by the selection of the ann model as shown in fig s16 a different ann model 28 hidden neurons and 5 hidden layers also yield the same response structure these results delineate the complexity of basin design when basin performance and cost are considered simultaneously in particular the transition for cost effective basin design from the higher horizontal aspect ratio to the longer baffle length as the desired basin performance increases indicates there is no a singular basin configuration that would consistently yield optimal basin cost for all total pm separation range the cost effective basin configuration depends on the desired basin performance these results suggest that a well informed scientific decision and cost effective basin design requires considering all these effects and balancing the trade off between the basin performance and the costs 11 a b e r m a s i t e a 12 2 a a r h 1 a r h 148 84 3 3 comparison of cost effectiveness of basin design features to examine the effectiveness of the proposed ml based basin design method the developed ml model was applied for an existing basin and watershed hydrologic conditions loading the basin in southwest florida 26 09 06 1 n 81 46 02 2 w this site receives runoff generated by airport and commercial land use catchments through a dendritic municipal separate storm sewer system ms4 the mean wet season flowrate at this site is 0 1 m 3 s and the loading is a heterodisperse psd note that developed ml models are not limited to this specific basin and watershed loading condition and can be robustly applied to a wide range of conditions as summarized in table 2 and illustrated by fig 3 the watershed hydrologic conditions and constituent loads for this basin have been characterized through a 12 month of field monitoring with a total number of 559 runoff event samples further details about this site location are provided at florida department of transportation 2016 fig 6 compares the cost effectiveness of proposed ml based baffled basin designs to common plain basin designs e g square and circular and also residence time rt based design guidelines currently adopted by many regulatory agencies three 3 heterodisperse psds that range from coarser to finer as shown in fig 6g are examined in fig 6a c and e in fig 6a c and e the ml designs blue cross markers are the pareto frontiers identified by the proposed ml based basin design method cfd simulations were performed to further verify these pareto frontiers with mae of 0 023 0 015 and 0 006 for the finer medium and coarser psds pareto frontiers represent the most cost effective basin designs and are therefore computed fig 7 illustrates the computation of a pareto frontier in stage 3 of the proposed framework fig 2 a random set of basin designs i e population was first initialized with population size of 50 an initial population size of 50 was sufficient for the optimization to progress although a higher population size can also be selected li and sansalone 2021b subsequently the evolutionary algorithm iteratively improved the basin performance while reducing the basin design cost by optimizing the design configuration as shown in fig 7a and b additional illustration of evolutionary algorithm is provided by eq s1 and fig s17 in the supplemental materials the resulting optimal solutions are the pareto frontier which indicates the most cost effective basin designs using the proposed ml based basin design method in fig 6a c and e the square and circular designs orange and green markers are the square and circular basin designs with different surface areas the performance of these square and circular designs are determined through cfd the rt design represent the current rt based basin design guideline adopted by the state of florida florida department of environmental protection 2020 harper and baker 2003 the expression of this rt based design guideline harper and baker 2003 is shown in eq s2 fig 6b d and f illustrates the resulting cost j associated with these different basin design methods for achieving a presumptive regulatory criteria of 80 pm separation removal the proposed ml based basin design method consistently yields lower basin cost than the other basin designs across the entire spectrum of total pm separation for each heterodisperse psd considered finer medium coarser as a function of each psd considered the resulted basin costs for achieving 80 total pm separation with the ml design is 4 7x to 8x lower than the square and circular basin designs with respect to the existing rt based design the ml model design yields a significant reduction in cost by 5 6x 27 8x and 83 5x for finer medium and coarser psd this increased cost reduction for the ml design compared to the rt design as the psd is transformed from a finer to coarser gravimetric particle diameter gradation results from rt based design methods that do not consider the influence of the psd for pm separation these results illustrates the significant benefits of applying the proposed ml based basin design approach the results also illustrate that the psd as the substrate for partitioning distribution of solutes and pathogens and as the vehicle for constituent transport fate is a critical input for a basin design or design retrofit 4 discussion 4 1 need for methodological evolution for basin design and implementation functioning as a unit operation uo basins are widely implemented to sequester particulate matter pm as well as pm bound chemicals and pathogens whether for storm waste potable water or combined sewer overflow treatment in recent decades there has been a worldwide increase in the implementation of wet detention or retention as a type of green infrastructure for urban water cycle management despite the ubiquitous implementation of basins in the built environs the practice of basin planning and design has not been advanced beyond the rt based methods since brune 1953 methods that are commonly implemented through regulatory guidance beckingham et al 2019 california stormwater quality association 2003 clar et al 2004 florida administration code 2005 florida department of environmental protection 2020 st johns river water management district 2018 united states environmental protection agency 2009 vijay and barbara 2019 there are many fundamental limitations of rt based models e g neglecting psd chemical partitioning basin geometrics hydrodynamics this study further reveals the major assumptions and constraints implicitly imposed by the rt based models and lumped models in general for basin geometrics retrofits is that system performance can only be improved by enlarging the system dimensions fig 6c conceptually illustrates an example for a basin retrofit where basin performance is impaired and requires an improvement from the existing impaired baseline of 60 to the presumptive guidance 80 target this is the common situation for most florida basins designed based on rt to meet 80 presumptive guidance there are two approaches to achieve this goal namely methods a and b method a is increasing the basin performance through enlarging the system dimensions this approach is indeed what is suggested and facilitated by the existing rt based basin design method to achieve desired basin performance increasing the basin dimension with respect to rt method a of enlarging the basin is technically simple to implement and has been widely adopted by regulatory and engineering stakeholders however this approach is not economical because enlarging the basin system dimensions results in direct increase in system cost irrespective of adjacent infrastructure conflicts and costs as illustrated by fig 6c if method a is used the basin cost increases exponentially with respect to a required level of basin performance in contrast to method a method b proposed by this study seeks to escape from the scaling characteristics that are constrained by current basin design and jump to a more cost effective basin design scaling through manipulating the basin turbulent transport and pm fate dynamics with design optimization compared to method a method b is technically more sophisticated specifically common urban water management tools such as the rt based method sor and even swmm fail to consider detailed basin configuration and cannot be applied to guide basin design optimization transport resolving simulation tools such as cfd are needed to capture the response of basin performance to the basin configuration notwithstanding the added complexity method b generates very significant economic benefit compared to method a as illustrated by fig 6c improving the basin performance to the target 80 with method b can save 7 0 million usd in comparison to method a furthermore method b has another distinct advantage for impaired basin retrofit in which spatial basin expansion is often constrained by surrounding infrastructure that has been built after the initial basin construction in such a scenario spatial basin expansion in method a is economically prohibitive if modifying or demolishing such infrastructure is even possible the application of method a is even less economical when the lost opportunity land cost is further considered in contrast method b proposed by this study can be effectively applied to impaired basin retrofits since basin performance can be improved by configuring intra basin baffles and basin spatial expansion is unnecessary applying method b with the proposed ml based tool for impaired basin retrofit is readily achieved by adjusting the optimization problem statement eq 1 as illustrated by eq 12 for an impaired basin retrofit the proposed framework optimizes design baffle configuration x b a f f l e for

regulation criteria evolving the existing engineering practice and regulatory guidance from the rt based method to more advanced cfd ml based approaches yield significant benefits for cost effective basin design and implementation furthermore the developed ml based basin design and optimization framework eliminate the challenges of direct application of cfd based optimization in engineering practice such as complex model configuration and higher computational expense liu et al 2020 the developed ml based tool does not require user knowledge of cfd nor ml a full scale basin design optimization can be carried out with the developed ml based tool in minutes on a personal laptop as compared to days with a conventional cfd based approach on an hpc to streamline the basin design and optimization process in engineering practice and reduce the barrier of using the developed ml based tool an immediate future step of this study is to develop a user friendly web based graphic user interface gui 4 2 prevalence of exponential scaling in water treatment systems this study demonstrates that when system cost effectiveness characteristics are subject to exponential scaling increasing the system performance by simply enlarging the system dimension is not an economical approach a significantly more economical approach to system design is by manipulating the intra basin hydrodynamics through design optimization essentially training the flow although exponential scaling in this study is illustrated for pm separation in clarification systems the exponential scaling behavior is likely also present in many other unit operations and processes for water treatment for example continuous stirred tank reactors with tank in series cstr tis model is widely applied for modeling full scale water unit process treatment systems with chemical and biological reactions such as chlorination disinfection and activated sludge processes grady et al 2011 guo et al 2021 pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 the system treatment performance δ modeled by the classic cstr tis model fair et al 1968 grady et al 2011 huber et al 2006 is shown in eq 13 as function of system volume v steady state loading flowrate q first order reaction rate constant k and number of hypothetical tanks n the system treatment performance is defined based on percent removal of a constituent of interest similar to a pm separation outcome the examined range of k and n are selected based on studies for disinfection systems pfeiffer and barbeau 2014 zhang et al 2014b fig 8 shows that irrespective to the selection reaction rate constant k and number of tanks n the system cost effectiveness generally follows the exponential scaling at the system performance range 0 2 δ 0 8 this observation implies if the water treatment system can be represented by the cstr tis model as is the case for chlorination systems and activated sludge processes the cost effectiveness scaling would follow exponential scaling future research is needed to verify this observation with full scale physical modeling or numerical simulation 13 δ 1 1 k v n q n in this equation δ is system treatment performance i e percent removal v is system volume q is steady state loading flowrate k is first order reaction rate and n is number of tanks nevertheless if exponential scaling presents the cost effective system design should also focus on manipulating the system treatment dynamics such as through optimizing system design as demonstrated by this study similarly the proposed ml based system design and optimization tool can also be extended to and developed for other water treatment processes and systems with minimal effort at the availability of higher fidelity cfd databases and or hpc resources for example in the chlorination process instead of expanding the system bulk dimension better design cost effectiveness can be potentially achieved by strategically configuring baffles following the proposed ml based design optimization framework a cfd model can be developed and validated for a chlorination process the validated chlorination cfd model can be used to generate a database for ml model development by evaluating a wide range of design configurations and loading conditions the ml model can be trained validated and tested based on a cfd generated database once the ml model is developed and deployed the cost effective chlorination system design optimization can be performed within a few seconds in engineering practice this proposed ml based system design and optimization framework can also be used to optimize the turbulent mixing and aeration system configuration in the activated sludge processes to improve the system performance and reduce energy consumption the proposed framework is not limited to water treatment systems with only bulk fluid by formulating and developing robust cfd models this same proposed framework can also be applied to design and optimize water treatment systems operating under permeable media flow conditions such as filters adsorption reactors and other types of green infrastructure such as bioretention cells and bioswales 5 conclusion this study developed a machine learning ml based tool of basin design geometrics and retrofit for cost effective clarification basin implementation in urban water management this tool was developed in three stages 1 generation of a basin performance database through computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations 2 formulation of an artificial neural network ann model based on dynamic similarity and trained for basin performance inference using the cfd generated database 3 leveraging the automatic differentiation ad of ann to develop an ann model that was integrated with the optimization library dakota for basin design optimization based on the developed ann model the basin performance and cost responses to various design configuration features were illustrated the potential of using internal baffles to augment basin design cost effectiveness without the need of basin expansion was investigated the efficacy of a developed ml based basin design and optimization tool was examined for a basin and watershed hydrologic condition in southwest florida with an existing monitoring database the basin design generated by the developed ml model was compared with common basin designs and existing design criteria rt based presumptive guidance the results of this study yield the following conclusions ml models such as ann are effective surrogate models for basin performance examination as a function of geometric features and loadings based on the generated database of the higher fidelity cfd model that can be verified and interpreted physically the trained ann model yield high predictive capability for pm separation eq 2 the coefficient of determination r 2 of ann model on training validation and test dataset are 0 998 0 998 and 0 998 fig s14 in supplemental materials moreover the developed ann model based on dynamic similarity illustrates high generalizability with minimal performance degradation from the training dataset to the test dataset r 2 decreases less than 0 001 the developed ann model also demonstrates good performance based on total pm separation eq 3 with the r 2 of 0 988 0 986 and 0 986 for finer medium and coarser psds fig 3 basin performance and cost illustrate complex response structures to basin geometric features a longer baffle length with a higher baffling angle i e pointing upstream as illustrated in fig 1 is more effective for enhancing basin performance however this basin performance response pattern is complicated by the basin horizontal aspect ratio as a higher basin horizontal aspect ratio can also increase basin pm separation the multi objective analysis illustrates that when the cost and basin performance are considered simultaneously there exists a unique transitional behavior between higher horizontal aspect ratio basin and longer baffle length fig 5 a basin with a higher horizontal aspect ratio at lower target basin performance is a more cost effective design in contrast at higher targeted performance level a basin with longer baffles is a more cost effective design the developed ml based design and optimization framework demonstrates significant economic benefits for design geometrics whether for basin planning or basin retrofits in the application to a basin and watershed hydrologic loading in southwest florida ml designs consistently dominate i e more cost effective the common basin external geometries i e square and circular basin and existing residence time rt or hydraulic residence time hrt based guidance irrespective of psd for achieving presumptive regulatory criteria of 80 pm removal i e pm separation the ml design yields 4 7x to 8x lower cost than the common basin geometries compared to the existing rt based guidance the ml design show 5 6x to 83 5x cost reduction as a function of the psd the developed ml based design and retrofit framework represents a promising tool for augmenting cost effective basin engineering and implementation in urban water management apart from demonstrating significant cost reduction capability the proposed ml based framework completely eliminates two 2 major obstacles associated with the direct application of advanced simulation tools such as cfd for current civil and environmental engineering practice identified by american society of civil engineers asce complex advanced model configuration and high computational expense the developed ml based framework requires the user s knowledge and skill in neither cfd nor ml furthermore because the forward propagation with the ann model requires minimal computational resources milliseconds a full scale basin design optimization with the developed ml based framework can be performed in minutes on a personal laptop a major constraint implicitly imposed by the existing rt based guideline or any empirical and or lumped model for cost effective system design is that the system performance can only be improved by enlarging the system dimensions this study demonstrates that when system cost effectiveness characteristics are subject to exponential scaling increasing the system performance by simply enlarging the system dimensions results in a significant increase in system cost if lost opportunity land costs and infrastructure adjacency costs are considered the cost of basin expansion is even more prohibitive instead the cost effective system design should focus on manipulating the system treatment dynamics through optimization of basin geometric features such as with retrofit baffles in addition to basin systems illustrated in this study the wide application of continuous stirred reactors with tank in series cstr tis model also indicates many other water treatment processes and systems are potentially subject to exponential cost benefit scaling future research is needed to verify this observation notwithstanding the developed ml based framework in this study can also be extended and adapted to other unit operation and process systems declaration of competing
