3970,by utilizing gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa and remote sensing precipitation data flood potential index fpi has been widely used in large scale flood monitoring however divergent post processing dynamics of different grace solutions result in substantial uncertainties in grace twsa and thus affecting predictive skills of fpi to overcome this this study develops an integrated flood potential index ifpi by linking the fpi derived from six grace products the gaussian copula is employed to establish the joint distribution of fpi from six spherical harmonic sh products and mass concentration blocks solutions one of the most flood prone regions yangtze river basin in china is selected as a case study we have identified and characterized the floods with different intensities using ifpi which is evaluated against standardized discharge observations as well as the total storage deficit index tsdi water storage deficit index wsdi and combined climatologic deviation index ccdi results show that the area under curve auc values of ifpi for different levels of floods are generally greater than fpis and their ensemble mean implying the better predictive skill for the large scale flood events during the three severest floods in 2010 2015 and 2016 ifpi captures the flood variability exhibited by tsdi wsdi and ccdi as well as hydrological observations this proposed approach might provide reference for flood monitoring and from multi mission satellite data keywords grace data flood monitoring uncertainty analysis copula function yangtze river basin 1 introduction flood is the sudden rise of water volume caused by heavy rain rapid melting of ice snow and storm surges barredo 2007 as one of the most destructive weather related hazards flood has caused over 93 000 deaths and 490 billion usd losses worldwide from 2001 to 2018 lee et al 2020 under climate changes and rapid urbanization frequency and intensity of floods have substantially intensified in the recent decades suggesting an urgent need to better monitor flood events for sustainable development in situ stations provide direct and timely measurements of hydro meteorological elements such as precipitation water level and stream flow which are key for flood monitoring while their sparse and uneven distribution across the world present a challenge in mapping the complete spatial picture of the inundated areas hagen and lu 2011 more recently merging remote sensing sensors have been widely applied in flood monitoring over the past 50 years due to their continuous large scale and accurate assessment of hydro meteorological parameters worldwide long et al 2014 alazzy et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however these conventional flood monitoring techniques only focus on the precise measurements of rainfall and runoff and neglect the importance of antecedent soil moisture hossain and lettenmaier 2006 clark et al 2015 which is known to improve the efficacy of flood monitoring tools and has even been utilized as a surrogate data for flood monitoring lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 reager and famiglietti 2009 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission launched in 2002 provides a promising tool for monitoring large scale changes in terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa which is defined as the sum of all water above and underneath land surface consisting of surface soil moisture root zone soil moisture groundwater snow ice water stored in the vegetation river and lake water tapley et al 2004 girotto and rodell 2019 grace based twsa plays a fundamental role in capturing the flood formation processes chen et al 2010 several studies have applied grace twsa to establish standardized indices for large scale flood monitoring for example chen et al 2018 employed the total storage deficit index tsdi using grace data to depict floods of the liao river basin in northeast china between 2002 and 2016 showing their potential application in flood monitoring nigatu et al 2021 used the water storage deficits index wsdi to capture floods triggered by human induced climate change in the nile river basin based on grace data in addition the grace based combined climatologic deviation index ccdi and grace groundwater drought index gcdi were also utilized to analyze the hydrological extremes over river basins in south india and north china indicating robust disasters monitoring capacity wang et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 xiong et al 2021 alternatively reager and famiglietti 2009 innovatively proposed the flood potential index fpi and validated its applicability globally by comparing with dartmouth flood observatory flood maps subsequently many studies have used fpi to assess its potential in flood monitoring across many areas molodtsova et al 2016 calculated fpi based on grace data of csr release rl 05 over continental united states from 2003 to 2012 and found a good agreement between the fpi and the observed floods on regional and even local scales sun et al 2017 identified the most severe 2010 flood event in the yangtze river basin using fpi derived from ensemble mean of level 3 data of grace csr jpl and gfz rl06 the monitoring ability for several levels of floods has also been validated in peninsular indian river basins gupta and dhanya 2020 fpi has become a preferable and effective tool to monitor large scale floods using grace data idowu and zhou 2021 furthermore given the more reliable monitoring ability for severe floods than moderate or middle floods of fpi abelen et al 2015 chen et al 2018 the threshold values of fpi for floods with varying severity need to be examined for more appropriate identification of different flood events especially over regions with high flood risks such as the yangtze river basin of china sun et al 2017 gupta and dhanya 2020 proposed a method based on in situ discharge data to detect the threshold values of fpi for floods of 85th 90th and 95th over the peninsular indian river basins and achieved good flood monitoring accuracy of more than 90 however only three classes of flood were analyzed and the method remains unexplored in the yangtze river basin twsa derived from different agencies e g csr jpl gfz exhibit considerable discrepancies due to different post processing strategies sun et al 2020 resulting in divergent performance of corresponding fpi previous works revealed that the fpi based on grace data can well monitor floods while these studies only assessed the fpi using the spherical harmonic sh solutions of grace the flood monitoring potential of mass concentration block mascon solutions remain unexplored the uncertainty in different fpi data derived from different kinds of grace twsa highlights an urgent need to integrate them for more accurate assessment of flood events as a robust approach for multivariate hydrological analysis copulas have been widely used in rainfall and flood frequency analysis favre et al 2004 zhang and singh 2006 renard and lang 2007 and its simplicity and feasibility enable wide use for development of joint monitoring index of hydrological extremes and the relative frequency analysis saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 hao and singh 2015 liu et al 2016 for example chang et al 2016 employed several parameters including precipitation anomaly percentage runoff anomaly percentage standardized precipitation index spi and modified palmer drought severity index to develop copula based integrated drought index shah and mishra 2020 integrated the spi standardized runoff index sri standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized groundwater index sgi to develop a copula based integrated drought index in india until now copula has not been applied to establish the so called integrated fpi ifpi considering above challenges the present study aims to 1 combine the fpi data derived from six sh and mascon grace solutions to a single integrated flood potential index ifpi based on copula function 2 compare the performance of fpi and ifpi across the yangtze river basin of china 3 use ifpi for flood monitoring varying levels of floods during the implementation period of grace mission 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin is in the plateau climate and subtropical zone of south china which originates from the tibetan plateau in the west and eventually drains into the east china sea in the east china with a total drainage area of 1 390 000 km2 the topography of yangtze river basin appears a ladder like distribution from west to east with an average elevation of 4500 m the spatial distribution of precipitation is uneven because of the complicated geographical and topographical environment the mean annual precipitation is about 1100 mm which presents a remarkable seasonal distribution and more than 70 of the annual rainfall is distributed during the wet season between may and october the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation indicates the large scale floods are prone to occur from may to october every year given the fact that the yangtze river basin sustains about 400 million people and occupies approximate 46 of the gross domestic product of china flood monitoring is of great significance for reduction of financial and life losses of flood disasters sun et al 2017 moreover the basic information about elevation stream network and major observation stations of the yangtze river basin is presented in fig 1 zhang et al 2015 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace solutions the grace mission has provided monthly twsa across the globe in the form of equivalent water thickness between april 2002 and june 2017 and the total of 20 missing months during the implementation period was interpolated using a simple linear regression method tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2004 this study obtained three level 2 sh products solved by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl center for space research at the university of texas at austin csr and german research center for geosciences gfz to establish fpi which are the latest versions of release number 06 rl06 ramillien et al 2004 moreover three gridded mascon solutions from jpl v02 csr v02 and goddard space flight center gsfc v02 4 were also used to develop fpi the level 2 sh products were processed by parameterize the earth s gravity field based on the global spherical harmonics basis functions and the gridded mascon allowed for parameterize the gravity field with regional mass concentration functions save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 all the six grace solutions were represented by 1 1 gridded cell the grace twsa have been removed from the time mean baseline between january 2005 and december 2010 for three sh solutions and between january 2004 and december 2009 for two mascon products an essential difference between the sh i e csr jpl and gfz and mascon i e csr jpl and gsfc solutions is that the sh solutions are global while the mascon products can be used at both regional to global scales for instance the land and ocean areas in global sh solutions cannot be distinguished and there are significant signal leakages and bias between land and ocean which can be exactly alleviated during mascon processing for the hydrological application at the regional scale using the sh solutions significant post processing steps including the truncation of the signal to degree and order of 40 60 96 de striping filtering and gaussian smoothing filter swenson and wahr 2006 furthermore the sh data are generally processed to reduce noise such as north south stripes in the gravity field and correlated errors trigged by the poor observability of the east west component of the gravity gradient for example various approaches including the addictive factor multiplicative factor and constrained forward modelling methods have been widely used to restore the signal leakage and bias landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2015 in contrast to the sh solutions that implement noise reduction during post processing procedures the regional mascon solutions employ constraints or regularization during the gravity inversion process scanlon et al 2016 2 2 2 gldas output global land data assimilation system gldas generates optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes by ingesting satellite and ground based observational data with advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 2007 gldas version 2 1 involves multiple land surface and hydrological models including noah the community clsm and the variable infiltration capacity vic models the noah model products were used in this study as it can fit grace twsa much better than the other two models i e clsm and vic yang et al 2013 the monthly twsa data from noah was utilized for comparison with six grace solutions representing the accumulation of the sum of soil moisture content plant canopy and snow melt water storage similarly the spatial resolution of the noah twsa is 1 1 thus a direct spatial comparison between twsa from noah and grace can be carried out 2 2 3 global precipitation climatology project to construct the fpi monthly precipitation data between april 2002 and june 2017 from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp was used which is formed by the world climate research program wcrp to exploit the capabilities of satellite borne instruments along with gauges for producing monthly and finer temporal resolution global precipitation in the long term adler et al 2003 the spatial resolution of the gpcp data was up scaled from 0 5 0 5 to 1 1 in consistent with grace data the gpcp precipitation data is available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center ncdc 2 2 4 in situ measurements to evaluate the uncertainty of gpcp precipitation data the monthly average precipitation measurements during the april 2002 june 2017 were collected from the 711 meteorological stations across the yangtze river basin see fig 1 and monthly mean discharge data measured at 11 hydrological stations were also used to validate the flood monitoring ability of ifpi all the in situ rainfall and stream flow data have followed a strict quality control policy xiong et al 2020 the hydro meteorological observations are from the china meteorological administration cma and the yangtze river water resources commission the observations are standardized by subtracting the mean value and dividing by the standard deviation between april 2002 and june 2017 2 3 method 2 3 1 flood monitoring indexes to express the regional flood possibility using grace and precipitation data the fpi is calculated according to reager and famiglietti 2009 1 fpa i j p i j m a x twsa i j twsa i j 1 2 fpi i j fpa i j max fpa i j where fpa i j mm is the flood potential amount of the i th year and j th month that indicates the capacity of storing the potential rainfall into the land a larger fpa i j implies higher flood occurrence p i j mm is the remote sensing precipitation of the corresponding time m a x twsa i j and twsa i j 1 mm represent the long term maximum twsa from grace during the period april 2002 june 2017 and the value of the previous month respectively equation 2 represents the normalization of fpa data max fpa i j is the maximum value of fpa which is the highest difference between precipitation and regional storage variability i e fpa i j in the grace era when the fpi is closer to 1 implying a higher flood occurrence in contrast to other widely used drought and flood indices e g sri spi swi merely concentrating on the soil wetness conditions or precipitation variations fpi highlights the possible transition to a flood prone situation of precipitation gains under terrestrial saturation the effective flood potential mapping ability of fpi has been validated by the flood maps from dartmouth flood observatory reager and famiglietti 2009 alternatively other three grace based indexes including tsdi wsdi and ccdi are calculated as follows 3 tsd i j twsa i j m e a n t w s a j m a x twsa j m i n twsa j 100 4 wsd i j twsa i j m e a n t w s a j 5 pa i j p i j m e a n p i j 6 pa i j r p i j m e a n pa j 7 cd i j pa i j r wsd i j 7 tsdi i j wsdi i j ccdi i j tsd i j wsd i j cd i j m e a n tsd i j wsd i j cd i j sd tsd i j wsd i j cd i j i 2002 2003 2017 j 1 2 12 where m e a n t w s a j and m i n twsa j is the long term mean and minimum grace twsa for the j th month during the period april 2002 june 2017 twsa i j and p i j donates the twsa and precipitation for the i th year and j th month moreover pa i j and pa j represents the precipitation anomaly for the i th year and j th month the j th month from 2002 to 2017 respectively pa i j r is the difference between pa i j and mean precipitation of pa j tsd i j wsd i j and cd i j is the total storage deficit water storage deficit and the combined climatologic deviation of the specific time respectively 2 3 2 integrate fpi based on copula function the copula function is used to integrate fpi derived from six sh and mascon solutions to alleviate relative uncertainty copula functions are generally employed to establish joint distribution of multiple variables which can link different types of marginal distribution among the various available copula families the gaussian copula is reported to be more appropriate to fit the distribution in linking higher order multivariate variables ma et al 2014 xiong et al 2019 xiong et al 2020a b in this study we use the gaussian copula for constructing the joint distribution of the multi mission fpi data respectively the joint distribution of fpi derived from six grace solutions is expressed as follows 8 p a a f f c u σ v u a u b u c u d u e u f 9 c u σ v φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 6 1 2 π n σ exp 1 2 x σ 1 x d x where c u σ v refers to as the gaussian copula v is the degrees of freedom and σ is the correlation matrix u a u b u c u d u e u f are the marginal distribution function of fpi derived from three sh products i e csr gfz jpl and three mascon solutions i e csr gsfc and jpl respectively the marginal distribution and copula function cannot be rejected if the corresponding p value of cramer von mises cm and kolmogorov smirnov ks tests at 10 significance level genest et al 2006 genest and favre 2007 the penalized likelihood criteria of akaike s information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are used to evaluate the fitting performance yamaoka et al 1978 atkinson 1980 the lower aic and bic values denote the closer proximity between the theoretical function and observations three alternative theoretical distributions including the normal logistic and general extreme value gev distributions are employed to fit the marginal distribution of fpi table 1 reveals that the normal distribution is relatively more suitable for each category of fpi for the yangtze river basin fig 2 also shows that normal distribution can fit fpi from csr sh left panel and csr mascon right panel very well to test the reliability of the gaussian copula function we calculate p values of the cm and ks tests aic and bic criteria respectively the p p plots of joint distributions for the fpi from six grace solutions are illustrated in fig 3 the gaussian copula shows respective p values of 0 09 and 0 07 for cm and ks tests at the 0 1 significance level which indicates that gaussian copula is capable to integrate fpi over the yangtze river basin hence we develop the ifpi using the gaussian copula by taking the inverse of joint cumulative probability p as 10 i f p i φ 1 p where φ is the standard normal distribution function 2 3 3 generalized three cornered hat this study used the generalized three cornered hat tch method to estimate the relative uncertainties of twsa data sourced from six different grace solutions without any prior knowledge at basin and grid scale respectively the tch theory was initially developed by premoli and tavella 1993 and tavella and premoli 1994 the tch approach allowed more than three products to participate in the estimation of uncertainty simultaneously without requiring any prior knowledge tch has been widely applied to compute temporal series uncertainties of grace data and other hydrological models awange et al 2016 ferreira et al 2016 the gsfc mascon product is chosen as the reference series because there is no estimate of the true signal which did not impact on ultimate results 2 3 4 determination of threshold ifpi the approach of identifying fpi threshold values has been validated across the peninsular indian river basins gupta and dhanya 2020 the threshold values of ifpi in the yangtze river basin are determined for better monitoring of floods with varying intensities as follows calculate the peak over threshold pot discharges of five different percentiles including 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentiles for the observed discharge time series at the outlet of the yangtze river basin determine whether a flood occurs for each month between april 2002 and june 2017 by comparing the observed discharge of the outlet gauge station with the pot values for different percentile exceedances compare the ifpi for the yangtze river basin with the observed discharge time series and determine the threshold values of ifpi corresponding to percentile observed floods by taking as the average of ifpi values of all grid cells over the whole of basin to assess the monitoring skill of ifpi for floods with different intensities i e 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentiles this study applied a 2 2 contingency table between the flood events identified by the threshold values of ifpi and in situ discharge respectively the agreement between ifpi and discharge observations can be quantified using the true positive rate tpr false positive rate fpr and accuracy a which are defined as follows murphy and winkler 1987 11 tpr a a c f p r b b d a a b a b c d where a hit case represents the number of floods monitored by both ifpi and observations b false alert is the number of floods monitored by ifpi but not observed from measurements c miss donates the number of floods observed by measurements but not monitored by ifpi and d positive rejection indicates the number of floods not monitored by neither ifpi nor observations furthermore a receiver operating characteristic roc is used to test the flood monitoring performance of ifpi against binary observational data in the 2 2 contingency table fawcett 2006 the roc analysis uses a binary classifier mapping the index values below and above the certain threshold value for different classes of floods the roc curve is performed by generating multiply pairs of tpr and fpr based on a contingency table against stepwise threshold values of ifpi ranging from 0 to 1 for different classes of floods while a line at a slope of 1 is set to represent random guess correspondingly the area under curve auc is calculated to represent the predictive skills of ifpi for different classes of floods for the random guess of 1 1 line the auc of 0 5 indicates no monitoring skill of floods and the auc greater than 0 7 relates to a strong predictive skill in practice the 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 of auc values are generally used as the thresholds for fair satisfactory good and excellent predictive skill hanley and mcneil 1982 molodtsova et al 2016 3 results 3 1 uncertainty of twsa and precipitation to measure the reliability of gpcp product and different grace solutions precipitation and twsa time series from observations remote sensing satellites and hydrological simulation for the yangtze river basin between april 2002 and june 2017 are presented in fig 4 a good agreement between gpcp and measured rainfall data is discovered with the correlation coefficient cc of 0 99 and root mean square error rmse of 11 20 mm indicating a satisfactory accuracy of gpcp data set in terms of twsa from six grace solutions the sh and mascon product presents different change patterns that mascon solutions generally underestimate the sh data it is found that grace twsa underestimate the gldas twsa from 2003 to 2004 and overestimate that from 2014 to 2017 the large discrepancies between grace and gldas might arise from the grace instrument problems and age related battery issue jpl jet propulsion laboratory 2017 a more correlated relation is discovered between sh products 0 81 0 82 and gldas twsa than that of mascon solutions 0 72 0 80 among the six grace solutions csr sh shows the strongest correlation with gldas results cc 0 82 while jpl mascon presents the poorest correlation with gldas data cc 0 72 we further calculated the relative uncertainty of six grace solutions using the tch method it is discovered that gfz sh product has the highest uncertainty of 11 45 mm month while the gsfc mascon data shows the lowest uncertainty 5 09 mm month csr sh csr mascon jpl sh and jpl mascon solution presents an average uncertainty of 7 17 6 49 6 74 and 6 69 mm month respectively 3 2 development of ifpi based on gaussian copula function this study develops ifpi using fpi series from six grace solutions the threshold values of ifpi for different classes of floods including 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentile is determined accordingly see table 2 the larger threshold values of ifpi indicate severity of flood occurrences increases over the basin we test the threshold ifpi against the observed flood events and the corresponding results of skill metrics are tabulated in table 2 it is observed the severest 99th floods indicate the highest accuracy of 97 22 with fpr of 0 03 and tpr of 0 58 which means that such floods can be better monitored than floods with lower intensity e g 80th percentile furthermore the roc curves for different levels of floods see fig 5 show good agreement between ifpi monitored and observed flood events over the yangtze river basin the auc values of ifpi and multi source fpi under different classes of floods are summarized in table 2 the ifpi usually achieve an auc score of over 0 85 confirming their excellent skill in predicting flood events on the contrary both multi source fpis and their ensemble mean scenario exhibit much poorer performance with auc values ranging from 0 78 to 0 92 when focusing on more extreme floods i e 99th percentile the auc values of ifpi 0 96 are far larger than those of individual fpi 0 87 0 92 suggesting better improvements of ifpi in characterizing high intensity events in addition the multi fpi average ensemble generally shows better flood monitoring skills than individual members which reflects large potential uncertainty sourced from different grace solutions and therefore even a simple weighting method can improve their performance among six divergent fpi data sets the gsfc mascon results present relatively better predictive skills while the csr sh solution shows the poorest flood monitoring ability with the auc value of 0 87 for the 99th percentile floods the uncertainty in distinctive grace products is responsible for the difference in flood predictive skills of corresponding fpi 3 3 identification of floods based on ifpi based on the basin averaged ifpi and threshold values under different flooding classes between april 2002 and june 2017 we extracted 12 major floods greater than 80th percentile level see fig 6 and table 3 this level corresponds to the lowest frequency in large scale floods monitored by the grace mission gupta and dhanya 2020 so it is selected as a threshold for sake of obtaining enough flooding samples the most severe floods in the yangtze river basin occurred in 2010 id 6 2015 id 10 and 2016 id 11 due to the high ifpi values and long duration these floods are also clearly captured by daily stream flow observations of the yangtze river basin see fig 6 verifying the reliability of ifpi the 2016 flood started in may 2016 and terminated in august 2016 with a duration of 4 months this was the longest and severest flood that occurred in the yangtze river basin during april 2002 june 2017 with peak average ifpis of 2 29 1 7 the next severest flood based on ifpi started in june 2010 and terminated in august 2010 with the duration of 3 months and the peak 2 23 and average 1 64 ifpis of the 2010 flood is significantly lower than the 2016 flood in addition the 2015 flood started in june 2015 and ended in september 2015 and lasted 4 months the average and maximum ifpi during the 2015 flood is 1 27 and 1 82 respectively next we have detected the temporal and spatial correlation between ifpi and fpi from six grace solutions the cc between basin average ifpi and fpis are all as high as 0 98 indicating that ifpi can combine the response of floods monitored by fpi derived from different grace solutions floods based on ifpi successfully captures the variability in flood potential derived from six grace solutions 3 4 ifpi performance to validate the flood monitoring ability of ifpi we evaluate the flood monitoring performance of ifpi against standardized streamflow observations over the yangtze river basin in the 2010 2015 and 2016 floods see fig 7 in addition to in situ measurements several grace based indices including tsdi wsdi ccdi are used to compare with ifpi because they are all robust and widely used indices to monitor large scale floods wang et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 nigatu et al 2021 we find that during the june 2016 a large part of the yangtze river basin was affected by severe flood especially in the lower regions of the basin our results show that during june 2016 the yangtze river basin experienced a severe flood monitored by tsdi wsdi and ccdi which is consistent with the response of ifpi it is noted here that the scales of ifpi and tsdi wsdi and ccdi are different therefore tsdi and ccdi exhibit a somewhat lesser intensity than ifpi while wsdi shows a slightly severer pattern standardized discharge measurements show a widespread flood located in the downstream basin in june 2016 which is also well captured in ifpi similarly our results show that ifpi can capture the flood variability exhibited by tsdi wsdi and ccdi as well as hydrological observations during august 2015 and july 2010 all the independent flood indicators and in situ measurements show a response that is consistent with ifpi we have also evaluated the temporal dynamics of ifpi tsdi wsdi ccdi together with standardized streamflow observations see fig 8 we find that basin averaged ifpi is well correlated with in situ discharge observations with a correlation coefficient of 0 86 higher than that of other three indexes tsdi wsdi ccdi 0 30 0 79 0 23 the results suggest a good flood monitoring ability of ifpi among the three indexes wsdi shows the strongest correlation with ifpi with cc of 0 86 than that of tsdi 0 40 and ccdi 0 41 moreover we present the spatial distribution of cc between ifpi and tsdi wsdi ccdi together with standardized stream flow observations across the yangtze river basin see fig 9 ifpi is strongly correlated with stream flow measurements with cc generally ranging from 0 6 to 1 overall generally the strong spatial correlations between ifpi and wsdi ccdi and tsdi suggest the satisfactory flood monitoring skill of ifpi 4 discussion although our proposed ifpi achieves a satisfactory flood monitoring skill with auc over 0 85 across the yangtze river basin there are still some limitations regarding the spatiotemporal resolution and coverage of ifpi firstly the monthly grace data and associated ifpi is difficult to capture the sub monthly flood process especially for floods with short life and small water amount given the shortcoming a previous study has derived sub monthly twsa variations based on the strong relationship between modis reflectance data and grace solutions tangdamrongsub et al 2016 and a radial basis function based daily grace solution from gfz is also used to track small scale floods in the ganges brahmaputra delta gouweleeuw et al 2018 however estimated twsa variations at the daily scale are not well validated due to the lack for in situ observations e g surface water soil moisture groundwater and the data driven post processing approaches might introduce systematical uncertainties sourced from external data constraints e g modis secondly the relatively coarse spatial resolution of approximately 400 km of raw grace data poses a challenge in monitoring the moderate and mild scale floods using ifpi therefore many spatial downscaling approaches have been employed to generate regional grace like data using statistical and data assimilation methods vishwakarma et al 2018 2021 yin et al 2018 bahrami et al 2021 the synthesized grace like data at a fine spatial resolution from 2 km to 27 75 km i e 0 25 has significantly broaden the grace application in the hydrological community such as drought and flood monitoring and groundwater estimation however these methods rely heavily on the inherent relationship between grace data and other hydrological variables and simulations suggesting an insufficient global applicability thirdly considering the definition of individual fpi ifpi works effectively in monitoring storm induced flood events however during spring march to may and winter december to february of next year in the upstream regions of the yangtze river basin the ifpi may exhibit a poorer performance see fig 10 this can be explained that floods during the two seasons are highly impacted by ice jams and snowmelt which are difficult to be captured in the ifpi xiao et al 2008 modification of the fpi approach to include ice jams and snowmelt is likely to improve its predictive skill in short ifpi method is more appropriate to the floods with long duration i e 1 month and high intensity over the large scale river basins larger than the grace footprints i e 150 000 km2 especially for un gauged and poorly gauged catchments like developing countries and international basins idowu and zhou 2019 jing et al 2020 grace satellites finished in june 2017 and the next generation of grace follow on mission has continued observing the global gravity field anomaly since june 2018 although ifpi during the implementation period of grace mission has been established the future change of ifpi is still unexplored by using the newest grace follow on data the change in flood risks and frequency in the future can be further detected furthermore state of the art machine learning techniques can help reconstruct the twsa data in the future combined with the global gcms precipitation and temperature data sets under different emission scenarios i e rcp 2 6 4 5 8 5 therefore ifpi projection with the lead time of several months can be carried out which will be further investigated and fully evaluated soon 5 conclusions using fpi derived from six grace sh i e csr gfz jpl and mascon i e csr gsfc jpl datasets this study develops ifpi based on a gaussian copula for the yangtze river basin between april 2002 june 2017 the threshold values of ifpi for floods with different intensities including 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentiles are identified subsequently the major floods for the basin during the april 2002 and june 2017 are detected and characterized using ifpi which are evaluated by comparing with stream flow observations as well as other indexes such as tsdi wsdi and ccdi the major conclusions are summarized as the roc curves for different levels of floods show good agreement between ifpi monitored and observed flood events over the yangtze river basin the auc values of ifpi for different classes of floods are generally greater than 0 85 and is as high as 0 96 for the 99th percentile flood showing that ifpi has an excellent predictive skill for the flood events especially for that with high intensity e g 99th percentile the generally higher auc values of ifpi indicate its better predictive skills of flood events than multi source fpis and their ensemble mean 12 major floods greater than 80th percentile level has been identified using ifpi the longest and severest flood started in may 2016 and terminated in august 2016 with average and peak ifpis of 1 7 and 2 29 respectively the next most severe flood lasted 4 months from june 2015 to september 2015 and the peak 1 82 and average 1 27 ifpis were significantly lower than the 2010 flood peak average ifpis 2 23 1 64 which started in june 2010 and ended in august 2010 during the 2016 2015 and 2010 floods all the independent flood indicators i e tsdi wsdi ccdi and in situ measurements show a response in consistent with ifpi the basin averaged ifpi is better correlated with in situ observations discharge cc 0 86 than tsdi wsdi and ccdi in conclusion ifpi can capture the flood variability exhibited by

3970,by utilizing gravity recovery and climate experiment grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa and remote sensing precipitation data flood potential index fpi has been widely used in large scale flood monitoring however divergent post processing dynamics of different grace solutions result in substantial uncertainties in grace twsa and thus affecting predictive skills of fpi to overcome this this study develops an integrated flood potential index ifpi by linking the fpi derived from six grace products the gaussian copula is employed to establish the joint distribution of fpi from six spherical harmonic sh products and mass concentration blocks solutions one of the most flood prone regions yangtze river basin in china is selected as a case study we have identified and characterized the floods with different intensities using ifpi which is evaluated against standardized discharge observations as well as the total storage deficit index tsdi water storage deficit index wsdi and combined climatologic deviation index ccdi results show that the area under curve auc values of ifpi for different levels of floods are generally greater than fpis and their ensemble mean implying the better predictive skill for the large scale flood events during the three severest floods in 2010 2015 and 2016 ifpi captures the flood variability exhibited by tsdi wsdi and ccdi as well as hydrological observations this proposed approach might provide reference for flood monitoring and from multi mission satellite data keywords grace data flood monitoring uncertainty analysis copula function yangtze river basin 1 introduction flood is the sudden rise of water volume caused by heavy rain rapid melting of ice snow and storm surges barredo 2007 as one of the most destructive weather related hazards flood has caused over 93 000 deaths and 490 billion usd losses worldwide from 2001 to 2018 lee et al 2020 under climate changes and rapid urbanization frequency and intensity of floods have substantially intensified in the recent decades suggesting an urgent need to better monitor flood events for sustainable development in situ stations provide direct and timely measurements of hydro meteorological elements such as precipitation water level and stream flow which are key for flood monitoring while their sparse and uneven distribution across the world present a challenge in mapping the complete spatial picture of the inundated areas hagen and lu 2011 more recently merging remote sensing sensors have been widely applied in flood monitoring over the past 50 years due to their continuous large scale and accurate assessment of hydro meteorological parameters worldwide long et al 2014 alazzy et al 2017 wang et al 2018 however these conventional flood monitoring techniques only focus on the precise measurements of rainfall and runoff and neglect the importance of antecedent soil moisture hossain and lettenmaier 2006 clark et al 2015 which is known to improve the efficacy of flood monitoring tools and has even been utilized as a surrogate data for flood monitoring lettenmaier and famiglietti 2006 reager and famiglietti 2009 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace twin satellite mission launched in 2002 provides a promising tool for monitoring large scale changes in terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa which is defined as the sum of all water above and underneath land surface consisting of surface soil moisture root zone soil moisture groundwater snow ice water stored in the vegetation river and lake water tapley et al 2004 girotto and rodell 2019 grace based twsa plays a fundamental role in capturing the flood formation processes chen et al 2010 several studies have applied grace twsa to establish standardized indices for large scale flood monitoring for example chen et al 2018 employed the total storage deficit index tsdi using grace data to depict floods of the liao river basin in northeast china between 2002 and 2016 showing their potential application in flood monitoring nigatu et al 2021 used the water storage deficits index wsdi to capture floods triggered by human induced climate change in the nile river basin based on grace data in addition the grace based combined climatologic deviation index ccdi and grace groundwater drought index gcdi were also utilized to analyze the hydrological extremes over river basins in south india and north china indicating robust disasters monitoring capacity wang et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 xiong et al 2021 alternatively reager and famiglietti 2009 innovatively proposed the flood potential index fpi and validated its applicability globally by comparing with dartmouth flood observatory flood maps subsequently many studies have used fpi to assess its potential in flood monitoring across many areas molodtsova et al 2016 calculated fpi based on grace data of csr release rl 05 over continental united states from 2003 to 2012 and found a good agreement between the fpi and the observed floods on regional and even local scales sun et al 2017 identified the most severe 2010 flood event in the yangtze river basin using fpi derived from ensemble mean of level 3 data of grace csr jpl and gfz rl06 the monitoring ability for several levels of floods has also been validated in peninsular indian river basins gupta and dhanya 2020 fpi has become a preferable and effective tool to monitor large scale floods using grace data idowu and zhou 2021 furthermore given the more reliable monitoring ability for severe floods than moderate or middle floods of fpi abelen et al 2015 chen et al 2018 the threshold values of fpi for floods with varying severity need to be examined for more appropriate identification of different flood events especially over regions with high flood risks such as the yangtze river basin of china sun et al 2017 gupta and dhanya 2020 proposed a method based on in situ discharge data to detect the threshold values of fpi for floods of 85th 90th and 95th over the peninsular indian river basins and achieved good flood monitoring accuracy of more than 90 however only three classes of flood were analyzed and the method remains unexplored in the yangtze river basin twsa derived from different agencies e g csr jpl gfz exhibit considerable discrepancies due to different post processing strategies sun et al 2020 resulting in divergent performance of corresponding fpi previous works revealed that the fpi based on grace data can well monitor floods while these studies only assessed the fpi using the spherical harmonic sh solutions of grace the flood monitoring potential of mass concentration block mascon solutions remain unexplored the uncertainty in different fpi data derived from different kinds of grace twsa highlights an urgent need to integrate them for more accurate assessment of flood events as a robust approach for multivariate hydrological analysis copulas have been widely used in rainfall and flood frequency analysis favre et al 2004 zhang and singh 2006 renard and lang 2007 and its simplicity and feasibility enable wide use for development of joint monitoring index of hydrological extremes and the relative frequency analysis saghafian and mehdikhani 2014 hao and singh 2015 liu et al 2016 for example chang et al 2016 employed several parameters including precipitation anomaly percentage runoff anomaly percentage standardized precipitation index spi and modified palmer drought severity index to develop copula based integrated drought index shah and mishra 2020 integrated the spi standardized runoff index sri standardized soil moisture index ssi and standardized groundwater index sgi to develop a copula based integrated drought index in india until now copula has not been applied to establish the so called integrated fpi ifpi considering above challenges the present study aims to 1 combine the fpi data derived from six sh and mascon grace solutions to a single integrated flood potential index ifpi based on copula function 2 compare the performance of fpi and ifpi across the yangtze river basin of china 3 use ifpi for flood monitoring varying levels of floods during the implementation period of grace mission 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the yangtze river basin is in the plateau climate and subtropical zone of south china which originates from the tibetan plateau in the west and eventually drains into the east china sea in the east china with a total drainage area of 1 390 000 km2 the topography of yangtze river basin appears a ladder like distribution from west to east with an average elevation of 4500 m the spatial distribution of precipitation is uneven because of the complicated geographical and topographical environment the mean annual precipitation is about 1100 mm which presents a remarkable seasonal distribution and more than 70 of the annual rainfall is distributed during the wet season between may and october the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation indicates the large scale floods are prone to occur from may to october every year given the fact that the yangtze river basin sustains about 400 million people and occupies approximate 46 of the gross domestic product of china flood monitoring is of great significance for reduction of financial and life losses of flood disasters sun et al 2017 moreover the basic information about elevation stream network and major observation stations of the yangtze river basin is presented in fig 1 zhang et al 2015 2 2 data 2 2 1 grace solutions the grace mission has provided monthly twsa across the globe in the form of equivalent water thickness between april 2002 and june 2017 and the total of 20 missing months during the implementation period was interpolated using a simple linear regression method tapley et al 2004 wahr et al 2004 this study obtained three level 2 sh products solved by the jet propulsion laboratory jpl center for space research at the university of texas at austin csr and german research center for geosciences gfz to establish fpi which are the latest versions of release number 06 rl06 ramillien et al 2004 moreover three gridded mascon solutions from jpl v02 csr v02 and goddard space flight center gsfc v02 4 were also used to develop fpi the level 2 sh products were processed by parameterize the earth s gravity field based on the global spherical harmonics basis functions and the gridded mascon allowed for parameterize the gravity field with regional mass concentration functions save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 all the six grace solutions were represented by 1 1 gridded cell the grace twsa have been removed from the time mean baseline between january 2005 and december 2010 for three sh solutions and between january 2004 and december 2009 for two mascon products an essential difference between the sh i e csr jpl and gfz and mascon i e csr jpl and gsfc solutions is that the sh solutions are global while the mascon products can be used at both regional to global scales for instance the land and ocean areas in global sh solutions cannot be distinguished and there are significant signal leakages and bias between land and ocean which can be exactly alleviated during mascon processing for the hydrological application at the regional scale using the sh solutions significant post processing steps including the truncation of the signal to degree and order of 40 60 96 de striping filtering and gaussian smoothing filter swenson and wahr 2006 furthermore the sh data are generally processed to reduce noise such as north south stripes in the gravity field and correlated errors trigged by the poor observability of the east west component of the gravity gradient for example various approaches including the addictive factor multiplicative factor and constrained forward modelling methods have been widely used to restore the signal leakage and bias landerer and swenson 2012 long et al 2015 in contrast to the sh solutions that implement noise reduction during post processing procedures the regional mascon solutions employ constraints or regularization during the gravity inversion process scanlon et al 2016 2 2 2 gldas output global land data assimilation system gldas generates optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes by ingesting satellite and ground based observational data with advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 2007 gldas version 2 1 involves multiple land surface and hydrological models including noah the community clsm and the variable infiltration capacity vic models the noah model products were used in this study as it can fit grace twsa much better than the other two models i e clsm and vic yang et al 2013 the monthly twsa data from noah was utilized for comparison with six grace solutions representing the accumulation of the sum of soil moisture content plant canopy and snow melt water storage similarly the spatial resolution of the noah twsa is 1 1 thus a direct spatial comparison between twsa from noah and grace can be carried out 2 2 3 global precipitation climatology project to construct the fpi monthly precipitation data between april 2002 and june 2017 from the global precipitation climatology project gpcp was used which is formed by the world climate research program wcrp to exploit the capabilities of satellite borne instruments along with gauges for producing monthly and finer temporal resolution global precipitation in the long term adler et al 2003 the spatial resolution of the gpcp data was up scaled from 0 5 0 5 to 1 1 in consistent with grace data the gpcp precipitation data is available from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center ncdc 2 2 4 in situ measurements to evaluate the uncertainty of gpcp precipitation data the monthly average precipitation measurements during the april 2002 june 2017 were collected from the 711 meteorological stations across the yangtze river basin see fig 1 and monthly mean discharge data measured at 11 hydrological stations were also used to validate the flood monitoring ability of ifpi all the in situ rainfall and stream flow data have followed a strict quality control policy xiong et al 2020 the hydro meteorological observations are from the china meteorological administration cma and the yangtze river water resources commission the observations are standardized by subtracting the mean value and dividing by the standard deviation between april 2002 and june 2017 2 3 method 2 3 1 flood monitoring indexes to express the regional flood possibility using grace and precipitation data the fpi is calculated according to reager and famiglietti 2009 1 fpa i j p i j m a x twsa i j twsa i j 1 2 fpi i j fpa i j max fpa i j where fpa i j mm is the flood potential amount of the i th year and j th month that indicates the capacity of storing the potential rainfall into the land a larger fpa i j implies higher flood occurrence p i j mm is the remote sensing precipitation of the corresponding time m a x twsa i j and twsa i j 1 mm represent the long term maximum twsa from grace during the period april 2002 june 2017 and the value of the previous month respectively equation 2 represents the normalization of fpa data max fpa i j is the maximum value of fpa which is the highest difference between precipitation and regional storage variability i e fpa i j in the grace era when the fpi is closer to 1 implying a higher flood occurrence in contrast to other widely used drought and flood indices e g sri spi swi merely concentrating on the soil wetness conditions or precipitation variations fpi highlights the possible transition to a flood prone situation of precipitation gains under terrestrial saturation the effective flood potential mapping ability of fpi has been validated by the flood maps from dartmouth flood observatory reager and famiglietti 2009 alternatively other three grace based indexes including tsdi wsdi and ccdi are calculated as follows 3 tsd i j twsa i j m e a n t w s a j m a x twsa j m i n twsa j 100 4 wsd i j twsa i j m e a n t w s a j 5 pa i j p i j m e a n p i j 6 pa i j r p i j m e a n pa j 7 cd i j pa i j r wsd i j 7 tsdi i j wsdi i j ccdi i j tsd i j wsd i j cd i j m e a n tsd i j wsd i j cd i j sd tsd i j wsd i j cd i j i 2002 2003 2017 j 1 2 12 where m e a n t w s a j and m i n twsa j is the long term mean and minimum grace twsa for the j th month during the period april 2002 june 2017 twsa i j and p i j donates the twsa and precipitation for the i th year and j th month moreover pa i j and pa j represents the precipitation anomaly for the i th year and j th month the j th month from 2002 to 2017 respectively pa i j r is the difference between pa i j and mean precipitation of pa j tsd i j wsd i j and cd i j is the total storage deficit water storage deficit and the combined climatologic deviation of the specific time respectively 2 3 2 integrate fpi based on copula function the copula function is used to integrate fpi derived from six sh and mascon solutions to alleviate relative uncertainty copula functions are generally employed to establish joint distribution of multiple variables which can link different types of marginal distribution among the various available copula families the gaussian copula is reported to be more appropriate to fit the distribution in linking higher order multivariate variables ma et al 2014 xiong et al 2019 xiong et al 2020a b in this study we use the gaussian copula for constructing the joint distribution of the multi mission fpi data respectively the joint distribution of fpi derived from six grace solutions is expressed as follows 8 p a a f f c u σ v u a u b u c u d u e u f 9 c u σ v φ 1 u 1 φ 1 u 6 1 2 π n σ exp 1 2 x σ 1 x d x where c u σ v refers to as the gaussian copula v is the degrees of freedom and σ is the correlation matrix u a u b u c u d u e u f are the marginal distribution function of fpi derived from three sh products i e csr gfz jpl and three mascon solutions i e csr gsfc and jpl respectively the marginal distribution and copula function cannot be rejected if the corresponding p value of cramer von mises cm and kolmogorov smirnov ks tests at 10 significance level genest et al 2006 genest and favre 2007 the penalized likelihood criteria of akaike s information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic are used to evaluate the fitting performance yamaoka et al 1978 atkinson 1980 the lower aic and bic values denote the closer proximity between the theoretical function and observations three alternative theoretical distributions including the normal logistic and general extreme value gev distributions are employed to fit the marginal distribution of fpi table 1 reveals that the normal distribution is relatively more suitable for each category of fpi for the yangtze river basin fig 2 also shows that normal distribution can fit fpi from csr sh left panel and csr mascon right panel very well to test the reliability of the gaussian copula function we calculate p values of the cm and ks tests aic and bic criteria respectively the p p plots of joint distributions for the fpi from six grace solutions are illustrated in fig 3 the gaussian copula shows respective p values of 0 09 and 0 07 for cm and ks tests at the 0 1 significance level which indicates that gaussian copula is capable to integrate fpi over the yangtze river basin hence we develop the ifpi using the gaussian copula by taking the inverse of joint cumulative probability p as 10 i f p i φ 1 p where φ is the standard normal distribution function 2 3 3 generalized three cornered hat this study used the generalized three cornered hat tch method to estimate the relative uncertainties of twsa data sourced from six different grace solutions without any prior knowledge at basin and grid scale respectively the tch theory was initially developed by premoli and tavella 1993 and tavella and premoli 1994 the tch approach allowed more than three products to participate in the estimation of uncertainty simultaneously without requiring any prior knowledge tch has been widely applied to compute temporal series uncertainties of grace data and other hydrological models awange et al 2016 ferreira et al 2016 the gsfc mascon product is chosen as the reference series because there is no estimate of the true signal which did not impact on ultimate results 2 3 4 determination of threshold ifpi the approach of identifying fpi threshold values has been validated across the peninsular indian river basins gupta and dhanya 2020 the threshold values of ifpi in the yangtze river basin are determined for better monitoring of floods with varying intensities as follows calculate the peak over threshold pot discharges of five different percentiles including 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentiles for the observed discharge time series at the outlet of the yangtze river basin determine whether a flood occurs for each month between april 2002 and june 2017 by comparing the observed discharge of the outlet gauge station with the pot values for different percentile exceedances compare the ifpi for the yangtze river basin with the observed discharge time series and determine the threshold values of ifpi corresponding to percentile observed floods by taking as the average of ifpi values of all grid cells over the whole of basin to assess the monitoring skill of ifpi for floods with different intensities i e 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentiles this study applied a 2 2 contingency table between the flood events identified by the threshold values of ifpi and in situ discharge respectively the agreement between ifpi and discharge observations can be quantified using the true positive rate tpr false positive rate fpr and accuracy a which are defined as follows murphy and winkler 1987 11 tpr a a c f p r b b d a a b a b c d where a hit case represents the number of floods monitored by both ifpi and observations b false alert is the number of floods monitored by ifpi but not observed from measurements c miss donates the number of floods observed by measurements but not monitored by ifpi and d positive rejection indicates the number of floods not monitored by neither ifpi nor observations furthermore a receiver operating characteristic roc is used to test the flood monitoring performance of ifpi against binary observational data in the 2 2 contingency table fawcett 2006 the roc analysis uses a binary classifier mapping the index values below and above the certain threshold value for different classes of floods the roc curve is performed by generating multiply pairs of tpr and fpr based on a contingency table against stepwise threshold values of ifpi ranging from 0 to 1 for different classes of floods while a line at a slope of 1 is set to represent random guess correspondingly the area under curve auc is calculated to represent the predictive skills of ifpi for different classes of floods for the random guess of 1 1 line the auc of 0 5 indicates no monitoring skill of floods and the auc greater than 0 7 relates to a strong predictive skill in practice the 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 of auc values are generally used as the thresholds for fair satisfactory good and excellent predictive skill hanley and mcneil 1982 molodtsova et al 2016 3 results 3 1 uncertainty of twsa and precipitation to measure the reliability of gpcp product and different grace solutions precipitation and twsa time series from observations remote sensing satellites and hydrological simulation for the yangtze river basin between april 2002 and june 2017 are presented in fig 4 a good agreement between gpcp and measured rainfall data is discovered with the correlation coefficient cc of 0 99 and root mean square error rmse of 11 20 mm indicating a satisfactory accuracy of gpcp data set in terms of twsa from six grace solutions the sh and mascon product presents different change patterns that mascon solutions generally underestimate the sh data it is found that grace twsa underestimate the gldas twsa from 2003 to 2004 and overestimate that from 2014 to 2017 the large discrepancies between grace and gldas might arise from the grace instrument problems and age related battery issue jpl jet propulsion laboratory 2017 a more correlated relation is discovered between sh products 0 81 0 82 and gldas twsa than that of mascon solutions 0 72 0 80 among the six grace solutions csr sh shows the strongest correlation with gldas results cc 0 82 while jpl mascon presents the poorest correlation with gldas data cc 0 72 we further calculated the relative uncertainty of six grace solutions using the tch method it is discovered that gfz sh product has the highest uncertainty of 11 45 mm month while the gsfc mascon data shows the lowest uncertainty 5 09 mm month csr sh csr mascon jpl sh and jpl mascon solution presents an average uncertainty of 7 17 6 49 6 74 and 6 69 mm month respectively 3 2 development of ifpi based on gaussian copula function this study develops ifpi using fpi series from six grace solutions the threshold values of ifpi for different classes of floods including 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentile is determined accordingly see table 2 the larger threshold values of ifpi indicate severity of flood occurrences increases over the basin we test the threshold ifpi against the observed flood events and the corresponding results of skill metrics are tabulated in table 2 it is observed the severest 99th floods indicate the highest accuracy of 97 22 with fpr of 0 03 and tpr of 0 58 which means that such floods can be better monitored than floods with lower intensity e g 80th percentile furthermore the roc curves for different levels of floods see fig 5 show good agreement between ifpi monitored and observed flood events over the yangtze river basin the auc values of ifpi and multi source fpi under different classes of floods are summarized in table 2 the ifpi usually achieve an auc score of over 0 85 confirming their excellent skill in predicting flood events on the contrary both multi source fpis and their ensemble mean scenario exhibit much poorer performance with auc values ranging from 0 78 to 0 92 when focusing on more extreme floods i e 99th percentile the auc values of ifpi 0 96 are far larger than those of individual fpi 0 87 0 92 suggesting better improvements of ifpi in characterizing high intensity events in addition the multi fpi average ensemble generally shows better flood monitoring skills than individual members which reflects large potential uncertainty sourced from different grace solutions and therefore even a simple weighting method can improve their performance among six divergent fpi data sets the gsfc mascon results present relatively better predictive skills while the csr sh solution shows the poorest flood monitoring ability with the auc value of 0 87 for the 99th percentile floods the uncertainty in distinctive grace products is responsible for the difference in flood predictive skills of corresponding fpi 3 3 identification of floods based on ifpi based on the basin averaged ifpi and threshold values under different flooding classes between april 2002 and june 2017 we extracted 12 major floods greater than 80th percentile level see fig 6 and table 3 this level corresponds to the lowest frequency in large scale floods monitored by the grace mission gupta and dhanya 2020 so it is selected as a threshold for sake of obtaining enough flooding samples the most severe floods in the yangtze river basin occurred in 2010 id 6 2015 id 10 and 2016 id 11 due to the high ifpi values and long duration these floods are also clearly captured by daily stream flow observations of the yangtze river basin see fig 6 verifying the reliability of ifpi the 2016 flood started in may 2016 and terminated in august 2016 with a duration of 4 months this was the longest and severest flood that occurred in the yangtze river basin during april 2002 june 2017 with peak average ifpis of 2 29 1 7 the next severest flood based on ifpi started in june 2010 and terminated in august 2010 with the duration of 3 months and the peak 2 23 and average 1 64 ifpis of the 2010 flood is significantly lower than the 2016 flood in addition the 2015 flood started in june 2015 and ended in september 2015 and lasted 4 months the average and maximum ifpi during the 2015 flood is 1 27 and 1 82 respectively next we have detected the temporal and spatial correlation between ifpi and fpi from six grace solutions the cc between basin average ifpi and fpis are all as high as 0 98 indicating that ifpi can combine the response of floods monitored by fpi derived from different grace solutions floods based on ifpi successfully captures the variability in flood potential derived from six grace solutions 3 4 ifpi performance to validate the flood monitoring ability of ifpi we evaluate the flood monitoring performance of ifpi against standardized streamflow observations over the yangtze river basin in the 2010 2015 and 2016 floods see fig 7 in addition to in situ measurements several grace based indices including tsdi wsdi ccdi are used to compare with ifpi because they are all robust and widely used indices to monitor large scale floods wang et al 2020 kumar et al 2021 nigatu et al 2021 we find that during the june 2016 a large part of the yangtze river basin was affected by severe flood especially in the lower regions of the basin our results show that during june 2016 the yangtze river basin experienced a severe flood monitored by tsdi wsdi and ccdi which is consistent with the response of ifpi it is noted here that the scales of ifpi and tsdi wsdi and ccdi are different therefore tsdi and ccdi exhibit a somewhat lesser intensity than ifpi while wsdi shows a slightly severer pattern standardized discharge measurements show a widespread flood located in the downstream basin in june 2016 which is also well captured in ifpi similarly our results show that ifpi can capture the flood variability exhibited by tsdi wsdi and ccdi as well as hydrological observations during august 2015 and july 2010 all the independent flood indicators and in situ measurements show a response that is consistent with ifpi we have also evaluated the temporal dynamics of ifpi tsdi wsdi ccdi together with standardized streamflow observations see fig 8 we find that basin averaged ifpi is well correlated with in situ discharge observations with a correlation coefficient of 0 86 higher than that of other three indexes tsdi wsdi ccdi 0 30 0 79 0 23 the results suggest a good flood monitoring ability of ifpi among the three indexes wsdi shows the strongest correlation with ifpi with cc of 0 86 than that of tsdi 0 40 and ccdi 0 41 moreover we present the spatial distribution of cc between ifpi and tsdi wsdi ccdi together with standardized stream flow observations across the yangtze river basin see fig 9 ifpi is strongly correlated with stream flow measurements with cc generally ranging from 0 6 to 1 overall generally the strong spatial correlations between ifpi and wsdi ccdi and tsdi suggest the satisfactory flood monitoring skill of ifpi 4 discussion although our proposed ifpi achieves a satisfactory flood monitoring skill with auc over 0 85 across the yangtze river basin there are still some limitations regarding the spatiotemporal resolution and coverage of ifpi firstly the monthly grace data and associated ifpi is difficult to capture the sub monthly flood process especially for floods with short life and small water amount given the shortcoming a previous study has derived sub monthly twsa variations based on the strong relationship between modis reflectance data and grace solutions tangdamrongsub et al 2016 and a radial basis function based daily grace solution from gfz is also used to track small scale floods in the ganges brahmaputra delta gouweleeuw et al 2018 however estimated twsa variations at the daily scale are not well validated due to the lack for in situ observations e g surface water soil moisture groundwater and the data driven post processing approaches might introduce systematical uncertainties sourced from external data constraints e g modis secondly the relatively coarse spatial resolution of approximately 400 km of raw grace data poses a challenge in monitoring the moderate and mild scale floods using ifpi therefore many spatial downscaling approaches have been employed to generate regional grace like data using statistical and data assimilation methods vishwakarma et al 2018 2021 yin et al 2018 bahrami et al 2021 the synthesized grace like data at a fine spatial resolution from 2 km to 27 75 km i e 0 25 has significantly broaden the grace application in the hydrological community such as drought and flood monitoring and groundwater estimation however these methods rely heavily on the inherent relationship between grace data and other hydrological variables and simulations suggesting an insufficient global applicability thirdly considering the definition of individual fpi ifpi works effectively in monitoring storm induced flood events however during spring march to may and winter december to february of next year in the upstream regions of the yangtze river basin the ifpi may exhibit a poorer performance see fig 10 this can be explained that floods during the two seasons are highly impacted by ice jams and snowmelt which are difficult to be captured in the ifpi xiao et al 2008 modification of the fpi approach to include ice jams and snowmelt is likely to improve its predictive skill in short ifpi method is more appropriate to the floods with long duration i e 1 month and high intensity over the large scale river basins larger than the grace footprints i e 150 000 km2 especially for un gauged and poorly gauged catchments like developing countries and international basins idowu and zhou 2019 jing et al 2020 grace satellites finished in june 2017 and the next generation of grace follow on mission has continued observing the global gravity field anomaly since june 2018 although ifpi during the implementation period of grace mission has been established the future change of ifpi is still unexplored by using the newest grace follow on data the change in flood risks and frequency in the future can be further detected furthermore state of the art machine learning techniques can help reconstruct the twsa data in the future combined with the global gcms precipitation and temperature data sets under different emission scenarios i e rcp 2 6 4 5 8 5 therefore ifpi projection with the lead time of several months can be carried out which will be further investigated and fully evaluated soon 5 conclusions using fpi derived from six grace sh i e csr gfz jpl and mascon i e csr gsfc jpl datasets this study develops ifpi based on a gaussian copula for the yangtze river basin between april 2002 june 2017 the threshold values of ifpi for floods with different intensities including 80th 90th 95th 98th and 99th percentiles are identified subsequently the major floods for the basin during the april 2002 and june 2017 are detected and characterized using ifpi which are evaluated by comparing with stream flow observations as well as other indexes such as tsdi wsdi and ccdi the major conclusions are summarized as the roc curves for different levels of floods show good agreement between ifpi monitored and observed flood events over the yangtze river basin the auc values of ifpi for different classes of floods are generally greater than 0 85 and is as high as 0 96 for the 99th percentile flood showing that ifpi has an excellent predictive skill for the flood events especially for that with high intensity e g 99th percentile the generally higher auc values of ifpi indicate its better predictive skills of flood events than multi source fpis and their ensemble mean 12 major floods greater than 80th percentile level has been identified using ifpi the longest and severest flood started in may 2016 and terminated in august 2016 with average and peak ifpis of 1 7 and 2 29 respectively the next most severe flood lasted 4 months from june 2015 to september 2015 and the peak 1 82 and average 1 27 ifpis were significantly lower than the 2010 flood peak average ifpis 2 23 1 64 which started in june 2010 and ended in august 2010 during the 2016 2015 and 2010 floods all the independent flood indicators i e tsdi wsdi ccdi and in situ measurements show a response in consistent with ifpi the basin averaged ifpi is better correlated with in situ observations discharge cc 0 86 than tsdi wsdi and ccdi in conclusion ifpi can capture the flood variability exhibited by tsdi wsdi and ccdi together with hydrological observations credit authorship contribution statement jinghua xiong conceptualization data curation writing original draft jiabo yin visualization writing

3971,a dynamic column experiment using aquifer medium collected from a riverbank filtration rbf site in northeast china was conducted to investigate the biogeochemical transformation processes of iron fe2 manganese mn2 ammonium nh4 and their interaction under coexisting conditions in real groundwater water parameters such as contaminant concentrations ph and dissolved oxygen do were determined while microbial analysis for the aquifer medium was performed through 16s rrna sequencing the results revealed that biochemical oxidation reductive dissolution adsorption were among the critical biogeochemical processes involved in the transformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in which biological processes were the core process the transformation rate of fe2 mn2 and nh4 jointly revealed that the competition for do existed throughout their co oxidation process and determined the spatial characteristics of their transformation processes to a certain extent fe2 oxidation and nitrification primarily occurred in the upper oxidation zone 100 cm 70 cm mn2 transformation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox occurred mainly beneath the oxidation zone the predominant area of microbial growth and metabolism was another key factor related to the spatial characteristics of biotransformation the microbial analysis illustrated that pseudomonas arthrobacter gallionella acinetobacter bacillus were among the dominant genera related to iron oxidizing bacteria iob and manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob the iob related genera were distributed mainly at 80 cm 60 cm with a relative abundance of 49 mnob related genera were the most abundant 35 bacteria at 60 cm 40 cm and nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and nitrosomonas mainly existed in the upper part of the 100 cm 70 cm where nitrification occurred the influence of microbial activity by changing chemical environment was manifested through the variation of transformation intensity during the experiment the iron and manganese oxides generated by the bio oxidation of fe2 and mn2 contributed significantly to the transformation of all three contaminants the results may be valuable for understanding the evolution mechanism of groundwater when contaminated simultaneously with fe2 mn2 and nh4 keywords ammonium iron manganese biogeochemical transformation process microbial community 1 introduction contamination caused by ferrous iron fe2 manganese mn2 and ammonium nh4 widely exists in groundwater environment zeng et al 2020 chinese class iii standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 stipulates that the content of fe2 and mn2 should not exceed 0 3 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively however fe2 and mn2 are common exceedance components in groundwater of northern china taking the riverbank filtration rbf sites in northeast china for instance the concentrations of fe2 0 8 9 7 mg l and mn2 0 8 1 4 mg l in groundwater surpass the standard value by 3 34 times and 8 14 times respectively meng et al 2020b meanwhile nh4 contamination has become more significant in recent years wu et al 2021 zuo et al 2018 which inevitably lead to contamination under the coexistence conditions of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in groundwater the migration and transformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in groundwater are subjected to a combination of physical chemical and biological processes podlasek et al 2020 vries et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 where biotransformation under the mediation of microorganisms plays an important role meng et al 2020a the migration and transformation processes of nh4 are relatively complicated affected mainly by adsorption dissolution assimilation chemical oxidation and biotransformation processes such as nitrification denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation under the synergy of various bacteria cai et al 2014 yu et al 2007 the biotransformation processes are also influenced by factors such as chemical conditions and microbial community characteristics he et al 2012 sudarno et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 the transformation of fe2 and mn2 in groundwater is closely related to a series of biogeochemical processes where oxidative precipitation and reductive dissolution regulated by microorganisms are among the critical biogeochemical processes gandy et al 2007 tebo et al 2004 the oxidation of mn2 and nh4 in groundwater is mostly enzymatic reactions dominated by biological oxidation when ph ranges from 6 0 to 8 0 tekerlekopoulou et al 2006 previous studies have shown mutual interaction between fe2 mn2 and nh4 when they coexist in water bodies a study on wastewater treatment suggested that both fe2 and mn2 as chemical components of cells and activators of enzyme activity have a facilitating effect on nitrifying bacteria when each of them is present at low concentrations the facilitating effect of the nitrosation reaction is more significant than that of nitrification wang et al 2003 fe2 at an appropriate concentration can significantly enhance the heterotrophic nitrification process qian et al 2017 and positively influence anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox liu and ni 2015 in the field of water contamination treatment the three contaminants are found in competition for dissolved oxygen do when they coexist in groundwater cheng 2016 guo et al 2017 there are differences in the oxidation reduction potential orp standard for redox reactions of fe2 mn2 and nh4 which determine the strong competitiveness of fe2 for do cai et al 2014 accordingly fe2 was found to be the fastest to oxidize among these contaminants while mn2 was the slowest as a result the oxidation of mn2 tends to become enhanced after fe2 and nh4 are oxidized completely cheng 2016 vandenabeele et al 1995 and the increase in fe2 concentration could limit the oxidation of nh4 and is disadvantageous to its aerobic transformation researchers bruins et al 2015 guo et al 2017 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 found that fe2 and mn2 can form into oxides through biochemical reactions and have adsorption and catalytic oxidation effects on nh4 however subsequent studies cheng et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 argued that there is no tight correlation between the removal of nh4 in groundwater and the catalytic effect of mn oxides and the transformation of nh4 is instead assumed to be primarily subjected to microbial relevant process overall it is apparent that fe2 and mn2 participate in the nitrogen cycle during the geochemical processes and influence the transformation of nh4 guo et al 2017 luther and popp 2002 our previous work meng et al 2020a demonstrated the impact of flow rate and initial concentration on the transformation of the three contaminants in the rbf system however the transformation mechanisms of fe2 mn2 and nh4 under coexisting conditions in the rbf system especially the interplay among their biotransformation processes in real groundwater are yet well understood in this study a vertical column experiment of fe2 mn2 and nh4 was conducted and the spatiotemporal interplay between the biogeochemical processes of fe2 mn2 and nh4 was analyzed thus formed the transferability of the study on the transformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in typical contaminated groundwater systems combined with our previous work 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquifer medium the aquifer medium used in the column experiment was collected from 0 to 5 m depth with 1 meter intervals and 5 45 m depth with uneven intervals in three in situ test wells of the rbf site on the south bank of songhua river northeast china meng et al 2020a the groundwater type of the rbf site is mainly phreatic water silty fine sand medium and coarse sand are the primary lithologies of the aquifer with a thickness of approximately 40 50 m and the aquifer is considered unified meng et al 2020a the upper zone of the aquifer is mainly a layer of yellow silty fine sand while the middle and lower zone of the aquifer consists mainly of gray medium and coarse sands the processes of collecting and pretreating the original aquifer medium before filling it into the column are shown in fig s1 2 2 apparatus and approaches 2 2 1 soil column and experiment procedures the vertical column experiment of fe2 mn2 and nh4 was conducted using a transparent polymethyl methacrylate column with a total length of 120 cm and an inner diameter of 10 cm as shown in fig 1 experimental materials were rinsed and repeatedly flushed with deionized water before the experiment to minimize the involvement of microorganisms not associated with the aquifer medium the effective filling length of the aquifer medium was 100 cm and a 5 cm mixture of gravel and quartz sand was filled beneath the aquifer medium to keep the column from clogging the medium was topped with 5 cm of quartz sand above to ensure uniform influent real groundwater and prevent the filled medium from mobilizing and deforming 10 cm was left void at the top of the column five sampling ports with an inner diameter of 12 mm were evenly arranged on the column soil solution samplers were installed in the sampling ports to collect water samples and subsequently determine the concentrations of fe2 mn2 nh4 as well as ph do orp at different depths during the experiment the filled aquifer medium in the column was equally scaled down according to the actual aquifer structure of the rbf site and the geometric ratio of the actual aquifer medium to the column medium was 1 50 the medium was tamped and compacted several times every 5 cm in the column to ensure that the filled medium approximated the natural state of the aquifer medium and prevented stratification after filling the soil column was shaded to restore the actual underground condition and the aquifer medium was saturated with a stable influent rate to meet the material needs of microbial growth and metabolism at the same time to avoid clogging and improve the biological effectiveness water with biological metabolites was released at a stable rate from the outlet at the column bottom real groundwater obtained from the rbf site was used for the leaching experiment and the leaching flow rate was set at 25 l d based on the permeability of the aquifer at the rbf site obtained from previous aquifer tests the groundwater quality parameters are shown in table s1 the soil column was initially saturated with deionized water then real groundwater in the influent water tank was pumped to the top of the column at a constant rate by a peristaltic pump which subsequently began the leaching experiment the water sample was 100 ml with 24 h intervals during the experiment and the experiment was conducted for 34 days 2 2 2 hydrochemical analysis methods the water samples were obtained through vacuum extraction based on the soil solution samplers installed on the column to ensure that the sampling process was not affected by ambient air a centrifuge tube was placed in an anaerobic incubator filled with nitrogen sealed with sealing film and connected to the sampling tube water chemistry analysis was conducted to obtain ion concentrations of nh4 no3 no2 fe2 and mn2 where concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 were determined by spectrometry perkin elmer lambda 35 usa and concentrations of fe2 and mn2 were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan chemical

distribution characteristics within the soil column and to further reveal the predominant genera during the biotransformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 five aquifer medium samples were collected from 80 60 40 20 and 0 cm above the bottom after the experiment was finished on day 34 the samples were then stored in sterilized bags in an anaerobic chamber filled with nitrogen and sealed in an airtight

amplification products were mixed with the same volume of buffer and detected by electrophoresis using a 1 5 agarose gel and samples with a bright main strip between 400 and 450 bp were selected for

reference to the greengenes database via rdp classifier software v2 11 and the species composition of samples at different taxonomic levels was counted the abundance information in otus of each sample was counted to reveal the composition and spatial distribution of bacterial communities in aquifer medium of different depths 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution and variation pattern of fe2 mn2 and nh4 the concentration of fe2 mn2 nh4 and ph do orp were obtained by water chemistry analysis the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of ion concentrations in the column were plotted in fig 2 which presented the influent and effluent concentration of nh4 fe2 mn2 as well as the ion concentrations of sp1 and sp3 in the early period day 1 10 middle period day 11 22 and late period day 23 34 of the experiment results from certain days are missing from fig 2 due to inadequacy of the data which was caused by the flawed experimental operation the overall variation regularity of ion concentrations in sp1 and sp2 sp3 and sp4 sp5 and effluent were relatively similar thus sp1 sp3 and effluent were selected as the representative points in the upper 100 cm 70 cm middle 70 cm 30 cm and lower 30 cm 0 cm sections of the column respectively in the early period the concentrations of fe2 mn2 nh4 all showed a generally descending pattern from top to bottom of the column fig 2a all three contaminants existed mostly in the upper section during this period the decreasing magnitude of fe2 concentration from influent to sp1 was the greatest among the three contaminants decreased by average 5 52 mg l indicating that a strong transformation of fe2 may have occurred in the upper section the differences in mn2 concentration among the upper middle lower sections throughout the early period were 9 30 smaller than that of the other two contaminants this would indicate that the rather slow mn2 oxidation discovered in the study of contaminant treatment cheng 2016 vandenabeele et al 1995 is also present in the natural rbf system the variation pattern of fe2 and mn2 during day 1 5 showed an obvious distinction from that of nh4 that is while fe2 and mn2 decreased in the upper section this pattern was not evident in the middle and especially in the lower section in contrast the concentration of nh4 presented a slight decline in the middle and lower sections during days 1 5 it can be hypothesized that the nh4 transformation may have occurred in the relatively anaerobic environment and the oxidation and precipitation of fe2 and mn2 occurred mostly in the upper section at this period in the middle period nh4 concentration remained in a decreasing pattern from top to bottom and was still present mainly in the upper section with an average concentration of 1 44 mg l fig 2b the distribution pattern of fe2 and mn2 showed a distinction from the previous period and were both presented mainly in the upper and lower sections fig 2b the average concentration of fe2 in sp3 was 30 53 smaller than that in the other two areas while that of mn2 was smaller by 27 35 the average concentration of mn2 and fe2 in the lower section were 0 27 0 62 mg l higher than that of the previous period suggesting that the reduction of fe2 and mn2 may have occurred and resulted in an obvious increase of both contaminants the decreasing magnitude of fe2 concentration between influent and sp1 remained the largest among the three contaminants while that of mn2 remained the weakest in the late period the distribution pattern of nh4 was still similar to that in the early and middle periods fe2 existed mainly in the lower section with an average concentration of 1 49 mg l and the upper section was still the primary area where the decline in fe2 concentration occurred fig 2c the variation in fe2 concentration throughout the whole column was relatively minor during this period indicating that the transformation and reduction processes of fe2 stabilized mn2 was mainly present in the upper section during the late period the difference in mn2 concentration between the middle and lower sections diminished by 53 compared to the previous period suggesting the reduction of mn2 may have been weakened overall the spatiotemporal distribution and variation pattern of nh4 was relatively consistent throughout the experiment nh4 existed primarily in the upper section and there was no predominant area where the decline in nh4 concentration mainly occurred the upper section was the primary area where the decline in fe2 concentration occurred throughout the experiment the predominant area where the decline in mn2 concentration occurred was the upper and middle sections the increase in fe2 and mn2 concentration associated with the reduction process occurred mainly in the lower section this process only became significant in the middle period 3 2 biogeochemical transformation processes the spatiotemporal distributions of ph do orp during the experiment were plotted by kriging interpolation as shown in fig 3 the transformation rates of nh4 fe2 and mn2 in the upper section middle section lower section were plotted as shown in fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 respectively the transformation rate in the upper section is calculated using concentrations of sp1 relative to the influent concentrations that in the middle section is calculated using concentrations of sp3 relative to concentrations of sp1 and the lower section is calculated in the same analogy 3 2 1 transformation rates in the upper section 100 cm 70 cm during the early period day 1 10 the transformation rate of fe2 in the upper section was far larger than that of mn2 and nh4 and fluctuated between 70 and 85 the transformation rate of nh4 was generally greater than that of mn2 with an average of 22 which coincided with the previous assumption that a predominant fe2 transformation occurred in the upper section and mn2 oxidation was the slowest in real groundwater neglecting the interference of data fluctuation at certain days the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 decreased by approximately 10 22 during the initial days which is opposite to the regularity that the transformation rate of fe2 had increased by 15 concurrently there was a continuous increase from 10 to around 30 in the transformation rate of nh4 from day 5 onwards the transformation rate of fe2 began to decrease at the end of the early period its transformation rate reached a lower value of 66 at the 13th day but from that day onwards the overall transformation rate of fe2 compared to the previous day raised again indicating an enhanced oxidation process of fe2 the transformation rate of mn2 increased considerably from an average of 12 in the early period to an average of 27 in the middle period and continuously increased by 34 since day 15 and reached a peak value of 46 at day 19 the transformation rate of nh4 during the middle period fluctuated drastically without obvious increase suggesting that the nitrification process is influenced by the changing biochemical environment during the late period day 23 34 the transformation rate of fe2 had risen to reach the average transformation rate of 84 during this period the transformation rate curves of fe2 and nh4 both fluctuated and were relatively parallel during the late period suggesting their transformation processes are relatively independent in this period the transformation rate of mn2 during the late period had generally decreased when the ph of the upper section decreased below 7 0 3 2 2 transformation rates in the middle section 70 cm 30 cm in the middle section of the column the average transformation rate of fe2 during the early period was 47 lower than that of the upper section the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 generally increased and were 15 and 22 higher than that of the upper section respectively the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 in the middle section decreased continuously after the initial days when the redox environment became progressively unsuitable for aerobic oxidation of nh4 and mn2 as shown by ph and orp variation in fig 3 during the middle period the average transformation rate of fe2 increased from 32 of the early period to 52 suggesting its transformation was enhanced the average transformation rate of nh4 increased from 27 in the upper section to 52 in the middle section and increased by 15 compared to that during the early period the transformation rate of mn2 showed an increasing trend with fluctuations from 17 on the 13th day to 77 on the 23rd day indicating the enhanced transformation of mn2 in the contemporaneous period during the late period the transformation rate of all three contaminants showed a continuous decline and ph in the middle section had been generally reduced to below 7 therefore the biochemical transformation processes of all three contaminants were inhibited to a considerable extent due to the changed chemical environment 3 2 3 transformation rates in the lower section 30 cm 0 cm in the lower section the overall transformation rate of all three contaminants were still kept at a lower level during the early period the average transformation rate of fe2 was approximately identical to that in the middle section the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 respectively decreased by 19 and 11 compared to that in the middle section the transformation rate of fe2 in the lower section increased continuously from 15 to 59 in the initial 6 days while do content in lower section was consumed to some extent in the early period during the middle and late periods as the concentration of fe2 and mn2 recovered in the lower section their transformation rate declined to below 0 simultaneously which could be another evidence for the reduction process of fe2 and mn2 there was a significant discrepancy in the transformation rate of fe2 and mn2 during day 22 34 averaging 107 and 28 respectively indicating that the content of iron and manganese minerals in aquifer medium may have resulted in a significant distinction in the reduction intensity between the two contaminants the transformation rate of nh4 in the lower section stabilized at 35 during the late period it is reasonable to assume that the biotransformation of nh4 is dominated by anaerobic processes since chemical conditions such as the average orp 86 mv and the average do 0 61 mg l became unsuitable for nitrification 3 3 microbial community structure analysis of the soil column the distributions of bacteria in the column are correspondingly associated with the biotransformation process of fe2 mn2 and nh4 the microbial community structures at the phylum level and genus level are respectively shown in fig 7 and fig 8 which was published in our previous studies meng et al 2020a actinobacteria some of which had been recognized as mnob tebo et al 2005 was the dominant bacterial phylum in the upper part 80 cm with a relative abundance of 45 except for the upper part the rest of the aquifer medium was dominated by proteobacteria ranging from 54 to 88 proteobacteria is widely distributed in various natural or artificial environments and represents one of the largest bacterial groups ciccarelli et al 2006 it is also found to be a predominant bacterial phylum in anaerobic ammonium oxidizing denitrifying systems yu and mohn 2001 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in 60 40 cm was the greatest throughout the whole column its relative abundance in the upper part was 20 the relative abundance of acidobacteria which is another important bacterial group widely existing in soil and participating to the iron cycle jones et al 2009 was the third highest among the bacterial phyla firmicutes existed primarily in the middle and lower parts 60 20 cm some of which having been identified as mnob tebo et al 2004 yang et al 2013 moreover some nitrospirae and planctomycetes can participate to the nitrification and denitrification processes saunders et al 2016 yangin gomec et al 2017 were observed at all depths but had relatively low abundance planctomycetes is an important bacterial phylum involved in anammox yangin gomec et al 2017 pseudomonas was the dominant bacteria at the genus level its relative abundance in the column generally decreased from the upper to lower column pseudomonas have been reported to be associated with fe2 and mn2 oxidization while it is also one of the heterotrophic bacteria in ammonia removal sasaki et al 2007 the cumulative abundances of nitrosomonas denitratisoma and nitrospira in the upper middle and lower sections were 4 0 3 0 and 4 0 respectively suggesting that the bacteria at the genus level associated with the biotransformation of ammonium were uniformly distributed throughout the column nitrosomonas and nitrospira are involved in removing ammonium and nitrite in groundwater li et al 2013 nitrosomonas includes a large number of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob widely distributed in sewage and eutrophic water dominates the partial nitrification process nitrosation of nh4 but could be constrained due to the limitation of ph and temperature groeneweg et al 1994 koops and pommerening röser 2001 nitrosomonas was detected in the upper and middle parts of the column which may support the nitrosation process of nh4 nitrospira mainly present in the upper part includes some nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with strong metabolic activity and shows the ability to oxidize no2 in conditions with high ph and low concentrations of do blackburne et al 2007 kouba et al 2017 the appearance of denitratisoma indicated that the denitrification process of no3 may have also occurred the existence of bacteria relevant to the nitrification denitrification process of nh4 in the column was comparatively minor for the cumulative relative abundance of nitrosomonas nitrospira and denitratisoma was merely 11 in total in addition to the appearance of pseudomonas at all depths the relative abundance of bacteria related to the biotransformation of fe2 and mn2 mainly existed in the upper and middle parts of the column arthrobacter whose relative abundance ranged from 0 1 to 7 mainly existed in the upper part of the column and is an aerobic bacterium showing the ability related to the oxidization of fe2 and mn2 gallionella has some typical microaerobic iob that uses fe2 as an energy source for its growth de vet et al 2011 emerson 2009 it existed mainly at 80 cm height with a relative abundance of 5 acinetobacter and bacillus are both aerobic microorganisms some of which involve in the oxidation of fe2 and mn2 hosseinkhani and emtiazi 2011 yang et al 2014 and mainly appear in the middle and upper parts respectively some corynebacterium and klebsiella were also among the mnob barboza et al 2018 bromfield 1955 present in the soil column overall the bacteria related to the biotransformation process of fe2 accumulated mostly at 80 cm 60 cm above the bottom while those of mn2 existed mainly at 80 cm 40 cm the cumulative relative abundances of iob related genera pseudomonas acinetobacter bacillus arthrobacter and gallionella and mnob related genera pseudomonas acinetobacter bacillus arthrobacter corynebacterium and klebsiella both exceeded 80 suggesting that iob and mnob might be more abundantly distributed within the column it was found that the transformation of all three contaminants started to be enhanced in the middle period which may be related to the gradual formation and stabilization of the microbial community structure within the soil column in the middle and late periods in the case of the leaching experiment 4 discussion 4 1 fe2 transformation in different vertical sections in the upper section the relatively drastic decline of fe2 concentration from influent to sp1 as shown in fig 2 indicated the strong transformation processes typically fe2 in water bodies will be oxidized by using do as the electron donor the discrepancy between influent do content and the do content in sp1 reaches an average of 3 13 mg l suggesting that the chemical contact oxidation process of fe2 exists in the upper column aquifer medium in the upper section is mainly silty fine sand with relatively small particle sizes and large specific surface area enriched with functional groups carrying a large number of negative charges this can lead to the adsorption of fe2 mn2 and nh4 our previous research meng et al 2020a analyzed the adsorption kinetics of fe2 mn2 nh4 with aquifer medium collected from the rbf site and the equilibrium adsorbed concentrations were 270 87 and 76 mg kg for fe2 mn2 and nh4 respectively this confirms that the adsorption by aquifer medium plays an important role in the upper section and the adsorption of fe2 by aquifer medium is the strongest among the three contaminants the transformation rate of fe2 begins to decline at around the 8th day indicating its weakened transformation process which may be associated with the depleted do content and the decreasing adsorption intensity of aquifer medium as illustrated in fig 8 the cumulative abundance of iob related genera reaches 49 in the upper section and 31 and 18 in the middle and lower sections respectively indicating the upper section is the primary bio oxidation zone of fe2 in addition to the chemical oxidation of fe2 and adsorption process by aquifer medium the relatively aerobic environment and more abundant distribution of iob related genera in the upper section are most likely to promote the bio oxidation process of fe2 and the rise in transformation rate of fe2 within day 22 25 suggesting the transformation of fe2 including both the abiotic and biotic processes are further enhanced in this period in the middle section the adsorption capacity is restricted with increasing soil particle size ph is also an important factor affecting the adsorption capacity the electrostatic potential of the variable charge surface decreases with increasing ph thus the surface charge becomes increasingly negative and more ions are adsorbed barrow 2010 in accordance with the aquifer lithology of the rbf site aquifer medium in the middle and lower sections is composed mainly of medium and coarse sand ph value in the middle section is lower than that in the upper section during the early period suggesting that the adsorption of fe2 in the middle section has been constrained and causes the difference in the transformation rate between the upper and middle sections during the early period the microbial induced biotransformation of fe2 cannot be ignored under low do conditions below 1 0 mg l katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 the distribution of iob related genera in the middle section is relatively limited its cumulative abundance is reduced by 19 compared with that in the upper section accordingly the biotransformation is not as intense as that of the upper section this is most likely another reason for the overall decline in the transformation rate of fe2 during the whole experiment in addition to the weakened adsorption and chemical oxidation process there is an increase in the transformation rate of fe2 and a decrease in do content during the middle period which could be related to the enhancement of biological oxidation of fe2 as well as the adsorption by fe oh 3 as fe2 can form into fe oh 3 combined with oh and adsorb the three contaminants when ph 7 the activity of aerobic iob related bacteria whose cumulative abundance is reduced to 18 is expected to be significantly inhibited in the unsuitable reducing environment ph 7 orp 0 mv therefore the depletion of do during the initial days is presumed to be mainly attributed to the chemical oxidation of fe2 it proves that the oxidation of fe2 in the lower section is mostly chemical during the middle period the negative transformation rate value of fe2 and mn2 in lower section is closely related to the appearance of microbial mediated reductive dissolution which occurs mainly in the place where orp is below 0 mv the overall chemical environment of the lower section is reduced compared with that of the upper and middle sections with an average orp of 73 897 mv as seen from fig 3 indicating that the microbial mediated reductive dissolution of fe2 and mn2 widely occurred during this period which can also be evidenced by a continuous increase of ph from 6 7 at the 11th day to 7 1 at the 14th day in the lower column the reaction equations of microbial mediated reductive dissolution of fe2 and mn2 tekerlekopoulou et al 2006 are as follows c h 2 4 f e o h 3 8 h 4 f e 2 11 h 2 o c o 2 c h 2 o 2 m n o 2 8 h 2 m n 2 3 h 2 o c o 2 4 2 mn2 transformation in different vertical sections in the upper section the transformation processes of mn2 are kept at a relatively low level during the early period the reason could be related to the fact that the adsorption of mn2 by aquifer medium was 67 7 smaller than that of fe2 meng et al 2020a and the abiotic homogenous oxidation of mn2 is very limited when the ph is between 7 1 and 7 6 tekerlekopoulou et al 2006 as in the upper column the cumulative abundance of mnob related genera in the upper section was 46 the overall increase in the transformation rate of mn2 in the middle period could be consistent with the strengthened biotransformation of mn2 in the upper section some mnob show a better oxidation efficiency when the ph was approximately 7 5 meng et al 2009 toyoda and tebo 2013 while the aerobic environment in the upper section favors the oxidative activity of mnob the newly generated iron and manganese oxides adhering to the surface of aquifer medium had a high specific surface area and a number of negative charges this could enhance the adsorption process for metal ions such as mn2 nelson et al 2002 hou et al 2003 villalobos et al 2005 thus verifying the rise of the mn2 transformation rate during the middle period in the middle section similar to fe2 the lithology and acid basic environment are jointly disadvantageous for the adsorption of mn2 the transformation rate of mn2 generally increased despite the adsorption of mn2 by aquifer medium is inevitably inhibited suggesting the biotransformation process of mn2 are enhanced compared to that in the upper section the cumulative abundance of mnob related genera in the middle section is 35 which is higher than that of iob related genera in this area when the adsorption by aquifer medium is weakened the average transformation rate of mn2 in the middle section is close to that of fe2 as the fe2 concentration decreases to the lowest level within the column further proving that the middle section is the predominant area for the activity of mnob and the weakened oxidation of fe2 and the decreased fe2 concentration might be the reasons for the enhanced biotransformation of mn2 similar to that in the upper section the surface of aquifer medium in the middle section is enriched with an increasing number of iron and manganese oxides therefore a continuous decline in mn2 concentration occurs during the middle period drastic fluctuations in the transformation rate curve of mn2 occurs concurrently which is possibly related to multiple processes such as the reaction of fe2 with manganese oxides and the desorption of mn2 resulting by the reaction between exchangeable mn in the aquifer medium and groundwater since the geochemistry analysis we conducted at the rbf site revealed a high proportion of exchangeable mn among all modes of occurrence of mn element in the lower section the anaerobic environment is generally unsuitable for the growth of aerobic mnob related genera whose cumulative abundance is only 19 and the limitation of the chemical environment caused the weakened transformation rate of mn2 during the early period starting from the middle period similar to fe2 the transformation of mn2 is mainly controlled by reductive dissolution 4 3 nh4 transformation in different vertical sections in the upper section similar to mn2 the adsorption of nh4 by aquifer medium is comparatively weaker than that of fe2 the transformation rate of nh4 is in general higher than that of mn2 in the early period proving its competitiveness for do in the upper oxidation zone is in preference to mn2 in the context of strong fe2 oxidation in the upper section the available do for nitrification can be considered as relatively limited and the nitrification of nh4 would become partial nitrification nitrosation no2 mainly accumulates rather than no3 as illustrated in fig s2 the concentration of no3 in the upper section during the early period is relatively stable with an average of 0 11 mg l while no2 concentration increases by around 30 compared with the influent no2 concentration nitrospira and nitrosomonas which are bacteria associated with nitrification and nitrosation distributed mainly in the upper and middle column could be another evidence for the existing but less intensified nitrification regarding the fluctuating transformation rate of nh4 during the middle period it may be associated with the catalytic effect of iron and manganese oxides on nh4 guo et al 2017 and the increase in fe2 which reduce no3 to nh4 directly ottley et al 1997 in the middle section since the adsorption of nh4 by aquifer medium is inevitably weakened the overall rise in transformation rate of nh4 during the early period similar to that of mn2 is supposed to be related to the enhanced biotransformation of nh4 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is an alternative biological transformation process of nh4 under relatively anaerobic conditions in addition to denitrification anammox uses no2 as the electron acceptor for the oxidation of ammonium kartal et al 2011 xu et al 2021 and is accompanied by decreasing ph the equation of anammox strous et al 1998 van der star et al 2007 is as follows n h 4 n o 2 n 2 2 h 2 o according to the distribution of orps in fig 3 the middle section shows a weak oxidation reduction environment 1 50 mv orp 158 mv while the orp suitable for nitrification occurs between 100 mv and 400 mv indicating that the overall chemical environment is unsuitable for nitrification the theoretical value of δnh4 δno3 δnh4 is the decreased nh4 concentration δno3 is the accumulated no3 concentration should be close to 1 0 if the decline in nh4 is derived from nitrification while it should be close to 8 0 in the case of anammox the calculated δnh4 δno3 in the middle section during the early period is 6 695 and ph decreased from 7 5 to 6 8 concurrently proving that the biotransformation of nh4 in the middle section is dominated by anammox while nitrification still exists to some extent during the middle period the transformation rate of nh4 was generally higher than in the upper section the low fe2 concentration can help promoting the transformation of nh4 the catalytic effect of iron and manganese oxides may have also been applied to nh4 the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the middle period 15 959 is much larger than that during the early period and is even higher than the theoretical value for anammox it incidentally suggests that the denitrification which utilizes the accumulated no3 as an electron acceptor has occurred more intensely especially when the overall chemical environment in the middle section becomes more reducing a decreased transformation rate of nh4 was observed during the late period it indicates that anammox has been weakened since the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the late period is 4 921 there is still a slight accumulation of no2 which increases from an average of 0 03 mg l in the early period to 0 05 mg l in the middle and late periods table s3 suggesting that the incomplete nitrification denitrification process also exists in the middle section proteobacteria are related to the anaerobic biotransformation of nh4 under anaerobic conditions and are mainly distributed in the middle and lower sections planctomycetes associated with anammox process are also detected this corresponds to the strong anammox and denitrification process within the column in the lower section nh4 transformation is kept at a low level researchers found that anaerobic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms are sensitive to the ph environment the suitable ph range of anammox bacteria is 7 5 8 3 while the best ph value is 8 0 a lower or higher ph can both inhibit the anammox reaction van de graaf et al 1996 in the lower section the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the early period is 2 33 while the average ph is 6 8 which indicates a much weakened anammox the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the middle period is 5 247 indicating that the anaerobic biotransformation of nh4 was enhanced during the middle period though it was generally weakened compared to the middle section 4 4 the interplay among transformation processes of fe2 mn2 nh4 in the upper section the adsorption by aquifer medium and the oxidation process play vital roles during the early period the adsorption of fe2 is the strongest among the three ions while the transformation rate of fe2 varies oppositely with that of nh4 and mn2 during the initial days which may suggest that competitivity exists in the adsorption process the oxidation process of the three contaminants is subject to their competition for do in which the oxidation of fe2 was the strongest the biochemical oxidation of nh4 is expected to occur after fe2 due to the difference in their redox potentials du et al 2017 while it was found that low concentration of fe2 and mn2 can promote nitrification of nh4 wang et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 the concentration of fe2 and mn2 in sp1 within 5 10 days were relatively low due to adsorption oxidation and the decreasing influent mn2 concentration which jointly promoted the nitrification process of nh4 and caused a continuous rise in its transformation rate however the overall nitrosation process of nh4 in the upper section is generally inhibited by the competitive effect of fe2 on do the nh4 concentration has also been influenced by the catalytic effect of iron and manganese oxides which may influence the concentrations of fe2 and mn2 as well in addition the composition of mnob was considerably consistent with that of iob except for corynebacterium and klebsiella at the genus level however the average transformation rate of mn2 in the upper section is 57 lower than that of fe2 and the transformation of mn2 appears slightly enhanced with the consumption of fe2 indicating that there is a constraint on the biotransformation of mn2 by the predominant biochemical oxidation process of fe2 in the upper section in the middle section the adsorption of all three contaminants by aquifer medium are inhibited to various extents compared to that of the upper section despite the impeded oxidation of fe2 in the middle section its strong competitiveness for do still ensures the preferential transformation of fe2 among the three contaminants the generation of iron and manganese oxides contributed to the transformation of nh4 and mn2 to different extent the biotransformation of nh4 in the middle section is generally strengthened due to relatively low fe2 concentration while it has been progressively inhibited with the changing chemical environment the middle section could be considered as the main area for mn2 transformation the consuming fe2 concentration and the effect of iron and manganese oxides might be the reasons for the enhanced transformation of mn2 in the middle section fe2 is a suitable reducing agent for manganese oxides thus fe2 could react with manganese oxides in addition to its own transformation process and is disadvantageous for the transformation of mn2 in the lower section the chemical conditions are generally unsuitable for iob mnob and nitrifying bacteria which in turn leads to the inhibition of aerobic bio oxidation of all three contaminants the concentrations of fe2 and mn2 in the lower section and the variation in the transformation rate are primarily influenced by reductive dissolution the effect of anammox in the lower section is constrained by ph conditions to a certain extent and the effect of iron and manganese oxides on the transformation rate of nh4 is rather minor since iron and manganese oxides do not accumulate much under the anaerobic condition of the lower section 5 conclusions in this paper the biogeochemical transformation processes of fe2 mn2 and nh4 and their interplay under coexisting conditions were explored through a column experiment the key transformation process for fe2 was biochemical oxidation while mn2 and nh4 were dominated by bio oxidation the biotransformation processes of the three contaminants exhibited different spatial characteristics the mutual influence among the three contaminants was primarily demonstrated by their competition for do where fe2 oxidation was the dominant process the biotransformation of nh4 and mn2 was usually not favored when fe2 oxidation was intense while the biotransformation could be enhanced when fe2 was less abundant adsorption by aquifer medium and the effect of iron and manganese oxides contributed significantly to the above transformation processes reductive dissolution dominated the variation in fe2 and mn2 in the lower section of the column microbial community analysis demonstrated that pseudomonas arthrobacter gallionella acinetobacter bacillus corynebacterium and klebsiella were among the dominant genera related to iob and mnob where iob related genera were mainly distributed in the upper area 80 cm 60 cm and the middle area 60 cm 40 cm was most abundant with mnob related genera bacteria associated with nh4 were evenly distributed within the column while nitrification relevant nitrospira and nitrosomonas were more abundant in the upper oxidation zone 100 cm 70 cm the results

3971,a dynamic column experiment using aquifer medium collected from a riverbank filtration rbf site in northeast china was conducted to investigate the biogeochemical transformation processes of iron fe2 manganese mn2 ammonium nh4 and their interaction under coexisting conditions in real groundwater water parameters such as contaminant concentrations ph and dissolved oxygen do were determined while microbial analysis for the aquifer medium was performed through 16s rrna sequencing the results revealed that biochemical oxidation reductive dissolution adsorption were among the critical biogeochemical processes involved in the transformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in which biological processes were the core process the transformation rate of fe2 mn2 and nh4 jointly revealed that the competition for do existed throughout their co oxidation process and determined the spatial characteristics of their transformation processes to a certain extent fe2 oxidation and nitrification primarily occurred in the upper oxidation zone 100 cm 70 cm mn2 transformation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox occurred mainly beneath the oxidation zone the predominant area of microbial growth and metabolism was another key factor related to the spatial characteristics of biotransformation the microbial analysis illustrated that pseudomonas arthrobacter gallionella acinetobacter bacillus were among the dominant genera related to iron oxidizing bacteria iob and manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob the iob related genera were distributed mainly at 80 cm 60 cm with a relative abundance of 49 mnob related genera were the most abundant 35 bacteria at 60 cm 40 cm and nitrifying bacteria nitrospira and nitrosomonas mainly existed in the upper part of the 100 cm 70 cm where nitrification occurred the influence of microbial activity by changing chemical environment was manifested through the variation of transformation intensity during the experiment the iron and manganese oxides generated by the bio oxidation of fe2 and mn2 contributed significantly to the transformation of all three contaminants the results may be valuable for understanding the evolution mechanism of groundwater when contaminated simultaneously with fe2 mn2 and nh4 keywords ammonium iron manganese biogeochemical transformation process microbial community 1 introduction contamination caused by ferrous iron fe2 manganese mn2 and ammonium nh4 widely exists in groundwater environment zeng et al 2020 chinese class iii standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 stipulates that the content of fe2 and mn2 should not exceed 0 3 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively however fe2 and mn2 are common exceedance components in groundwater of northern china taking the riverbank filtration rbf sites in northeast china for instance the concentrations of fe2 0 8 9 7 mg l and mn2 0 8 1 4 mg l in groundwater surpass the standard value by 3 34 times and 8 14 times respectively meng et al 2020b meanwhile nh4 contamination has become more significant in recent years wu et al 2021 zuo et al 2018 which inevitably lead to contamination under the coexistence conditions of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in groundwater the migration and transformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in groundwater are subjected to a combination of physical chemical and biological processes podlasek et al 2020 vries et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 where biotransformation under the mediation of microorganisms plays an important role meng et al 2020a the migration and transformation processes of nh4 are relatively complicated affected mainly by adsorption dissolution assimilation chemical oxidation and biotransformation processes such as nitrification denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation under the synergy of various bacteria cai et al 2014 yu et al 2007 the biotransformation processes are also influenced by factors such as chemical conditions and microbial community characteristics he et al 2012 sudarno et al 2011 zhao et al 2016 the transformation of fe2 and mn2 in groundwater is closely related to a series of biogeochemical processes where oxidative precipitation and reductive dissolution regulated by microorganisms are among the critical biogeochemical processes gandy et al 2007 tebo et al 2004 the oxidation of mn2 and nh4 in groundwater is mostly enzymatic reactions dominated by biological oxidation when ph ranges from 6 0 to 8 0 tekerlekopoulou et al 2006 previous studies have shown mutual interaction between fe2 mn2 and nh4 when they coexist in water bodies a study on wastewater treatment suggested that both fe2 and mn2 as chemical components of cells and activators of enzyme activity have a facilitating effect on nitrifying bacteria when each of them is present at low concentrations the facilitating effect of the nitrosation reaction is more significant than that of nitrification wang et al 2003 fe2 at an appropriate concentration can significantly enhance the heterotrophic nitrification process qian et al 2017 and positively influence anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox liu and ni 2015 in the field of water contamination treatment the three contaminants are found in competition for dissolved oxygen do when they coexist in groundwater cheng 2016 guo et al 2017 there are differences in the oxidation reduction potential orp standard for redox reactions of fe2 mn2 and nh4 which determine the strong competitiveness of fe2 for do cai et al 2014 accordingly fe2 was found to be the fastest to oxidize among these contaminants while mn2 was the slowest as a result the oxidation of mn2 tends to become enhanced after fe2 and nh4 are oxidized completely cheng 2016 vandenabeele et al 1995 and the increase in fe2 concentration could limit the oxidation of nh4 and is disadvantageous to its aerobic transformation researchers bruins et al 2015 guo et al 2017 katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 found that fe2 and mn2 can form into oxides through biochemical reactions and have adsorption and catalytic oxidation effects on nh4 however subsequent studies cheng et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 argued that there is no tight correlation between the removal of nh4 in groundwater and the catalytic effect of mn oxides and the transformation of nh4 is instead assumed to be primarily subjected to microbial relevant process overall it is apparent that fe2 and mn2 participate in the nitrogen cycle during the geochemical processes and influence the transformation of nh4 guo et al 2017 luther and popp 2002 our previous work meng et al 2020a demonstrated the impact of flow rate and initial concentration on the transformation of the three contaminants in the rbf system however the transformation mechanisms of fe2 mn2 and nh4 under coexisting conditions in the rbf system especially the interplay among their biotransformation processes in real groundwater are yet well understood in this study a vertical column experiment of fe2 mn2 and nh4 was conducted and the spatiotemporal interplay between the biogeochemical processes of fe2 mn2 and nh4 was analyzed thus formed the transferability of the study on the transformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 in typical contaminated groundwater systems combined with our previous work 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquifer medium the aquifer medium used in the column experiment was collected from 0 to 5 m depth with 1 meter intervals and 5 45 m depth with uneven intervals in three in situ test wells of the rbf site on the south bank of songhua river northeast china meng et al 2020a the groundwater type of the rbf site is mainly phreatic water silty fine sand medium and coarse sand are the primary lithologies of the aquifer with a thickness of approximately 40 50 m and the aquifer is considered unified meng et al 2020a the upper zone of the aquifer is mainly a layer of yellow silty fine sand while the middle and lower zone of the aquifer consists mainly of gray medium and coarse sands the processes of collecting and pretreating the original aquifer medium before filling it into the column are shown in fig s1 2 2 apparatus and approaches 2 2 1 soil column and experiment procedures the vertical column experiment of fe2 mn2 and nh4 was conducted using a transparent polymethyl methacrylate column with a total length of 120 cm and an inner diameter of 10 cm as shown in fig 1 experimental materials were rinsed and repeatedly flushed with deionized water before the experiment to minimize the involvement of microorganisms not associated with the aquifer medium the effective filling length of the aquifer medium was 100 cm and a 5 cm mixture of gravel and quartz sand was filled beneath the aquifer medium to keep the column from clogging the medium was topped with 5 cm of quartz sand above to ensure uniform influent real groundwater and prevent the filled medium from mobilizing and deforming 10 cm was left void at the top of the column five sampling ports with an inner diameter of 12 mm were evenly arranged on the column soil solution samplers were installed in the sampling ports to collect water samples and subsequently determine the concentrations of fe2 mn2 nh4 as well as ph do orp at different depths during the experiment the filled aquifer medium in the column was equally scaled down according to the actual aquifer structure of the rbf site and the geometric ratio of the actual aquifer medium to the column medium was 1 50 the medium was tamped and compacted several times every 5 cm in the column to ensure that the filled medium approximated the natural state of the aquifer medium and prevented stratification after filling the soil column was shaded to restore the actual underground condition and the aquifer medium was saturated with a stable influent rate to meet the material needs of microbial growth and metabolism at the same time to avoid clogging and improve the biological effectiveness water with biological metabolites was released at a stable rate from the outlet at the column bottom real groundwater obtained from the rbf site was used for the leaching experiment and the leaching flow rate was set at 25 l d based on the permeability of the aquifer at the rbf site obtained from previous aquifer tests the groundwater quality parameters are shown in table s1 the soil column was initially saturated with deionized water then real groundwater in the influent water tank was pumped to the top of the column at a constant rate by a peristaltic pump which subsequently began the leaching experiment the water sample was 100 ml with 24 h intervals during the experiment and the experiment was conducted for 34 days 2 2 2 hydrochemical analysis methods the water samples were obtained through vacuum extraction based on the soil solution samplers installed on the column to ensure that the sampling process was not affected by ambient air a centrifuge tube was placed in an anaerobic incubator filled with nitrogen sealed with sealing film and connected to the sampling tube water chemistry analysis was conducted to obtain ion concentrations of nh4 no3 no2 fe2 and mn2 where concentrations of nh4 no3 and no2 were determined by spectrometry perkin elmer lambda 35 usa and concentrations of fe2 and mn2 were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms tokyo japan chemical

distribution characteristics within the soil column and to further reveal the predominant genera during the biotransformation of fe2 mn2 and nh4 five aquifer medium samples were collected from 80 60 40 20 and 0 cm above the bottom after the experiment was finished on day 34 the samples were then stored in sterilized bags in an anaerobic chamber filled with nitrogen and sealed in an airtight

reference to the greengenes database via rdp classifier software v2 11 and the species composition of samples at different taxonomic levels was counted the abundance information in otus of each sample was counted to reveal the composition and spatial distribution of bacterial communities in aquifer medium of different depths 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal distribution and variation pattern of fe2 mn2 and nh4 the concentration of fe2 mn2 nh4 and ph do orp were obtained by water chemistry analysis the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of ion concentrations in the column were plotted in fig 2 which presented the influent and effluent concentration of nh4 fe2 mn2 as well as the ion concentrations of sp1 and sp3 in the early period day 1 10 middle period day 11 22 and late period day 23 34 of the experiment results from certain days are missing from fig 2 due to inadequacy of the data which was caused by the flawed experimental operation the overall variation regularity of ion concentrations in sp1 and sp2 sp3 and sp4 sp5 and effluent were relatively similar thus sp1 sp3 and effluent were selected as the representative points in the upper 100 cm 70 cm middle 70 cm 30 cm and lower 30 cm 0 cm sections of the column respectively in the early period the concentrations of fe2 mn2 nh4 all showed a generally descending pattern from top to bottom of the column fig 2a all three contaminants existed mostly in the upper section during this period the decreasing magnitude of fe2 concentration from influent to sp1 was the greatest among the three contaminants decreased by average 5 52 mg l indicating that a strong transformation of fe2 may have occurred in the upper section the differences in mn2 concentration among the upper middle lower sections throughout the early period were 9 30 smaller than that of the other two contaminants this would indicate that the rather slow mn2 oxidation discovered in the study of contaminant treatment cheng 2016 vandenabeele et al 1995 is also present in the natural rbf system the variation pattern of fe2 and mn2 during day 1 5 showed an obvious distinction from that of nh4 that is while fe2 and mn2 decreased in the upper section this pattern was not evident in the middle and especially in the lower section in contrast the concentration of nh4 presented a slight decline in the middle and lower sections during days 1 5 it can be hypothesized that the nh4 transformation may have occurred in the relatively anaerobic environment and the oxidation and precipitation of fe2 and mn2 occurred mostly in the upper section at this period in the middle period nh4 concentration remained in a decreasing pattern from top to bottom and was still present mainly in the upper section with an average concentration of 1 44 mg l fig 2b the distribution pattern of fe2 and mn2 showed a distinction from the previous period and were both presented mainly in the upper and lower sections fig 2b the average concentration of fe2 in sp3 was 30 53 smaller than that in the other two areas while that of mn2 was smaller by 27 35 the average concentration of mn2 and fe2 in the lower section were 0 27 0 62 mg l higher than that of the previous period suggesting that the reduction of fe2 and mn2 may have occurred and resulted in an obvious increase of both contaminants the decreasing magnitude of fe2 concentration between influent and sp1 remained the largest among the three contaminants while that of mn2 remained the weakest in the late period the distribution pattern of nh4 was still similar to that in the early and middle periods fe2 existed mainly in the lower section with an average concentration of 1 49 mg l and the upper section was still the primary area where the decline in fe2 concentration occurred fig 2c the variation in fe2 concentration throughout the whole column was relatively minor during this period indicating that the transformation and reduction processes of fe2 stabilized mn2 was mainly present in the upper section during the late period the difference in mn2 concentration between the middle and lower sections diminished by 53 compared to the previous period suggesting the reduction of mn2 may have been weakened overall the spatiotemporal distribution and variation pattern of nh4 was relatively consistent throughout the experiment nh4 existed primarily in the upper section and there was no predominant area where the decline in nh4 concentration mainly occurred the upper section was the primary area where the decline in fe2 concentration occurred throughout the experiment the predominant area where the decline in mn2 concentration occurred was the upper and middle sections the increase in fe2 and mn2 concentration associated with the reduction process occurred mainly in the lower section this process only became significant in the middle period 3 2 biogeochemical transformation processes the spatiotemporal distributions of ph do orp during the experiment were plotted by kriging interpolation as shown in fig 3 the transformation rates of nh4 fe2 and mn2 in the upper section middle section lower section were plotted as shown in fig 4 fig 5 fig 6 respectively the transformation rate in the upper section is calculated using concentrations of sp1 relative to the influent concentrations that in the middle section is calculated using concentrations of sp3 relative to concentrations of sp1 and the lower section is calculated in the same analogy 3 2 1 transformation rates in the upper section 100 cm 70 cm during the early period day 1 10 the transformation rate of fe2 in the upper section was far larger than that of mn2 and nh4 and fluctuated between 70 and 85 the transformation rate of nh4 was generally greater than that of mn2 with an average of 22 which coincided with the previous assumption that a predominant fe2 transformation occurred in the upper section and mn2 oxidation was the slowest in real groundwater neglecting the interference of data fluctuation at certain days the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 decreased by approximately 10 22 during the initial days which is opposite to the regularity that the transformation rate of fe2 had increased by 15 concurrently there was a continuous increase from 10 to around 30 in the transformation rate of nh4 from day 5 onwards the transformation rate of fe2 began to decrease at the end of the early period its transformation rate reached a lower value of 66 at the 13th day but from that day onwards the overall transformation rate of fe2 compared to the previous day raised again indicating an enhanced oxidation process of fe2 the transformation rate of mn2 increased considerably from an average of 12 in the early period to an average of 27 in the middle period and continuously increased by 34 since day 15 and reached a peak value of 46 at day 19 the transformation rate of nh4 during the middle period fluctuated drastically without obvious increase suggesting that the nitrification process is influenced by the changing biochemical environment during the late period day 23 34 the transformation rate of fe2 had risen to reach the average transformation rate of 84 during this period the transformation rate curves of fe2 and nh4 both fluctuated and were relatively parallel during the late period suggesting their transformation processes are relatively independent in this period the transformation rate of mn2 during the late period had generally decreased when the ph of the upper section decreased below 7 0 3 2 2 transformation rates in the middle section 70 cm 30 cm in the middle section of the column the average transformation rate of fe2 during the early period was 47 lower than that of the upper section the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 generally increased and were 15 and 22 higher than that of the upper section respectively the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 in the middle section decreased continuously after the initial days when the redox environment became progressively unsuitable for aerobic oxidation of nh4 and mn2 as shown by ph and orp variation in fig 3 during the middle period the average transformation rate of fe2 increased from 32 of the early period to 52 suggesting its transformation was enhanced the average transformation rate of nh4 increased from 27 in the upper section to 52 in the middle section and increased by 15 compared to that during the early period the transformation rate of mn2 showed an increasing trend with fluctuations from 17 on the 13th day to 77 on the 23rd day indicating the enhanced transformation of mn2 in the contemporaneous period during the late period the transformation rate of all three contaminants showed a continuous decline and ph in the middle section had been generally reduced to below 7 therefore the biochemical transformation processes of all three contaminants were inhibited to a considerable extent due to the changed chemical environment 3 2 3 transformation rates in the lower section 30 cm 0 cm in the lower section the overall transformation rate of all three contaminants were still kept at a lower level during the early period the average transformation rate of fe2 was approximately identical to that in the middle section the transformation rate of nh4 and mn2 respectively decreased by 19 and 11 compared to that in the middle section the transformation rate of fe2 in the lower section increased continuously from 15 to 59 in the initial 6 days while do content in lower section was consumed to some extent in the early period during the middle and late periods as the concentration of fe2 and mn2 recovered in the lower section their transformation rate declined to below 0 simultaneously which could be another evidence for the reduction process of fe2 and mn2 there was a significant discrepancy in the transformation rate of fe2 and mn2 during day 22 34 averaging 107 and 28 respectively indicating that the content of iron and manganese minerals in aquifer medium may have resulted in a significant distinction in the reduction intensity between the two contaminants the transformation rate of nh4 in the lower section stabilized at 35 during the late period it is reasonable to assume that the biotransformation of nh4 is dominated by anaerobic processes since chemical conditions such as the average orp 86 mv and the average do 0 61 mg l became unsuitable for nitrification 3 3 microbial community structure analysis of the soil column the distributions of bacteria in the column are correspondingly associated with the biotransformation process of fe2 mn2 and nh4 the microbial community structures at the phylum level and genus level are respectively shown in fig 7 and fig 8 which was published in our previous studies meng et al 2020a actinobacteria some of which had been recognized as mnob tebo et al 2005 was the dominant bacterial phylum in the upper part 80 cm with a relative abundance of 45 except for the upper part the rest of the aquifer medium was dominated by proteobacteria ranging from 54 to 88 proteobacteria is widely distributed in various natural or artificial environments and represents one of the largest bacterial groups ciccarelli et al 2006 it is also found to be a predominant bacterial phylum in anaerobic ammonium oxidizing denitrifying systems yu and mohn 2001 the relative abundance of proteobacteria in 60 40 cm was the greatest throughout the whole column its relative abundance in the upper part was 20 the relative abundance of acidobacteria which is another important bacterial group widely existing in soil and participating to the iron cycle jones et al 2009 was the third highest among the bacterial phyla firmicutes existed primarily in the middle and lower parts 60 20 cm some of which having been identified as mnob tebo et al 2004 yang et al 2013 moreover some nitrospirae and planctomycetes can participate to the nitrification and denitrification processes saunders et al 2016 yangin gomec et al 2017 were observed at all depths but had relatively low abundance planctomycetes is an important bacterial phylum involved in anammox yangin gomec et al 2017 pseudomonas was the dominant bacteria at the genus level its relative abundance in the column generally decreased from the upper to lower column pseudomonas have been reported to be associated with fe2 and mn2 oxidization while it is also one of the heterotrophic bacteria in ammonia removal sasaki et al 2007 the cumulative abundances of nitrosomonas denitratisoma and nitrospira in the upper middle and lower sections were 4 0 3 0 and 4 0 respectively suggesting that the bacteria at the genus level associated with the biotransformation of ammonium were uniformly distributed throughout the column nitrosomonas and nitrospira are involved in removing ammonium and nitrite in groundwater li et al 2013 nitrosomonas includes a large number of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob widely distributed in sewage and eutrophic water dominates the partial nitrification process nitrosation of nh4 but could be constrained due to the limitation of ph and temperature groeneweg et al 1994 koops and pommerening röser 2001 nitrosomonas was detected in the upper and middle parts of the column which may support the nitrosation process of nh4 nitrospira mainly present in the upper part includes some nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with strong metabolic activity and shows the ability to oxidize no2 in conditions with high ph and low concentrations of do blackburne et al 2007 kouba et al 2017 the appearance of denitratisoma indicated that the denitrification process of no3 may have also occurred the existence of bacteria relevant to the nitrification denitrification process of nh4 in the column was comparatively minor for the cumulative relative abundance of nitrosomonas nitrospira and denitratisoma was merely 11 in total in addition to the appearance of pseudomonas at all depths the relative abundance of bacteria related to the biotransformation of fe2 and mn2 mainly existed in the upper and middle parts of the column arthrobacter whose relative abundance ranged from 0 1 to 7 mainly existed in the upper part of the column and is an aerobic bacterium showing the ability related to the oxidization of fe2 and mn2 gallionella has some typical microaerobic iob that uses fe2 as an energy source for its growth de vet et al 2011 emerson 2009 it existed mainly at 80 cm height with a relative abundance of 5 acinetobacter and bacillus are both aerobic microorganisms some of which involve in the oxidation of fe2 and mn2 hosseinkhani and emtiazi 2011 yang et al 2014 and mainly appear in the middle and upper parts respectively some corynebacterium and klebsiella were also among the mnob barboza et al 2018 bromfield 1955 present in the soil column overall the bacteria related to the biotransformation process of fe2 accumulated mostly at 80 cm 60 cm above the bottom while those of mn2 existed mainly at 80 cm 40 cm the cumulative relative abundances of iob related genera pseudomonas acinetobacter bacillus arthrobacter and gallionella and mnob related genera pseudomonas acinetobacter bacillus arthrobacter corynebacterium and klebsiella both exceeded 80 suggesting that iob and mnob might be more abundantly distributed within the column it was found that the transformation of all three contaminants started to be enhanced in the middle period which may be related to the gradual formation and stabilization of the microbial community structure within the soil column in the middle and late periods in the case of the leaching experiment 4 discussion 4 1 fe2 transformation in different vertical sections in the upper section the relatively drastic decline of fe2 concentration from influent to sp1 as shown in fig 2 indicated the strong transformation processes typically fe2 in water bodies will be oxidized by using do as the electron donor the discrepancy between influent do content and the do content in sp1 reaches an average of 3 13 mg l suggesting that the chemical contact oxidation process of fe2 exists in the upper column aquifer medium in the upper section is mainly silty fine sand with relatively small particle sizes and large specific surface area enriched with functional groups carrying a large number of negative charges this can lead to the adsorption of fe2 mn2 and nh4 our previous research meng et al 2020a analyzed the adsorption kinetics of fe2 mn2 nh4 with aquifer medium collected from the rbf site and the equilibrium adsorbed concentrations were 270 87 and 76 mg kg for fe2 mn2 and nh4 respectively this confirms that the adsorption by aquifer medium plays an important role in the upper section and the adsorption of fe2 by aquifer medium is the strongest among the three contaminants the transformation rate of fe2 begins to decline at around the 8th day indicating its weakened transformation process which may be associated with the depleted do content and the decreasing adsorption intensity of aquifer medium as illustrated in fig 8 the cumulative abundance of iob related genera reaches 49 in the upper section and 31 and 18 in the middle and lower sections respectively indicating the upper section is the primary bio oxidation zone of fe2 in addition to the chemical oxidation of fe2 and adsorption process by aquifer medium the relatively aerobic environment and more abundant distribution of iob related genera in the upper section are most likely to promote the bio oxidation process of fe2 and the rise in transformation rate of fe2 within day 22 25 suggesting the transformation of fe2 including both the abiotic and biotic processes are further enhanced in this period in the middle section the adsorption capacity is restricted with increasing soil particle size ph is also an important factor affecting the adsorption capacity the electrostatic potential of the variable charge surface decreases with increasing ph thus the surface charge becomes increasingly negative and more ions are adsorbed barrow 2010 in accordance with the aquifer lithology of the rbf site aquifer medium in the middle and lower sections is composed mainly of medium and coarse sand ph value in the middle section is lower than that in the upper section during the early period suggesting that the adsorption of fe2 in the middle section has been constrained and causes the difference in the transformation rate between the upper and middle sections during the early period the microbial induced biotransformation of fe2 cannot be ignored under low do conditions below 1 0 mg l katsoyiannis and zouboulis 2004 the distribution of iob related genera in the middle section is relatively limited its cumulative abundance is reduced by 19 compared with that in the upper section accordingly the biotransformation is not as intense as that of the upper section this is most likely another reason for the overall decline in the transformation rate of fe2 during the whole experiment in addition to the weakened adsorption and chemical oxidation process there is an increase in the transformation rate of fe2 and a decrease in do content during the middle period which could be related to the enhancement of biological oxidation of fe2 as well as the adsorption by fe oh 3 as fe2 can form into fe oh 3 combined with oh and adsorb the three contaminants when ph 7 the activity of aerobic iob related bacteria whose cumulative abundance is reduced to 18 is expected to be significantly inhibited in the unsuitable reducing environment ph 7 orp 0 mv therefore the depletion of do during the initial days is presumed to be mainly attributed to the chemical oxidation of fe2 it proves that the oxidation of fe2 in the lower section is mostly chemical during the middle period the negative transformation rate value of fe2 and mn2 in lower section is closely related to the appearance of microbial mediated reductive dissolution which occurs mainly in the place where orp is below 0 mv the overall chemical environment of the lower section is reduced compared with that of the upper and middle sections with an average orp of 73 897 mv as seen from fig 3 indicating that the microbial mediated reductive dissolution of fe2 and mn2 widely occurred during this period which can also be evidenced by a continuous increase of ph from 6 7 at the 11th day to 7 1 at the 14th day in the lower column the reaction equations of microbial mediated reductive dissolution of fe2 and mn2 tekerlekopoulou et al 2006 are as follows c h 2 4 f e o h 3 8 h 4 f e 2 11 h 2 o c o 2 c h 2 o 2 m n o 2 8 h 2 m n 2 3 h 2 o c o 2 4 2 mn2 transformation in different vertical sections in the upper section the transformation processes of mn2 are kept at a relatively low level during the early period the reason could be related to the fact that the adsorption of mn2 by aquifer medium was 67 7 smaller than that of fe2 meng et al 2020a and the abiotic homogenous oxidation of mn2 is very limited when the ph is between 7 1 and 7 6 tekerlekopoulou et al 2006 as in the upper column the cumulative abundance of mnob related genera in the upper section was 46 the overall increase in the transformation rate of mn2 in the middle period could be consistent with the strengthened biotransformation of mn2 in the upper section some mnob show a better oxidation efficiency when the ph was approximately 7 5 meng et al 2009 toyoda and tebo 2013 while the aerobic environment in the upper section favors the oxidative activity of mnob the newly generated iron and manganese oxides adhering to the surface of aquifer medium had a high specific surface area and a number of negative charges this could enhance the adsorption process for metal ions such as mn2 nelson et al 2002 hou et al 2003 villalobos et al 2005 thus verifying the rise of the mn2 transformation rate during the middle period in the middle section similar to fe2 the lithology and acid basic environment are jointly disadvantageous for the adsorption of mn2 the transformation rate of mn2 generally increased despite the adsorption of mn2 by aquifer medium is inevitably inhibited suggesting the biotransformation process of mn2 are enhanced compared to that in the upper section the cumulative abundance of mnob related genera in the middle section is 35 which is higher than that of iob related genera in this area when the adsorption by aquifer medium is weakened the average transformation rate of mn2 in the middle section is close to that of fe2 as the fe2 concentration decreases to the lowest level within the column further proving that the middle section is the predominant area for the activity of mnob and the weakened oxidation of fe2 and the decreased fe2 concentration might be the reasons for the enhanced biotransformation of mn2 similar to that in the upper section the surface of aquifer medium in the middle section is enriched with an increasing number of iron and manganese oxides therefore a continuous decline in mn2 concentration occurs during the middle period drastic fluctuations in the transformation rate curve of mn2 occurs concurrently which is possibly related to multiple processes such as the reaction of fe2 with manganese oxides and the desorption of mn2 resulting by the reaction between exchangeable mn in the aquifer medium and groundwater since the geochemistry analysis we conducted at the rbf site revealed a high proportion of exchangeable mn among all modes of occurrence of mn element in the lower section the anaerobic environment is generally unsuitable for the growth of aerobic mnob related genera whose cumulative abundance is only 19 and the limitation of the chemical environment caused the weakened transformation rate of mn2 during the early period starting from the middle period similar to fe2 the transformation of mn2 is mainly controlled by reductive dissolution 4 3 nh4 transformation in different vertical sections in the upper section similar to mn2 the adsorption of nh4 by aquifer medium is comparatively weaker than that of fe2 the transformation rate of nh4 is in general higher than that of mn2 in the early period proving its competitiveness for do in the upper oxidation zone is in preference to mn2 in the context of strong fe2 oxidation in the upper section the available do for nitrification can be considered as relatively limited and the nitrification of nh4 would become partial nitrification nitrosation no2 mainly accumulates rather than no3 as illustrated in fig s2 the concentration of no3 in the upper section during the early period is relatively stable with an average of 0 11 mg l while no2 concentration increases by around 30 compared with the influent no2 concentration nitrospira and nitrosomonas which are bacteria associated with nitrification and nitrosation distributed mainly in the upper and middle column could be another evidence for the existing but less intensified nitrification regarding the fluctuating transformation rate of nh4 during the middle period it may be associated with the catalytic effect of iron and manganese oxides on nh4 guo et al 2017 and the increase in fe2 which reduce no3 to nh4 directly ottley et al 1997 in the middle section since the adsorption of nh4 by aquifer medium is inevitably weakened the overall rise in transformation rate of nh4 during the early period similar to that of mn2 is supposed to be related to the enhanced biotransformation of nh4 anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is an alternative biological transformation process of nh4 under relatively anaerobic conditions in addition to denitrification anammox uses no2 as the electron acceptor for the oxidation of ammonium kartal et al 2011 xu et al 2021 and is accompanied by decreasing ph the equation of anammox strous et al 1998 van der star et al 2007 is as follows n h 4 n o 2 n 2 2 h 2 o according to the distribution of orps in fig 3 the middle section shows a weak oxidation reduction environment 1 50 mv orp 158 mv while the orp suitable for nitrification occurs between 100 mv and 400 mv indicating that the overall chemical environment is unsuitable for nitrification the theoretical value of δnh4 δno3 δnh4 is the decreased nh4 concentration δno3 is the accumulated no3 concentration should be close to 1 0 if the decline in nh4 is derived from nitrification while it should be close to 8 0 in the case of anammox the calculated δnh4 δno3 in the middle section during the early period is 6 695 and ph decreased from 7 5 to 6 8 concurrently proving that the biotransformation of nh4 in the middle section is dominated by anammox while nitrification still exists to some extent during the middle period the transformation rate of nh4 was generally higher than in the upper section the low fe2 concentration can help promoting the transformation of nh4 the catalytic effect of iron and manganese oxides may have also been applied to nh4 the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the middle period 15 959 is much larger than that during the early period and is even higher than the theoretical value for anammox it incidentally suggests that the denitrification which utilizes the accumulated no3 as an electron acceptor has occurred more intensely especially when the overall chemical environment in the middle section becomes more reducing a decreased transformation rate of nh4 was observed during the late period it indicates that anammox has been weakened since the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the late period is 4 921 there is still a slight accumulation of no2 which increases from an average of 0 03 mg l in the early period to 0 05 mg l in the middle and late periods table s3 suggesting that the incomplete nitrification denitrification process also exists in the middle section proteobacteria are related to the anaerobic biotransformation of nh4 under anaerobic conditions and are mainly distributed in the middle and lower sections planctomycetes associated with anammox process are also detected this corresponds to the strong anammox and denitrification process within the column in the lower section nh4 transformation is kept at a low level researchers found that anaerobic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms are sensitive to the ph environment the suitable ph range of anammox bacteria is 7 5 8 3 while the best ph value is 8 0 a lower or higher ph can both inhibit the anammox reaction van de graaf et al 1996 in the lower section the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the early period is 2 33 while the average ph is 6 8 which indicates a much weakened anammox the calculated δnh4 δno3 during the middle period is 5 247 indicating that the anaerobic biotransformation of nh4 was enhanced during the middle period though it was generally weakened compared to the middle section 4 4 the interplay among transformation processes of fe2 mn2 nh4 in the upper section the adsorption by aquifer medium and the oxidation process play vital roles during the early period the adsorption of fe2 is the strongest among the three ions while the transformation rate of fe2 varies oppositely with that of nh4 and mn2 during the initial days which may suggest that competitivity exists in the adsorption process the oxidation process of the three contaminants is subject to their competition for do in which the oxidation of fe2 was the strongest the biochemical oxidation of nh4 is expected to occur after fe2 due to the difference in their redox potentials du et al 2017 while it was found that low concentration of fe2 and mn2 can promote nitrification of nh4 wang et al 2003 as shown in fig 2 the concentration of fe2 and mn2 in sp1 within 5 10 days were relatively low due to adsorption oxidation and the decreasing influent mn2 concentration which jointly promoted the nitrification process of nh4 and caused a continuous rise in its transformation rate however the overall nitrosation process of nh4 in the upper section is generally inhibited by the competitive effect of fe2 on do the nh4 concentration has also been influenced by the catalytic effect of iron and manganese oxides which may influence the concentrations of fe2 and mn2 as well in addition the composition of mnob was considerably consistent with that of iob except for corynebacterium and klebsiella at the genus level however the average transformation rate of mn2 in the upper section is 57 lower than that of fe2 and the transformation of mn2 appears slightly enhanced with the consumption of fe2 indicating that there is a constraint on the biotransformation of mn2 by the predominant biochemical oxidation process of fe2 in the upper section in the middle section the adsorption of all three contaminants by aquifer medium are inhibited to various extents compared to that of the upper section despite the impeded oxidation of fe2 in the middle section its strong competitiveness for do still ensures the preferential transformation of fe2 among the three contaminants the generation of iron and manganese oxides contributed to the transformation of nh4 and mn2 to different extent the biotransformation of nh4 in the middle section is generally strengthened due to relatively low fe2 concentration while it has been progressively inhibited with the changing chemical environment the middle section could be considered as the main area for mn2 transformation the consuming fe2 concentration and the effect of iron and manganese oxides might be the reasons for the enhanced transformation of mn2 in the middle section fe2 is a suitable reducing agent for manganese oxides thus fe2 could react with manganese oxides in addition to its own transformation process and is disadvantageous for the transformation of mn2 in the lower section the chemical conditions are generally unsuitable for iob mnob and nitrifying bacteria which in turn leads to the inhibition of aerobic bio oxidation of all three contaminants the concentrations of fe2 and mn2 in the lower section and the variation in the transformation rate are primarily influenced by reductive dissolution the effect of anammox in the lower section is constrained by ph conditions to a certain extent and the effect of iron and manganese oxides on the transformation rate of nh4 is rather minor since iron and manganese oxides do not accumulate much under the anaerobic condition of the lower section 5 conclusions in this paper the biogeochemical transformation processes of fe2 mn2 and nh4 and their interplay under coexisting conditions were explored through a column experiment the key transformation process for fe2 was biochemical oxidation while mn2 and nh4 were dominated by bio oxidation the biotransformation processes of the three contaminants exhibited different spatial characteristics the mutual influence among the three contaminants was primarily demonstrated by their competition for do where fe2 oxidation was the dominant process the biotransformation of nh4 and mn2 was usually not favored when fe2 oxidation was intense while the biotransformation could be enhanced when fe2 was less abundant adsorption by aquifer medium and the effect of iron and manganese oxides contributed significantly to the above transformation processes reductive dissolution dominated the variation in fe2 and mn2 in the lower section of the column microbial community analysis demonstrated that pseudomonas arthrobacter gallionella acinetobacter bacillus corynebacterium and klebsiella were among the dominant genera related to iob and mnob where iob related genera were mainly distributed in the upper area 80 cm 60 cm and the middle area 60 cm 40 cm was most abundant with mnob related genera bacteria associated with nh4 were evenly distributed within the column while nitrification relevant nitrospira and nitrosomonas were more abundant in the upper oxidation zone 100 cm 70 cm the results

3972,quantifying root zone water replenishment β is essential to understanding how root zone water is partitioned and released and the associated residence time of water in earth s critical zone however dynamics of such water replenishments and mean residence time in karst environments remain poorly understood in this study stable isotope compositions of precipitation and plant xylem water were investigated for eight woody plant species growing on two rocky outcrops in a subtropical karst critical zone a new method was proposed for estimating mean residence time of root zone water with a consideration of precipitation replenishment the results show that all these species had seasonal water sources during the growing seasons reflecting by seasonal variations in isotopic compositions of stem xylem water and β rapid increases in β were generally found for most species during the early wet season the high values of β 80 appeared frequently during the main growing seasons accompanied with frequent precipitation events indicating that precipitation frequency is particularly important for these plants growing on the outcrops meanwhile precipitation was likely to bypass the root zone β 0 after several high replenishment events which suggests that not all precipitation events evenly contribute to root zone water in addition mean residence time of root zone water varied seasonally and differed among species with a range from 2 to 80 days for most species the differences of mean residence time of root zone water among these species during the main growing seasons may suggest that less competition exists among these species in such rocky outcrops this study provides insights into understanding vegetation response to future changes in precipitation patterns and ecohydrological dynamics of karst ecosystems keywords root zone water stable isotopes residence time water replenishment plant water sources karst 1 introduction root zone water storage is a key factor controlling plants growth and productivity in earth s critical zone systems which also regulates plant transpiration runoff generation and groundwater recharge dralle et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 full understanding of dynamic interactions between ecological and hydrological processes within the root zone requires investigations of how root zone water is replenished and released previous studies have shown that water replenishment in the soil root zone is highly dynamic due to variations in precipitation inputs antecedent soil water and vegetation cover liu et al 2015 mendham et al 2011 xu et al 2019 such water replenishments can vary both in space and time for example water replenishments were heterogeneous within soil pore space brooks et al 2010 mcdonnell et al 2007 which was evidenced by isotopic differences between mobile and less mobile water brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2019 sprenger et al 2019a generally small rainfall events generate a limited replenishment depth in soil which benefits plants with shallow root zones rain water during more frequent and intensive rain events can infiltrate into deeper layers supporting deeper root zone water replenishment liu et al 2015 yang et al 2014 recently xu et al 2019 reported that root zone water was significantly replenished by the very first precipitation events of the wet season and precipitation infiltration in the late wet season contributed little to root zone water in a catchment under a mediterranean climate these findings are valuable for assessing seasonal replenishment of plant water sources and for predicting plant responses to climate change induced shifts in precipitation patterns in addition to water replenishment the residence time of water also called transit time or reflected water age sprenger et al 2019b is an important variable to describe the time that water takes to travel through a hydrological component e g stream or groundwater which reveals information about water release flow pathways and water exchange rate in a hydrological component buzacott et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 most studies have focused on residence time of stream water soil water and groundwater asadollahi et al 2020 benettin et al 2015 bethke and johnson 2008 hu et al 2015 however investigations of residence time for water that is closely associated with plants e g residence time of root zone water root uptake water ages are still limited based on stable isotope method some studies report that water stored in root zone has a very long residence time months to seasons which causes subsequent rain water during the wet season to bypass the root zone brooks et al 2010 luo et al 2019 such bypass flows may lead to the occurrence of the ecohydrological separation recent studies suggest that water ages of root uptake vary from a few hours to many months based on model results brinkmann et al 2018 evaristo et al 2019 sprenger et al 2018 these advances highlight the importance of residence time distribution of root zone water which provides insight into interactions between plants and water as well as timescale of water transport water stored in root zone may consist of different fractions of residence time regulated by the processes of time variable fluxes e g root water uptake evaporation precipitation infiltration in root zone soils fluxes of root water uptake and evaporation do not directly change residence time of root zone water however these processes influence root zone water storage which in turn affects proportion of precipitation replenishment part of root zone water and thus the mean residence time therefore the dominant influencing factor on mean residence time of root zone water is precipitation infiltration processes which decreases the mean residence time of root zone water however owing to the complex and heterogeneous flow processes in the subsurface how precipitation induced replenishment of root zone water will affect mean residence time of root zone water is still poorly understood currently widely used methods for characterizing the distribution of water residence time in critical zones are tracer aided hydrologic models and lamped convolution approaches brinkmann et al 2018 kuppel et al 2018 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 sprenger et al 2018 an important assumption for these methods is that water is well mixed in a hydrological component however for root zone water system such an assumption is not always feasible because there may exist separated water pools in root zone e g mobile water vs immobile water such as the phenomenon of ecohydrological separation first found in brooks study brooks et al 2010 and the follow up studies geris et al 2015 knighton et al 2019 luo et al 2019 mcdonnell 2014 sprenger and allen 2020 although hydrologic modelling can reveal continuous distribution of water residence time at different time scales when it comes to a complex critical zone system such a method itself is faced with the challenge of difficulty in accurately characterizing complex subsurface hydrological processes and model applicability e g karst critical zone for the lamped convolution approach it is quite simple but it only provides a mean residence time of water during a given study period and cannot reveal seasonal variations in mean residence time of a specific hydrologic system therefore a more feasible method should be taken to fill this gap in mean residence time of root zone water karst critical zone is well known as complex rock soil structures and shallow little soil overlying bedrock such environments result in rapid rates of variations in hydrological processes and fluxes dynamic which deeply regulates water availability in plant root zones jiang et al 2020 nie et al 2019 in karst mountains rocky outcrops are typical environments for plant growth which plays an important role in karst forest cover it is important to know when and how water stores in rocky outcrops system and releases for plant use however it is not clear that how the complex rock soil structures and rapid hydrological processes affect the distribution of precipitation and water residence time in root zones this situation limits our understanding of the important role of soil and weathered bedrock in regulating water storage in root zones and also limits a further assessment of hydrological effects of vegetation restoration for example it is unknown that whether vegetation restoration significantly reduces soil water content water conservation effect tong et al 2020 or accelerates transport of subsurface water back to the atmosphere via transpiration water cycle effect these limitations call for a need to investigate root zone water status especially the replenishment and residence time distribution of root zone water determining root zone water replenishment and mean residence time is helpful to describe characteristics of water retention and release in soil and epikarst to understand the temporal origin of water that plants use and to reveal water adaptation mechanism of karst plants and hydrological effects of vegetation restoration in this study investigations were conducted on two representative rocky outcrops on a hillslope in a typical karst catchment of southwest china little to no soil is present on the surface which makes it impossible to obtain soil water samples for isotopic analysis a new method was proposed based on monthly sampling of isotopic compositions of plant xylem water and precipitation according to the assumption that no isotope fractionation exists during root water uptake indicating that isotopic compositions of plant xylem water reflects the integrated isotopic compositions of root zone water it is possible to employ the isotopic compositions of plant xylem water to determine dynamics of root zone water replenishment luo et al 2019 and to estimate mean residence time of root zone water the main objectives of this study are 1 to quantify root zone water replenishment for plants growing on rocky outcrops during the growing season and 2 to estimate the mean residence time of root zone water with a consideration of variations in water replenishment 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located at the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems administrated by the chinese academy of sciences in a typical karst catchment of southwest china 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e this site has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1389 mm which mostly occurs between may and september chen et al 2011 the mean annual air temperature is about 18 5 c about 60 of the hillslopes in this catchment are characterized with shallow soil 10 30 cm on average which are frequently interrupted by the dispersed rocky outcrops tussock and sparse scrublands are the most common vegetation types due to the harshness of the karst environment while trees are usually found on rocky outcrops and nearby soils as well as at the base of hillslopes two representative isolated dolomite outcrops on a south facing slope were selected for investigation fig s1 these two outcrops both have a height of 8 m above the ground covered by dense vegetation that have adapted to rocky habitat the outcrop 1 is about 8 m in length and 12 5 m in width and the outcrop 2 is about 10 m in length and 15 m in width the outcrops have no visible soil on the surface and the rocks are fractured with many visible cracks and fissures which provides physical space for the growth of plant roots eight woody plant species were selected for sampling six on outcrop 1 and five on outcrop 2 including deciduous and semi deciduous tree species and one evergreen shrub table 1 more details of the two outcrops and the sample plants can be found in ding et al 2018 2 2 sampling and isotope analysis water samples from rain events were collected from march 2014 to september 2015 rainfall amount was measured 30 min interval using an automatic weather station installed in the study catchment stem samples from these eight species 3 replicates for each species were collected monthly between april and november 2014 and between march and september 2015 each stem sample was collected from non photosynthetic stem sections of each individual plant the bark was quickly removed before each sample was immediately sealed into glass bottles with parafilm in august 2015 stem samples were taken four times august 1 4 11 and 22 on the outcrop 1 and three times august 1 11 and 22 on the outcrop 2 we failed to obtain stem samples on the outcrop 2 on august 4 but this may not produce much difference between the two outcrops because only one small rainfall 3 6 mm event occurred on august 2 all samples were placed in a cooler with ice then brought to the laboratory for further processing stem xylem water was extracted using a water extraction system based on the cryogenic vacuum distillation method west et al 2006 isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h of xylem water and rain water were analyzed with a liquid water isotope laser spectroscopy instrument model dlt 100 lgr inc at the key laboratory of agro ecological processes in the institute of subtropical agriculture the chinese academy of science δ18o and δ2h values are expressed in delta notation δ as 1 δ 18 o o r δ 2 h r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the 18o 16o and 2h h ratios of the sample and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard respectively the accuracy of the instrument was 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h 2 3 estimating root zone water replenishment the definition of root zone in this study is the area in which the plant s roots are located and the area where roots can effectively extract water for growth for plants on the rocky outcrops most roots distribute in cracks thus root zone water in this study mostly likely comes from water contained in cracks to estimate root zone water replenishment in such rocky environments we assume that precipitation is the main source for root zone water replenishment and that isotopic compositions of plant xylem water represents mean isotopic value of root zone water that plant acquired no isotope fractionation exists during root water uptake and water flow in plant xylem flanagan and ehleringer 1991 thus root zone water replenishment was calculated based on isotopic compositions of xylem water and precipitation using a piecewise isotope balance method as shown in luo et al 2019 and xu et al 2019 the core of this method is to calculate the proportion of root zone water replenished by precipitation between two consecutive sampling events which has been successfully applied to quantify root zone water replenishment in a humid subtropical monsoon climate site luo et al 2019 and a mediterranean climate site xu et al 2019 the replenishment proportion β can be calculated as 2 β δ x i δ x i 1 δ σ p δ x i 1 100 where δx i and δx i 1 are δ2h values of stem xylem water between two consecutive sampling events δσp is the volume weighted mean value of precipitation δ2h between two consecutive samplings β value varies between 0 and 1 more details of the method can be found in luo et al 2019 in addition precipitation amount corresponding isotopic composition may vary a lot between events which may cause some uncertainties for β estimation thus based on the distribution of daily precipitation at the study site different precipitation thresholds 30 mm 40 mm and 50 mm were applied to truncate the volume of precipitation events for calculating δσp then the differences between β values calculated from these thresholds and without any threshold were analyzed for this method evaporation effects on isotopic compositions of the root zone water are assumed to be negligible this is a reasonable assumption in these outcrops covered by dense vegetations under humid monsoon climate note that only precipitation amounts larger than one mm was used to estimate β 2 4 quantifying mean residence time of root zone water generally residence time of root zone water can be estimated from that of soil water within root zone the common way to do this is that soil water is obtained based on several point based soil samples however due to the heterogeneity of soil water and the uncertainty in determining the extent of root zone in the field it is hard to fully reflect water signature of the whole root zone based on limited point based soil water samples furthermore for plants growing on rocky outcrops in this study there is no visible soil and water in root zone is even difficult to obtain thus we do not focus on depth related water replenishment and residence time in the rooting zone instead we aim to quantify mean residence time of the whole root zone water that plants acquired in this context based on the above mentioned assumptions and β estimation section 2 3 we proposed a new method for quantifying the mean residence time of root zone water with the consideration of variations in root zone water replenishment referred to as the piecewise linear mixing residence time model we also assumed that the mean residence time of root zone water is a linear mixture of the residence time of old water and newly replenished water the piecewise linear mixing residence time model is illustrated in eqs 3 and 4 3 t r t i t p t i β t r t i 1 δ t 1 β 4 t p t i t i 1 k t k p k 1 k p k where tr ti 1 and tr ti are mean residence time of root zone water at time steps ti 1 and ti tp ti is residence time of rain replenishment part of root zone water at time steps ti k is the number of precipitation events between time steps ti 1 and ti tk and pk are the occurrence time and precipitation amount of kth precipitation event respectively δt ti ti 1 therefore the higher the proportion of root zone water replenished by precipitation the younger the root zone water that is the shorter the mean residence time of root zone water note that the initial mean residence time of root zone water tr t0 has a great influence on subsequent estimated mean residence time however the tr t0 value is difficult to measure previous studies on water residence time generally assumed the initial mean residence time as zero or lag time of the last precipitation infiltration prior to the study period brinkmann et al 2018 sprenger et al 2018 it is better to give an initial value of tr t0 during the period between the end of dry season and early wet season because β value in root zone will be high during this transition period and the higher the β value is the smaller the effect on subsequent estimated mean residence time is in this study t0 was selected as the end date of precipitation events when the following two conditions were found in march 1 there are at least 5 consecutive days of rain and 2 the cumulative rainfall should be 30 mm then we set tr t0 0 d and the mean residence time at the first sampling date t1 is the time lag between t0 and t1 tr t1 t1 t0 3 results 3 1 isotopic compositions of precipitation and twig water during the study period precipitation amounts were 2316 6 mm 1148 8 mm between march and december 2014 1167 8 mm between january and september 2015 fig 1 which mainly occurred from may to september high precipitation frequency occurred in the wet seasons with a mean frequency of 10 5 times per month the maximum duration of rainless day was 19 d in october 2014 and 16 d in january 2015 respectively the isotopic compositions δ2h and δ18o of precipitation showed an obvious seasonal variability with high values in winter and spring and low values in summer δ2h and δ18o of precipitation varied from 118 9 to 14 7 and from 15 2 to 0 0 respectively stem xylem water δ2h and δ18o for all eight species varied seasonally fig 2 accompanied with changes in that of precipitation indicating seasonal variation in plant water sources δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water had a similar fluctuation among different species as well as the same plants both on outcrop 1 and outcrop 2 fig 2a c 3 2 dynamics of root zone water replenishment fig 3 shows the dynamics of root zone water replenishment for the selected plants during the growing season the β values higher than 100 were rounded to be 100 and those less than zero were rounded to be zero the β values increased from the end of dry season and approximated 100 during the early wet season high replenishment proportion occurred frequently during the wet season and no significant relationship was found between replenishment proportion and precipitation amount data not shown here this indicates that precipitation frequency is more important for these plants growing on the outcrops the seasonal patterns of β for the species with shallow roots cebi didu pahe and pllo were similar between the two years while for those deep rooted species rasi pito steu and saro seasonal variation of β differed between the two years most differences were shown during the period between august and september 2015 with lower β compared with that during the similar period in 2014 this was likely due to high sampling frequency and rainfall bypass from the root zone during these sampling intervals further the same species on different outcrops showed a similar seasonal pattern of root zone water replenishment but to a different degree in response to precipitation inputs fig 3a c this is likely caused by specific rocky habitat in these two outcrops such as difference in crack distribution 3 3 seasonal variations in mean residence time of root zone moisture seasonal variations in mean residence time of root zone water for each species are shown in fig 4 the mean residence time varied from 2 to 116 d during the growing seasons the differences of mean residence time of root zone water among species were small during the early wet season april to may and then became large however the average value of the mean residence time of root zone water during the whole study period was not significantly p 0 5 different between species except for significant difference between saro steu and cebi on the outcrop 1 fig 5 root zone water of saro had an obvious longer residence time than others in late wet season 2014 fig 4 very likely resulting from a lack of precipitation replenishment fig 3f the whole period mean residence time of root zone water for these species varied between 19 and 42 d fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 replenishment dynamics of plant water sources root zone water replenishment increased to about 100 during the early wet season and then kept very high most of the time during the growing seasons fig 3 this is likely due to very little soil and many crevices in such a rocky habitat which limits the capacity of soil water storage and leads to rapid depletion of water via discharge through cracks or evapotranspiration such a low subsurface water storage capacity is consistent with that reported in yang et al 2019 the seasonal pattern of root zone water replenishment in this study is different from that reported in mediterranean catchment brooks et al 2010 xu et al 2019 where the first several precipitation events had highest replenishment proportion of root zone water and became the dominant water sources for plants during the dry season after high replenishment proportion precipitation was likely to bypass the root zone water for these species reflected from zero values of β fig 3 which supports the temporal occurrence of the ecohydrological separation at this site such results are similar with that temporal ecohydrological separation existed in two study sites under subtropical monsoon climate luo et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 the ecohydrological separation phenomena is likely to occur in the area where there are alternative dry and wet seasons such as the mediterranean climate zones brooks et al 2010 tropical montane forest goldsmith et al 2012 temperate snow influenced catchment knighton et al 2019 or in an environment with evident drying and rewetting cycles in root zone soils such as rocky outcrop habitat recently sprenger and allen 2020 have demonstrated that studies on the ecohydrological separation should focus more on heterogeneous infiltration and root uptake processes in their reviews and evaristo et al 2019 have reported that the ecohydrological separation can happen both in space and time nevertheless hydrological connectivity existed most of the time in these outcrops reflected by high replenishment proportion fig 3 which highlights that recent precipitation with high frequency is an important water sources for plants growing on rocky outcrops the importance of recent precipitation for plants has been also reported in karst areas in nie et al 2018 and peng et al 2019 moreover ding et al 2021 found that plants growing on rocky outcrops would be suffered from water stress if there is no precipitation for a long time 135 days plant water uptake depends on root zone water availability and root distribution lobet et al 2014 while replenishment dynamics can reveal changes in plant water sources in this study accurately investigating root distribution of plants growing on outcrops is difficult and not possible however the method used for estimating root zone water replenishment in this study has successfully characterized the responses of root zone water to precipitation inputs numerous studies have reported that depth of plant water uptake varied seasonally e g wet season vs dry season amin et al 2020 dawson and pate 1996 eggemeyer et al 2008 ma and song 2016 the key to understanding such seasonal variations is that how root zone water source changes and recharges both in time and space vertical profile the method used for root zone water replenishment in this study provides a valuable insight into replenishment dynamics of subsurface soil water and how heterogeneous replenishment lead to differences in plant water sources 4 2 seasonal variations in root zone water residence time the mean residence times of root zone water estimated in this study were highly variable ranging from 2 to 116 d for the study species during growing seasons most of them varied from 2 to 80 d fig 4 if we assume that mean residence time of root zone water can reflect water age of transpiration thus we can roughly infer that root uptake water age for most of the species in this study varied between 2 and 80 d such results are similar with that reported in recent studies for example root uptake water age varied between 0 and 149 d and between 0 and 165 d for two temperate tree species in brinkmann et al 2018 and fluctuated from 17 to 62 d for five tropical tree species in evaristo et al 2019 in addition correa et al 2020 found that transpiration flux age varied from hours to 12 days which was the youngest water in a tropical rainforest system these studies suggest that root uptake water age varies across species and climate most of the species had similar average values of the root uptake water ages during the study period fig 5 but saro and steu showed wider range and slightly higher mean values of root uptake water age than others this is probably due to the largest leaves low wood densities and deep roots for these two species table 1 indicating high transpiration and deeper source water long residence time however most species showed difference in mean residence time of root zone water at a given time fig 4 which indicates that these species may have less competition for water acquiring in such outcrop environments in addition to species precipitation inputs water replenishment in root zone have great influences on root uptake water age or root zone water residence time generally high precipitation amount and intensity will cause immediate decrease in mean residence time brinkmann et al 2018 sprenger et al 2016 in this study the estimated mean residence time was closely related to precipitation replenishment root zone water replenishment is not only affected by precipitation amount but also regulated by precipitation frequency at the study site because precipitation frequency to some extent determines how often the root zone is replenished by precipitation although the study area has a humid climate mean annual precipitation 1300 mm water availability is still a key factor controlling vegetation growth and distribution due to limited soil water storage and rapid downward water movements in karst ecosystems furthermore studies have shown that droughts frequently occurred in southwest china during the past decades wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 different species show different resistance to drought for example species with shallow roots is likely to have greater risk of drought stress than deeper rooted species ding et al 2021 the climate induced changes in precipitation patterns will influence mean residence time of root zone water seasonal variations in water residence time in root zone and their differences between species would provide new insights into vegetation responses to climate changes 4 3 evaluation of the used method widely used methods or models brinkmann et al 2018 correa et al 2020 usually assume that water in soils is well mixed and that no isotope fractionation exists during root water uptake the assumption of well mixed water in root zone is rather unrealistic and has been challenged brooks et al 2010 good et al 2015 luo et al 2019 mcdonnell 2014 however the method used in this study has overcome this limitation the estimated mean residence time depends largely on proportion of root zone water replenished by precipitation while the replenishment proportion is directly inferred from isotopic signature of root uptake water xylem water without a consideration of whether the soil water is completely mixed or not despite the advantages above some uncertainties in this study should be noted based on monthly sampling data it is difficult to accurately check the relative contribution of each precipitation events to root zone for a given sampling interval this causes some uncertainties in estimating replenishment proportion which in turn produces uncertainties in mean residence time of newly precipitation inputs e g tp ti and mixed root zone water in this study a volume weighted isotopic composition and precipitation input time were applied eqs 2 and 4 which may be feasible for rocky outcrops as root zone water is easily replenished by precipitation event water due to limited soil water storage meanwhile to check the influence of large precipitation amounts on volume weighted isotopic composition three precipitation thresholds were applied to truncate the volume of precipitation events when estimating β in eq 2 the results show that most β values do not significantly change by using different precipitation thresholds except for some points when replenishment is high fig s2 in the supplementary material changes in β values caused by different thresholds lead to changes in calculated mean residence time with a range from 0 to 17 d 97 of them are less than 10 d table s1 in the supplementary material another uncertainty comes from estimation of the initial mean residence time of root zone water tr t0 but t0 value only affects the mean residence time calculated during the first several sampling intervals when replenishment proportion β was much less than 100 nevertheless the mean ages residence time of root zone water estimated in this study were comparable with that reported for plants in different areas from hours to many months the results in this study provide meaningful insights into ecohydrological processes related to precipitation inputs and rocky environments future work needs to further test this method with high resolution sampling data of stable isotopes which is useful for understanding how plants acquire root zone water and for predicting how changes in precipitation patterns will affect the water sources for plants in karst and other ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study the isotope compositions of twig xylem water for eight woody plant species fluctuated seasonally during the growing seasons indicating a seasonal variation in plant water sources root zone water replenishment β increased to the peak value for most species during the early wet season and β values kept relatively high most of the time this suggests that precipitation frequency is critical for these plants growing on the outcrops as hydrological processes are generally fast in rocky environments meanwhile after some high peak replenishment events precipitation infiltration water bypassed the root zone reflected by β 0 suggesting the temporal occurrence of ecohydrological separation at this study site the proposed method for estimating mean residence time of root zone water performs well in characterizing the seasonal variations in root zone water residence time the results show that the mean residence time of root zone water obviously differed among species most of them varied from 2 to 80 d during the growing seasons the long term average of the root zone water residence time was between 19 and 42 d for these species again such a short residence time of root zone water indicates recent precipitation is an important water source for plants growing on rocky outcrops in short the seasonal variations in root zone water replenishment and mean residence time provide more insights into ecohydrological dynamics of karst ecosystems in terms of the link between soil rock water root water uptake and

3972,quantifying root zone water replenishment β is essential to understanding how root zone water is partitioned and released and the associated residence time of water in earth s critical zone however dynamics of such water replenishments and mean residence time in karst environments remain poorly understood in this study stable isotope compositions of precipitation and plant xylem water were investigated for eight woody plant species growing on two rocky outcrops in a subtropical karst critical zone a new method was proposed for estimating mean residence time of root zone water with a consideration of precipitation replenishment the results show that all these species had seasonal water sources during the growing seasons reflecting by seasonal variations in isotopic compositions of stem xylem water and β rapid increases in β were generally found for most species during the early wet season the high values of β 80 appeared frequently during the main growing seasons accompanied with frequent precipitation events indicating that precipitation frequency is particularly important for these plants growing on the outcrops meanwhile precipitation was likely to bypass the root zone β 0 after several high replenishment events which suggests that not all precipitation events evenly contribute to root zone water in addition mean residence time of root zone water varied seasonally and differed among species with a range from 2 to 80 days for most species the differences of mean residence time of root zone water among these species during the main growing seasons may suggest that less competition exists among these species in such rocky outcrops this study provides insights into understanding vegetation response to future changes in precipitation patterns and ecohydrological dynamics of karst ecosystems keywords root zone water stable isotopes residence time water replenishment plant water sources karst 1 introduction root zone water storage is a key factor controlling plants growth and productivity in earth s critical zone systems which also regulates plant transpiration runoff generation and groundwater recharge dralle et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 full understanding of dynamic interactions between ecological and hydrological processes within the root zone requires investigations of how root zone water is replenished and released previous studies have shown that water replenishment in the soil root zone is highly dynamic due to variations in precipitation inputs antecedent soil water and vegetation cover liu et al 2015 mendham et al 2011 xu et al 2019 such water replenishments can vary both in space and time for example water replenishments were heterogeneous within soil pore space brooks et al 2010 mcdonnell et al 2007 which was evidenced by isotopic differences between mobile and less mobile water brooks et al 2010 evaristo et al 2019 sprenger et al 2019a generally small rainfall events generate a limited replenishment depth in soil which benefits plants with shallow root zones rain water during more frequent and intensive rain events can infiltrate into deeper layers supporting deeper root zone water replenishment liu et al 2015 yang et al 2014 recently xu et al 2019 reported that root zone water was significantly replenished by the very first precipitation events of the wet season and precipitation infiltration in the late wet season contributed little to root zone water in a catchment under a mediterranean climate these findings are valuable for assessing seasonal replenishment of plant water sources and for predicting plant responses to climate change induced shifts in precipitation patterns in addition to water replenishment the residence time of water also called transit time or reflected water age sprenger et al 2019b is an important variable to describe the time that water takes to travel through a hydrological component e g stream or groundwater which reveals information about water release flow pathways and water exchange rate in a hydrological component buzacott et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 most studies have focused on residence time of stream water soil water and groundwater asadollahi et al 2020 benettin et al 2015 bethke and johnson 2008 hu et al 2015 however investigations of residence time for water that is closely associated with plants e g residence time of root zone water root uptake water ages are still limited based on stable isotope method some studies report that water stored in root zone has a very long residence time months to seasons which causes subsequent rain water during the wet season to bypass the root zone brooks et al 2010 luo et al 2019 such bypass flows may lead to the occurrence of the ecohydrological separation recent studies suggest that water ages of root uptake vary from a few hours to many months based on model results brinkmann et al 2018 evaristo et al 2019 sprenger et al 2018 these advances highlight the importance of residence time distribution of root zone water which provides insight into interactions between plants and water as well as timescale of water transport water stored in root zone may consist of different fractions of residence time regulated by the processes of time variable fluxes e g root water uptake evaporation precipitation infiltration in root zone soils fluxes of root water uptake and evaporation do not directly change residence time of root zone water however these processes influence root zone water storage which in turn affects proportion of precipitation replenishment part of root zone water and thus the mean residence time therefore the dominant influencing factor on mean residence time of root zone water is precipitation infiltration processes which decreases the mean residence time of root zone water however owing to the complex and heterogeneous flow processes in the subsurface how precipitation induced replenishment of root zone water will affect mean residence time of root zone water is still poorly understood currently widely used methods for characterizing the distribution of water residence time in critical zones are tracer aided hydrologic models and lamped convolution approaches brinkmann et al 2018 kuppel et al 2018 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 sprenger et al 2018 an important assumption for these methods is that water is well mixed in a hydrological component however for root zone water system such an assumption is not always feasible because there may exist separated water pools in root zone e g mobile water vs immobile water such as the phenomenon of ecohydrological separation first found in brooks study brooks et al 2010 and the follow up studies geris et al 2015 knighton et al 2019 luo et al 2019 mcdonnell 2014 sprenger and allen 2020 although hydrologic modelling can reveal continuous distribution of water residence time at different time scales when it comes to a complex critical zone system such a method itself is faced with the challenge of difficulty in accurately characterizing complex subsurface hydrological processes and model applicability e g karst critical zone for the lamped convolution approach it is quite simple but it only provides a mean residence time of water during a given study period and cannot reveal seasonal variations in mean residence time of a specific hydrologic system therefore a more feasible method should be taken to fill this gap in mean residence time of root zone water karst critical zone is well known as complex rock soil structures and shallow little soil overlying bedrock such environments result in rapid rates of variations in hydrological processes and fluxes dynamic which deeply regulates water availability in plant root zones jiang et al 2020 nie et al 2019 in karst mountains rocky outcrops are typical environments for plant growth which plays an important role in karst forest cover it is important to know when and how water stores in rocky outcrops system and releases for plant use however it is not clear that how the complex rock soil structures and rapid hydrological processes affect the distribution of precipitation and water residence time in root zones this situation limits our understanding of the important role of soil and weathered bedrock in regulating water storage in root zones and also limits a further assessment of hydrological effects of vegetation restoration for example it is unknown that whether vegetation restoration significantly reduces soil water content water conservation effect tong et al 2020 or accelerates transport of subsurface water back to the atmosphere via transpiration water cycle effect these limitations call for a need to investigate root zone water status especially the replenishment and residence time distribution of root zone water determining root zone water replenishment and mean residence time is helpful to describe characteristics of water retention and release in soil and epikarst to understand the temporal origin of water that plants use and to reveal water adaptation mechanism of karst plants and hydrological effects of vegetation restoration in this study investigations were conducted on two representative rocky outcrops on a hillslope in a typical karst catchment of southwest china little to no soil is present on the surface which makes it impossible to obtain soil water samples for isotopic analysis a new method was proposed based on monthly sampling of isotopic compositions of plant xylem water and precipitation according to the assumption that no isotope fractionation exists during root water uptake indicating that isotopic compositions of plant xylem water reflects the integrated isotopic compositions of root zone water it is possible to employ the isotopic compositions of plant xylem water to determine dynamics of root zone water replenishment luo et al 2019 and to estimate mean residence time of root zone water the main objectives of this study are 1 to quantify root zone water replenishment for plants growing on rocky outcrops during the growing season and 2 to estimate the mean residence time of root zone water with a consideration of variations in water replenishment 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located at the huanjiang observation and research station for karst ecosystems administrated by the chinese academy of sciences in a typical karst catchment of southwest china 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e this site has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1389 mm which mostly occurs between may and september chen et al 2011 the mean annual air temperature is about 18 5 c about 60 of the hillslopes in this catchment are characterized with shallow soil 10 30 cm on average which are frequently interrupted by the dispersed rocky outcrops tussock and sparse scrublands are the most common vegetation types due to the harshness of the karst environment while trees are usually found on rocky outcrops and nearby soils as well as at the base of hillslopes two representative isolated dolomite outcrops on a south facing slope were selected for investigation fig s1 these two outcrops both have a height of 8 m above the ground covered by dense vegetation that have adapted to rocky habitat the outcrop 1 is about 8 m in length and 12 5 m in width and the outcrop 2 is about 10 m in length and 15 m in width the outcrops have no visible soil on the surface and the rocks are fractured with many visible cracks and fissures which provides physical space for the growth of plant roots eight woody plant species were selected for sampling six on outcrop 1 and five on outcrop 2 including deciduous and semi deciduous tree species and one evergreen shrub table 1 more details of the two outcrops and the sample plants can be found in ding et al 2018 2 2 sampling and isotope analysis water samples from rain events were collected from march 2014 to september 2015 rainfall amount was measured 30 min interval using an automatic weather station installed in the study catchment stem samples from these eight species 3 replicates for each species were collected monthly between april and november 2014 and between march and september 2015 each stem sample was collected from non photosynthetic stem sections of each individual plant the bark was quickly removed before each sample was immediately sealed into glass bottles with parafilm in august 2015 stem samples were taken four times august 1 4 11 and 22 on the outcrop 1 and three times august 1 11 and 22 on the outcrop 2 we failed to obtain stem samples on the outcrop 2 on august 4 but this may not produce much difference between the two outcrops because only one small rainfall 3 6 mm event occurred on august 2 all samples were placed in a cooler with ice then brought to the laboratory for further processing stem xylem water was extracted using a water extraction system based on the cryogenic vacuum distillation method west et al 2006 isotopic compositions δ18o and δ2h of xylem water and rain water were analyzed with a liquid water isotope laser spectroscopy instrument model dlt 100 lgr inc at the key laboratory of agro ecological processes in the institute of subtropical agriculture the chinese academy of science δ18o and δ2h values are expressed in delta notation δ as 1 δ 18 o o r δ 2 h r s a m p l e r s t a n d a r d 1 1000 where r sample and r standard are the 18o 16o and 2h h ratios of the sample and vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard respectively the accuracy of the instrument was 0 2 for δ18o and 0 6 for δ2h 2 3 estimating root zone water replenishment the definition of root zone in this study is the area in which the plant s roots are located and the area where roots can effectively extract water for growth for plants on the rocky outcrops most roots distribute in cracks thus root zone water in this study mostly likely comes from water contained in cracks to estimate root zone water replenishment in such rocky environments we assume that precipitation is the main source for root zone water replenishment and that isotopic compositions of plant xylem water represents mean isotopic value of root zone water that plant acquired no isotope fractionation exists during root water uptake and water flow in plant xylem flanagan and ehleringer 1991 thus root zone water replenishment was calculated based on isotopic compositions of xylem water and precipitation using a piecewise isotope balance method as shown in luo et al 2019 and xu et al 2019 the core of this method is to calculate the proportion of root zone water replenished by precipitation between two consecutive sampling events which has been successfully applied to quantify root zone water replenishment in a humid subtropical monsoon climate site luo et al 2019 and a mediterranean climate site xu et al 2019 the replenishment proportion β can be calculated as 2 β δ x i δ x i 1 δ σ p δ x i 1 100 where δx i and δx i 1 are δ2h values of stem xylem water between two consecutive sampling events δσp is the volume weighted mean value of precipitation δ2h between two consecutive samplings β value varies between 0 and 1 more details of the method can be found in luo et al 2019 in addition precipitation amount corresponding isotopic composition may vary a lot between events which may cause some uncertainties for β estimation thus based on the distribution of daily precipitation at the study site different precipitation thresholds 30 mm 40 mm and 50 mm were applied to truncate the volume of precipitation events for calculating δσp then the differences between β values calculated from these thresholds and without any threshold were analyzed for this method evaporation effects on isotopic compositions of the root zone water are assumed to be negligible this is a reasonable assumption in these outcrops covered by dense vegetations under humid monsoon climate note that only precipitation amounts larger than one mm was used to estimate β 2 4 quantifying mean residence time of root zone water generally residence time of root zone water can be estimated from that of soil water within root zone the common way to do this is that soil water is obtained based on several point based soil samples however due to the heterogeneity of soil water and the uncertainty in determining the extent of root zone in the field it is hard to fully reflect water signature of the whole root zone based on limited point based soil water samples furthermore for plants growing on rocky outcrops in this study there is no visible soil and water in root zone is even difficult to obtain thus we do not focus on depth related water replenishment and residence time in the rooting zone instead we aim to quantify mean residence time of the whole root zone water that plants acquired in this context based on the above mentioned assumptions and β estimation section 2 3 we proposed a new method for quantifying the mean residence time of root zone water with the consideration of variations in root zone water replenishment referred to as the piecewise linear mixing residence time model we also assumed that the mean residence time of root zone water is a linear mixture of the residence time of old water and newly replenished water the piecewise linear mixing residence time model is illustrated in eqs 3 and 4 3 t r t i t p t i β t r t i 1 δ t 1 β 4 t p t i t i 1 k t k p k 1 k p k where tr ti 1 and tr ti are mean residence time of root zone water at time steps ti 1 and ti tp ti is residence time of rain replenishment part of root zone water at time steps ti k is the number of precipitation events between time steps ti 1 and ti tk and pk are the occurrence time and precipitation amount of kth precipitation event respectively δt ti ti 1 therefore the higher the proportion of root zone water replenished by precipitation the younger the root zone water that is the shorter the mean residence time of root zone water note that the initial mean residence time of root zone water tr t0 has a great influence on subsequent estimated mean residence time however the tr t0 value is difficult to measure previous studies on water residence time generally assumed the initial mean residence time as zero or lag time of the last precipitation infiltration prior to the study period brinkmann et al 2018 sprenger et al 2018 it is better to give an initial value of tr t0 during the period between the end of dry season and early wet season because β value in root zone will be high during this transition period and the higher the β value is the smaller the effect on subsequent estimated mean residence time is in this study t0 was selected as the end date of precipitation events when the following two conditions were found in march 1 there are at least 5 consecutive days of rain and 2 the cumulative rainfall should be 30 mm then we set tr t0 0 d and the mean residence time at the first sampling date t1 is the time lag between t0 and t1 tr t1 t1 t0 3 results 3 1 isotopic compositions of precipitation and twig water during the study period precipitation amounts were 2316 6 mm 1148 8 mm between march and december 2014 1167 8 mm between january and september 2015 fig 1 which mainly occurred from may to september high precipitation frequency occurred in the wet seasons with a mean frequency of 10 5 times per month the maximum duration of rainless day was 19 d in october 2014 and 16 d in january 2015 respectively the isotopic compositions δ2h and δ18o of precipitation showed an obvious seasonal variability with high values in winter and spring and low values in summer δ2h and δ18o of precipitation varied from 118 9 to 14 7 and from 15 2 to 0 0 respectively stem xylem water δ2h and δ18o for all eight species varied seasonally fig 2 accompanied with changes in that of precipitation indicating seasonal variation in plant water sources δ2h and δ18o values of stem xylem water had a similar fluctuation among different species as well as the same plants both on outcrop 1 and outcrop 2 fig 2a c 3 2 dynamics of root zone water replenishment fig 3 shows the dynamics of root zone water replenishment for the selected plants during the growing season the β values higher than 100 were rounded to be 100 and those less than zero were rounded to be zero the β values increased from the end of dry season and approximated 100 during the early wet season high replenishment proportion occurred frequently during the wet season and no significant relationship was found between replenishment proportion and precipitation amount data not shown here this indicates that precipitation frequency is more important for these plants growing on the outcrops the seasonal patterns of β for the species with shallow roots cebi didu pahe and pllo were similar between the two years while for those deep rooted species rasi pito steu and saro seasonal variation of β differed between the two years most differences were shown during the period between august and september 2015 with lower β compared with that during the similar period in 2014 this was likely due to high sampling frequency and rainfall bypass from the root zone during these sampling intervals further the same species on different outcrops showed a similar seasonal pattern of root zone water replenishment but to a different degree in response to precipitation inputs fig 3a c this is likely caused by specific rocky habitat in these two outcrops such as difference in crack distribution 3 3 seasonal variations in mean residence time of root zone moisture seasonal variations in mean residence time of root zone water for each species are shown in fig 4 the mean residence time varied from 2 to 116 d during the growing seasons the differences of mean residence time of root zone water among species were small during the early wet season april to may and then became large however the average value of the mean residence time of root zone water during the whole study period was not significantly p 0 5 different between species except for significant difference between saro steu and cebi on the outcrop 1 fig 5 root zone water of saro had an obvious longer residence time than others in late wet season 2014 fig 4 very likely resulting from a lack of precipitation replenishment fig 3f the whole period mean residence time of root zone water for these species varied between 19 and 42 d fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 replenishment dynamics of plant water sources root zone water replenishment increased to about 100 during the early wet season and then kept very high most of the time during the growing seasons fig 3 this is likely due to very little soil and many crevices in such a rocky habitat which limits the capacity of soil water storage and leads to rapid depletion of water via discharge through cracks or evapotranspiration such a low subsurface water storage capacity is consistent with that reported in yang et al 2019 the seasonal pattern of root zone water replenishment in this study is different from that reported in mediterranean catchment brooks et al 2010 xu et al 2019 where the first several precipitation events had highest replenishment proportion of root zone water and became the dominant water sources for plants during the dry season after high replenishment proportion precipitation was likely to bypass the root zone water for these species reflected from zero values of β fig 3 which supports the temporal occurrence of the ecohydrological separation at this site such results are similar with that temporal ecohydrological separation existed in two study sites under subtropical monsoon climate luo et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 the ecohydrological separation phenomena is likely to occur in the area where there are alternative dry and wet seasons such as the mediterranean climate zones brooks et al 2010 tropical montane forest goldsmith et al 2012 temperate snow influenced catchment knighton et al 2019 or in an environment with evident drying and rewetting cycles in root zone soils such as rocky outcrop habitat recently sprenger and allen 2020 have demonstrated that studies on the ecohydrological separation should focus more on heterogeneous infiltration and root uptake processes in their reviews and evaristo et al 2019 have reported that the ecohydrological separation can happen both in space and time nevertheless hydrological connectivity existed most of the time in these outcrops reflected by high replenishment proportion fig 3 which highlights that recent precipitation with high frequency is an important water sources for plants growing on rocky outcrops the importance of recent precipitation for plants has been also reported in karst areas in nie et al 2018 and peng et al 2019 moreover ding et al 2021 found that plants growing on rocky outcrops would be suffered from water stress if there is no precipitation for a long time 135 days plant water uptake depends on root zone water availability and root distribution lobet et al 2014 while replenishment dynamics can reveal changes in plant water sources in this study accurately investigating root distribution of plants growing on outcrops is difficult and not possible however the method used for estimating root zone water replenishment in this study has successfully characterized the responses of root zone water to precipitation inputs numerous studies have reported that depth of plant water uptake varied seasonally e g wet season vs dry season amin et al 2020 dawson and pate 1996 eggemeyer et al 2008 ma and song 2016 the key to understanding such seasonal variations is that how root zone water source changes and recharges both in time and space vertical profile the method used for root zone water replenishment in this study provides a valuable insight into replenishment dynamics of subsurface soil water and how heterogeneous replenishment lead to differences in plant water sources 4 2 seasonal variations in root zone water residence time the mean residence times of root zone water estimated in this study were highly variable ranging from 2 to 116 d for the study species during growing seasons most of them varied from 2 to 80 d fig 4 if we assume that mean residence time of root zone water can reflect water age of transpiration thus we can roughly infer that root uptake water age for most of the species in this study varied between 2 and 80 d such results are similar with that reported in recent studies for example root uptake water age varied between 0 and 149 d and between 0 and 165 d for two temperate tree species in brinkmann et al 2018 and fluctuated from 17 to 62 d for five tropical tree species in evaristo et al 2019 in addition correa et al 2020 found that transpiration flux age varied from hours to 12 days which was the youngest water in a tropical rainforest system these studies suggest that root uptake water age varies across species and climate most of the species had similar average values of the root uptake water ages during the study period fig 5 but saro and steu showed wider range and slightly higher mean values of root uptake water age than others this is probably due to the largest leaves low wood densities and deep roots for these two species table 1 indicating high transpiration and deeper source water long residence time however most species showed difference in mean residence time of root zone water at a given time fig 4 which indicates that these species may have less competition for water acquiring in such outcrop environments in addition to species precipitation inputs water replenishment in root zone have great influences on root uptake water age or root zone water residence time generally high precipitation amount and intensity will cause immediate decrease in mean residence time brinkmann et al 2018 sprenger et al 2016 in this study the estimated mean residence time was closely related to precipitation replenishment root zone water replenishment is not only affected by precipitation amount but also regulated by precipitation frequency at the study site because precipitation frequency to some extent determines how often the root zone is replenished by precipitation although the study area has a humid climate mean annual precipitation 1300 mm water availability is still a key factor controlling vegetation growth and distribution due to limited soil water storage and rapid downward water movements in karst ecosystems furthermore studies have shown that droughts frequently occurred in southwest china during the past decades wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 different species show different resistance to drought for example species with shallow roots is likely to have greater risk of drought stress than deeper rooted species ding et al 2021 the climate induced changes in precipitation patterns will influence mean residence time of root zone water seasonal variations in water residence time in root zone and their differences between species would provide new insights into vegetation responses to climate changes 4 3 evaluation of the used method widely used methods or models brinkmann et al 2018 correa et al 2020 usually assume that water in soils is well mixed and that no isotope fractionation exists during root water uptake the assumption of well mixed water in root zone is rather unrealistic and has been challenged brooks et al 2010 good et al 2015 luo et al 2019 mcdonnell 2014 however the method used in this study has overcome this limitation the estimated mean residence time depends largely on proportion of root zone water replenished by precipitation while the replenishment proportion is directly inferred from isotopic signature of root uptake water xylem water without a consideration of whether the soil water is completely mixed or not despite the advantages above some uncertainties in this study should be noted based on monthly sampling data it is difficult to accurately check the relative contribution of each precipitation events to root zone for a given sampling interval this causes some uncertainties in estimating replenishment proportion which in turn produces uncertainties in mean residence time of newly precipitation inputs e g tp ti and mixed root zone water in this study a volume weighted isotopic composition and precipitation input time were applied eqs 2 and 4 which may be feasible for rocky outcrops as root zone water is easily replenished by precipitation event water due to limited soil water storage meanwhile to check the influence of large precipitation amounts on volume weighted isotopic composition three precipitation thresholds were applied to truncate the volume of precipitation events when estimating β in eq 2 the results show that most β values do not significantly change by using different precipitation thresholds except for some points when replenishment is high fig s2 in the supplementary material changes in β values caused by different thresholds lead to changes in calculated mean residence time with a range from 0 to 17 d 97 of them are less than 10 d table s1 in the supplementary material another uncertainty comes from estimation of the initial mean residence time of root zone water tr t0 but t0 value only affects the mean residence time calculated during the first several sampling intervals when replenishment proportion β was much less than 100 nevertheless the mean ages residence time of root zone water estimated in this study were comparable with that reported for plants in different areas from hours to many months the results in this study provide meaningful insights into ecohydrological processes related to precipitation inputs and rocky environments future work needs to further test this method with high resolution sampling data of stable isotopes which is useful for understanding how plants acquire root zone water and for predicting how changes in precipitation patterns will affect the water sources for plants in karst and other ecosystems 5 conclusions in this study the isotope compositions of twig xylem water for eight woody plant species fluctuated seasonally during the growing seasons indicating a seasonal variation in plant water sources root zone water replenishment β increased to the peak value for most species during the early wet season and β values kept relatively high most of the time this suggests that precipitation frequency is critical for these plants growing on the outcrops as hydrological processes are generally fast in rocky environments meanwhile after some high peak replenishment events precipitation infiltration water bypassed the root zone reflected by β 0 suggesting the temporal occurrence of ecohydrological separation at this study site the proposed method for estimating mean residence time of root zone water performs well in characterizing the seasonal variations in root zone water residence time the results show that the mean residence time of root zone water obviously differed among species most of them varied from 2 to 80 d during the growing seasons the long term average of the root zone water residence time was between 19 and 42 d for these species again such a short residence time of root zone water indicates recent precipitation is an important water source for plants growing on rocky outcrops in short the seasonal variations in root zone water replenishment and mean residence time provide more insights into ecohydrological dynamics of karst ecosystems in terms of the link between soil rock water root water uptake and precipitation which would be particularly useful for assessing vegetation response to future climate change credit authorship contribution statement zidong luo conceptualization methodology writing

3973,rainfall and sheet flow sf on gentle slopes always appear concurrently however the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on sf resistance are still unclear for gentle slopes in this study two sets of experiments namely upstream inflow with rainfall and upstream inflow only were conducted to investigate the resistance characteristics of sf on a flat and smooth flume with three gentle slopes 3 5 and 7 the experimental results indicated that in the tests with upstream inflow only the darcy weisbach resistance f and manning coefficient n decreased following a power function with increasing flow depth when the reynolds number re was less than 1070 the n and f of the sf in the upstream inflow alone decreased with increasing re following the power function both the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity for the upstream inflow with the rainfall tests the rainfall significantly affected the f and n of the sf in the low re zone re 1070 inflow discharge 0 06 m2 min 1 and flow energy for all inflow with rainfall cases under the conditions of upstream inflow with rainfall both the f and n of the sf decreased with the increase in the ratio between the flow depth and median raindrop diameter h d50 in the power function this result indicated that a deeper flow could dissipate more raindrop energy in addition empirical equations among re hydraulic slope and h d50 were established to predict the n and f of the sf for upstream inflow with rainfall tests this study will be helpful in understanding the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on sf and could provide a scientific basis for improving hydrological and soil erosion models keywords sheet flow rainfall intensity raindrop diameter flow resistance reynolds number 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the most serious ecological and environmental problems globally and approximately 66 6 of the global soil erosion area is affected by water erosion every year ma et al 2021 sheet flow sf formed by rainfall moving along a slope by gravity is the driving force behind soil erosion pan and shangguan 2006 shang et al 2020 understanding the hydraulic characteristics of sf and determining its capacity for sediment detachment and transport on slopes are essential for predicting soil erosion for sf resistance plays an important role in hydrological and erosion modelling and can be represented by the manning coefficient n and darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f abrahams et al 1990 abrahams and li 1998 hessel et al 2003 nicosia et al 2020 shen et al 2021 many studies have shown that the manning coefficient n one of the most important parameters to describe the comprehensive effect of surface roughness on sf zhang et al 2010 shen et al 2021 is closely related to rainfall intensity and flow depth of sf shen et al 2021 found that raindrop impact significantly increased manning s n of sf on a fixed slope surface compared to without raindrop impact li et al 2018 made similar observations in their simulated rainfall and inflow experiments on the other hand as pointed out by chow 1959 manning s n generally increases with increasing flow depth diaz 2005 showed that manning s n of sf is also closely related to the flow depth on vegetated beds in fraga et al 2013 a critical threshold of the flow depth of sf was identified below which manning s n increases significantly with rainfall intensity this effect is much stronger on artificial grass than on concrete surfaces in contrast kamali et al 2018 found that manning s roughness coefficient revealed a weak inverse relation with inflow depth and direct relation with plant cover accurately estimating manning s n of sf is the key to simulating surface runoff and soil erosion processes zhang et al 2010 especially under rainfall conditions however the effects of raindrop size on the n of sf under different flow depth conditions are still not clear especially on gentle slopes with low froude and reynolds number f is also often defined as the total flow resistance of sf li 2009 smith et al 2007 the hydraulic resistance of sf is based on rain resistance form resistance grain resistance etc kim et al 2012 li 2009 papanicolaou et al 2018 roushangar et al 2018 rain resistance is caused by the disturbance of raindrop impact on runoff and its contribution to total resistance depends on the slopes in that different slopes may cause contrasting results shang et al 2020 either a negative contribution wang et al 2019 or a positive contribution li 2009 on steep slopes greater than8 sf has high flow velocity kinetic energy and potential energy so the contribution of raindrops to flow resistance may be negative however on gentle slopes 1 8 the contribution of rain resistance to f is still not clear wen et al 2015 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in addition because the flow resistance reflected momentum exchange which is directly related to turbulent fluctuation the flow resistance of sf is also affected by the reynolds number re shen et al 2021 re is often used as an important parameter to establish relationships with f under rainfall conditions abrahams et al 1994 nearing et al 1997 for example shen and li 1973 established the relations among f re and rainfall intensity when the re was less than 2000 li 2009 also derived a relationship between rainfall resistance and the re nicosia et al 2020 deduced and tested a theoretical flow resistance equation between f and re under rainfall conditions another nonnegligible factor on sf is the combined effect of raindrop size and flow depth guy et al 1987 kinnell 2013 zhang and wang 2017 moss and green 1983 reported the combined effect of raindrop size and flow depth plays an important role in the transport of soil particles and transport rates decreased with increasing water depth but the resistance of the flowing water was not concerned although wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b and tian et al 2017 found that the interaction between raindrop size and flow depth significantly affects soil particles transport on erosion processes the hydraulic parameters are still neglected li et al 2018 showed that the interaction between raindrops and flow depth was important in affecting flow hydraulics flow transport capacity is greatly influenced by the interaction between raindrops and flow depth zhang and wang 2017 flow depth was definitely important in respect to erosion by rain impacted flows kinnell 2021 although previous studies shen et al 2021 found that raindrop impact significantly increased the resistance of rainfall runoff the combined effect of rainfall and flow depth on resistance of sf on gentle slopes remains unclear to date few studies have established a relationship among flow depth raindrop size re and resistance coefficients therefore the objectives of this study are i to investigate the responses of the resistance coefficients of sf on gentle slopes to flow depth under scenarios with and without rainfall conditions and ii to analyse the combined effects of raindrop size and flow depth on the resistance coefficients of sf on gentle slopes the results of this study will be helpful for better understanding the hydrological processes on slopes with the combined effects of raindrop impact and flow depth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the simulated rainfall and inflow scouring experiments were conducted at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau in yangling china the experimental facilities included the flume water supply device rainfall simulator and flow discharge device fig 1 the flume used in the experiments was 6 0 m long 0 25 m wide and 0 3 m deep the adjustable range of the slope angle of the flume was 0 30 to avoid infiltration and soil erosion appels et al 2016 fraga et al 2013 the bed surface of the flume was a smooth and impervious bottom made from polymethyl methacrylate in addition a water container was installed upstream of the flume and to supply a steady inflow to the flume fig 1 a rainfall simulator with downward sprinkler nozzles that were 18 m above the flume was employed to simulate natural rainfall with respect to raindrop size distribution and rainfall kinetic energy lu et al 2016 the uniformity of the simulated rainfall was greater than 85 and the rainfall intensity was accurately controlled in the range of 30 to 350 mm h 1 meanwhile for all the inflow experiments an electromagnetic flowmeter accuracy 0 5 sllde dn32 kaifeng shengling measurement and control instrument co ltd china was used for inflow discharge measurements and control 2 2 experimental design two sets of flume experiments namely upstream inflow alone experiments and upstream inflow with rainfall experiments were applied to investigate the effect of flow depth alone and the combined effect of rainfall and flow depth on the resistance of sf on a smooth flume with three gentle slopes respectively in the upstream inflow alone experiments five unit width inflow discharges 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m2 min 1 and three gentle slope gradients 3 5 and 7 were designed to simulate sf on gentle slopes at different depths table 1 the constant flow discharge in the flume was calibrated by measurement flow discharge at the outlet of flume before testing after the inflow discharge had reached a steady state the flow depth of the sf was measured by a water level needle accuracy 0 1 mm scm60 shandong hengmei electronic technology co ltd at the centre point of each 1 m segment of the flume fig 1c in the upstream inflow with rainfall experiments simulated rainfall events with intensities of 40 60 80 100 and 120 mm h 1 were selected to simulate the natural rainfall intensities of the subhumid climate regions of china similarly flume with unit width inflow discharges with 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 l m2 min 1 and three gentle slope gradients 3 5 and 7 were designed to simulate sf on gentle slopes at the beginning of each test three rain gauges were placed along the flume to calibrate the rainfall intensity the inflow discharge at the outlet of flume was measured three times to verify the stability and the consistency of cases with different experimental conditions when the rainfall and inflow discharge were stable the flow depth was also measured by a water level needle at the centre point of each 1 m segment of the flume fig 1b in the two sets of experiments the water temperature was measured by using a mercurial thermometer accuracy of 0 1 c the flow depth of the entire flume was the average value of six segments in addition the sf flowed uniformly along the flat bottom of the flume for all the cases when the ratio of width to flow depth is greater than 20 the wall effect could be ignored webel and schatzmann 1984 in our study the flow depths of the sf were less than 5 mm table 1 the ratios of width to flow depth were larger than 50 thus the wall effects can be approximately ignored wang et al 2021 shen and li 1973 the rainfall characteristics the diameter and fall velocity of each raindrop in one minute were measured by a laser precipitation monitor lpm thies clima germany for each rainfall intensity tests the measurement of each rainfall took at least ten minutes to obtain optimal raindrop size distribution results one minute rainfall kinetic energy raindrop diameter and number of raindrops were used in the date analyses 2 3 data analysis the rainfall kinetic energy can be calculated by

results 3 1 physical characteristics of rainfall fig 2 shows the physical characteristics for five rainfall intensity the number of raindrops increased with increasing rainfall intensity in a linear equation fig 2a the median diameter d50 and mean volume diameter md of the five rainfall intensities ranged from 0 331 to 0 375 mm and 1 488 to 1 818 mm respectively both of these variables also increased with increasing rainfall intensity in the power equations fig 2b for five rainfall intensity rainfall kinetic energy rate ket was between 79 68 and 462 17 j m 2h 1 fig 2c and still increased with increasing rainfall intensity by following the power equation r2 0 90 3 2 effects of flow depth on the resistance coefficients of sf figs 3 and 4 shows the result is solely based on the inflow alone experiments for analysis the effects of flow depth alone on the resistance coefficients of the sf as shown in fig 3 the two resistance coefficients n and f of the sf ranged in 0 0140 0 0225 and 0 103 0 322 respectively both the n and f of the sf significantly decreased with increasing flow depth by following the power equation p 0 05 this result indicated that the resistance coefficients of the sf were sensitive to the change in flow depth fig 4 plots the variations in re from 360 to 1453 under ten different flow depth conditions fig 4 a shows that when re was 1070 f decreased with increasing re in the power functions if re was greater than 1070 approximately f seemed independent with re these results agree with the general trend in fluid mechanics that f is inversely proportional to re in the laminar flow zone sf may have been located in the laminar zone when the re was 1070 re 1070 may be a critical value for defining laminar sf under without rainfall conditions on gentle slopes when unit width inflow discharge was 0 8 m2 min 1 similarly fig 4 b also shows that n was inversely proportional to re for re 1070 3 3 combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on the resistance characteristics of sf 3 3 1 flow velocity and depth the mean flow velocities of the flume in fig 5 were calculated with reference to the eq 3 fig 5 shows the variations in the average flow velocity with increasing flow depth for all inflow with rainfall tests on three gentle slopes for the 3 slope the mean flow velocity increased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 2 20 3 68 and 4 43 mm but decreased slightly at inflow depths of 2 71 and 3 23 mm for the 5 slope the mean flow velocity increased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 1 93 2 28 3 07 and 3 64 and decreased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 2 60 for the 7 slope the mean flow velocity increased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 1 87 and 2 55 mm and decreased slightly at inflow depths of 2 22 2 90 and 3 24 mm in general the influence of rainfall intensity on mean flow velocity was not significant at different inflow depths for inflow with rainfall cases on gentle slopes with the same rainfall intensity under the combined conditions of rainfall and inflow fig 6 shows the variations in the average flow depth with increasing inflow discharge for the 3 5 and 7 slopes the flow depth increased with increasing rainfall intensity under the same inflow conditions however when the inflow discharge was equal to 0 1 m2 min 1 the flow depth with rainfall was less than the flow depth without rainfall fig 6 this result indicated that rainfall increased the mean flow depth at low flow discharges and flow depths 3 3 2 coefficients n and f as demonstrated in fig 7 under the same rainfall conditions both the n and f of the sf decreased with increasing inflow depth while under all combined conditions of rainfall and inflow the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 7 for the 3 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall were greater than those without rainfall when the flow depth was less than 3 68 mm but smaller when the flow depth was 4 43 mm fig 7 a b for the 5 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall were greater than those without rainfall when the flow depth was 1 93 mm and smaller when the flow depth was 3 64 mm fig 7 c d for the 7 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall were greater than those without rainfall when the flow depth was 1 87 mm and smaller when the flow depth was greater than 1 87 mm fig 7 e f this result indicated that rainfall has different effects on the resistance coefficients of the sf under different flow depths and gentle slope conditions in addition fig 8 shows that the mean unit energy of the water carrying section e increased with increasing flow depth flow discharge and slope gradient in a single inflow which indicated that rainfall could increase the resistance of low energy inflow fig 9 shows the relationship of the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing re in a power function under the combined conditions of different rainfall events and flow depths on gentle slopes the coloured rectangles in fig 9 represent five different groups of the unit width inflow discharges re increased with increasing inflow discharges under inflow with rainfall conditions the variation range of the f and n of the sf under the influence of rainfall was more obvious at low re 1070 this result indicated that the incremental effect of rainfall on the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing re fig 10 shows that when the unit width inflow discharge was 0 08 m2 min 1 the rainfall intensity had high correlation coefficients 0 5 with the f and n of the sf for all the cases this result indicated that the effect of rainfall on the f and n of the sf was more obvious under the conditions of low inflow discharge and re range than those under the other conditions fig 11 shows the variations in the n and f of the sf with the flow depth to median raindrop diameter ratio as shown in fig 11 the f and n of the sf decreased with the increase in the ratio between the flow depth and median raindrop diameter h d50 in the power function for the whole range of re this result indicated that raindrops and flow depth have combined effects on the resistance coefficients of sf the effects of the flow depth were less than three times those of the raindrop diameter fig 11 in addition the n and f of the sf for the whole range of re was positively correlated with rainfall intensity for all inflow with rainfall cases fig 10 therefore good correlation relationships among n f re h d50 and hydraulic slope j were established by the following equations 10 f 30 34 re 0 675 j 0 119 h d 50 0 542 r 2 0 91 n 75 p 0 001 s e 0 061 11 n 0 187 re 0 278 j 0 109 h d 50 0 261 r 2 0 85 n 75 p 0 001 s e 0 035 where n is the number of samples se is the standard error 4 discussion 4 1 effects of flow depth on resistance coefficients of sf the current experimental study demonstrated that the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing flow depth without rainfall fig 3 the results were consistent with the results reported in fu et al 2019 which found similar effects that coefficients n and f decreased with increasing flow depth however fraga et al 2013 reported that for the inflow scouring condition n was almost constant and independent of flow depth on the flat concrete surfaces when the flow depth was greater than 5 mm this difference may be due to the different bed conditions used plexiglass and concrete surfaces as a power function relationship between re and f was obtained in fig 4a sf may be laminar when re is approximately less than 1070 the critical value of re was defined by the point of intersection of the two fitting equations of the f see fig 4a shen and li 1973 and yao 1996 concluded that the sf was laminar when re was approximately equal to 900 on gentle slopes without rainfall the larger threshold of re 1070 in our study may be ascribed to the greater unit inflow discharge and slope gradient determining the laminar zone of sf plays an important role in the study of the influence of rainfall on sf however the threshold of re have limited implications and applications due to the range of the experimental conditions therefore more research is still need to distinguish the threshold of re that defines the sf flow regime on steep slopes 4 2 combined effects of rainfall and flow depth in the current experimental study we observed that rainfall slightly decreased flow velocity but not obviously under the combined conditions of rainfall and flow depth fig 5 this result is not consistent with that in li et al s 2018 study which reported that raindrop impact significantly decreased the flow velocity on gentler slope gradients 2 5 and 7 5 tian et al 2017 found that rainfall decreased flow velocity with lower inflow discharge 18 l min 1 the abovementioned differences may be attributed to the flow velocity was calculated by reference eq 3 in our study which depends entirely on the change of flow depth and total flow discharge when the rainfall intensity increased both the total flow discharge and the flow depth increased fig 6 thus rainfall intensity may have a weak influence on the change of flow velocity the average flow velocity with increasing flow depth for all rainfall test on three gentle slopes fig 5 it is reasonable that the flow velocity increased with increasing inflow discharge on non eroded bed surfaces similar results were reported by polyakov et al 2018 and li et al 2016 compared to the n and f of the sf without rainfall rainfall did increase the n and f of the sf in low flow discharge flow depth and energy and the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity figs 7 and 8 this observation is consistent with the results of tian et al 2017 fraga et al 2013 and li et al 2018 where the combined effects of rainfall and inflow increased the resistance of sf at a lower flow depth because of the low flow energy at the shallow flow depth fig 8 the raindrop impact can easily disrupt the vertical distribution profile of the sf and thus increase the resistance of the flow shen et al 2021 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b kinnell 2012 however wang et al 2019 reported that on steep slopes 15 f decreased with increasing rainfall intensity because the energy of the sf on steep slopes was greater than that on gentle slopes therefore the slope may also influence the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf which still needs further explore for the 3 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall was less than that without rainfall when the flow depth was greater than 3 68 mm while for the 5 and 7 slopes the n and f of the sf with rainfall was less than that without rainfall when the flow depth was greater than 1 93 mm and 1 87 mm respectively see fig 7 with increasing flow depth the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf changed due to the variation in the sf flow regime and energy the effect of rainfall on the resistance of sf is significant at low flow velocities and momentum nicosia et al 2020 at the same time the runoff discharge of base flow increased with increasing rainfall intensity and could also affect the influences of rainfall on the resistance of sf wang et al 2019 shen et al 2021 the influence of raindrops on the resistance of sf is affected by the flow depth liu et al 2019 which is shallow generally only a few millimeters in sf polyakov et al 2018 wang et al 2019 shen et al 2021 raindrops can affect the flow velocity profile of sf and change the resistance characteristics nicosia et al 2020 while flow depth determines how much influence raindrop impacts could have on resistance under the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth conditions both the resistance coefficients n and f increased significantly with rainfall intensity for re was 1070 fig 9 the correlations between rainfall intensity and resistance coefficients were strong when the unit width flow discharge was less than 0 08 m2 min 1 fig 10 this result indicated that the influence of rainfall on sf resistance was obvious in the lower re zone with low flow discharge rainfall affected the resistance variation in the sf but the incremental variation decreased significantly with increasing re fig 9 which is consistent with the findings of tian et al 2017 yoon and wenzel 1971 reported that when re was approximately greater than 1200 the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf can be ignored thus the laminar flow zone of sf appears to be re 1200 shen et al 2021 argued that under rainfall runoff conditions re 800 was approximately for the laminar zone of the sf and that the raindrop effect on the resistance of sf was mainly in the laminar zone for the impermeable surface different flow discharges and energies of rainfall generated runoff and the combination of rainfall and inflow result in different re values for laminar zones in addition due to the limitations of the artificial simulated rainfall apparatus in the experiment rainfall intensities greater than 40 mm h 1 were used in this study rainfall intensities less than 40 mm h 1 are likely to increase resistance only in flow with lower energy and velocity future more detailed study on the flow regime and resistance of the sf for rainfall case is still needed 4 3 n f and h d50 h d50 is used to represent the combined effects of flow depth h and median raindrop diameter d50 the flow depth and raindrop diameter of the sf determine the amount of flow energy in the water erosion process wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b as shown in fig 11 the n and f of the sf decreased with increasing h d50 on gentle slopes this result indicated that the influence of raindrop size on the resistance of sf is closely related to flow depth on gentle slopes pan et al 2016 also proved that the effect of raindrop impacts on resistance of sf decreased with increasing flow depth moreover different flow depths of sf have different responses to raindrop impacts nouhou bako et al 2016 it is generally believed that when the flow depth is deeper than three raindrop diameters the impact force of raindrops is suppressed guy et al 1987 kinnell 2005 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in this study the h d50 was less than 3 for the whole range of re fig 11 thus as the flow depth increased the effect of rainfall on the resistance of sf gradually weakened but was not suppressed the raindrop energy may be partially dispersed by being translated into splash and wave action wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in this study empirical equations among re j and h d50 were established to predict the n and f of the sf on gentle slopes under the combined effects of raindrop diameter and flow depth these equations can help to understand the combined relationship between raindrop size and flow depth for soil erosion and hydrological models however empirical equations have limited implications and applications on erodible bed surfaces and can be further improved in the future meanwhile in the same rainfall process there are many raindrops with different diameters the median raindrop diameter should be an effective raindrop diameter which needs further explore various hydrological and soil erosion models have habitually used n and f as a model parameter value in this study rainfall and flow depth were able to change the coefficients n and f of sf on gentle slopes therefore the effect of rainfall and flow depth should be considered when the model parameter value was selected although this result was obtained by limited experimental data it helps in predicting the flow resistance for hydrologic and soil erosion models the results will help to estimate the resistance coefficients in hillslope hydrology for different flow depth with rainfall conditions on gentle slopes 5 conclusions in this study two series of runoff experiments upstream inflow only and upstream inflow with rainfall were used to investigate the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on the resistance characteristics of sheet flow sf in an impermeable and smooth flume flow depth reynolds number re manning s coefficient n and darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f were analysed in upstream inflow only tests raindrop diameter d50 flow depth flow velocity re and manning s coefficient n and f were analysed in upstream inflow with rainfall tests the experimental results showed that under inflow alone conditions the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing flow depth when the reynolds number re was less than 1070 the f of the sf decreased with increasing re following the power function the laminar zone of the sf was approximately identified as re 1070 when unit width inflow discharge was less than 0 08 m2 min 1 under the inflow alone conditions on three gentle slopes 3 5 and 7 under the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth the effect of rainfall on flow velocity was not significant rainfall increased the resistance of sf at a low flow depth and energy compared with without rainfall tests the variation in slopes may influence the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf because it would affect the flow velocity and energy in this study for the upstream inflow with rainfall tests the effect of rainfall intensity on the resistance of sf was significant mainly within the zone of lower re where the sf had a low flow velocity and energy the additional rainfall could easily change the uniform flow profile of the sf thus leading to changes in resistance the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity under the combined rainfall and flow depth conditions both the f and n of the sf decreased with the increase in the ratio between flow depth and raindrop median diameter h d50 3 based on the analysis of the experimental results empirical equations among the re hydraulic slope raindrop median diameter and flow depth were established to predict the n and f of the sf in upstream inflow with rainfall on gentle slopes these equations can help to understand the combined relationship between raindrop size and flow depth for soil erosion and hydrological models due to the limited of the experimental conditions empirical equations have limited applications under moving bed with erosion conditions and can be further improved in the future the above findings reveal the mechanism of the combination effect of raindrop size and flow depth on sf resistance on gentle slopes a rainfall intensity of 40 mm h 1 may have a significant effect on the resistance at a lower flow depths and slopes which needs further research credit authorship contribution statement enshuai shen conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing

3973,rainfall and sheet flow sf on gentle slopes always appear concurrently however the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on sf resistance are still unclear for gentle slopes in this study two sets of experiments namely upstream inflow with rainfall and upstream inflow only were conducted to investigate the resistance characteristics of sf on a flat and smooth flume with three gentle slopes 3 5 and 7 the experimental results indicated that in the tests with upstream inflow only the darcy weisbach resistance f and manning coefficient n decreased following a power function with increasing flow depth when the reynolds number re was less than 1070 the n and f of the sf in the upstream inflow alone decreased with increasing re following the power function both the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity for the upstream inflow with the rainfall tests the rainfall significantly affected the f and n of the sf in the low re zone re 1070 inflow discharge 0 06 m2 min 1 and flow energy for all inflow with rainfall cases under the conditions of upstream inflow with rainfall both the f and n of the sf decreased with the increase in the ratio between the flow depth and median raindrop diameter h d50 in the power function this result indicated that a deeper flow could dissipate more raindrop energy in addition empirical equations among re hydraulic slope and h d50 were established to predict the n and f of the sf for upstream inflow with rainfall tests this study will be helpful in understanding the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on sf and could provide a scientific basis for improving hydrological and soil erosion models keywords sheet flow rainfall intensity raindrop diameter flow resistance reynolds number 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the most serious ecological and environmental problems globally and approximately 66 6 of the global soil erosion area is affected by water erosion every year ma et al 2021 sheet flow sf formed by rainfall moving along a slope by gravity is the driving force behind soil erosion pan and shangguan 2006 shang et al 2020 understanding the hydraulic characteristics of sf and determining its capacity for sediment detachment and transport on slopes are essential for predicting soil erosion for sf resistance plays an important role in hydrological and erosion modelling and can be represented by the manning coefficient n and darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f abrahams et al 1990 abrahams and li 1998 hessel et al 2003 nicosia et al 2020 shen et al 2021 many studies have shown that the manning coefficient n one of the most important parameters to describe the comprehensive effect of surface roughness on sf zhang et al 2010 shen et al 2021 is closely related to rainfall intensity and flow depth of sf shen et al 2021 found that raindrop impact significantly increased manning s n of sf on a fixed slope surface compared to without raindrop impact li et al 2018 made similar observations in their simulated rainfall and inflow experiments on the other hand as pointed out by chow 1959 manning s n generally increases with increasing flow depth diaz 2005 showed that manning s n of sf is also closely related to the flow depth on vegetated beds in fraga et al 2013 a critical threshold of the flow depth of sf was identified below which manning s n increases significantly with rainfall intensity this effect is much stronger on artificial grass than on concrete surfaces in contrast kamali et al 2018 found that manning s roughness coefficient revealed a weak inverse relation with inflow depth and direct relation with plant cover accurately estimating manning s n of sf is the key to simulating surface runoff and soil erosion processes zhang et al 2010 especially under rainfall conditions however the effects of raindrop size on the n of sf under different flow depth conditions are still not clear especially on gentle slopes with low froude and reynolds number f is also often defined as the total flow resistance of sf li 2009 smith et al 2007 the hydraulic resistance of sf is based on rain resistance form resistance grain resistance etc kim et al 2012 li 2009 papanicolaou et al 2018 roushangar et al 2018 rain resistance is caused by the disturbance of raindrop impact on runoff and its contribution to total resistance depends on the slopes in that different slopes may cause contrasting results shang et al 2020 either a negative contribution wang et al 2019 or a positive contribution li 2009 on steep slopes greater than8 sf has high flow velocity kinetic energy and potential energy so the contribution of raindrops to flow resistance may be negative however on gentle slopes 1 8 the contribution of rain resistance to f is still not clear wen et al 2015 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in addition because the flow resistance reflected momentum exchange which is directly related to turbulent fluctuation the flow resistance of sf is also affected by the reynolds number re shen et al 2021 re is often used as an important parameter to establish relationships with f under rainfall conditions abrahams et al 1994 nearing et al 1997 for example shen and li 1973 established the relations among f re and rainfall intensity when the re was less than 2000 li 2009 also derived a relationship between rainfall resistance and the re nicosia et al 2020 deduced and tested a theoretical flow resistance equation between f and re under rainfall conditions another nonnegligible factor on sf is the combined effect of raindrop size and flow depth guy et al 1987 kinnell 2013 zhang and wang 2017 moss and green 1983 reported the combined effect of raindrop size and flow depth plays an important role in the transport of soil particles and transport rates decreased with increasing water depth but the resistance of the flowing water was not concerned although wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b and tian et al 2017 found that the interaction between raindrop size and flow depth significantly affects soil particles transport on erosion processes the hydraulic parameters are still neglected li et al 2018 showed that the interaction between raindrops and flow depth was important in affecting flow hydraulics flow transport capacity is greatly influenced by the interaction between raindrops and flow depth zhang and wang 2017 flow depth was definitely important in respect to erosion by rain impacted flows kinnell 2021 although previous studies shen et al 2021 found that raindrop impact significantly increased the resistance of rainfall runoff the combined effect of rainfall and flow depth on resistance of sf on gentle slopes remains unclear to date few studies have established a relationship among flow depth raindrop size re and resistance coefficients therefore the objectives of this study are i to investigate the responses of the resistance coefficients of sf on gentle slopes to flow depth under scenarios with and without rainfall conditions and ii to analyse the combined effects of raindrop size and flow depth on the resistance coefficients of sf on gentle slopes the results of this study will be helpful for better understanding the hydrological processes on slopes with the combined effects of raindrop impact and flow depth 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the simulated rainfall and inflow scouring experiments were conducted at the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau in yangling china the experimental facilities included the flume water supply device rainfall simulator and flow discharge device fig 1 the flume used in the experiments was 6 0 m long 0 25 m wide and 0 3 m deep the adjustable range of the slope angle of the flume was 0 30 to avoid infiltration and soil erosion appels et al 2016 fraga et al 2013 the bed surface of the flume was a smooth and impervious bottom made from polymethyl methacrylate in addition a water container was installed upstream of the flume and to supply a steady inflow to the flume fig 1 a rainfall simulator with downward sprinkler nozzles that were 18 m above the flume was employed to simulate natural rainfall with respect to raindrop size distribution and rainfall kinetic energy lu et al 2016 the uniformity of the simulated rainfall was greater than 85 and the rainfall intensity was accurately controlled in the range of 30 to 350 mm h 1 meanwhile for all the inflow experiments an electromagnetic flowmeter accuracy 0 5 sllde dn32 kaifeng shengling measurement and control instrument co ltd china was used for inflow discharge measurements and control 2 2 experimental design two sets of flume experiments namely upstream inflow alone experiments and upstream inflow with rainfall experiments were applied to investigate the effect of flow depth alone and the combined effect of rainfall and flow depth on the resistance of sf on a smooth flume with three gentle slopes respectively in the upstream inflow alone experiments five unit width inflow discharges 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 m2 min 1 and three gentle slope gradients 3 5 and 7 were designed to simulate sf on gentle slopes at different depths table 1 the constant flow discharge in the flume was calibrated by measurement flow discharge at the outlet of flume before testing after the inflow discharge had reached a steady state the flow depth of the sf was measured by a water level needle accuracy 0 1 mm scm60 shandong hengmei electronic technology co ltd at the centre point of each 1 m segment of the flume fig 1c in the upstream inflow with rainfall experiments simulated rainfall events with intensities of 40 60 80 100 and 120 mm h 1 were selected to simulate the natural rainfall intensities of the subhumid climate regions of china similarly flume with unit width inflow discharges with 0 02 0 04 0 06 0 08 and 0 1 l m2 min 1 and three gentle slope gradients 3 5 and 7 were designed to simulate sf on gentle slopes at the beginning of each test three rain gauges were placed along the flume to calibrate the rainfall intensity the inflow discharge at the outlet of flume was measured three times to verify the stability and the consistency of cases with different experimental conditions when the rainfall and inflow discharge were stable the flow depth was also measured by a water level needle at the centre point of each 1 m segment of the flume fig 1b in the two sets of experiments the water temperature was measured by using a mercurial thermometer accuracy of 0 1 c the flow depth of the entire flume was the average value of six segments in addition the sf flowed uniformly along the flat bottom of the flume for all the cases when the ratio of width to flow depth is greater than 20 the wall effect could be ignored webel and schatzmann 1984 in our study the flow depths of the sf were less than 5 mm table 1 the ratios of width to flow depth were larger than 50 thus the wall effects can be approximately ignored wang et al 2021 shen and li 1973 the rainfall characteristics the diameter and fall velocity of each raindrop in one minute were measured by a laser precipitation monitor lpm thies clima germany for each rainfall intensity tests the measurement of each rainfall took at least ten minutes to obtain optimal raindrop size distribution results one minute rainfall kinetic energy raindrop diameter and number of raindrops were used in the date analyses 2 3 data analysis the rainfall kinetic energy can be calculated by

results 3 1 physical characteristics of rainfall fig 2 shows the physical characteristics for five rainfall intensity the number of raindrops increased with increasing rainfall intensity in a linear equation fig 2a the median diameter d50 and mean volume diameter md of the five rainfall intensities ranged from 0 331 to 0 375 mm and 1 488 to 1 818 mm respectively both of these variables also increased with increasing rainfall intensity in the power equations fig 2b for five rainfall intensity rainfall kinetic energy rate ket was between 79 68 and 462 17 j m 2h 1 fig 2c and still increased with increasing rainfall intensity by following the power equation r2 0 90 3 2 effects of flow depth on the resistance coefficients of sf figs 3 and 4 shows the result is solely based on the inflow alone experiments for analysis the effects of flow depth alone on the resistance coefficients of the sf as shown in fig 3 the two resistance coefficients n and f of the sf ranged in 0 0140 0 0225 and 0 103 0 322 respectively both the n and f of the sf significantly decreased with increasing flow depth by following the power equation p 0 05 this result indicated that the resistance coefficients of the sf were sensitive to the change in flow depth fig 4 plots the variations in re from 360 to 1453 under ten different flow depth conditions fig 4 a shows that when re was 1070 f decreased with increasing re in the power functions if re was greater than 1070 approximately f seemed independent with re these results agree with the general trend in fluid mechanics that f is inversely proportional to re in the laminar flow zone sf may have been located in the laminar zone when the re was 1070 re 1070 may be a critical value for defining laminar sf under without rainfall conditions on gentle slopes when unit width inflow discharge was 0 8 m2 min 1 similarly fig 4 b also shows that n was inversely proportional to re for re 1070 3 3 combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on the resistance characteristics of sf 3 3 1 flow velocity and depth the mean flow velocities of the flume in fig 5 were calculated with reference to the eq 3 fig 5 shows the variations in the average flow velocity with increasing flow depth for all inflow with rainfall tests on three gentle slopes for the 3 slope the mean flow velocity increased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 2 20 3 68 and 4 43 mm but decreased slightly at inflow depths of 2 71 and 3 23 mm for the 5 slope the mean flow velocity increased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 1 93 2 28 3 07 and 3 64 and decreased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 2 60 for the 7 slope the mean flow velocity increased slightly with increasing rainfall intensity at inflow depths of 1 87 and 2 55 mm and decreased slightly at inflow depths of 2 22 2 90 and 3 24 mm in general the influence of rainfall intensity on mean flow velocity was not significant at different inflow depths for inflow with rainfall cases on gentle slopes with the same rainfall intensity under the combined conditions of rainfall and inflow fig 6 shows the variations in the average flow depth with increasing inflow discharge for the 3 5 and 7 slopes the flow depth increased with increasing rainfall intensity under the same inflow conditions however when the inflow discharge was equal to 0 1 m2 min 1 the flow depth with rainfall was less than the flow depth without rainfall fig 6 this result indicated that rainfall increased the mean flow depth at low flow discharges and flow depths 3 3 2 coefficients n and f as demonstrated in fig 7 under the same rainfall conditions both the n and f of the sf decreased with increasing inflow depth while under all combined conditions of rainfall and inflow the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity fig 7 for the 3 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall were greater than those without rainfall when the flow depth was less than 3 68 mm but smaller when the flow depth was 4 43 mm fig 7 a b for the 5 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall were greater than those without rainfall when the flow depth was 1 93 mm and smaller when the flow depth was 3 64 mm fig 7 c d for the 7 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall were greater than those without rainfall when the flow depth was 1 87 mm and smaller when the flow depth was greater than 1 87 mm fig 7 e f this result indicated that rainfall has different effects on the resistance coefficients of the sf under different flow depths and gentle slope conditions in addition fig 8 shows that the mean unit energy of the water carrying section e increased with increasing flow depth flow discharge and slope gradient in a single inflow which indicated that rainfall could increase the resistance of low energy inflow fig 9 shows the relationship of the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing re in a power function under the combined conditions of different rainfall events and flow depths on gentle slopes the coloured rectangles in fig 9 represent five different groups of the unit width inflow discharges re increased with increasing inflow discharges under inflow with rainfall conditions the variation range of the f and n of the sf under the influence of rainfall was more obvious at low re 1070 this result indicated that the incremental effect of rainfall on the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing re fig 10 shows that when the unit width inflow discharge was 0 08 m2 min 1 the rainfall intensity had high correlation coefficients 0 5 with the f and n of the sf for all the cases this result indicated that the effect of rainfall on the f and n of the sf was more obvious under the conditions of low inflow discharge and re range than those under the other conditions fig 11 shows the variations in the n and f of the sf with the flow depth to median raindrop diameter ratio as shown in fig 11 the f and n of the sf decreased with the increase in the ratio between the flow depth and median raindrop diameter h d50 in the power function for the whole range of re this result indicated that raindrops and flow depth have combined effects on the resistance coefficients of sf the effects of the flow depth were less than three times those of the raindrop diameter fig 11 in addition the n and f of the sf for the whole range of re was positively correlated with rainfall intensity for all inflow with rainfall cases fig 10 therefore good correlation relationships among n f re h d50 and hydraulic slope j were established by the following equations 10 f 30 34 re 0 675 j 0 119 h d 50 0 542 r 2 0 91 n 75 p 0 001 s e 0 061 11 n 0 187 re 0 278 j 0 109 h d 50 0 261 r 2 0 85 n 75 p 0 001 s e 0 035 where n is the number of samples se is the standard error 4 discussion 4 1 effects of flow depth on resistance coefficients of sf the current experimental study demonstrated that the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing flow depth without rainfall fig 3 the results were consistent with the results reported in fu et al 2019 which found similar effects that coefficients n and f decreased with increasing flow depth however fraga et al 2013 reported that for the inflow scouring condition n was almost constant and independent of flow depth on the flat concrete surfaces when the flow depth was greater than 5 mm this difference may be due to the different bed conditions used plexiglass and concrete surfaces as a power function relationship between re and f was obtained in fig 4a sf may be laminar when re is approximately less than 1070 the critical value of re was defined by the point of intersection of the two fitting equations of the f see fig 4a shen and li 1973 and yao 1996 concluded that the sf was laminar when re was approximately equal to 900 on gentle slopes without rainfall the larger threshold of re 1070 in our study may be ascribed to the greater unit inflow discharge and slope gradient determining the laminar zone of sf plays an important role in the study of the influence of rainfall on sf however the threshold of re have limited implications and applications due to the range of the experimental conditions therefore more research is still need to distinguish the threshold of re that defines the sf flow regime on steep slopes 4 2 combined effects of rainfall and flow depth in the current experimental study we observed that rainfall slightly decreased flow velocity but not obviously under the combined conditions of rainfall and flow depth fig 5 this result is not consistent with that in li et al s 2018 study which reported that raindrop impact significantly decreased the flow velocity on gentler slope gradients 2 5 and 7 5 tian et al 2017 found that rainfall decreased flow velocity with lower inflow discharge 18 l min 1 the abovementioned differences may be attributed to the flow velocity was calculated by reference eq 3 in our study which depends entirely on the change of flow depth and total flow discharge when the rainfall intensity increased both the total flow discharge and the flow depth increased fig 6 thus rainfall intensity may have a weak influence on the change of flow velocity the average flow velocity with increasing flow depth for all rainfall test on three gentle slopes fig 5 it is reasonable that the flow velocity increased with increasing inflow discharge on non eroded bed surfaces similar results were reported by polyakov et al 2018 and li et al 2016 compared to the n and f of the sf without rainfall rainfall did increase the n and f of the sf in low flow discharge flow depth and energy and the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity figs 7 and 8 this observation is consistent with the results of tian et al 2017 fraga et al 2013 and li et al 2018 where the combined effects of rainfall and inflow increased the resistance of sf at a lower flow depth because of the low flow energy at the shallow flow depth fig 8 the raindrop impact can easily disrupt the vertical distribution profile of the sf and thus increase the resistance of the flow shen et al 2021 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b kinnell 2012 however wang et al 2019 reported that on steep slopes 15 f decreased with increasing rainfall intensity because the energy of the sf on steep slopes was greater than that on gentle slopes therefore the slope may also influence the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf which still needs further explore for the 3 slope the n and f of the sf with rainfall was less than that without rainfall when the flow depth was greater than 3 68 mm while for the 5 and 7 slopes the n and f of the sf with rainfall was less than that without rainfall when the flow depth was greater than 1 93 mm and 1 87 mm respectively see fig 7 with increasing flow depth the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf changed due to the variation in the sf flow regime and energy the effect of rainfall on the resistance of sf is significant at low flow velocities and momentum nicosia et al 2020 at the same time the runoff discharge of base flow increased with increasing rainfall intensity and could also affect the influences of rainfall on the resistance of sf wang et al 2019 shen et al 2021 the influence of raindrops on the resistance of sf is affected by the flow depth liu et al 2019 which is shallow generally only a few millimeters in sf polyakov et al 2018 wang et al 2019 shen et al 2021 raindrops can affect the flow velocity profile of sf and change the resistance characteristics nicosia et al 2020 while flow depth determines how much influence raindrop impacts could have on resistance under the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth conditions both the resistance coefficients n and f increased significantly with rainfall intensity for re was 1070 fig 9 the correlations between rainfall intensity and resistance coefficients were strong when the unit width flow discharge was less than 0 08 m2 min 1 fig 10 this result indicated that the influence of rainfall on sf resistance was obvious in the lower re zone with low flow discharge rainfall affected the resistance variation in the sf but the incremental variation decreased significantly with increasing re fig 9 which is consistent with the findings of tian et al 2017 yoon and wenzel 1971 reported that when re was approximately greater than 1200 the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf can be ignored thus the laminar flow zone of sf appears to be re 1200 shen et al 2021 argued that under rainfall runoff conditions re 800 was approximately for the laminar zone of the sf and that the raindrop effect on the resistance of sf was mainly in the laminar zone for the impermeable surface different flow discharges and energies of rainfall generated runoff and the combination of rainfall and inflow result in different re values for laminar zones in addition due to the limitations of the artificial simulated rainfall apparatus in the experiment rainfall intensities greater than 40 mm h 1 were used in this study rainfall intensities less than 40 mm h 1 are likely to increase resistance only in flow with lower energy and velocity future more detailed study on the flow regime and resistance of the sf for rainfall case is still needed 4 3 n f and h d50 h d50 is used to represent the combined effects of flow depth h and median raindrop diameter d50 the flow depth and raindrop diameter of the sf determine the amount of flow energy in the water erosion process wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b as shown in fig 11 the n and f of the sf decreased with increasing h d50 on gentle slopes this result indicated that the influence of raindrop size on the resistance of sf is closely related to flow depth on gentle slopes pan et al 2016 also proved that the effect of raindrop impacts on resistance of sf decreased with increasing flow depth moreover different flow depths of sf have different responses to raindrop impacts nouhou bako et al 2016 it is generally believed that when the flow depth is deeper than three raindrop diameters the impact force of raindrops is suppressed guy et al 1987 kinnell 2005 wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in this study the h d50 was less than 3 for the whole range of re fig 11 thus as the flow depth increased the effect of rainfall on the resistance of sf gradually weakened but was not suppressed the raindrop energy may be partially dispersed by being translated into splash and wave action wang et al 2018a wang et al 2018b in this study empirical equations among re j and h d50 were established to predict the n and f of the sf on gentle slopes under the combined effects of raindrop diameter and flow depth these equations can help to understand the combined relationship between raindrop size and flow depth for soil erosion and hydrological models however empirical equations have limited implications and applications on erodible bed surfaces and can be further improved in the future meanwhile in the same rainfall process there are many raindrops with different diameters the median raindrop diameter should be an effective raindrop diameter which needs further explore various hydrological and soil erosion models have habitually used n and f as a model parameter value in this study rainfall and flow depth were able to change the coefficients n and f of sf on gentle slopes therefore the effect of rainfall and flow depth should be considered when the model parameter value was selected although this result was obtained by limited experimental data it helps in predicting the flow resistance for hydrologic and soil erosion models the results will help to estimate the resistance coefficients in hillslope hydrology for different flow depth with rainfall conditions on gentle slopes 5 conclusions in this study two series of runoff experiments upstream inflow only and upstream inflow with rainfall were used to investigate the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth on the resistance characteristics of sheet flow sf in an impermeable and smooth flume flow depth reynolds number re manning s coefficient n and darcy weisbach resistance coefficient f were analysed in upstream inflow only tests raindrop diameter d50 flow depth flow velocity re and manning s coefficient n and f were analysed in upstream inflow with rainfall tests the experimental results showed that under inflow alone conditions the f and n of the sf decreased with increasing flow depth when the reynolds number re was less than 1070 the f of the sf decreased with increasing re following the power function the laminar zone of the sf was approximately identified as re 1070 when unit width inflow discharge was less than 0 08 m2 min 1 under the inflow alone conditions on three gentle slopes 3 5 and 7 under the combined effects of rainfall and flow depth the effect of rainfall on flow velocity was not significant rainfall increased the resistance of sf at a low flow depth and energy compared with without rainfall tests the variation in slopes may influence the contribution of rainfall to the resistance of sf because it would affect the flow velocity and energy in this study for the upstream inflow with rainfall tests the effect of rainfall intensity on the resistance of sf was significant mainly within the zone of lower re where the sf had a low flow velocity and energy the additional rainfall could easily change the uniform flow profile of the sf thus leading to changes in resistance the n and f of the sf increased with increasing rainfall intensity under the combined rainfall and flow depth conditions both the f and n of the sf decreased with the increase in the ratio between flow depth and raindrop median diameter h d50 3 based on the analysis of the experimental results empirical equations among the re hydraulic slope raindrop median diameter and flow depth were established to predict the n and f of the sf in upstream inflow with rainfall on gentle slopes these equations can help to understand the combined relationship between raindrop size and flow depth for soil erosion and hydrological models due to the limited of the experimental conditions empirical equations have limited applications under moving bed with erosion conditions and can be further improved in the future the above findings reveal the mechanism of the combination effect of raindrop size and flow depth on sf resistance on gentle slopes a rainfall intensity of 40 mm h 1 may have a significant effect on the resistance at a lower flow depths and slopes which needs further research credit authorship contribution statement enshuai shen conceptualization methodology formal analysis investigation writing

3974,the mismatch between natural water availability and demand in dryland regions is overcome by reservoirs of different sizes with the purpose of storing water the increase in population in dryland regions and the consequent growth in water demand expanded the construction of small reservoirs generating in these regions a dense network of reservoirs which increases the complexity of modeling these hydrological systems for dryland watersheds modeling with daily time step the horizontal connectivity of the reservoir network needs careful representation in order to achieve acceptable model performance including cumulative effects of reservoirs however the horizontal connectivity of reservoir networks is often less investigated in large scale catchment models this work presents an innovative way of implementing the dense reservoir network into the widely used eco hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat with detailed representation of large and small reservoirs and an extensive analysis about the cumulative impact of small reservoirs on the horizontal hydrological connectivity for large scale dryland catchments a two fold cross validation was used against streamflow at a catchment outlet and against in catchment reservoir water levels the model daily performance was acceptable despite the input data uncertainty with good reliability for peak flow in wet years for nonflow periods and for the rising limb of the hydrograph the efforts in the parameterization of reservoirs and aggregation of ponds allowed a better analysis of the hydrological processes and their impacts in the catchment the results showed that small reservoirs decreased the streamflow but had a low impact on catchment retention and water losses with 2 of water retention in wet years however the water retention reached 9 in dry years which may worsen periods of water scarcity in the large reservoirs the spatial representation of small reservoirs for a high density network in the swat model and the results of the cumulative impact of small reservoirs may be relevant for a better understanding of hydrology in dryland catchments and can be applied to catchments in similar climatic and socio economic environments keywords swat dryland hydrology pond reservoir hydrological connectivity 1 introduction dryland environments are home to the world s water poorest populations and during recent decades have been subjected to increases in population partial rise in living standards development of irrigated agriculture and new activities especially tourism that have drastically changed water and land use these populations are vulnerable to the adverse consequences of environmental changes and in need of regional hydrological studies for better water resources management and water scarcity risk reduction gutiérrez et al 2014 aghakouchak et al 2015 mallakpour et al 2018 samimi et al 2020 yao et al 2020 to overcome the mismatch between natural water availability and demand dams of different sizes have been built with the purpose of storing large amounts of water during the wet season which may then be used during the dry season and dry years simmers 2003 mamede et al 2012 mady et al 2020 the increase in population in dryland regions and the consequent growth in water demand for human activities expanded the number of large medium and small dams distributed along the catchments mady et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 the federal and state governments of dryland regions have promoted the construction of large reservoirs which mainly serve to provide for the water demand of industries urban regions and large scale irrigation agriculture de araújo and medeiros 2013 additionally small scale reservoirs have been used for a long time mainly in dryland regions as a complement to meet the water demand of small municipalities rural communities and farmers the small sized and seasonal freshwater system play an important role in reducing inequalities for rural populations providing sustainable development for rural communities and farmers due to their reduced cost and availability of many favourable locations the number of small reservoirs has increased in recent decades de araújo and medeiros 2013 berhane et al 2016 yaeger et al 2017 habets et al 2018 the spatial density of small reservoirs varies across different regions with catchments in india with 4 2 reservoirs per km2 northeastern brazil with 0 2 reservoir per km2 and australia with values between 0 15 and 6 1 reservoirs per km2 for example the advances of remote sensing techniques in obtaining important information from satellite images have allowed a better identification of the dimensions and uses of small reservoirs and assessing their global distribution lima neto et al 2011 carluer et al 2016 mady et al 2020 paredes beltran et al 2021 the small reservoirs medium to micro dams are usually built disregarding the potential impact on the water availability of downstream communities this has led to the generation of a chaotic system which is referred to as a high density reservoir network lima neto et al 2011 mamede et al 2012 abouabdillah et al 2014 on the one hand such a reservoir network ensures a more equally distributed use of the water resources among the population of the river basin as it reduces the concentration of water in large downstream reservoirs and enhances an even spatial distribution mamede et al 2012 fowe et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 this has also positive effects such as decreasing sedimentation in the large strategic reservoirs lima neto et al 2011 berg et al 2016 mamede et al 2018 decreasing soil erosion abouabdillah et al 2014 and decreasing the energy demand for pumping nascimento et al 2019 on the other hand as the smaller dams are also designed to maximize storage and the flow in tributaries is rare the spilling frequency of the reservoirs is low increasing hydrological discontinuity de araújo and medeiros 2013 abouabdillah et al 2014 peter et al 2014 the cumulative impact of the small reservoirs on downstream water availability are not simple to estimate because they are not necessarily the sum of individual effects of each small reservoir these reservoirs may be inter dependent and the cumulative effect can be greater or less than the sum of the individual effects depending on their dimensions uses and locations habets et al 2018 however there is evidence that the cumulative impact of the small reservoirs can be considerable as the inflow to the large downstream reservoirs is reduced malveira et al 2012 de araújo and medeiros 2013 fowler et al 2015 some modeling approaches have been developed to assess the effects of small reservoirs in a basin most of them reported a decrease on the annual stream discharge with a wide range from 0 2 to 36 and decreases in low flow and peak flow neal et al 2002 schreider et al 2002 nathan et al 2005 callow and smettem 2009 hughes and mantel 2010 nathan and lowe 2012 fowe et al 2015 ayalew et al 2017 habets et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 most of those models are however based on simple mass balance methods developed for dryland environments thus their application in a scenario of increase in the number of small reservoirs should be done with caution due to specific water use and hydraulic infrastructure patterns moreover despite the importance of the small reservoirs for local needs and their impact on water availability at catchment scale the small reservoirs have been neglected by water authorities providing little technical information about them fowe et al 2015 habets et al 2018 reservoir data scarcity hampers therefore successful hydrological model application to drylands and semi arid environments with high density reservoir networks which already face both poor monitoring of streamflow and extreme precipitation variation from year to year the lack of information on small reservoirs characteristics and the difficulty to estimate cumulative impact is a challenge to assess and to model the hydrology in dryland environments the incorporation of reservoirs in hydrological models was carried out using simplified approaches in several other studies to assess their impact in streamflow in wasa model of water availability in semi arid environments the reservoirs are grouped into size classes according to their storage capacity with reservoirs of a smaller size class located upstream of reservoirs of a higher size class and arranged in a cascade system with only reservoirs of the largest size class regarded explicitly in the model in daily or hourly steps güntner 2002 güntner et al 2004 mamede et al 2018 the tedi tool for estimating dam impacts model also uses as model input the dam size distribution subdivided into classes with computations on a monthly basis tedi assumes that reservoirs are connected in parallel and the excess water spilling from each reservoir is directly routed to the outlet of the catchment disregarding the spatial arrangement of the single reservoirs subsequently the cheat complex hydrological evaluation of the assumptions in tedi tool was developed by nathan et al 2005 and included information on the location of the reservoirs on the river network and the network topology thus differentiating also between sequential and parallel arrangement of single reservoirs nathan and lowe 2012 fowler et al 2015 however the horizontal connectivity of reservoir networks is often less investigated in large scale catchment models the eco hydrological model swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 2012 has been applied worldwide for the simulation of catchments in particular where water extractions and agricultural water management are of major relevance e g uniyal et al 2019 with study areas in india chile vietnam and germany various swat applications regarding the hydrology of dryland areas in china mongolia azerbaijan pakistan tunisia

2017 zettam et al 2017 santos et al 2018 andaryani et al 2019 andrade et al 2019 despite this there are few examples of studies e g zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 that investigate the impacts of the combination of reservoirs of different types and levels of operation on catchment runoff using swat in fact approaches that mimic the effects of a large number of reservoirs in hydrological model structures have rarely been published to achieve acceptable model performance in dryland watersheds for daily time steps modeling the implementation of the reservoir network and its horizontal connectivity is fundamental with detailed representation of large and small reservoirs enabling a better analysis of their cumulative effects this paper investigates capabilities of the eco hydrological catchment model swat to represent dense networks of large and small reservoirs as common for many dryland regions as well as to gain in depth understanding of hydrological processes and reservoir storage for meso scale dryland catchments to accomplish this goal a detailed approach for dense networks of reservoirs is modeled in the eco hydrological model swat for daily time steps a new modeling and parameterization strategy of ponds and reservoirs is developed with detailed representation focusing on the horizontal hydrological connectivity and the cumulative impact of small reservoirs together with the parameterization of transmission losses and flood routing based on a modified swat version nguyen et al 2018 with a corrected muskingum subroutine suggested by the authors the catchment in the swat model is evaluated using streamflow and reservoir water level series by a two fold cross validation approach moreover a reservoir scenario approach is performed to assess the impact of the large and small reservoirs on the streamflow and storage volume including different combinations of small reservoir dimensions the present study not only improves the understanding of the hydrology of dense reservoir networks but also proposes a modeling approach that can be applied to water resources management in dryland catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area catchment the region for application of the model is a dryland meso scale catchment in brazil the conceição river catchment area 3 347 km2 is located in the state of ceará in the northeast of brazil fig 1 the discharge from the watershed outlet is monitored daily at the malhada gauging station the conceição river is a tributary of the upper jaguaribe alto jaguaribe river basin ujb which is itself a sub catchment of the jaguaribe river watershed the jaguaribe river flows through the entire state of ceará disemboguing into the atlantic ocean the study area sits between the latitudes of 6 5 and 7 5 the altitudes in the region vary from approximately 300 to 870 m with an average elevation of 550 m a s l according to köppen the climate of the region is defined as semi arid dry and hot bsh de araújo and medeiros 2013 it is characterized by a clear distinction between a rainy and a dry season the rain period lasting from january through may accounts for about 80 of the total annual precipitation which ranges from 500 to 1000 mm de araújo and medeiros 2013 amounting to 700 to 800 mm on average malveira et al 2012 the dry season however is characterized by water scarcity as the potential evaporation exceeds precipitation by up to four times annually gatto 1999 the prevailing climatic conditions with high interannual precipitation variability cause regular droughts which may even occur in several consecutive years climate data and its pre processing are presented in the supplementary material the vast majority of the region is covered by steppe like savannah gatto 1999 the predominant natural flora is the so called arboreal caatinga a vegetation type found only in the northeast of brazil being composed of trees shrubs and cacti which are characterized as tropical xerophytic deciduous broadleaved plants malveira et al 2012 gatto 1999 the caatinga presents a spatially rather continuous vegetation cover only with slight variations in density the trees have densely branched stems and firm foliage which dries out and falls off shortly after the rainy season güntner 2002 geologically 80 of the ujb is composed of crystalline bedrock eudoro 2009 which is characterized by shallow overlying soils with low hydraulic conductivity and porosity silva et al 2007 therefore the subsurface water storage vadose zone and groundwater in the catchment is limited eudoro 2009 along the principal rivers and tributaries alluvial depositions may be found composed by young sandy clayey sediments these alluvial bodies present rather high permeability feitosa 1998 feitosa and de oliveira 1998 colares and feitosa 1998 soil mapping and its physical parameters derivation are presented in the supplementary material the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall combined with the low groundwater storage capacity and high evaporation creates an adverse environment with regard to natural water availability which is characterized by intermittent rivers and low runoff coefficients de araújo and medeiros 2013 malveira et al 2012 surface runoff generated in higher parts of the hillslopes is likely to infiltrate into the soil when reaching lower unsaturated areas if produced at all streamflow in upstream tributaries is of ephemeral nature lasting only for short periods in the range of minutes only after several consecutive rainy days the soil water content is increased so that hydraulic connectivity is established on a catchment scale and streamflow occurs in the main rivers continuing over longer periods in the range of weeks de araújo and medeiros 2013 de figueiredo et al 2016 in river reaches embedded in an alluvium the flow regime is additionally influenced by channel transmission losses as a consequence of infiltration through the river bed and banks costa et al 2012 costa et al 2013 2 2 study area reservoir system reservoirs were distinguished between the large so called strategic reservoirs constructed and managed by the state government and the privately built unmanaged reservoirs of different sizes and shapes fig 1 the latter ones will be generally referred to as small reservoirs 2 2 1 strategic reservoirs four strategic reservoirs namely poço da pedra benguê mamoeiro and do coronel are located within the catchment fig 1 with a drainage area of 800 1 062 1 888 and 25 km2 respectively table 1 the daily storage volume and the flooded area for each strategic reservoir are derived from the monitoring of water levels the dam constructions usually dispose of two different release facilities table 1 a drain unit with an adjustable clasp device and an uncontrolled spillway time series of the controllable releases are available for three of the strategic reservoirs poço da pedra do coronel and benguê for poço da pedra and do coronel no released discharges occurred for the entire period the records for benguê showed some days during which water was released no regularity was discernible and the discharges were rather small usually lower than 100 l s as the released discharges are negligibly small compared to the observed streamflow and to the losses caused by lake evaporation güntner et al 2004 they were disregarded for the calculation of reservoir water balance differently from the controllable water releases the spillway overflow is quite relevant to estimate the reservoir water balance since large flood events were recurrent during the study period 2 2 2 small reservoirs for previous studies on the reservoir network in the ujb mamede et al 2012 peter et al 2014 a total number of 230 reservoirs was registered in the conceição river catchment analyzing aerial images taken immediately after the rainy season of the three comparatively wet years 2004 2008 and 2009 this analysis allowed the estimation of the maximum water surface and the corresponding perimeter of the lakes in situ measurements of volume area and height of the small reservoirs are not available as the flooded areas represent a moisture state shortly after the rainy season of extremely wet years it was assumed that they correspond to the maximum capacity beyond which water is spilled from a reservoir mamede et al 2012 peter et al 2014 hence an estimation of the storage volumes based on these surface areas was conducted to gain the input data required by the hydrological model simplified approaches to estimate the storage capacity and additionally the spillway width are shown as follows storage capacity estimation molle 1994 conducted an extensive field study on the geometry of reservoirs in four states of the semi arid northeast of brazil including the state of ceará based on this work he developed the following equations describing the relation between surface area height and volume of a reservoir as a function of two parameters v k h α a k α h α 1 v estimated reservoir volume m3 k aperture coefficient h reservoir height water stage m α shape coefficient a surface area m2 when combining the two equations one obtains an expression for the reservoir volume as a function of the surface area pereira 2017 v k a α k α α 1 the two coefficients are site specific and vary depending on the prevailing topography molle 1994 determined these coefficients for a sample of 420 reservoirs with capacities ranging from 0 03 to 0 66 hm3 the mean value of the sample for α and the median for k amounted to 2 7 and 1500 respectively using these parameters the equation has been commonly applied in many studies e g malveira et al 2012 peter et al 2014 in order to find mean values for the two coefficients of molle s equation that are more representative for the reservoir dimensions found in the conceição river catchment reservoirs with flooded area till 0 07 hm2 which are rather smaller than those from the sample of molle 1994 a sub sample of 21 reservoirs from a database published by the brazilian national department of constructions against droughts departamento nacional de obras contra as secas dnocs pinheiro 2004 was taken at hand the average value for α 2 7 and the median for k 5046 of this sample were determined and adopted for this work the estimated storage capacity of the small reservoirs detected by aerial images in the catchment based on molle s equation ranges from 2 362 to 1 939 301 m3 the mean and median storage capacity of the small reservoirs are 80 335 and 23 700 m3 respectively 3 spillway width estimation not only the strategic reservoirs dispose of spillway structures but the private non operated dams as well even though their flood water release is generated in different manners the small reservoirs usually have a lowered sill made of compacted soil some reservoirs simply spill via a natural or excavated so called preferential flow channel no information is available on the width and the height of spillways of small reservoirs so in order to realize a broad scale assessment of the small reservoir spillway widths measurements based on satellite images were conducted in google earth in cases where a spillway was clearly discernible from the flight perspective after the satellite image analysis only 21 measurements were considered because in the majority of cases no clear distinction between dam and spillway was discernible mainly due to the fact that both structures are made of earth and hence no difference in depth was recognizable additionally some of the larger reservoirs dispose of tubes integrated into the dam which could also not be assessed in the imagery aiming the estimation of all spillway widths it was assumed that the flood magnitude is related to the upstream drainage area so all 21 values of google earth based spillway width were plotted against the upstream drainage area of each dam obtained from a geographic information system gis after removing three outliers a linear function was fitted to the plot with a coefficient of determination of 0 88 based on the thus obtained relationship the width of the spillway of other small reservoirs could be approximately determined entering the respective drainage area with this width the released discharge based on the water stage over the spillway crest may be calculated however it must be stated that the relation between width and drainage area represent only a very rough estimation it presents a source of uncertainty originating from the low resolution of the satellite images in some regions the potential misinterpretation of them and measuring imprecision 3 1 model of the system of reservoirs and ponds 3 1 1 catchment delineation including reservoirs for simulating hydrological processes and reservoirs in the catchment the model swat was used the delineation of the watershed and the definition of its river network fig 1 were done in arcswat based on a digital elevation model dem with 90 m resolution outlets of strategic reservoirs were incorporated as nodes in this section the model development and parameterization of ponds and reservoirs is presented strategic reservoirs and main private reservoirs along the river network were implemented into the swat model as reservoir during the watershed delineation while the other small ones were added as pond as they are situated on tributaries off the main river network fig 1 the classification of small reservoirs as reservoirs or as ponds was done depending on their impact on the generated water runoff water impoundments were implemented as reservoir if they meet all of the following criteria i the water impoundment is caused by a dam construction built across the main river reach ii the upstream drainage area of the reservoir is substantially larger than the average design sub basin area 20 km2 iii the estimated storage capacity of the water impoundment is 0 01 hm3 in the special case that the water impoundment was complying with the first two criteria but not with the third one it was assigned to the second category pond for means of simplification even though it was receiving water from upstream sub basins by implementing these water impoundments as pond as if they were located off the main channel their water retaining effect was not completely neglected to implement the remaining reservoirs as pond the following criteria were checked i the water impoundment is caused by a dam construction built across the river reach ii the upstream drainage area of the reservoir is approximately equal or smaller than the average design sub basin area 20 km2 fulfilling these criteria a water impoundment was considered a pond according to the swat definition in case the upstream drainage area was larger than the designated minimum sub basin area 5 km2 the outlet was placed on the stream just downstream of the lake generating a sub basin whose entire area drains into the pond allocated to it deliberately placing certain ponds at the outlet of sub basins simplifies further calculations for the determination of their drainage fraction which is a required input parameter for swat if no dam construction was detected the water impoundment was disregarded in the model during a flood event depressions in the landscape or flood plains may be inundated and filled with water being registered as a water impoundment through remote sensing these inundation lakes were neglected in the model as they show different topographic characteristics than the lakes impounded by dams which would lead to an overestimation of their storage volume when applying the general method for volume estimation from flooded surface area see section 2 2 2 this would then cause a distorted impact on the surface runoff the model catchment delineation ended up with a total of 191 dams and 197 sub basins fig 1 the average sub basin size amounted to approximately 17 km2 a total of 18 dams were implemented as reservoir 4 strategic and 14 main private and 79 sub basins contained dams that were either individually assigned or aggregated as pond 3 1 2 aggregation of small reservoirs into ponds swat allows only one single pond to be allocated to each sub basin after the watershed delineation however many sub basins ended up containing multiple small reservoirs that was considered a reservoir system in which it was distinguished between a cascade and a parallel arrangement of reservoirs fig 2 in the cascade arrangement two or more reservoirs are located one behind the other on the same river reach water being released from the upstream reservoir will flow into the downstream reservoir so the filling of a downstream reservoir depends on the amount of water held up by reservoirs further upstream and thus on the storage capacities and drainage areas of all upstream reservoirs in the case that two or more reservoirs are arranged parallel to each other the filling and spilling processes are independent of each other in the parallel arrangement each reservoir is located on a separate river branch of the same order water being released from one reservoir does not flow into the other each reservoir has a separate drainage area based on the arrangement of small reservoirs and their drainage areas certain calculation rules were applied for the determination of the aggregated reservoir volume drainage areas of downstream reservoirs were kept fixed while the volumes were reduced if necessary in that way it was guaranteed that only a fraction of the sub basin contributes to runoff production that actually does not drain into any reservoir in the case that a pond is located directly at the outlet no outflow from the sub basin will occur until the storage capacity of the aggregated pond is exceeded with regard to the rarity and variability of runoff it is plausible to assume that in some dry years even some of the smaller reservoirs do not spill so it was aimed at estimating the mean storage volume that has to be reached so that water is exiting a network of small reservoirs this volume will be referred to further on as equivalent capacity the system s impact on the hydrology will be termed storage effect two extreme states may be distinguished with regard to the storage effect i the state when the entire amount of generated runoff in the system is stored so that no outflow occurs this may be seen at the beginning of the rainy season only if a certain threshold water volume is exceeded the system spills this threshold storage may be considered the effective capacity ii the other state occurs after full saturation of the system all reservoirs filled high soil moisture after some consecutive rainy days at this point the system only damps the outflow hydrograph releasing the amount of water above the total storage capacity of the system in other words the effective capacity of the reservoir network determines whether it spills while the total storage capacity determines how much water is spilled in order to simulate a storage effect that will match the one in reality on average it was set the equivalent storage capacity of the lumped pond to a value in between effective capacity and total storage capacity if the relation of capacity to drainage area of an upstream reservoir is equal to or smaller than that of the downstream reservoir considering only the fraction of drainage area beneath the upstream reservoir the upper dam will spill first hence the equivalent storage capacity of the system amounts to the total capacity the sum of both this case corresponds to the assumption of a positively constant relation between capacity and drainage area made for other studies e g güntner et al 2004 zhang et al 2012 in the case that this ratio is higher for the upstream reservoir the downstream reservoir will spill first when assuming the drainage area of the downstream reservoir though an addition of the single storage capacities would lead to a strong overestimation of the effective capacity spilling from the sub basin would be simulated with delay or not at all if only the downstream volume is considered the threshold storage for spilling of the system would be matched but the total capacity would be highly underestimated in this case the equivalent capacity is calculated as the sum between the full capacity of the reservoir with the larger specific drainage area and the other capacity reduced by the fraction of the two drainage areas eq 4 if v r u da u v r d da d v eq v r u v r d if v r u da u v r d da d if da u da d v eq v r u da d da u v r d if da u da d v eq v r d da u da d v r u veq equivalent storage capacity of aggregated pond v ru storage capacity of upstream reservoir v rd storage capacity of downstream reservoir dau drainage area of upstream reservoir dad drainage area of downstream reservoir accordingly for a parallel arrangement of small reservoirs in the same sub basin if the relation of capacity to drainage area of two reservoirs is equal both will spill at the same time hence the equivalent storage capacity of the system amounts to the total capacity the sum of both this case corresponds to the assumption of a positively constant relation between capacity and drainage area for the case that this relation is smaller for one of the reservoirs this dam will spill before the other one assuming the sum of both drainage areas as an upstream basin for the lumped pond the effective storage capacity would be overestimated considering only the drainage area and capacity of the reservoir with the smaller ratio the threshold storage for spilling would be matched but the total capacity would be underestimated in this case the equivalent capacity is calculated in the same way as for the sequential configuration as the sum of the full capacity of the reservoir with the larger specific drainage area and the other capacity reduced by the fraction of the two drainage areas eq 5 if v r 1 da 1 v r 2 da 2 v eq v r 1 v r 2 if v r 1 da 1 v r 2 da 2 if da 1 da 2 v eq v r 1 da 2 da 1 v r 2 if da 1 da

da2 drainage area of second reservoir by these calculation rules it was considered that if the combined drainage area is assumed the storage effect of the reservoir with the larger drainage area is weighted higher for the estimation of the joint storage capacity in case that multiple small reservoirs are arranged in the same configuration or that the two arrangements are combined in one sub basin it was started with the most upstream reservoirs their volumes were aggregated according to the respective rule then this intermediate equivalent volume was again lumped with the small reservoir further downstream and so on 3 1 3 parameterization of strategic reservoirs in swat a reservoir is basically described by the principal volume vpr the emergency volume vem and the respective flooded surface areas sapr and saem with these parameters the surface area volume curve is calculated and the water release is determined the gradual flood water release from the strategic reservoirs may best be modeled in swat with the target release for controlled reservoir function iresco 2 the outflow routine allows a gradual spilling of the water volume above a certain target volume vtarg and under the emergency volume vem the maximum storage capacity of each reservoir corresponding to a water level equal to the height of the weir crest was set as vpr considering that the spillways of all reservoirs in the catchment are uncontrollable free weirs vtarg was fixed as vpr for all months in order to guarantee a gradual water release over the spillway vem must be set substantially higher than vpr so that it is possibly never exceeded vem and saem are available for strategic reservoirs by the state water agency the parameter ndtarg representing the number of days required for releasing all excess water above vtarg determines the amount of water flowing out from the reservoir on each day it depends on the type and the width of the spillways in order to find a value for this parameter daily spillway discharges for different excess volumes were calculated for each strategic reservoir the discharge over the spillway in swat was calculated according to the commonly known weir overflow poleni equation aigner 2008 which depends on the width and the form of the spillway table 1 the weir type specific overflow coefficients were set according to the weir types 2 1 for benguê and mamoeiro 1 75 for poço da pedra and 1 6 for do coronel water levels were considered only up to a height slightly above the maximum observed elevation in the provided time series of the reservoirs 1 m above the spillway crest for benguê and mamoeiro 0 75 and 0 5 m for do coronel and poço da pedra respectively excess volumes were also calculated for water stages at 0 01 0 05 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 m above the spillway for all strategic reservoirs therefore the poleni equation was solved for half hourly time steps readjusting the water stage after each step based on the specific volume elevation curve the amounts of water released after each time step were added up obtaining the total water volume released in one day the values for the excess volume i e the volume above reservoir capacity were then plotted against the values for the calculated released water volume linear functions were fitted to the plots fig 3 with ndtarg equal to the inverse of the slopes of the straights the straight lines presented high coefficients of determination r2 0 9 which led to the conclusion that the spilling behaviour of such reservoirs could be suitably represented by the function implemented in swat the obtained values for ndtarg reveal that all the excess water is released within slightly more than one day for the reservoirs benguê and do coronel mamoeiro spills all the excess water in less than one day for the excess water to be released from poço da pedra however it takes more than two days these statements are only valid for the assumption that no water is entering the reservoir during this time in reality the spilling process is much more dynamic a simulation on hourly time steps would be much more precise but would lead to high computation time as the simulation step in swat was set to one day due to data availability limitations the approach presented here was considered the most appropriate way to estimate the daily released water volume the parameters iyres and mores year and month in which the reservoir was built respectively were set according to the available information the parameter evrsv the lake evaporation coefficient was set to 1 which represents the maximum value to guarantee high evaporation losses the parameter res k represents the hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir bottom it determines the losses through infiltration due to the professional planning and construction of the governmental reservoirs it was assumed that these dams were sufficiently sealed and res k was set to 0 the initial reservoir volume parameter res vol for benguê was obtained from recorded values shortly after the reservoir became operational in 2000 the initial storage volume represented about 4 of its capacity for mamoeiro which became operational in 2012 the initial volume was also set to 4 of its capacity however no further time series were available for mamoeiro for do coronel the observed storage volume on the first day of simulation in 1979 was obtained from the available records the time series for poço da pedra showed a gap for the years around 1979 the storage volume at that time was estimated based on all other values registered at the beginning of january in the other years and based on the rainfall measured in 1978 the mean annual rainfall was calculated from five rain gauges inside the study catchment both for the year 1978 and for the entire simulation period the annual rainfall in 1978 showed to be around 71 of the mean annual rainfall of the entire simulation period the average of registered reservoir volumes at the beginning of january amounted to 46 of the total capacity so the initial storage for poço da pedra was estimated with these percentages res vol 0 71 0 46 capacity table 2 summarizes the parameterization of reservoirs with a description of all parameters the representation of the withdrawal of water from the reservoirs was considered in the model in a simplified approach urban water supply and irrigation were represented by a constant monthly water withdrawal based on state water agency data for each strategic reservoir 3 1 4 parameterization of main private reservoirs except for the flooded areas measured through remote sensing at the end of the flood season of extremely wet years no data were available on the 14 main private reservoirs which were implemented as reservoir into the swat model as they typically dispose of some type of spillway it was assumed that the water storage effect of these dams was similar to that of the strategic reservoirs so their implementation followed the same principle the measured flooded area was set as sapr and the respective volume which was therefore estimated using the molle based approach was assumed as capacity and set as vpr moreover the volume corresponding to a water level of 1 5 m above the crest of the spillway was calculated and assumed as vem the height of 1 5 m was assumed as a reasonable value for the average height between spillway and dam crest assuming the same procedure of overflow analysis that was followed for the strategic reservoirs and general simplifications of spillway geometric properties it was found that the excess water is spilled within less than one day for almost all small reservoirs i e less than the model calculation time step the average ndtarg parameter was set as 1 for the main private reservoirs the application google timelapse was used to determine in which year each reservoir was built setting iyres accordingly this google function provides satellite images of many regions from the years 1984 until 2017 if it was seen that a dam had been present since 1984 it was assumed that it had been existing since 1979 in these cases mores was set to january in the other cases mores was set to november the ending of the dry season assuming that the dams are constructed during the dry season according to molle 1989 seepage does not occur in the flooded area of the reservoir due to the underlying crystalline bedrock but rather underneath the dam along the original river bed in the study the insufficient sealing and compaction of the dam structures were concluded to be the principal reason for infiltration losses so the seepage process implemented in swat assuming a loss through the flooded area neitsch et al 2009 does not adequately represent the infiltration process happening in the field in order not to neglect seepage losses from small reservoirs however the swat parameter res k hydraulic conductivity of reservoir bottom was set according to the average seepage rate found in molle 1989 which amounted to 2 64 mm per day 0 1 mm per hour for evaporation losses the same value of 1 for evrsv was defined as described for strategic reservoirs reservoirs that were built during the simulation period were assigned 0 as initial storage volume for the other reservoirs the initial storage was set according to the size class same as used in the studies presented here micro dams capacity 0 1 hm3 were assumed to be empty before the flood season in january small sized dams 0 1 hm3 capacity 1 hm3 were assumed to be at 10 of their capacity and the medium sized ones 1 hm3 capacity 10 hm3 were assumed to be at 20 of their capacity the remaining parameters were left as swat default a summary of the main private reservoir parameters can be found in table 2 3 1 5 parameterization of ponds the obtained equivalent capacity of a system of small reservoirs was set as the vpr of the aggregated pond of each sub basin the corresponding equivalent surface area was determined according to the same calculation rules setting it as the sapr of the lumped pond of each sub basin with the single reservoir volumes corresponding to a water level of 1 5 m above the spillway vem and saem of the aggregated ponds were calculated using the same method in swat it is not possible to set the date when a pond came into being so it had to be assumed that all ponds had been existing since the beginning of the simulation period which adds another source of uncertainty considering the transient nature of the micro dams and looking at the development of dam construction in the region analysed in malveira et al 2012 based on the considerations made for reservoir bottom percolation the respective parameter for infiltration through the pond bottom k pond was set as 0 1 mm h too from the investigation about the spilling behaviour it was found that only above the threshold value of 0 01 for the ratio of capacity to drainage area of the single small reservoirs it takes more than one day for the excess volume to be spilled ndtarg 1 0 from the highest value for ndtarg and the lowest one with the corresponding ratios a linear relation was set up based on this equation the ndtarg parameter was determined for all the small ponds that showed a ratio higher than 0 01 in case the pond was located at the outlet of a sub basin the interpolated value for ndtarg was assumed for the aggregated pond in the respective sub basin for the remaining sub basins with ponds the parameter was set to 1 initial storages of the aggregated ponds were also set based on the single small reservoirs located in the sub basin following the reservoir size class as aforementioned if at least one small reservoir of a higher reservoir size class small or medium sized dam is located in a sub basin the initial storage was set as a fraction of the capacity of this reservoir accordingly table 3 summarizes the parameterization of ponds 3 2 parameterization of dryland hydrology 3 2 1 model calibration approach the aim of the calibrated model is to describe the rainfall runoff relationship of the catchment with the reservoir system as a base for further investigations and scenario simulations studying the sensitivity and uncertainty of hydrological parameters is not the subject of this study based on the available data literature and the experience of the modelers the following methods were chosen for the calculation of infiltration evapotranspiration and channel routing respectively curve number method plant evaporation method and muskingum method the parameters of the model were calibrated with an iterative trial and error procedure with the objective of maximizing statistical model performance and minimizing bias in stream flow by keeping parameter values in a physically meaningful range initial values for the model parameters were derived from field data as much as possible then where field data from the case study area were not sufficient values from literature about dryland catchments were chosen to represent the characteristics of the study catchment finally remaining sensitive parameters were calibrated the model was calibrated separately for the sub catchments of the three large strategic reservoirs benguê poço da pedra and do coronel the simulated reservoir volume was compared to the time series for the strategic reservoirs as the mamoeiro reservoir became operational only in 2012 after the last year of the malhada station available time series 1979 2010 it was disregarded for the presented analysis the remaining sub basins were sub divided into three categories upstream sub basins with mountainous river reaches transition sub basins with medium order river reaches and down stream sub basins the sub division was done by personal judgment with regard to the topography slope classes and the order of the river reaches it is common in hydrological modeling to use warm up periods especially when the initial simulation conditions are not known a warm up is a sufficient period to run the model to initialize important variables or allow processes to reach a dynamic equilibrium the complexity of watershed scale processes impact the length of warm up periods for hydrological models however two to four years are recommended by model developers due to having a complete hydrological cycling in the modeling these periods are used by swat modelers in the arid and semiarid region for hydrological studies daggupati et al 2015 jajarmizadeh et al 2017 zettam et al 2017 kim et al 2018 carlos mendoza et al 2021 mengistu et al 2019 the calibration and validation of the model was performed using the technique of two fold cross validation considering the first two years as a warm up of the model simulation 1979 and 1980 the first half of the series 1981 1995 was used for calibration while the second half 1996 2010 was used for validation obtaining the statistical criteria for both series at the malhada station subsequently the second half of the series was used for calibration while the first half was used for validation the reservoir volume simulation was evaluated for the whole series but with a special highlight in the periods when each reservoir spilled out these periods have a greater importance due to the spillway overflow directly influencing the streamflow at the outlet of the catchment the simulated and observed time series of the reservoir s volume were overlain and their fitting was visually evaluated the years considered in the series for two fold cross validation have periods of flood and drought such as 1985 and 2004 rainy years and 1993 and 2005 drought years these rainy years were extremely wet years when all strategic reservoirs spilled out beyond these extreme years the preceding and following years were moderately wet to dry in this way the model could be evaluated for different extreme seasons and rainfall events for the calibration procedure the daily simulated stream flow were tried to match the daily observed stream flow at malhada gauging station evaluating the plausibility of the magnitude and the duration of the uncontrolled released discharges by reservoirs with regard to the stage discharge curves i e excess volume to released volume curves developed in this work to assess the fitting of daily streamflow hydrographs observed vs simulated a combination of three quantitative statistical criteria commonly applied in hydrological modeling was used the percent bias pbias the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge 3 2 2 rainfall runoff process flood routing and channel transmission losses the dominant vegetation caatinga resembles the vegetation type rangeland the manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow for rangeland with 20 vegetation cover was provided in neitsch et al 2009 the maximum canopy storage canmx was set to 1 5 mm as the average value for canopy storage in an arid environment stated in attarod et al 2015 the parameters sol awc available water capacity and sol k saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived by applying pedo transfer functions ptf based on brazilian literature for each soil layer supplementary material three soil types latosol vermelho amarelo bruno não calcio and litolicos eu textura arenosa had characteristics of vertic soils for them the bypass flow function of swat was activated for a reach of the middle jaguaribe river costa et al 2013 found that at the end of regular moist rainy seasons the river becomes a losing gaining system with its streamflow being sustained from base flow occurring in the underlying alluvium the test reach represented a high order river in lower areas as the principal rivers and tributaries in the study catchment are embedded in layers of alluvium as well similar effects of streamflow being sustained by backflow from these alluvium bodies may also be expected therefore river reaches were classified into three orders in the model high order reach medium order reach and upstream tributary swat allows to calculate water movement from the shallow aquifer to the root zone which is controlled by the groundwater revap coefficient gw revap for the respective sub basins the gw revap was set accordingly to different values decreasing in magnitude with increasing reach order according to the findings in costa et al 2013 transmission losses increase with increasing discharges due to a higher hydraulic head in order to include a more appropriate approach for transmission losses on a catchment scale the parameters ch k2 effective hydraulic conductivity of the channel alluvium in main river reaches and ch n2 manning s roughness coefficient for main channels were set to different values depending on the topographic position of the sub basins and the slope classes in the vicinity of the main river reaches the calibration of other parameters such as esco soil evaporation compensation coefficient alpha bnk bank flow recession coefficient alpha bf base flow recession coefficient gw delay delay time for aquifer recharge gwqmn threshold water level in shallow aquifer for base flow revapmn threshold water level in shallow aquifer for evaporation and trnsrch fraction of the transmission losses partitioned to the deep aquifer can be seen in a summary in the tables 4 6 table 4 presents parameters set for the entire catchment table 5 presents parameters set for specific sub basins of the catchment with distinction between sub catchments of two strategic reservoirs and topographic position of sub basins table 6 presents parameters set for specific zones in the catchment with distinction between soil types 3 3 reservoir scenarios one of the goals of this investigation is to assess the impact of the small reservoirs ponds and main private reservoirs on the model streamflow and volume series as the estimate of those structures was made mainly with the help of aerial images there is considerable uncertainty in this process thus in order to investigate different scenarios for the dimensions of the small reservoirs res esa res evol res psa res pvol and res vol and ponds pnd psa pnd pvol pnd esa pnd evol and pnd vol their volumes were multiplied by factor zero and the factor ten these parameters represent areas and volumes that were estimated by the analysis of aerial images in the model see section 2 2 2 0 time means the total absence of small reservoirs and was chosen to show how the model behaves without these small reservoirs 10 times means a ten times increase in the aforementioned parameters that represent the volumes of these small reservoirs with these modifications the model was run from 1979 to 2010 to assess their impact on the simulation of the streamflow at the malhada station and of the volumes and the spillway overflows for the strategic reservoirs we especially evaluated the peak values of the streamflow hydrograph at the malhada station and the number of days of spillway overflow in the strategic reservoirs in addition another scenario approach was performed to assess the impact of the reservoirs on the simulated streamflow at the outlet the general influence of reservoirs was performed considering 4 scenarios i considering all strategic reservoirs and small reservoirs reference ii removing all small reservoirs in the hydrological system but keeping only the strategic reservoirs iii removing all strategic reservoirs but keeping only the small reservoirs iv removing all reservoirs the model was run for the whole series with these hypothetical scenarios ii iii and iv and the streamflow at malhada station was compared with the reference scenario i fig 4 illustrates the main flowchart of this study with a summary of all methods applied 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation of streamflow the most relevant parameters in swat simulations in this study were identified as sol crk trnsrch ch k2 lat time revapmn gw revap and ch n1 it is worth mentioning that cn2 showed only low sensitivity even though it was often reported as very sensitive in other catchments we explain that with the climatic and soil characteristics of the area where soil moisture and infiltration processes more often underlie extreme dry or wet conditions than elsewhere in this study the first two years 1979 and 1980 were considered as warm up period for adjustment of internal processes e g soil moisture redistribution that moves from an estimated initial condition to a realistic state the model performance during the two fold cross validation periods was assessed with the three previously presented statistical performance criteria table 7 presents the obtained values for each for the calibration validation periods these values indicate a good model performance the analysis of the values for both nse and kge attested a good overall fit of the simulated and observed hydrographs at malhada station the model simulated streamflow peaks with fairly high accuracy with regard to their dates of occurrence and their magnitudes when calibrating the model with the first half of the series 1981 1995 the model overestimated streamflow values highly negative pbias for the second half 1996 2010 when calibrating the model with the second half of the series 1996 2010 the model underestimated the streamflow values highly positive pbias for the first half 1981 1995 fig 5 depicts the observed and the simulated hydrographs for the calibration validation periods while fig 6 depicts the log flow duration curve for these periods for better display fig 7 shows close ups of hydrographs with a logarithmic scale streamflow for the single years 1985 and 2004 during which relevant discharges were observed these years were chosen because they represent the wettest years allowing a full analysis of the hydrograph rising limb the peak flow and the recession flow for dry years with low precipitations and consequently low flows the analysis of these hydrograph characteristics would be limited fig 5 a b 6 a b and 7 a b present results for 1981 1995 calibration and 1996 2010 validation and c and d in both figures present results for 1996 2010 calibration and 1981 1995 validation for fig 7 only the first half of the year the wet season period is presented as for the rest of the year neither observed nor simulated discharges occur the dry season it is remarked that the scale of the vertical axis is adapted for each year the results show that the model was able to simulate dry years in which no or only minor discharges are registered 1983 1993 2001 and 2005 at the malhada gauging station for these years no water reached the outlet of the catchment so the hydrograph was not presented here this indicates that both the storage capacity of the single reservoirs and the losses due to evapotranspiration and riverbed infiltration were estimated sufficiently high for years with near average water yield the model accuracy was good for some years 1984 1987 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1999 and 2003 but was rather poor in others 1986 1989 1995 1997 2000 2002 and 2006 2008 for these years with worse accuracy until 2002 the peak streamflow was underestimated which means that the observed streamflow has higher peaks and more water reaching the outlet from 2006 to 2008 the model overestimated the peak streamflow these results can be seen in fig 5 for 2009 the modeled peak was clearly overestimated the graphs clarify that for wet years during which the large reservoirs spilled out 1985 and 2004 the days of extreme flood events high peaks were matched with high accuracy by the model the magnitude of the simulated peaks was within a similar range than those of the observed ones however the flow recession was not well represented by the model it was found that it is characteristic for the study area that the streamflow lasted for many days after strong consecutive rain events the abrupt recession of the simulated hydrograph at the end of wet periods with streamflow going down to zero just after a few days the peak occurred in all simulation results while in the observed hydrograph the streamflow lasts for a few days after extremely rainy periods water accumulates in the regions close to the river channel forming flood plains the river recharge process after this period is notably complex with unsaturated seepage and vertical unsaturated subsurface water redistribution beneath the stream lateral stream aquifer interaction and groundwater flow parallel to the river course in unconfined aquifers these processes and the channel transmission losses for arid and semi arid watersheds are very simplified in the swat model and have a great influence on these basins costa et al 2012 some of the years with moderate rain showed worse accuracy in peak streamflow hydrographs limbs and recession flow either with underestimation or with overestimation in the simulated values depending on the year of analysis those years with near average streamflow require attention in the hydrological simulations mainly due to the possible unsaturated characteristics of the soil transmission losses are more complex in these years and the swat model equation is relatively simple depending on hydraulic conductivity flow translation time wet perimeter and channel length uncertainties in the input data were one of the difficulties during modeling in this dryland catchment mainly in the values of hydraulic conductivity the values of hydraulic conductivity and transmission losses estimated also affected the recession flow whose simulated values also showed streamflow results with sharper drops than the observed values in the hydrographs after the rainy season in all cases there is uncertainty in rainfall data lack of continuous rain gauge monitoring in some days and human errors in measurements although the 44 stations available in the catchment can reduce errors no significant errors were found despite that errors of rainfall data during storm events can significantly impact modeling even interpolation cannot compensate for gaps in the recording of the local variability of rain 4 2 simulation of reservoir volume the simulated storage volumes during the cross validation of the three strategic reservoirs poço da pedra benguê and do coronel are presented for comparing their values and temporal dynamics with the observed values based on data availability and operation periods fig 8 from the diagrams it can be seen that the peaks during flood year 2004 were matched well for the three reservoirs the model simulated the filling of the reservoir very well until the storage capacity was exceeded for the other years the model simulated that the capacity was exceeded for 1986 1988 1990 1997 and 2009 2010 for poço da pedra 2006 2009 for benguê and 2009 for do coronel analyzing fig 8 the storage volume in poço da pedra and benguê reservoirs was higher overestimated in some years besides the periods that the simulated storage of the reservoir reached the maximum volume 1988 1990 1997 and 2009 2010 for poço da pedra and 2006 2007 for benguê when the observed data showed a value quite distant from that the evolution of the hydrograph however was well represented by the model for do coronel the curve of simulated storage volume showed slightly overestimated values compared to the observed ones for the years after and before the flood years the overall dynamics is better simulated than for the other two reservoirs despite these differences in storage volumes of poço da pedra and benguê we did not find any systematic error the years of 1997 2008 and 2009 for example showed considerable streamflow at malhada gauging station while the years of 1998 2001 and 2010 showed low streamflow there were no direct discharge measurements upstream from the studied reservoirs storage volumes were used to validate the reservoir modeling approach on the other hand from 2008 to 2010 the model overestimated the storage volumes in poço da pedra as well as the streamflow at malhada gauging station in these years especially in 2009 some characteristics of dryland environments cause uncertainties for modeling of rainfall runoff processes for example the nonlinear behavior of runoff generation and the irregular spatial patterns of soil properties rödiger et al 2014 mamede et al 2018 the fall of the storage volume during the dry period too was modeled very realistically for the years before and after a flood year the curves fitted very well for reservoirs the slope of the curve after a rainy season was a little more pronounced in the model this period is characterized by intense evaporation and a decrease in the volume of the reservoirs for semiarid sub basins and the parameter that calculates the evaporation evrsv in the reservoirs in the model was established at the highest possible value see table 2 the catchment of benguê reservoir was modeled by mamede et al 2018 using the wasa sed model güntner et al 2004 bronstert et al 2014 for the period 2000 2012 the wasa sed model also simulates the impact of the small reservoirs on the generated catchment runoff as aforementioned the wasa sed results for the storage volumes of the benguê reservoir were very similar to those produced by the swat model presented here although the wasa sed model was specifically adjusted only for the benguê catchment furthermore it can be seen that the model simulated the release from the reservoir during flood events within the calibration and validation periods fig 9 both the durations and the magnitudes of the overflow discharges seem plausible for all reservoirs according to the specific stage discharge curves edited for this study the simulated maximum discharge from poço da pedra corresponds to a water stage of about 60 cm above the spillway crest the maximum simulated overflow discharge from do coronel would cause the water stage to reach a height of 40 cm above the spillway crest the maximum discharge from benguê corresponded to a water stage higher than 2 m above the spillway crest 2 1 m is given as the maximum water level above the spillway so in this case it may be assumed that the model overestimated the outflow but as the outflow from the spillway represents a dynamic process depending on hourly flood events the water stage may be kept constant during a longer time span leading to higher discharges than the one predicted by the stage discharge curves which assume no further inflow to the reservoir as no information was available regarding the spillway overflow from the reservoirs no further comments on the plausibility of the outflow hydrographs were done however the results were an indication that the filling and emptying processes in reservoirs may be mimicked realistically with the swat model even on a daily time step which was rarely shown before beyond the results presented for reservoirs an analysis was also made for the number of days on which the three reservoirs overflowed these results were taken from analysis of the simulation counting the days when each reservoir exceeded capacity resulting in spillway overflow during the simulation period 1979 2010 these values were compared with the number of spillway overflow days from the state water agency observed data for each reservoir the results were presented in table 8 the model greatly overestimated the number of days with spillway overflow mainly for poço da pedra and benguê this is an expected result since the hydrographs of these reservoirs for model simulation had several years reaching their capacities on the other hand for do coronel the results were very close a greater number of days of spillway overflow from the reservoirs implies that more water reaches the outlet of the catchment increasing the simulated streamflow values this could be clearly seen in 2009 where all reservoirs overflowed and consequently the simulated peak flow at the malhada station was much higher than the observed peak flow other years that also had simulated streamflow rates greater than those observed 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 coincided with the overflow of the reservoirs having a higher number of days in these years fig 10 depicts the outflow hydrographs for four selected main private dams implemented as reservoirs for the entire simulation period 1979 2010 the two main private reservoirs with the largest drainage area and the largest storage volume no 46 and no 146 respectively and the largest main private reservoirs for poço da pedra catchment no 123 and benguê catchment no 17 were chosen for presentation see fig 1 as they had the highest hydrological impact the diagrams showed that water release from the reservoirs 17 46 and 123 was simulated by the model only in some years with the spilling lasting only for a couple of days as presented before it was expected that such medium sized reservoirs spill out only in wet years after consecutive strong rain events these results agree with this field observation hence the spilling behavior seems realistic with regard to the spillway outflow simulated for these main private reservoirs the magnitude of the discharges were consistent considering the smaller drainage areas and the spillway widths estimated consequently it may be stated that the estimation of the reservoir capacity and the model parameterization were reasonable no other information nor observed data was available for these reservoirs therefore the plausibility of the results may not be assessed more specifically the higher frequency and duration of spilling of reservoir number 146 simulated by the model were due to the fact that the soil type present in that area does not have any cracking potential therefore the soil was saturated faster and more runoff was generated leading to a faster filling of the reservoir as the spillway outflow magnitudes were consistent to the drainage area and the spillway width and the parametrization was based on the calibration of the volume of do coronel reservoir located nearby it may be assumed that these results too were reasonable 4 3 impact of the reservoir network on streamflow and reservoir volume simulations the influence of reservoirs on the outflow of the catchment was first investigated with the following four scenarios for the whole flow series 1979 2010 i considering all strategic reservoirs and small reservoirs reference ii removing all small reservoirs in the hydrological system but keeping only the strategic reservoirs iii removing all strategic reservoirs but keeping only the small reservoirs iv removing all reservoirs table 9 presents a comparison for the model results criteria pbias nse and kge between the four scenarios the analysis of the statistical criteria in table 9 showed that removing strategic reservoirs significantly reduced the pbias which means an increase in the simulated streamflow in the outlet also nse and kge decreased this result is in line with the expectations due to the decrease in retention by removing the reservoirs besides that to illustrate the results obtained for wet years the year of 2004 was chosen to show the comparison between the simulations with the streamflow in the outlet at logarithmic scale fig 11 the streamflow hydrograph showed that during the first increasing limb the scenarios had a similar slope but the scenarios iii and iv reached a higher peak flow scenarios iii and iv do not have strategic reservoirs therefore water retention was lower in the catchment after this point all the scenarios showed similar results as the differences between scenarios i and ii and between scenarios iii and iv were very small this result also showed that the presence of small reservoirs did not significantly alter the streamflow during the rainy season the water retention due to small reservoirs in wet years was 2 the decreasing limb and the recession flow showed the same aspect observed in model calibration with the end of wet periods to be abrupt with streamflow going down to zero faster than the observed values probably due to river aquifer interaction processes that were not catched by swat as aforementioned this behaviour is also seen in other wetted years such as 1985 and 2009 not shown here therefore these results indicated that the basin under study is far from reaching its maximum water reserve capacity especially considering the saturation of small reservoirs all scenarios overestimate the observed streamflow data which can be seen more clearly on the cumulative streamflow representation fig 11 for the scenarios i and ii during the intermediate rainy season the simulated recession flow was higher than the observed one mainly from 02 2004 to 03 2004 furthermore the scenarios iii and iv reached a higher peak flow at the beginning of the rainy season due to the absence of the strategic reservoirs to illustrate the results obtained for dry years with low flows the year of 2003 was chosen to show the comparison between the simulations and the observed data with the streamflow in the outlet at logarithmic scale fig 12 the results were very similar to those obtained for wet years all scenarios overestimate the observed streamflow data however the differences between scenarios i and ii and between scenarios iii and iv showed that the presence of small reservoirs is more significant for reducing the cumulative streamflow during a dry year the water retention due to small reservoirs in dry years was 9 other studies have also shown that small reservoirs decrease low flows with a more intense reduction in dry years perrin et al 2012 habets et al 2018 now modifying the dimensions of the small reservoirs ten times we found a lower streamflow peak for the estimation with small reservoirs parameters ten times larger than the reference original parameterization this result was expected because with more small reservoirs in the catchment more water retention is observed which means less outflow to the malhada station despite this the comparison of scenario simulations the absence of small reservoirs the reference and the larger dimensions of small reservoirs for peak flow increasing and decreasing limb were very close with no considerable differences between the model scenarios for small reservoirs even in dry years not shown here the analysis of the reservoir volumes for the scenarios was carried out by a comparison of the time series of the storage volumes figs 13 15 the results showed a small difference for the storage volume in the poço da pedra reservoir fig 13 considering the changes in the dimensions of the small reservoirs for the benguê and do coronel reservoirs figs 14 and 15 respectively the differences in the storage volume can be observed more clearly between 2002 and 2004 with larger volumes for the 0 times simulation which means the absence of small reservoirs and slightly smaller volumes for the 10 times simulation once again this was an expected result because by decreasing the small reservoirs more water can reach the strategic reservoirs increasing the storage volumes however the differences between the simulations were not considerable to conclude for a relevant impact of small reservoirs on those catchments previous studies suggest a relatively high impact of small reservoirs on the catchment water retention from 10 to 20 de araújo and medeiros 2013 peter et al 2014 mamede et al 2018 habets et al 2018 while the present model with new representation of small reservoirs in swat showed a lower impact on the water inflow for strategic reservoirs about 2 of water retention in wet years and about 9 in dry years the study basin has an estimate of 230 reservoirs distributed over a total catchment area of 3 347 km2 resulting in 1 reservoir per 14 5 km2 reservoir density for semi arid regions the variability of spatial distribution and density of small reservoirs varies significantly between 0 and 4 2 reservoirs per km2 mady et al 2020 in comparison with other dryland regions the conceição river catchment reservoir density is 25 times bigger than reservoir density in california usa as reported by minear and kondolf 2009 for example despite the large number of reservoirs in the upper jaguaribe basin ujb where the study area is located we found a reservoir density 2 5 times smaller than that of the whole ujb which is 1 reservoir per 6 km2 lima neto et al 2011 this indicates that the study area can still be considered to have a high density of reservoirs although it has a lower reservoir density than the average of the ujb furthermore considering the observed data from 1979 to 2010 the main hydrologic fluxes of the study are annual precipitation annual potential evapotranspiration and annual streamflow of 605 mm 2 328 mm and 67 8 hm3 year 20 3 mm respectively the total estimated reservoir capacity is 113 1 hm3 or 33 8 mm of which 94 0 hm3 28 1 mm comes from three strategic reservoirs ponds and main private reservoirs 226 have only 19 1 hm3 5 7 mm on average 0 085 hm3 0 025 mm per small reservoir even increasing the volume estimates of small reservoirs by ten times the average volume per area of each small reservoir 0 25 mm remains very small in comparison with strategic reservoirs and the aforementioned hydrologic fluxes moreover as the stream flow are normally concentrated in a few days of the year in this catchment the surface runoff has much more volume than the capacity of the small reservoirs even for forcing moderate rainfall events although the results obtained in this work represent hydrological aspects of a specific catchment in the brazilian semiarid region the methodology for assessing the impact of small reservoirs and the discussion of hydrological processes such as peak flow and non flow periods channel transmission losses analysis at the beginning and end of the rainy season in the streamflow gauge station hydrographs and in the storage volume of reservoirs as well as the parameterization of the dense network of reservoirs can also be applied to large scale catchments located in other dryland regions some examples include semi arid watersheds in australia united states mexico and south asia which present similar climate hydrological and land use characteristics 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the impact of small reservoirs on a dryland catchment with a high density network of reservoirs and investigated the water routing dynamics and hydrological processes in the basin for this purpose a model was developed to simulate the catchment streamflow at the outlet the storage volumes of large reservoirs and the water balance of lumped small reservoirs at sub basin scale a methodology for the parameterization of the small reservoirs was developed to represent their integration into the catchment hydrological modeling and to investigate their influence on the hydrological outputs streamflow and reservoir volume storage of the basin the main findings of our work can be described as follows 1 the model proved to be well suited for simulating peak flow in wet years the non flow periods and the rising limb of the hydrograph with high reliability for the streamflow at the catchment outlet 2 in the strategic reservoirs wet and dry years were well represented as well as the magnitude of spillway overflow of strategic and small reservoirs on the other hand the number of days with spillway overflow showed to be overestimated 3 the proposed model presents an innovative way to represent a dense network of reservoirs in semi arid basins in catchment hydrological models the efforts in the parameterization and aggregation of ponds and reservoirs proved to be worthwhile allowing a more accurate spatial representation of the strategic and small reservoirs in the swat model for high density networks and improving the analysis of the hydrological processes and impacts in the basin 4 the presence of small reservoirs decreased the stream flow and storage downstream reservoir volumes with only 2 of water retention on average increasing the volumes of small reservoirs along the basin by ten times showed that the small ponds had a low influence on stream discharge the catchment under study is far from reaching its maximum water reserve capacity especially considering the current density of small reservoirs however in dry years their impact can reach 9 of water retention which may worsen periods of water scarcity in the large reservoirs for semi arid catchments the reliability of the results for peak flow in wet years for non flow periods and for the rising limb of the hydrograph is very important for the simulation of the stream flow reaching the large reservoirs and consequently for meeting the water demand at catchment scale however future improvements should be done in the model for better representations in recession flow since the results of the present study pointed to a low influence of the network of small reservoirs on the stream flow and strategic reservoir storages the small reservoirs in the catchment might be an option to increase decentralized water access for small rural communities without competing with other water uses such as large and medium sized city sanitation demands and irrigation industry from the strategic reservoirs the spatial representation of small reservoirs for a high density network in the swat model and the results of the cumulative impact of small reservoirs presented in this study contributed to a better understanding of hydrology in dryland catchments and can be applied to catchments in similar climatic and socio economic environments further studies on the swat model in semi arid regions will evaluate different arrangements for the increase of small reservoirs in the basin and their impact on reservoir water quality such studies should also be concerned with investigating channel transmission losses and river aquifer interactions based on comparison with additional intermittent groundwater data the coupling of surface and groundwater models will potentially improve the understanding of dryland hydrology and integrated water resources

3974,the mismatch between natural water availability and demand in dryland regions is overcome by reservoirs of different sizes with the purpose of storing water the increase in population in dryland regions and the consequent growth in water demand expanded the construction of small reservoirs generating in these regions a dense network of reservoirs which increases the complexity of modeling these hydrological systems for dryland watersheds modeling with daily time step the horizontal connectivity of the reservoir network needs careful representation in order to achieve acceptable model performance including cumulative effects of reservoirs however the horizontal connectivity of reservoir networks is often less investigated in large scale catchment models this work presents an innovative way of implementing the dense reservoir network into the widely used eco hydrological model soil and water assessment tool swat with detailed representation of large and small reservoirs and an extensive analysis about the cumulative impact of small reservoirs on the horizontal hydrological connectivity for large scale dryland catchments a two fold cross validation was used against streamflow at a catchment outlet and against in catchment reservoir water levels the model daily performance was acceptable despite the input data uncertainty with good reliability for peak flow in wet years for nonflow periods and for the rising limb of the hydrograph the efforts in the parameterization of reservoirs and aggregation of ponds allowed a better analysis of the hydrological processes and their impacts in the catchment the results showed that small reservoirs decreased the streamflow but had a low impact on catchment retention and water losses with 2 of water retention in wet years however the water retention reached 9 in dry years which may worsen periods of water scarcity in the large reservoirs the spatial representation of small reservoirs for a high density network in the swat model and the results of the cumulative impact of small reservoirs may be relevant for a better understanding of hydrology in dryland catchments and can be applied to catchments in similar climatic and socio economic environments keywords swat dryland hydrology pond reservoir hydrological connectivity 1 introduction dryland environments are home to the world s water poorest populations and during recent decades have been subjected to increases in population partial rise in living standards development of irrigated agriculture and new activities especially tourism that have drastically changed water and land use these populations are vulnerable to the adverse consequences of environmental changes and in need of regional hydrological studies for better water resources management and water scarcity risk reduction gutiérrez et al 2014 aghakouchak et al 2015 mallakpour et al 2018 samimi et al 2020 yao et al 2020 to overcome the mismatch between natural water availability and demand dams of different sizes have been built with the purpose of storing large amounts of water during the wet season which may then be used during the dry season and dry years simmers 2003 mamede et al 2012 mady et al 2020 the increase in population in dryland regions and the consequent growth in water demand for human activities expanded the number of large medium and small dams distributed along the catchments mady et al 2020 samimi et al 2020 the federal and state governments of dryland regions have promoted the construction of large reservoirs which mainly serve to provide for the water demand of industries urban regions and large scale irrigation agriculture de araújo and medeiros 2013 additionally small scale reservoirs have been used for a long time mainly in dryland regions as a complement to meet the water demand of small municipalities rural communities and farmers the small sized and seasonal freshwater system play an important role in reducing inequalities for rural populations providing sustainable development for rural communities and farmers due to their reduced cost and availability of many favourable locations the number of small reservoirs has increased in recent decades de araújo and medeiros 2013 berhane et al 2016 yaeger et al 2017 habets et al 2018 the spatial density of small reservoirs varies across different regions with catchments in india with 4 2 reservoirs per km2 northeastern brazil with 0 2 reservoir per km2 and australia with values between 0 15 and 6 1 reservoirs per km2 for example the advances of remote sensing techniques in obtaining important information from satellite images have allowed a better identification of the dimensions and uses of small reservoirs and assessing their global distribution lima neto et al 2011 carluer et al 2016 mady et al 2020 paredes beltran et al 2021 the small reservoirs medium to micro dams are usually built disregarding the potential impact on the water availability of downstream communities this has led to the generation of a chaotic system which is referred to as a high density reservoir network lima neto et al 2011 mamede et al 2012 abouabdillah et al 2014 on the one hand such a reservoir network ensures a more equally distributed use of the water resources among the population of the river basin as it reduces the concentration of water in large downstream reservoirs and enhances an even spatial distribution mamede et al 2012 fowe et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 this has also positive effects such as decreasing sedimentation in the large strategic reservoirs lima neto et al 2011 berg et al 2016 mamede et al 2018 decreasing soil erosion abouabdillah et al 2014 and decreasing the energy demand for pumping nascimento et al 2019 on the other hand as the smaller dams are also designed to maximize storage and the flow in tributaries is rare the spilling frequency of the reservoirs is low increasing hydrological discontinuity de araújo and medeiros 2013 abouabdillah et al 2014 peter et al 2014 the cumulative impact of the small reservoirs on downstream water availability are not simple to estimate because they are not necessarily the sum of individual effects of each small reservoir these reservoirs may be inter dependent and the cumulative effect can be greater or less than the sum of the individual effects depending on their dimensions uses and locations habets et al 2018 however there is evidence that the cumulative impact of the small reservoirs can be considerable as the inflow to the large downstream reservoirs is reduced malveira et al 2012 de araújo and medeiros 2013 fowler et al 2015 some modeling approaches have been developed to assess the effects of small reservoirs in a basin most of them reported a decrease on the annual stream discharge with a wide range from 0 2 to 36 and decreases in low flow and peak flow neal et al 2002 schreider et al 2002 nathan et al 2005 callow and smettem 2009 hughes and mantel 2010 nathan and lowe 2012 fowe et al 2015 ayalew et al 2017 habets et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 most of those models are however based on simple mass balance methods developed for dryland environments thus their application in a scenario of increase in the number of small reservoirs should be done with caution due to specific water use and hydraulic infrastructure patterns moreover despite the importance of the small reservoirs for local needs and their impact on water availability at catchment scale the small reservoirs have been neglected by water authorities providing little technical information about them fowe et al 2015 habets et al 2018 reservoir data scarcity hampers therefore successful hydrological model application to drylands and semi arid environments with high density reservoir networks which already face both poor monitoring of streamflow and extreme precipitation variation from year to year the lack of information on small reservoirs characteristics and the difficulty to estimate cumulative impact is a challenge to assess and to model the hydrology in dryland environments the incorporation of reservoirs in hydrological models was carried out using simplified approaches in several other studies to assess their impact in streamflow in wasa model of water availability in semi arid environments the reservoirs are grouped into size classes according to their storage capacity with reservoirs of a smaller size class located upstream of reservoirs of a higher size class and arranged in a cascade system with only reservoirs of the largest size class regarded explicitly in the model in daily or hourly steps güntner 2002 güntner et al 2004 mamede et al 2018 the tedi tool for estimating dam impacts model also uses as model input the dam size distribution subdivided into classes with computations on a monthly basis tedi assumes that reservoirs are connected in parallel and the excess water spilling from each reservoir is directly routed to the outlet of the catchment disregarding the spatial arrangement of the single reservoirs subsequently the cheat complex hydrological evaluation of the assumptions in tedi tool was developed by nathan et al 2005 and included information on the location of the reservoirs on the river network and the network topology thus differentiating also between sequential and parallel arrangement of single reservoirs nathan and lowe 2012 fowler et al 2015 however the horizontal connectivity of reservoir networks is often less investigated in large scale catchment models the eco hydrological model swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 2012 has been applied worldwide for the simulation of catchments in particular where water extractions and agricultural water management are of major relevance e g uniyal et al 2019 with study areas in india chile vietnam and germany various swat applications regarding the hydrology of dryland areas in china mongolia azerbaijan pakistan tunisia algeria mexico and brazil have been published abouabdillah et al 2014 bressiani et al 2015 ghoraba 2015 molina navarro et al 2016 luo et al 2017 siqueira et al 2016 sukhbaatar et al 2017 sun et al 2017 zettam et al 2017 santos et al 2018 andaryani et al 2019 andrade et al 2019 despite this there are few examples of studies e g zhang et al 2012 liu et al 2014 nguyen et al 2017 that investigate the impacts of the combination of reservoirs of different types and levels of operation on catchment runoff using swat in fact approaches that mimic the effects of a large number of reservoirs in hydrological model structures have rarely been published to achieve acceptable model performance in dryland watersheds for daily time steps modeling the implementation of the reservoir network and its horizontal connectivity is fundamental with detailed representation of large and small reservoirs enabling a better analysis of their cumulative effects this paper investigates capabilities of the eco hydrological catchment model swat to represent dense networks of large and small reservoirs as common for many dryland regions as well as to gain in depth understanding of hydrological processes and reservoir storage for meso scale dryland catchments to accomplish this goal a detailed approach for dense networks of reservoirs is modeled in the eco hydrological model swat for daily time steps a new modeling and parameterization strategy of ponds and reservoirs is developed with detailed representation focusing on the horizontal hydrological connectivity and the cumulative impact of small reservoirs together with the parameterization of transmission losses and flood routing based on a modified swat version nguyen et al 2018 with a corrected muskingum subroutine suggested by the authors the catchment in the swat model is evaluated using streamflow and reservoir water level series by a two fold cross validation approach moreover a reservoir scenario approach is performed to assess the impact of the large and small reservoirs on the streamflow and storage volume including different combinations of small reservoir dimensions the present study not only improves the understanding of the hydrology of dense reservoir networks but also proposes a modeling approach that can be applied to water resources management in dryland catchments 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area catchment the region for application of the model is a dryland meso scale catchment in brazil the conceição river catchment area 3 347 km2 is located in the state of ceará in the northeast of brazil fig 1 the discharge from the watershed outlet is monitored daily at the malhada gauging station the conceição river is a tributary of the upper jaguaribe alto jaguaribe river basin ujb which is itself a sub catchment of the jaguaribe river watershed the jaguaribe river flows through the entire state of ceará disemboguing into the atlantic ocean the study area sits between the latitudes of 6 5 and 7 5 the altitudes in the region vary from approximately 300 to 870 m with an average elevation of 550 m a s l according to köppen the climate of the region is defined as semi arid dry and hot bsh de araújo and medeiros 2013 it is characterized by a clear distinction between a rainy and a dry season the rain period lasting from january through may accounts for about 80 of the total annual precipitation which ranges from 500 to 1000 mm de araújo and medeiros 2013 amounting to 700 to 800 mm on average malveira et al 2012 the dry season however is characterized by water scarcity as the potential evaporation exceeds precipitation by up to four times annually gatto 1999 the prevailing climatic conditions with high interannual precipitation variability cause regular droughts which may even occur in several consecutive years climate data and its pre processing are presented in the supplementary material the vast majority of the region is covered by steppe like savannah gatto 1999 the predominant natural flora is the so called arboreal caatinga a vegetation type found only in the northeast of brazil being composed of trees shrubs and cacti which are characterized as tropical xerophytic deciduous broadleaved plants malveira et al 2012 gatto 1999 the caatinga presents a spatially rather continuous vegetation cover only with slight variations in density the trees have densely branched stems and firm foliage which dries out and falls off shortly after the rainy season güntner 2002 geologically 80 of the ujb is composed of crystalline bedrock eudoro 2009 which is characterized by shallow overlying soils with low hydraulic conductivity and porosity silva et al 2007 therefore the subsurface water storage vadose zone and groundwater in the catchment is limited eudoro 2009 along the principal rivers and tributaries alluvial depositions may be found composed by young sandy clayey sediments these alluvial bodies present rather high permeability feitosa 1998 feitosa and de oliveira 1998 colares and feitosa 1998 soil mapping and its physical parameters derivation are presented in the supplementary material the spatial and temporal variability in rainfall combined with the low groundwater storage capacity and high evaporation creates an adverse environment with regard to natural water availability which is characterized by intermittent rivers and low runoff coefficients de araújo and medeiros 2013 malveira et al 2012 surface runoff generated in higher parts of the hillslopes is likely to infiltrate into the soil when reaching lower unsaturated areas if produced at all streamflow in upstream tributaries is of ephemeral nature lasting only for short periods in the range of minutes only after several consecutive rainy days the soil water content is increased so that hydraulic connectivity is established on a catchment scale and streamflow occurs in the main rivers continuing over longer periods in the range of weeks de araújo and medeiros 2013 de figueiredo et al 2016 in river reaches embedded in an alluvium the flow regime is additionally influenced by channel transmission losses as a consequence of infiltration through the river bed and banks costa et al 2012 costa et al 2013 2 2 study area reservoir system reservoirs were distinguished between the large so called strategic reservoirs constructed and managed by the state government and the privately built unmanaged reservoirs of different sizes and shapes fig 1 the latter ones will be generally referred to as small reservoirs 2 2 1 strategic reservoirs four strategic reservoirs namely poço da pedra benguê mamoeiro and do coronel are located within the catchment fig 1 with a drainage area of 800 1 062 1 888 and 25 km2 respectively table 1 the daily storage volume and the flooded area for each strategic reservoir are derived from the monitoring of water levels the dam constructions usually dispose of two different release facilities table 1 a drain unit with an adjustable clasp device and an uncontrolled spillway time series of the controllable releases are available for three of the strategic reservoirs poço da pedra do coronel and benguê for poço da pedra and do coronel no released discharges occurred for the entire period the records for benguê showed some days during which water was released no regularity was discernible and the discharges were rather small usually lower than 100 l s as the released discharges are negligibly small compared to the observed streamflow and to the losses caused by lake evaporation güntner et al 2004 they were disregarded for the calculation of reservoir water balance differently from the controllable water releases the spillway overflow is quite relevant to estimate the reservoir water balance since large flood events were recurrent during the study period 2 2 2 small reservoirs for previous studies on the reservoir network in the ujb mamede et al 2012 peter et al 2014 a total number of 230 reservoirs was registered in the conceição river catchment analyzing aerial images taken immediately after the rainy season of the three comparatively wet years 2004 2008 and 2009 this analysis allowed the estimation of the maximum water surface and the corresponding perimeter of the lakes in situ measurements of volume area and height of the small reservoirs are not available as the flooded areas represent a moisture state shortly after the rainy season of extremely wet years it was assumed that they correspond to the maximum capacity beyond which water is spilled from a reservoir mamede et al 2012 peter et al 2014 hence an estimation of the storage volumes based on these surface areas was conducted to gain the input data required by the hydrological model simplified approaches to estimate the storage capacity and additionally the spillway width are shown as follows storage capacity estimation molle 1994 conducted an extensive field study on the geometry of reservoirs in four states of the semi arid northeast of brazil including the state of ceará based on this work he developed the following equations describing the relation between surface area height and volume of a reservoir as a function of two parameters v k h α a k α h α 1 v estimated reservoir volume m3 k aperture coefficient h reservoir height water stage m α shape coefficient a surface area m2 when combining the two equations one obtains an expression for the reservoir volume as a function of the surface area pereira 2017 v k a α k α α 1 the two coefficients are site specific and vary depending on the prevailing topography molle 1994 determined these coefficients for a sample of 420 reservoirs with capacities ranging from 0 03 to 0 66 hm3 the mean value of the sample for α and the median for k amounted to 2 7 and 1500 respectively using these parameters the equation has been commonly applied in many studies e g malveira et al 2012 peter et al 2014 in order to find mean values for the two coefficients of molle s equation that are more representative for the reservoir dimensions found in the conceição river catchment reservoirs with flooded area till 0 07 hm2 which are rather smaller than those from the sample of molle 1994 a sub sample of 21 reservoirs from a database published by the brazilian national department of constructions against droughts departamento nacional de obras contra as secas dnocs pinheiro 2004 was taken at hand the average value for α 2 7 and the median for k 5046 of this sample were determined and adopted for this work the estimated storage capacity of the small reservoirs detected by aerial images in the catchment based on molle s equation ranges from 2 362 to 1 939 301 m3 the mean and median storage capacity of the small reservoirs are 80 335 and 23 700 m3 respectively 3 spillway width estimation not only the strategic reservoirs dispose of spillway structures but the private non operated dams as well even though their flood water release is generated in different manners the small reservoirs usually have a lowered sill made of compacted soil some reservoirs simply spill via a natural or excavated so called preferential flow channel no information is available on the width and the height of spillways of small reservoirs so in order to realize a broad scale assessment of the small reservoir spillway widths measurements based on satellite images were conducted in google earth in cases where a spillway was clearly discernible from the flight perspective after the satellite image analysis only 21 measurements were considered because in the majority of cases no clear distinction between dam and spillway was discernible mainly due to the fact that both structures are made of earth and hence no difference in depth was recognizable additionally some of the larger reservoirs dispose of tubes integrated into the dam which could also not be assessed in the imagery aiming the estimation of all spillway widths it was assumed that the flood magnitude is related to the upstream drainage area so all 21 values of google earth based spillway width were plotted against the upstream drainage area of each dam obtained from a geographic information system gis after removing three outliers a linear function was fitted to the plot with a coefficient of determination of 0 88 based on the thus obtained relationship the width of the spillway of other small reservoirs could be approximately determined entering the respective drainage area with this width the released discharge based on the water stage over the spillway crest may be calculated however it must be stated that the relation between width and drainage area represent only a very rough estimation it presents a source of uncertainty originating from the low resolution of the satellite images in some regions the potential misinterpretation of them and measuring imprecision 3 1 model of the system of reservoirs and ponds 3 1 1 catchment delineation including reservoirs for simulating hydrological processes and reservoirs in the catchment the model swat was used the delineation of the watershed and the definition of its river network fig 1 were done in arcswat based on a digital elevation model dem with 90 m resolution outlets of strategic reservoirs were incorporated as nodes in this section the model development and parameterization of ponds and reservoirs is presented strategic reservoirs and main private reservoirs along the river network were implemented into the swat model as reservoir during the watershed delineation while the other small ones were added as pond as they are situated on tributaries off the main river network fig 1 the classification of small reservoirs as reservoirs or as ponds was done depending on their impact on the generated water runoff water impoundments were implemented as reservoir if they meet all of the following criteria i the water impoundment is caused by a dam construction built across the main river reach ii the upstream drainage area of the reservoir is substantially larger than the average design sub basin area 20 km2 iii the estimated storage capacity of the water impoundment is 0 01 hm3 in the special case that the water impoundment was complying with the first two criteria but not with the third one it was assigned to the second category pond for means of simplification even though it was receiving water from upstream sub basins by implementing these water impoundments as pond as if they were located off the main channel their water retaining effect was not completely neglected to implement the remaining reservoirs as pond the following criteria were checked i the water impoundment is caused by a dam construction built across the river reach ii the upstream drainage area of the reservoir is approximately equal or smaller than the average design sub basin area 20 km2 fulfilling these criteria a water impoundment was considered a pond according to the swat definition in case the upstream drainage area was larger than the designated minimum sub basin area 5 km2 the outlet was placed on the stream just downstream of the lake generating a sub basin whose entire area drains into the pond allocated to it deliberately placing certain ponds at the outlet of sub basins simplifies further calculations for the determination of their drainage fraction which is a required input parameter for swat if no dam construction was detected the water impoundment was disregarded in the model during a flood event depressions in the landscape or flood plains may be inundated and filled with water being registered as a water impoundment through remote sensing these inundation lakes were neglected in the model as they show different topographic characteristics than the lakes impounded by dams which would lead to an overestimation of their storage volume when applying the general method for volume estimation from flooded surface area see section 2 2 2 this would then cause a distorted impact on the surface runoff the model catchment delineation ended up with a total of 191 dams and 197 sub basins fig 1 the average sub basin size amounted to approximately 17 km2 a total of 18 dams were implemented as reservoir 4 strategic and 14 main private and 79 sub basins contained dams that were either individually assigned or aggregated as pond 3 1 2 aggregation of small reservoirs into ponds swat allows only one single pond to be allocated to each sub basin after the watershed delineation however many sub basins ended up containing multiple small reservoirs that was considered a reservoir system in which it was distinguished between a cascade and a parallel arrangement of reservoirs fig 2 in the cascade arrangement two or more reservoirs are located one behind the other on the same river reach water being released from the upstream reservoir will flow into the downstream reservoir so the filling of a downstream reservoir depends on the amount of water held up by reservoirs further upstream and thus on the storage capacities and drainage areas of all upstream reservoirs in the case that two or more reservoirs are arranged parallel to each other the filling and spilling processes are independent of each other in the parallel arrangement each reservoir is located on a separate river branch of the same order water being released from one reservoir does not flow into the other each reservoir has a separate drainage area based on the arrangement of small reservoirs and their drainage areas certain calculation rules were applied for the determination of the aggregated reservoir volume drainage areas of downstream reservoirs were kept fixed while the volumes were reduced if necessary in that way it was guaranteed that only a fraction of the sub basin contributes to runoff production that actually does not drain into any reservoir in the case that a pond is located directly at the outlet no outflow from the sub basin will occur until the storage capacity of the aggregated pond is exceeded with regard to the rarity and variability of runoff it is plausible to assume that in some dry years even some of the smaller reservoirs do not spill so it was aimed at estimating the mean storage volume that has to be reached so that water is exiting a network of small reservoirs this volume will be referred to further on as equivalent capacity the system s impact on the hydrology will be termed storage effect two extreme states may be distinguished with regard to the storage effect i the state when the entire amount of generated runoff in the system is stored so that no outflow occurs this may be seen at the beginning of the rainy season only if a certain threshold water volume is exceeded the system spills this threshold storage may be considered the effective capacity ii the other state occurs after full saturation of the system all reservoirs filled high soil moisture after some consecutive rainy days at this point the system only damps the outflow hydrograph releasing the amount of water above the total storage capacity of the system in other words the effective capacity of the reservoir network determines whether it spills while the total storage capacity determines how much water is spilled in order to simulate a storage effect that will match the one in reality on average it was set the equivalent storage capacity of the lumped pond to a value in between effective capacity and total storage capacity if the relation of capacity to drainage area of an upstream reservoir is equal to or smaller than that of the downstream reservoir considering only the fraction of drainage area beneath the upstream reservoir the upper dam will spill first hence the equivalent storage capacity of the system amounts to the total capacity the sum of both this case corresponds to the assumption of a positively constant relation between capacity and drainage area made for other studies e g güntner et al 2004 zhang et al 2012 in the case that this ratio is higher for the upstream reservoir the downstream reservoir will spill first when assuming the drainage area of the downstream reservoir though an addition of the single storage capacities would lead to a strong overestimation of the effective capacity spilling from the sub basin would be simulated with delay or not at all if only the downstream volume is considered the threshold storage for spilling of the system would be matched but the total capacity would be highly underestimated in this case the equivalent capacity is calculated as the sum between the full capacity of the reservoir with the larger specific drainage area and the other capacity reduced by the fraction of the two drainage areas eq 4 if v r u da u v r d da d v eq v r u v r d if v r u da u v r d da d if da u da d v eq v r u da d da u v r d if da u da d v eq v r d da u da d v r u veq equivalent storage capacity of aggregated pond v ru storage capacity of upstream reservoir v rd storage capacity of downstream reservoir dau drainage area of upstream reservoir dad drainage area of downstream reservoir accordingly for a parallel arrangement of small reservoirs in the same sub basin if the relation of capacity to drainage area of two reservoirs is equal both will spill at the same time hence the equivalent storage capacity of the system amounts to the total capacity the sum of both this case corresponds to the assumption of a positively constant relation between capacity and drainage area for the case that this relation is smaller for one of the reservoirs this dam will spill before the other one assuming the sum of both drainage areas as an upstream basin for the lumped pond the effective storage capacity would be overestimated considering only the drainage area and capacity of the reservoir with the smaller ratio the threshold storage for spilling would be matched but the total capacity would be underestimated in this case the equivalent capacity is calculated in the same way as for the sequential configuration as the sum of the full capacity of the reservoir with the larger specific drainage area and the other capacity reduced by the fraction of the two drainage areas eq 5 if v r 1 da 1 v r 2 da 2 v eq v r 1 v r 2 if v r 1 da 1 v r 2 da 2 if da 1 da 2 v eq v r 1 da 2 da 1 v r 2 if da 1 da

da2 drainage area of second reservoir by these calculation rules it was considered that if the combined drainage area is assumed the storage effect of the reservoir with the larger drainage area is weighted higher for the estimation of the joint storage capacity in case that multiple small reservoirs are arranged in the same configuration or that the two arrangements are combined in one sub basin it was started with the most upstream reservoirs their volumes were aggregated according to the respective rule then this intermediate equivalent volume was again lumped with the small reservoir further downstream and so on 3 1 3 parameterization of strategic reservoirs in swat a reservoir is basically described by the principal volume vpr the emergency volume vem and the respective flooded surface areas sapr and saem with these parameters the surface area volume curve is calculated and the water release is determined the gradual flood water release from the strategic reservoirs may best be modeled in swat with the target release for controlled reservoir function iresco 2 the outflow routine allows a gradual spilling of the water volume above a certain target volume vtarg and under the emergency volume vem the maximum storage capacity of each reservoir corresponding to a water level equal to the height of the weir crest was set as vpr considering that the spillways of all reservoirs in the catchment are uncontrollable free weirs vtarg was fixed as vpr for all months in order to guarantee a gradual water release over the spillway vem must be set substantially higher than vpr so that it is possibly never exceeded vem and saem are available for strategic reservoirs by the state water agency the parameter ndtarg representing the number of days required for releasing all excess water above vtarg determines the amount of water flowing out from the reservoir on each day it depends on the type and the width of the spillways in order to find a value for this parameter daily spillway discharges for different excess volumes were calculated for each strategic reservoir the discharge over the spillway in swat was calculated according to the commonly known weir overflow poleni equation aigner 2008 which depends on the width and the form of the spillway table 1 the weir type specific overflow coefficients were set according to the weir types 2 1 for benguê and mamoeiro 1 75 for poço da pedra and 1 6 for do coronel water levels were considered only up to a height slightly above the maximum observed elevation in the provided time series of the reservoirs 1 m above the spillway crest for benguê and mamoeiro 0 75 and 0 5 m for do coronel and poço da pedra respectively excess volumes were also calculated for water stages at 0 01 0 05 0 10 0 25 and 0 50 m above the spillway for all strategic reservoirs therefore the poleni equation was solved for half hourly time steps readjusting the water stage after each step based on the specific volume elevation curve the amounts of water released after each time step were added up obtaining the total water volume released in one day the values for the excess volume i e the volume above reservoir capacity were then plotted against the values for the calculated released water volume linear functions were fitted to the plots fig 3 with ndtarg equal to the inverse of the slopes of the straights the straight lines presented high coefficients of determination r2 0 9 which led to the conclusion that the spilling behaviour of such reservoirs could be suitably represented by the function implemented in swat the obtained values for ndtarg reveal that all the excess water is released within slightly more than one day for the reservoirs benguê and do coronel mamoeiro spills all the excess water in less than one day for the excess water to be released from poço da pedra however it takes more than two days these statements are only valid for the assumption that no water is entering the reservoir during this time in reality the spilling process is much more dynamic a simulation on hourly time steps would be much more precise but would lead to high computation time as the simulation step in swat was set to one day due to data availability limitations the approach presented here was considered the most appropriate way to estimate the daily released water volume the parameters iyres and mores year and month in which the reservoir was built respectively were set according to the available information the parameter evrsv the lake evaporation coefficient was set to 1 which represents the maximum value to guarantee high evaporation losses the parameter res k represents the hydraulic conductivity of the reservoir bottom it determines the losses through infiltration due to the professional planning and construction of the governmental reservoirs it was assumed that these dams were sufficiently sealed and res k was set to 0 the initial reservoir volume parameter res vol for benguê was obtained from recorded values shortly after the reservoir became operational in 2000 the initial storage volume represented about 4 of its capacity for mamoeiro which became operational in 2012 the initial volume was also set to 4 of its capacity however no further time series were available for mamoeiro for do coronel the observed storage volume on the first day of simulation in 1979 was obtained from the available records the time series for poço da pedra showed a gap for the years around 1979 the storage volume at that time was estimated based on all other values registered at the beginning of january in the other years and based on the rainfall measured in 1978 the mean annual rainfall was calculated from five rain gauges inside the study catchment both for the year 1978 and for the entire simulation period the annual rainfall in 1978 showed to be around 71 of the mean annual rainfall of the entire simulation period the average of registered reservoir volumes at the beginning of january amounted to 46 of the total capacity so the initial storage for poço da pedra was estimated with these percentages res vol 0 71 0 46 capacity table 2 summarizes the parameterization of reservoirs with a description of all parameters the representation of the withdrawal of water from the reservoirs was considered in the model in a simplified approach urban water supply and irrigation were represented by a constant monthly water withdrawal based on state water agency data for each strategic reservoir 3 1 4 parameterization of main private reservoirs except for the flooded areas measured through remote sensing at the end of the flood season of extremely wet years no data were available on the 14 main private reservoirs which were implemented as reservoir into the swat model as they typically dispose of some type of spillway it was assumed that the water storage effect of these dams was similar to that of the strategic reservoirs so their implementation followed the same principle the measured flooded area was set as sapr and the respective volume which was therefore estimated using the molle based approach was assumed as capacity and set as vpr moreover the volume corresponding to a water level of 1 5 m above the crest of the spillway was calculated and assumed as vem the height of 1 5 m was assumed as a reasonable value for the average height between spillway and dam crest assuming the same procedure of overflow analysis that was followed for the strategic reservoirs and general simplifications of spillway geometric properties it was found that the excess water is spilled within less than one day for almost all small reservoirs i e less than the model calculation time step the average ndtarg parameter was set as 1 for the main private reservoirs the application google timelapse was used to determine in which year each reservoir was built setting iyres accordingly this google function provides satellite images of many regions from the years 1984 until 2017 if it was seen that a dam had been present since 1984 it was assumed that it had been existing since 1979 in these cases mores was set to january in the other cases mores was set to november the ending of the dry season assuming that the dams are constructed during the dry season according to molle 1989 seepage does not occur in the flooded area of the reservoir due to the underlying crystalline bedrock but rather underneath the dam along the original river bed in the study the insufficient sealing and compaction of the dam structures were concluded to be the principal reason for infiltration losses so the seepage process implemented in swat assuming a loss through the flooded area neitsch et al 2009 does not adequately represent the infiltration process happening in the field in order not to neglect seepage losses from small reservoirs however the swat parameter res k hydraulic conductivity of reservoir bottom was set according to the average seepage rate found in molle 1989 which amounted to 2 64 mm per day 0 1 mm per hour for evaporation losses the same value of 1 for evrsv was defined as described for strategic reservoirs reservoirs that were built during the simulation period were assigned 0 as initial storage volume for the other reservoirs the initial storage was set according to the size class same as used in the studies presented here micro dams capacity 0 1 hm3 were assumed to be empty before the flood season in january small sized dams 0 1 hm3 capacity 1 hm3 were assumed to be at 10 of their capacity and the medium sized ones 1 hm3 capacity 10 hm3 were assumed to be at 20 of their capacity the remaining parameters were left as swat default a summary of the main private reservoir parameters can be found in table 2 3 1 5 parameterization of ponds the obtained equivalent capacity of a system of small reservoirs was set as the vpr of the aggregated pond of each sub basin the corresponding equivalent surface area was determined according to the same calculation rules setting it as the sapr of the lumped pond of each sub basin with the single reservoir volumes corresponding to a water level of 1 5 m above the spillway vem and saem of the aggregated ponds were calculated using the same method in swat it is not possible to set the date when a pond came into being so it had to be assumed that all ponds had been existing since the beginning of the simulation period which adds another source of uncertainty considering the transient nature of the micro dams and looking at the development of dam construction in the region analysed in malveira et al 2012 based on the considerations made for reservoir bottom percolation the respective parameter for infiltration through the pond bottom k pond was set as 0 1 mm h too from the investigation about the spilling behaviour it was found that only above the threshold value of 0 01 for the ratio of capacity to drainage area of the single small reservoirs it takes more than one day for the excess volume to be spilled ndtarg 1 0 from the highest value for ndtarg and the lowest one with the corresponding ratios a linear relation was set up based on this equation the ndtarg parameter was determined for all the small ponds that showed a ratio higher than 0 01 in case the pond was located at the outlet of a sub basin the interpolated value for ndtarg was assumed for the aggregated pond in the respective sub basin for the remaining sub basins with ponds the parameter was set to 1 initial storages of the aggregated ponds were also set based on the single small reservoirs located in the sub basin following the reservoir size class as aforementioned if at least one small reservoir of a higher reservoir size class small or medium sized dam is located in a sub basin the initial storage was set as a fraction of the capacity of this reservoir accordingly table 3 summarizes the parameterization of ponds 3 2 parameterization of dryland hydrology 3 2 1 model calibration approach the aim of the calibrated model is to describe the rainfall runoff relationship of the catchment with the reservoir system as a base for further investigations and scenario simulations studying the sensitivity and uncertainty of hydrological parameters is not the subject of this study based on the available data literature and the experience of the modelers the following methods were chosen for the calculation of infiltration evapotranspiration and channel routing respectively curve number method plant evaporation method and muskingum method the parameters of the model were calibrated with an iterative trial and error procedure with the objective of maximizing statistical model performance and minimizing bias in stream flow by keeping parameter values in a physically meaningful range initial values for the model parameters were derived from field data as much as possible then where field data from the case study area were not sufficient values from literature about dryland catchments were chosen to represent the characteristics of the study catchment finally remaining sensitive parameters were calibrated the model was calibrated separately for the sub catchments of the three large strategic reservoirs benguê poço da pedra and do coronel the simulated reservoir volume was compared to the time series for the strategic reservoirs as the mamoeiro reservoir became operational only in 2012 after the last year of the malhada station available time series 1979 2010 it was disregarded for the presented analysis the remaining sub basins were sub divided into three categories upstream sub basins with mountainous river reaches transition sub basins with medium order river reaches and down stream sub basins the sub division was done by personal judgment with regard to the topography slope classes and the order of the river reaches it is common in hydrological modeling to use warm up periods especially when the initial simulation conditions are not known a warm up is a sufficient period to run the model to initialize important variables or allow processes to reach a dynamic equilibrium the complexity of watershed scale processes impact the length of warm up periods for hydrological models however two to four years are recommended by model developers due to having a complete hydrological cycling in the modeling these periods are used by swat modelers in the arid and semiarid region for hydrological studies daggupati et al 2015 jajarmizadeh et al 2017 zettam et al 2017 kim et al 2018 carlos mendoza et al 2021 mengistu et al 2019 the calibration and validation of the model was performed using the technique of two fold cross validation considering the first two years as a warm up of the model simulation 1979 and 1980 the first half of the series 1981 1995 was used for calibration while the second half 1996 2010 was used for validation obtaining the statistical criteria for both series at the malhada station subsequently the second half of the series was used for calibration while the first half was used for validation the reservoir volume simulation was evaluated for the whole series but with a special highlight in the periods when each reservoir spilled out these periods have a greater importance due to the spillway overflow directly influencing the streamflow at the outlet of the catchment the simulated and observed time series of the reservoir s volume were overlain and their fitting was visually evaluated the years considered in the series for two fold cross validation have periods of flood and drought such as 1985 and 2004 rainy years and 1993 and 2005 drought years these rainy years were extremely wet years when all strategic reservoirs spilled out beyond these extreme years the preceding and following years were moderately wet to dry in this way the model could be evaluated for different extreme seasons and rainfall events for the calibration procedure the daily simulated stream flow were tried to match the daily observed stream flow at malhada gauging station evaluating the plausibility of the magnitude and the duration of the uncontrolled released discharges by reservoirs with regard to the stage discharge curves i e excess volume to released volume curves developed in this work to assess the fitting of daily streamflow hydrographs observed vs simulated a combination of three quantitative statistical criteria commonly applied in hydrological modeling was used the percent bias pbias the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the kling gupta efficiency kge 3 2 2 rainfall runoff process flood routing and channel transmission losses the dominant vegetation caatinga resembles the vegetation type rangeland the manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow for rangeland with 20 vegetation cover was provided in neitsch et al 2009 the maximum canopy storage canmx was set to 1 5 mm as the average value for canopy storage in an arid environment stated in attarod et al 2015 the parameters sol awc available water capacity and sol k saturated hydraulic conductivity were derived by applying pedo transfer functions ptf based on brazilian literature for each soil layer supplementary material three soil types latosol vermelho amarelo bruno não calcio and litolicos eu textura arenosa had characteristics of vertic soils for them the bypass flow function of swat was activated for a reach of the middle jaguaribe river costa et al 2013 found that at the end of regular moist rainy seasons the river becomes a losing gaining system with its streamflow being sustained from base flow occurring in the underlying alluvium the test reach represented a high order river in lower areas as the principal rivers and tributaries in the study catchment are embedded in layers of alluvium as well similar effects of streamflow being sustained by backflow from these alluvium bodies may also be expected therefore river reaches were classified into three orders in the model high order reach medium order reach and upstream tributary swat allows to calculate water movement from the shallow aquifer to the root zone which is controlled by the groundwater revap coefficient gw revap for the respective sub basins the gw revap was set accordingly to different values decreasing in magnitude with increasing reach order according to the findings in costa et al 2013 transmission losses increase with increasing discharges due to a higher hydraulic head in order to include a more appropriate approach for transmission losses on a catchment scale the parameters ch k2 effective hydraulic conductivity of the channel alluvium in main river reaches and ch n2 manning s roughness coefficient for main channels were set to different values depending on the topographic position of the sub basins and the slope classes in the vicinity of the main river reaches the calibration of other parameters such as esco soil evaporation compensation coefficient alpha bnk bank flow recession coefficient alpha bf base flow recession coefficient gw delay delay time for aquifer recharge gwqmn threshold water level in shallow aquifer for base flow revapmn threshold water level in shallow aquifer for evaporation and trnsrch fraction of the transmission losses partitioned to the deep aquifer can be seen in a summary in the tables 4 6 table 4 presents parameters set for the entire catchment table 5 presents parameters set for specific sub basins of the catchment with distinction between sub catchments of two strategic reservoirs and topographic position of sub basins table 6 presents parameters set for specific zones in the catchment with distinction between soil types 3 3 reservoir scenarios one of the goals of this investigation is to assess the impact of the small reservoirs ponds and main private reservoirs on the model streamflow and volume series as the estimate of those structures was made mainly with the help of aerial images there is considerable uncertainty in this process thus in order to investigate different scenarios for the dimensions of the small reservoirs res esa res evol res psa res pvol and res vol and ponds pnd psa pnd pvol pnd esa pnd evol and pnd vol their volumes were multiplied by factor zero and the factor ten these parameters represent areas and volumes that were estimated by the analysis of aerial images in the model see section 2 2 2 0 time means the total absence of small reservoirs and was chosen to show how the model behaves without these small reservoirs 10 times means a ten times increase in the aforementioned parameters that represent the volumes of these small reservoirs with these modifications the model was run from 1979 to 2010 to assess their impact on the simulation of the streamflow at the malhada station and of the volumes and the spillway overflows for the strategic reservoirs we especially evaluated the peak values of the streamflow hydrograph at the malhada station and the number of days of spillway overflow in the strategic reservoirs in addition another scenario approach was performed to assess the impact of the reservoirs on the simulated streamflow at the outlet the general influence of reservoirs was performed considering 4 scenarios i considering all strategic reservoirs and small reservoirs reference ii removing all small reservoirs in the hydrological system but keeping only the strategic reservoirs iii removing all strategic reservoirs but keeping only the small reservoirs iv removing all reservoirs the model was run for the whole series with these hypothetical scenarios ii iii and iv and the streamflow at malhada station was compared with the reference scenario i fig 4 illustrates the main flowchart of this study with a summary of all methods applied 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation of streamflow the most relevant parameters in swat simulations in this study were identified as sol crk trnsrch ch k2 lat time revapmn gw revap and ch n1 it is worth mentioning that cn2 showed only low sensitivity even though it was often reported as very sensitive in other catchments we explain that with the climatic and soil characteristics of the area where soil moisture and infiltration processes more often underlie extreme dry or wet conditions than elsewhere in this study the first two years 1979 and 1980 were considered as warm up period for adjustment of internal processes e g soil moisture redistribution that moves from an estimated initial condition to a realistic state the model performance during the two fold cross validation periods was assessed with the three previously presented statistical performance criteria table 7 presents the obtained values for each for the calibration validation periods these values indicate a good model performance the analysis of the values for both nse and kge attested a good overall fit of the simulated and observed hydrographs at malhada station the model simulated streamflow peaks with fairly high accuracy with regard to their dates of occurrence and their magnitudes when calibrating the model with the first half of the series 1981 1995 the model overestimated streamflow values highly negative pbias for the second half 1996 2010 when calibrating the model with the second half of the series 1996 2010 the model underestimated the streamflow values highly positive pbias for the first half 1981 1995 fig 5 depicts the observed and the simulated hydrographs for the calibration validation periods while fig 6 depicts the log flow duration curve for these periods for better display fig 7 shows close ups of hydrographs with a logarithmic scale streamflow for the single years 1985 and 2004 during which relevant discharges were observed these years were chosen because they represent the wettest years allowing a full analysis of the hydrograph rising limb the peak flow and the recession flow for dry years with low precipitations and consequently low flows the analysis of these hydrograph characteristics would be limited fig 5 a b 6 a b and 7 a b present results for 1981 1995 calibration and 1996 2010 validation and c and d in both figures present results for 1996 2010 calibration and 1981 1995 validation for fig 7 only the first half of the year the wet season period is presented as for the rest of the year neither observed nor simulated discharges occur the dry season it is remarked that the scale of the vertical axis is adapted for each year the results show that the model was able to simulate dry years in which no or only minor discharges are registered 1983 1993 2001 and 2005 at the malhada gauging station for these years no water reached the outlet of the catchment so the hydrograph was not presented here this indicates that both the storage capacity of the single reservoirs and the losses due to evapotranspiration and riverbed infiltration were estimated sufficiently high for years with near average water yield the model accuracy was good for some years 1984 1987 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1999 and 2003 but was rather poor in others 1986 1989 1995 1997 2000 2002 and 2006 2008 for these years with worse accuracy until 2002 the peak streamflow was underestimated which means that the observed streamflow has higher peaks and more water reaching the outlet from 2006 to 2008 the model overestimated the peak streamflow these results can be seen in fig 5 for 2009 the modeled peak was clearly overestimated the graphs clarify that for wet years during which the large reservoirs spilled out 1985 and 2004 the days of extreme flood events high peaks were matched with high accuracy by the model the magnitude of the simulated peaks was within a similar range than those of the observed ones however the flow recession was not well represented by the model it was found that it is characteristic for the study area that the streamflow lasted for many days after strong consecutive rain events the abrupt recession of the simulated hydrograph at the end of wet periods with streamflow going down to zero just after a few days the peak occurred in all simulation results while in the observed hydrograph the streamflow lasts for a few days after extremely rainy periods water accumulates in the regions close to the river channel forming flood plains the river recharge process after this period is notably complex with unsaturated seepage and vertical unsaturated subsurface water redistribution beneath the stream lateral stream aquifer interaction and groundwater flow parallel to the river course in unconfined aquifers these processes and the channel transmission losses for arid and semi arid watersheds are very simplified in the swat model and have a great influence on these basins costa et al 2012 some of the years with moderate rain showed worse accuracy in peak streamflow hydrographs limbs and recession flow either with underestimation or with overestimation in the simulated values depending on the year of analysis those years with near average streamflow require attention in the hydrological simulations mainly due to the possible unsaturated characteristics of the soil transmission losses are more complex in these years and the swat model equation is relatively simple depending on hydraulic conductivity flow translation time wet perimeter and channel length uncertainties in the input data were one of the difficulties during modeling in this dryland catchment mainly in the values of hydraulic conductivity the values of hydraulic conductivity and transmission losses estimated also affected the recession flow whose simulated values also showed streamflow results with sharper drops than the observed values in the hydrographs after the rainy season in all cases there is uncertainty in rainfall data lack of continuous rain gauge monitoring in some days and human errors in measurements although the 44 stations available in the catchment can reduce errors no significant errors were found despite that errors of rainfall data during storm events can significantly impact modeling even interpolation cannot compensate for gaps in the recording of the local variability of rain 4 2 simulation of reservoir volume the simulated storage volumes during the cross validation of the three strategic reservoirs poço da pedra benguê and do coronel are presented for comparing their values and temporal dynamics with the observed values based on data availability and operation periods fig 8 from the diagrams it can be seen that the peaks during flood year 2004 were matched well for the three reservoirs the model simulated the filling of the reservoir very well until the storage capacity was exceeded for the other years the model simulated that the capacity was exceeded for 1986 1988 1990 1997 and 2009 2010 for poço da pedra 2006 2009 for benguê and 2009 for do coronel analyzing fig 8 the storage volume in poço da pedra and benguê reservoirs was higher overestimated in some years besides the periods that the simulated storage of the reservoir reached the maximum volume 1988 1990 1997 and 2009 2010 for poço da pedra and 2006 2007 for benguê when the observed data showed a value quite distant from that the evolution of the hydrograph however was well represented by the model for do coronel the curve of simulated storage volume showed slightly overestimated values compared to the observed ones for the years after and before the flood years the overall dynamics is better simulated than for the other two reservoirs despite these differences in storage volumes of poço da pedra and benguê we did not find any systematic error the years of 1997 2008 and 2009 for example showed considerable streamflow at malhada gauging station while the years of 1998 2001 and 2010 showed low streamflow there were no direct discharge measurements upstream from the studied reservoirs storage volumes were used to validate the reservoir modeling approach on the other hand from 2008 to 2010 the model overestimated the storage volumes in poço da pedra as well as the streamflow at malhada gauging station in these years especially in 2009 some characteristics of dryland environments cause uncertainties for modeling of rainfall runoff processes for example the nonlinear behavior of runoff generation and the irregular spatial patterns of soil properties rödiger et al 2014 mamede et al 2018 the fall of the storage volume during the dry period too was modeled very realistically for the years before and after a flood year the curves fitted very well for reservoirs the slope of the curve after a rainy season was a little more pronounced in the model this period is characterized by intense evaporation and a decrease in the volume of the reservoirs for semiarid sub basins and the parameter that calculates the evaporation evrsv in the reservoirs in the model was established at the highest possible value see table 2 the catchment of benguê reservoir was modeled by mamede et al 2018 using the wasa sed model güntner et al 2004 bronstert et al 2014 for the period 2000 2012 the wasa sed model also simulates the impact of the small reservoirs on the generated catchment runoff as aforementioned the wasa sed results for the storage volumes of the benguê reservoir were very similar to those produced by the swat model presented here although the wasa sed model was specifically adjusted only for the benguê catchment furthermore it can be seen that the model simulated the release from the reservoir during flood events within the calibration and validation periods fig 9 both the durations and the magnitudes of the overflow discharges seem plausible for all reservoirs according to the specific stage discharge curves edited for this study the simulated maximum discharge from poço da pedra corresponds to a water stage of about 60 cm above the spillway crest the maximum simulated overflow discharge from do coronel would cause the water stage to reach a height of 40 cm above the spillway crest the maximum discharge from benguê corresponded to a water stage higher than 2 m above the spillway crest 2 1 m is given as the maximum water level above the spillway so in this case it may be assumed that the model overestimated the outflow but as the outflow from the spillway represents a dynamic process depending on hourly flood events the water stage may be kept constant during a longer time span leading to higher discharges than the one predicted by the stage discharge curves which assume no further inflow to the reservoir as no information was available regarding the spillway overflow from the reservoirs no further comments on the plausibility of the outflow hydrographs were done however the results were an indication that the filling and emptying processes in reservoirs may be mimicked realistically with the swat model even on a daily time step which was rarely shown before beyond the results presented for reservoirs an analysis was also made for the number of days on which the three reservoirs overflowed these results were taken from analysis of the simulation counting the days when each reservoir exceeded capacity resulting in spillway overflow during the simulation period 1979 2010 these values were compared with the number of spillway overflow days from the state water agency observed data for each reservoir the results were presented in table 8 the model greatly overestimated the number of days with spillway overflow mainly for poço da pedra and benguê this is an expected result since the hydrographs of these reservoirs for model simulation had several years reaching their capacities on the other hand for do coronel the results were very close a greater number of days of spillway overflow from the reservoirs implies that more water reaches the outlet of the catchment increasing the simulated streamflow values this could be clearly seen in 2009 where all reservoirs overflowed and consequently the simulated peak flow at the malhada station was much higher than the observed peak flow other years that also had simulated streamflow rates greater than those observed 2006 2007 2008 and 2010 coincided with the overflow of the reservoirs having a higher number of days in these years fig 10 depicts the outflow hydrographs for four selected main private dams implemented as reservoirs for the entire simulation period 1979 2010 the two main private reservoirs with the largest drainage area and the largest storage volume no 46 and no 146 respectively and the largest main private reservoirs for poço da pedra catchment no 123 and benguê catchment no 17 were chosen for presentation see fig 1 as they had the highest hydrological impact the diagrams showed that water release from the reservoirs 17 46 and 123 was simulated by the model only in some years with the spilling lasting only for a couple of days as presented before it was expected that such medium sized reservoirs spill out only in wet years after consecutive strong rain events these results agree with this field observation hence the spilling behavior seems realistic with regard to the spillway outflow simulated for these main private reservoirs the magnitude of the discharges were consistent considering the smaller drainage areas and the spillway widths estimated consequently it may be stated that the estimation of the reservoir capacity and the model parameterization were reasonable no other information nor observed data was available for these reservoirs therefore the plausibility of the results may not be assessed more specifically the higher frequency and duration of spilling of reservoir number 146 simulated by the model were due to the fact that the soil type present in that area does not have any cracking potential therefore the soil was saturated faster and more runoff was generated leading to a faster filling of the reservoir as the spillway outflow magnitudes were consistent to the drainage area and the spillway width and the parametrization was based on the calibration of the volume of do coronel reservoir located nearby it may be assumed that these results too were reasonable 4 3 impact of the reservoir network on streamflow and reservoir volume simulations the influence of reservoirs on the outflow of the catchment was first investigated with the following four scenarios for the whole flow series 1979 2010 i considering all strategic reservoirs and small reservoirs reference ii removing all small reservoirs in the hydrological system but keeping only the strategic reservoirs iii removing all strategic reservoirs but keeping only the small reservoirs iv removing all reservoirs table 9 presents a comparison for the model results criteria pbias nse and kge between the four scenarios the analysis of the statistical criteria in table 9 showed that removing strategic reservoirs significantly reduced the pbias which means an increase in the simulated streamflow in the outlet also nse and kge decreased this result is in line with the expectations due to the decrease in retention by removing the reservoirs besides that to illustrate the results obtained for wet years the year of 2004 was chosen to show the comparison between the simulations with the streamflow in the outlet at logarithmic scale fig 11 the streamflow hydrograph showed that during the first increasing limb the scenarios had a similar slope but the scenarios iii and iv reached a higher peak flow scenarios iii and iv do not have strategic reservoirs therefore water retention was lower in the catchment after this point all the scenarios showed similar results as the differences between scenarios i and ii and between scenarios iii and iv were very small this result also showed that the presence of small reservoirs did not significantly alter the streamflow during the rainy season the water retention due to small reservoirs in wet years was 2 the decreasing limb and the recession flow showed the same aspect observed in model calibration with the end of wet periods to be abrupt with streamflow going down to zero faster than the observed values probably due to river aquifer interaction processes that were not catched by swat as aforementioned this behaviour is also seen in other wetted years such as 1985 and 2009 not shown here therefore these results indicated that the basin under study is far from reaching its maximum water reserve capacity especially considering the saturation of small reservoirs all scenarios overestimate the observed streamflow data which can be seen more clearly on the cumulative streamflow representation fig 11 for the scenarios i and ii during the intermediate rainy season the simulated recession flow was higher than the observed one mainly from 02 2004 to 03 2004 furthermore the scenarios iii and iv reached a higher peak flow at the beginning of the rainy season due to the absence of the strategic reservoirs to illustrate the results obtained for dry years with low flows the year of 2003 was chosen to show the comparison between the simulations and the observed data with the streamflow in the outlet at logarithmic scale fig 12 the results were very similar to those obtained for wet years all scenarios overestimate the observed streamflow data however the differences between scenarios i and ii and between scenarios iii and iv showed that the presence of small reservoirs is more significant for reducing the cumulative streamflow during a dry year the water retention due to small reservoirs in dry years was 9 other studies have also shown that small reservoirs decrease low flows with a more intense reduction in dry years perrin et al 2012 habets et al 2018 now modifying the dimensions of the small reservoirs ten times we found a lower streamflow peak for the estimation with small reservoirs parameters ten times larger than the reference original parameterization this result was expected because with more small reservoirs in the catchment more water retention is observed which means less outflow to the malhada station despite this the comparison of scenario simulations the absence of small reservoirs the reference and the larger dimensions of small reservoirs for peak flow increasing and decreasing limb were very close with no considerable differences between the model scenarios for small reservoirs even in dry years not shown here the analysis of the reservoir volumes for the scenarios was carried out by a comparison of the time series of the storage volumes figs 13 15 the results showed a small difference for the storage volume in the poço da pedra reservoir fig 13 considering the changes in the dimensions of the small reservoirs for the benguê and do coronel reservoirs figs 14 and 15 respectively the differences in the storage volume can be observed more clearly between 2002 and 2004 with larger volumes for the 0 times simulation which means the absence of small reservoirs and slightly smaller volumes for the 10 times simulation once again this was an expected result because by decreasing the small reservoirs more water can reach the strategic reservoirs increasing the storage volumes however the differences between the simulations were not considerable to conclude for a relevant impact of small reservoirs on those catchments previous studies suggest a relatively high impact of small reservoirs on the catchment water retention from 10 to 20 de araújo and medeiros 2013 peter et al 2014 mamede et al 2018 habets et al 2018 while the present model with new representation of small reservoirs in swat showed a lower impact on the water inflow for strategic reservoirs about 2 of water retention in wet years and about 9 in dry years the study basin has an estimate of 230 reservoirs distributed over a total catchment area of 3 347 km2 resulting in 1 reservoir per 14 5 km2 reservoir density for semi arid regions the variability of spatial distribution and density of small reservoirs varies significantly between 0 and 4 2 reservoirs per km2 mady et al 2020 in comparison with other dryland regions the conceição river catchment reservoir density is 25 times bigger than reservoir density in california usa as reported by minear and kondolf 2009 for example despite the large number of reservoirs in the upper jaguaribe basin ujb where the study area is located we found a reservoir density 2 5 times smaller than that of the whole ujb which is 1 reservoir per 6 km2 lima neto et al 2011 this indicates that the study area can still be considered to have a high density of reservoirs although it has a lower reservoir density than the average of the ujb furthermore considering the observed data from 1979 to 2010 the main hydrologic fluxes of the study are annual precipitation annual potential evapotranspiration and annual streamflow of 605 mm 2 328 mm and 67 8 hm3 year 20 3 mm respectively the total estimated reservoir capacity is 113 1 hm3 or 33 8 mm of which 94 0 hm3 28 1 mm comes from three strategic reservoirs ponds and main private reservoirs 226 have only 19 1 hm3 5 7 mm on average 0 085 hm3 0 025 mm per small reservoir even increasing the volume estimates of small reservoirs by ten times the average volume per area of each small reservoir 0 25 mm remains very small in comparison with strategic reservoirs and the aforementioned hydrologic fluxes moreover as the stream flow are normally concentrated in a few days of the year in this catchment the surface runoff has much more volume than the capacity of the small reservoirs even for forcing moderate rainfall events although the results obtained in this work represent hydrological aspects of a specific catchment in the brazilian semiarid region the methodology for assessing the impact of small reservoirs and the discussion of hydrological processes such as peak flow and non flow periods channel transmission losses analysis at the beginning and end of the rainy season in the streamflow gauge station hydrographs and in the storage volume of reservoirs as well as the parameterization of the dense network of reservoirs can also be applied to large scale catchments located in other dryland regions some examples include semi arid watersheds in australia united states mexico and south asia which present similar climate hydrological and land use characteristics 5 conclusions in this study we assessed the impact of small reservoirs on a dryland catchment with a high density network of reservoirs and investigated the water routing dynamics and hydrological processes in the basin for this purpose a model was developed to simulate the catchment streamflow at the outlet the storage volumes of large reservoirs and the water balance of lumped small reservoirs at sub basin scale a methodology for the parameterization of the small reservoirs was developed to represent their integration into the catchment hydrological modeling and to investigate their influence on the hydrological outputs streamflow and reservoir volume storage of the basin the main findings of our work can be described as follows 1 the model proved to be well suited for simulating peak flow in wet years the non flow periods and the rising limb of the hydrograph with high reliability for the streamflow at the catchment outlet 2 in the strategic reservoirs wet and dry years were well represented as well as the magnitude of spillway overflow of strategic and small reservoirs on the other hand the number of days with spillway overflow showed to be overestimated 3 the proposed model presents an innovative way to represent a dense network of reservoirs in semi arid basins in catchment hydrological models the efforts in the parameterization and aggregation of ponds and reservoirs proved to be worthwhile allowing a more accurate spatial representation of the strategic and small reservoirs in the swat model for high density networks and improving the analysis of the hydrological processes and impacts in the basin 4 the presence of small reservoirs decreased the stream flow and storage downstream reservoir volumes with only 2 of water retention on average increasing the volumes of small reservoirs along the basin by ten times showed that the small ponds had a low influence on stream discharge the catchment under study is far from reaching its maximum water reserve capacity especially considering the current density of small reservoirs however in dry years their impact can reach 9 of water retention which may worsen periods of water scarcity in the large reservoirs for semi arid catchments the reliability of the results for peak flow in wet years for non flow periods and for the rising limb of the hydrograph is very important for the simulation of the stream flow reaching the large reservoirs and consequently for meeting the water demand at catchment scale however future improvements should be done in the model for better representations in recession flow since the results of the present study pointed to a low influence of the network of small reservoirs on the stream flow and strategic reservoir storages the small reservoirs in the catchment might be an option to increase decentralized water access for small rural communities without competing with other water uses such as large and medium sized city sanitation demands and irrigation industry from the strategic reservoirs the spatial representation of small reservoirs for a high density network in the swat model and the results of the cumulative impact of small reservoirs presented in this study contributed to a better understanding of hydrology in dryland catchments and can be applied to catchments in similar climatic and socio economic environments further studies on the swat model in semi arid regions will evaluate different arrangements for the increase of small reservoirs in the basin and their impact on reservoir water quality such studies should also be concerned with investigating channel transmission losses and river aquifer interactions based on comparison with additional intermittent groundwater data the coupling of surface and groundwater models will potentially improve the understanding of dryland hydrology and integrated water resources
