11465,oasis areas of arid inland river basins in northwest china have been facing intensified water use conflicts between agricultural sector and eco environmental systems since 1990s the reduction of river water allocation to oasis has resulted in the undesirable declines of groundwater levels gwls with the increase in irrigated area and groundwater pumping improving water management and restoring gwls become a great concern for those areas in this study the middle oasis of heihe river basin hrb was selected as the representative case for such an endeavor a three dimensional groundwater flow model was established for the zhangye basin a sub basin of hrb to obtain a better understanding of groundwater dynamics in middle oasis particularly for investigating the effects of agricultural water use a major advantage of this model is that the spatial and temporal recharge from irrigation has been described in details with considering the result obtained by an ago hydrological model swap epic simulation the model was well calibrated and validated over the period of 1991 2010 simulation of gwls matched well with the observed 20 year gwls in the 50 wells then spatiotemporal groundwater dynamics and groundwater budget were quantitatively analyzed for the zhangye basin during 1991 2010 in particular the modeling results revealed three different changing trends of gwls based on the analysis of groundwater dynamics and budget for four representative zones results indicated that negative balance of groundwater was mainly caused by over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation resulting in a gwl decline of 9 cm a 1 in average and even 2 m decline in some years at local areas the area with critical groundwater depth e g 5 m has reduced about 30 in 2010 as compared to that in 1991 finally recommendations on how to restore gwls were proposed with emphasis on irrigation water and land use adjustment and groundwater pumping control our results are expected to provide implications for recovering the groundwater status in oasis areas of inland river basins in arid northwest china keywords numerical modeling groundwater level water budget irrigation management modflow 1 introduction water scarcity and resulting water use conflicts have become a great concern to river basin management in arid and semi arid areas worldwide the challenge is more serious to most arid inland river basins with large irrigated agriculture ji et al 2006 white et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 in arid northwest china the rapid expansion of irrigated agriculture has further aggravated the water use conflicts between agriculture and eco environment in the basin in recent decades the conflicts are especially striking for most inland river basins i e tarim river basin heihe river basin shiyanghe river basin and shule river basin fig 1 especially since 1990s cheng et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 the ecological water diversion project ewdp has been implemented in these basins with the purpose of decreasing river water allocation to artificial oasis and aiming to restore ecosystems in downstream basin since 2000 cheng et al 2014 however application of ewdp has resulted in over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation supplement and thus continuous decline of groundwater levels gwls and ecosystem deterioration in the oasis cheng et al 2014 kang et al 2008 huang and pang 2010 zhang et al 2014 therefore a thorough understanding of long term groundwater dynamics affected by agricultural water use is quite necessary and should be the basis for restoring groundwater environment in oasis areas various researches have been carried out to investigate the hydrological processes for seeking reasonable groundwater management in oasis areas the studies involve different aspects of processes and various techniques related to groundwater system e g traditional field experiments jiang et al 2015 chen et al 2006 geostatistical analysis hu et al 2012 remote sensing inversion zhao et al 2013 simulation modeling li and zhao 2010 peng and xu 2010 water chemistry huang and pang 2010 and tracer temperature or isotope experiments huang and pang 2010 yao et al 2015a zhu et al 2008 recently the regional scale hydrological modeling is increasingly considered as a promising tool accomplishing the research objectives cheng et al 2014 in particular the models with groundwater flow model as the core are preferred and widely adopted in former literatures because of the important role of groundwater and its frequent interactions with surface water in oasis areas zhou et al 2011 wu et al 2014 li et al 2017 huo et al 2011 danierhan et al 2013 xie et al 2012 in such way all the key aspects of hydrological cycles and their interactions could be combined and integrated in the modeling however in most previous studies in arid inland river basins of northwest china the effects of agricultural irrigation on hydrological cycle are significant but usually treated with very simple and not necessarily physically sound approaches for instance irrigation recharge including canal seepage field deep percolation is often simplified as an empirical ratio to irrigation or even uniform distribution in an irrigation system e g wen et al 2007 huo et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 yao et al 2015b nevertheless note that they often have very strong spatial and temporal variations in oasis affected by water conveyance and field irrigation conditions irrigation management crop patterns soils etc jiang et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 jiang 2017 the over simplified approaches are partly caused by the limitation of data availability and partly due to the poor understanding of the agro hydrological processes on the other hand the groundwater dynamic analysis in most previous studies are carried out with a relatively short calibration period mainly 2 6 years e g huo et al 2011 hu et al 2007 xie et al 2012 wu et al 2014 this may not well reflect the long term dynamics of groundwater dynamics in oasis area therefore this study is to investigate the long term effect of intense agricultural activities on groundwater dynamics in recent decades with the middle oasis of the heihe river basin as a typical example mainly taking into account the huge amounts of shared data in hydrology hydrogeology agriculture land use pattern etc the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in china covering an area of 128 000 km2 it consists of an upstream mountain area a piedmont plain and fine soil valley plain in midstream area i e middle oasis and a downstream area of gobi desert and wetlands fig 1 in recent years excessive diversion for agriculture in the middle oasis has resulted in inadequate discharge to the downstream areas this has raised a few significant ecological issues especially since 1990s typically as natural vegetation degradation soil desertification and terminal lake shrinkage guo et al 2009 cheng et al 2014 with the application of ewdp the positive effects are observed in downstream area at least in the short term e g the recovery of juyan lake and wetlands zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 in another aspect more groundwater is exploited for irrigation and significant gwl decline is observed in many parts of middle oasis since 1980s as reported in some previous studies e g zhou et al 2011 mi et al 2015 jiang 2017 the shrinkage of wetland and degradation of natural vegetation has occurred in some local regions thus it is essential to quantitatively recognize the effects of agricultural activities on water cycle and groundwater dynamics at present how to prevent the water table decline and recover the groundwater environment is becoming an urgent issue for the middle oasis taking into account the above mentioned issues this paper aims at exploring the long term groundwater dynamics in middle oasis in recent two decades with detailed consideration of irrigation effects on the basis of previous groundwater modeling and agro hydrological modeling the large volume datasets particularly related to canal conveyance groundwater exploitation field irrigation etc were collected with support of the heihe plan i e a key research plan integrated research on eco hydrological process of heihe river basin us 23 million by national science foundation of china a modflow based three dimensional 3d groundwater flow model was established for zhangye basin a sub basin in middle oasis during 1991 2010 it included improved description of sources from irrigation based on detailed agro hydrological modeling analysis the major objectives were to reproduce the spatiotemporal groundwater dynamics over a long term period 1991 2010 and to identify the main impact factors and to foresee the possible strategies for recovery of groundwater tables in oasis areas the research findings can be applied to similar oasis in other inland river basins in arid northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location geography and climate the middle oasis is defined as the region between the yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge consisting of four sub basins i e zhangye jiuquan east jiuquan west and shandan fig 1 it is one of the most important grain and seed production bases in northwest china it consumes more than 90 of available surface water from the heihe river and contributes approximately 90 of agricultural production value of hrb the mainstream of heihe river mainly flows across the zhangye basin 38 6 39 8 n and 99 2 100 8 e which has the largest irrigated agriculture in middle oasis in addition the zhangye basin is a closed basin with relatively distinctive hydrogeological boundary conditions wen et al 2007 hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 in this study the zhangye basin was thus chosen as the simulation domain for groundwater modeling and long term dynamic assessment fig 1 huge amounts of data were available from the heihe plan as presented in table 1 related to hydrology hydrogeology agriculture land use pattern etc the zhangye basin covers the main area of three counties of ganzhou linze and gaotai covering an area of 5500 km2 it is bounded by qilian mountain to the southwest and longshou mountain and heli mountain to the northeast fig 1 there are two typical topographies i e alluvial proluvial fan in front of qilian mountain and river valley fine soil plain fig 2 the topography has a slope of 40 for alluvial proluvial fan and became flat in fine soil plain with an average slope of 2 land surface elevation ranges from 860 m and 2300 m above sea level asl in the northeast plain area and the southwest mountain front area respectively the study area has a typically arid continental climate precipitation is about 140 mm per year mainly occurring in the summer season whereas the mean annual evaporation 20 cm pan reaches to 2050 mm 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology the zhangye basin is underlain by quaternary sediments mainly the diluvium and alluvial deposits the aquifer system mainly includes the stratum of holocene q4 upper pleistocene q3 and middle pleistocene q2 fig 2 the stratum for early pleistocene q1 is composed of consolidated sediments forming the non permeable bottom boundary for the quaternary aquifer system in the alluvial proluvial fan the q4 stratum is mainly composed of alluvium finer soils sandy gravels and gravels with thickness ranging at 5 30 m the deposits for underlain q3 and q2 are the well sorted pebbles gravels and sand gravels with thickness of 50 100 m and 150 200 m respectively in fine soil plain the deposits for q1 q3 and q4 are similar to that in the alluvial proluvial fan but with finer texture however the q2 stratum has more complex deposits i e gravels and sand gravels interlaced with two low permeable layers clay or loam clay about 5 20 m thickness for each layer thus on the basis of the properties of stratum deposits a single layer water bearing stratum is identified at the alluvial proluvial fan in front of mountain areas meanwhile the multi layer water bearing strata are defined for the fine soil plain including interlaced two low permeable layers for q2 the heihe river and its main tributary liyuanhe river are two main rivers in zhangye basin with average annual runoff of 1 59 billion m3 and 0 23 billion m3 respectively the annual runoff for each of other five tributary rivers is only about 0 011 0 04 billion m3 except for the heihe river surface runoff in other rivers is intercepted by reservoirs and diverted for irrigation note that the six tributary rivers mainly recharge the groundwater as they are intercepted at mountain front fig 1 however the river seepage is too small and is generally negligible hu et al 2007 iggs 2002 for the heihe river the river water strongly recharges groundwater in upstream front mountain area with deeper groundwater depths gwds through seepage i e with seepage of 0 15 billion m3 per year from the yingluo gorge to heihe bridge hu et al 2007 iggs 2002 then the complicated and strong exchanges seepage base flow and spring take place in the valley plain area with shallower gwds irrigation water diverted from the heihe river would largely recharge the groundwater system and finally return back to the heihe river in spring and lateral flow the annual groundwater recharge to heihe river is about 0 7 billion m3 during 1980s iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 as estimated using isotope and temperature tracer however it becomes smaller as groundwater level declines in the past 20 years for instance the flux of a typical spring has decreased from 129 6 l s 1 in 1986 to 51 0 l s 1 in 2011 2 1 3 water use conditions and crop planting there are totally seventeen irrigation districts in zhangye basin fig 3 a including twelve fed by heihe river one fed by liyuan river and the rest smaller ones in the front mountain area the amount of irrigation water is kept at 1 6 1 7 billion m3 accounting for over 90 of the total water use in the basin due to ewdp irrigation water diverted from the river was reduced from 1 65 to 1 35 billion m3 from 1990s to 2010s while the water pumped from aquifers increased from 0 15 to 0 35 billion m3 fig 3b the total irrigation water use remained almost the same due to various reasons related to technique and management issues jiang et al 2015 jiang 2017 the number of groundwater pumping wells were less than 2000 in 1991 but increased to more than 8000 in 2012 in the basin the irrigation water use per unit area actually decreased mainly because of the large investment in canal systems construction i e canal lining and water project regulation and cease of intercropping fig 3c f up to 2011 the percentage of lined canal respectively reached to about 85 and 80 for main canals and tributaries respectively which effetively reduced the canal loss and seepgae however the farmland area has expanded from 90 000 ha to 150 000 ha during 1991 2010 which resulted in little change in total amount of irrigation water a continuous decrease was observed for areas of grass forest water and bare land meanwhile the amount of water for industrial and domestic use increased from 0 05 to 0 09 billion m3 which was almost entirely from groundwater pumping some part of diverted river water was also applied to eco environment sector increasing from 0 05 to 0 09 billion m3 after the application of ewdp overall the total water use for all sectors in zhangye basin varied slightly around 1 8 billion m3 during 1991 2010 the cropping pattern has changed greatly during the last three decades the main crop changed from forage corn and wheat in 1990s to grain corn after 2000 the area for wheat reduced significantly and the intercropping pattern was almost abandoned the remaining irrigated areas also included other croplands e g planted with wheat barley cotton cabbage tomato and pepper and some scattered grasslands and woodlands silt loam and loam are widely distributed in the cultivated farmlands while coarse textured soils are also typical in northeast area of downstream basin surface basin irrigation is the common method there are generally 4 5 irrigation events during crop season april september and also a winter irrigation in november for maintaining appropriate soil moisture conditions for seedling growth in the subsequent spring field deep percolation is relatively large due to the large irrigation amount with relatively large variation in space and time 2 2 model description the modflow 2005 was utilized to develop the groundwater flow model of the zhangye basin with reasonably considering the recharge from field irrigation determined by using an ago hydrological model swap epic modflow is a modular 3d model that includes modules to simulate steady state or transient groundwater flow in confined unconfined aquifers harbaugh 2005 the model is based on solving the 3d partial differential equation of groundwater flow using the finite difference method the governing equation for groundwater flow is as follows 1 x k xx h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy kzz are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y z coordinate axes which are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h is the groundwater level l w are the source sink terms with w 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and w 0 for flow into the system t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 and t is time t the source code of modflow is open and easily accessible various packages have been readily incorporated into the modflow to treat the different boundary conditions and the source sink terms typically as the packages of recharge rch well wel river riv drainage drn and evapotranspiration segments ets modflow has become a powerful and widely used tool in hydrological or hydrogeological competition research and groundwater management particularly the swap epic model was used to help describe the spatiotemporal recharge from field irrigation which was the main source for groundwater with the most uncertainties in zhangye basin swap epic was a one dimensional 1d physical based agro hydrological model that could simulate soil water flow solute transport and crop growth on a field scale and daily time step xu et al 2013 soil water flow and solute transport were described based on the vertically 1d richards equation and advection dispersion equation respectively crop growth and yield were calculated using the modified epic crop growth model more detailed calculation principles for swap epic could be found in xu et al 2013 meanwhile the gis based swap epic has been proposed for simulating the regional agro hydrological processes in a distributed manner by jiang et al 2015 with the spatial combination of various soil crop climate irrigation conditions the calibrated gis based swap epic could provide the reasonable estimation of distributed deep percolation for avoiding the computation complexity we did not directly run the swap epic for the whole simulation period a more reasonable alternative was adopted in this study i e to estimate the recharge coefficients from field irrigation and precipitation ξ for different conditions based on modeling results the ξ values often had strong variations with different soils irrigation depths and plants sophocleous 2004 jiang 2017 swap epic was applied to estimate the ratio of deep percolation to field irrigation and precipitation i e dp ratio in irrigated areas with different soil irrigation and plant conditions when assuming that the deep percolation water could finally recharge to the groundwater the dp ratio should be close to ξ that is the approximate relationship between ξ and the sum of irrigation depth and precipitation could be systematically obtained for irrigated areas thus this approach could provide more accurate and reasonable estimation of recharge from field irrigation for modflow use also the other modeling researches could directly and conveniently use the recommended ξ values to estimate the groundwater recharge with no need to develop and run the distributed agro hydrological models 2 3 numerical hydrological model calibration and validation the domain was discretized into 5 layers according to the lithology of sediments and aquifer characteristics the first layer was the phreatic aquifer including strata of q4 q3 and the q2 part above the first low permeable layer of q2 the second and fourth layers were both composed of low permeable stratum of q2 in the northeast and permeable stratum in the southwest the third layer was defined as the aquifer between above two layers i e two low permeable strata of q2 in the northeast and two permeable strata of q2 in the southwest the fifth layer was the aquifer consisting of the lower part of q2 the q1 with the consolidated sediments i e bedrock was defined as the non permeable bottom for the model domain that is the fifth layer was located between the second low permeable sediments of q2 and consolidated sediments in q1 a uniform grid with square cells of 1000 m was adopted i e 160 rows and 155 columns in horizontal direction the monthly stress period with 10 time steps in each was adopted in model simulation the hydrogeological parameters were set up based on the geologic and hydrogeological reports and literature from previous researches iggs 2002 wen et al 2007 mainly including bore hole and pumping test data conductivity in horizontal direction was set as the same while the conductivity in vertical direction was set up as 10 of that in horizontal direction the specific yield sy for phreatic aquifer was set according to the pumping test its values varied between 0 15 and 0 30 with relative high value 0 4 0 5 set up near the area where the spring spilled out the storage coefficients for confined aquifer were set between 0 00001 m 1 and 0 0001 m 1 2 3 1 initial conditions and lateral boundary initial values of groundwater levels were obtained using the ordinary kriging interpolation technique applied to the observation data of 50 wells at the beginning of 1991 which was also adjusted by adding some control points according to the groundwater flow field reported by other researches wen et al 2007 yao et al 2015b hu et al 2007 thus a reasonable smooth spatial distribution of the groundwater levels was achieved lateral a b and c d fig 1 were both defined as the neumann boundary conditions and the flux was respectively estimated to be 0 01 billion m3 and 0 1 billion m3 using the darcy s law no flow boundary condition was defined for both b c and d e as there were thrust faults and hidden faults along the two boundaries a e was also defined as no flow boundary where the hydraulic connection with yanchi basin was cut off by the yulin mountain uplift 2 3 2 other boundary conditions and sinks sources 2 3 2 1 recharge from irrigation precipitation and spring discharge groundwater recharge from field irrigation and precipitation rfirg l for irrigated areas was calculated as follows 2 r f i r g i r ξ where ir is the irrigation depth l the ξ values can be inferred from the results of an agro hydrological modeling in the zhangye basin by using process based swap epic model in our previous studies jiang et al 2015 jiang 2017 the model was firstly calibrated by using the observed soil and crop data in 23 field sites with five soil types and four crop species of yingke irrigation district during 2012 and 2013 jiang et al 2015 then it was further extended to be used on the scale of zhangye basin and validated with the remote sensing evapotranspiration jiang 2017 simulation results could provide the reasonable deep percolation for whole zhangye basin covering different crops and soil types under various irrigation depths this modeling could provide the reasonable values of dp ratio at 200 cm soil depth covering different combinations of soils crops natural plants and irrigation depths in zhangye basin the ξ value could be seen close to the dp ratio value with relatively deep groundwater depth its values for various land use soil types and irrigation depths are summarized and given in table 2 groundwater recharge from canal seepage rc l was calculated as follows 3 r c q s δ ε where qs is the canal conveyance loss l δ is the ratio of canal seepage to canal conveyance loss and ε is the ratio of groundwater recharge to canal seepage annual data of canal conveyance loss were obtained from zhangye my 2010 the values of δ and ε were available from the previous hydrogeological reports iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 groundwater recharge from precipitation infiltration for the non irrigated areas rp l was calculated as follows 4 r p p e α where pe is the effective precipitation l only considering a single rainfall over 10 mm iggs 2002 and α is the coefficient of precipitation recharge and affected by land cover soils and the size of rainfall event α value was set small 0 05 0 08 in the mountain front area with deep gwds it became larger in the plain area i e 0 08 0 20 increasing with the coarser soil texture and larger rainfall event iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 discharge by spring effluence mainly occurred at the edge of alluvial proluvial fan and areas along the heihe river after the heihe bridge see fig 1 zhao et al 2010 the total volume was estimated to about 0 7 billion m3 in 1980s and decreased to about 0 4 billion m3 in 2010s iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 it could be defined as the areal discharge the location and flux were defined according to the hydrogeological surveys and reports and the observation data of a typical spring in the basin iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 finally the recharge flux from irrigation and rainfall and the discharge flux from spring effluence were incorporated together by using the rch package 2 3 2 2 groundwater exploitation a large number of pumping wells were defined to describe the groundwater exploitation using the wel package the number of wells increased from less than 2000 in 1991 to over 8000 in 2011 with total volume increasing from 0 1 to 0 45 billion m3 zhangye my 2010 detailed information of the pumping wells were collected from the latest survey in 2010 including location construction time water use well depth exploitation volume screen materials etc pumping schedules for agricultural wells were determined as referred to the irrigation schedules zhangye my 2010 in the basin while pumping schedules for industrial and domestic wells were averaged annually pumping wells in a model cell 1000 m 1000 m were integrated into an equivalent well when using the wel package and thus 1885 wells were finally defined in the modeling 2 3 2 3 groundwater evaporation piecewise linear decreasing function was applied to describe the groundwater evaporation egw using the ets package the relationship between evaporation rate and gwd was obtained from the previous experiments for different soils and land covers bare soil cropland grassland and forestland iggs 2002 based on this four pieces of linear equations were determined in ets package the extinction depth and maximum groundwater evaporation rate were set according to different types of soils and land use and also defined according to the experiments and previous literature iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 such as extinction depths for bare land cropland grassland and forestland were 7 10 m 5 10 m 5 m and 15 m respectively with different soil types and species the range of maximum groundwater evaporation for bare land was set as 300 500 mm a 1 for different soils and that for cropland grassland and forestland was respectively 200 300 mm a 1 400 600 mm a 1 and 500 1500 mm a 1 as affected by vegetation density iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 2 3 2 4 water exchange between river and groundwater the main heihe river was defined using the riv package the length of heihe river in the zhangye basin was about 180 km and three hydrological stations were established to gauge the runoff and water levels in the heihe river located at yingluo gorge zhengyi gorge and gaoai gorge detailed monthly river levels of the three stations were collected and applied in the model elevation of the river bed and river width was set up based on the previous survey ma et al 2011 the thickness of the relative impermeable layer was set as 3 m river bed seepage coefficients was set between 1 m d 1 and 0 1 m d 1 the value of 1 m d 1 was used in the alluvial proluvial fan while 0 1 m d 1 was used in the fine soil plain according to the previous studies zhou et al 2011 iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 the liyuan river was defined as areal recharge along the liyuan river the other 5 rivers were ignored since their surface runoff was very small after the irrigation diversion 2 3 3 calibration and validation the monthly gwl data from 50 observation wells during 1990 2010 were used to calibrate and validate the model the simulated gwls were thus aggregated into the monthly values for comparison the data in 1990 were used for warming up the model the observed dataset in 1991 2000 and in 2001 2010 were respectively applied for model calibration and validation parameters referring to the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were calibrated through an iterative process using a trial and error method due to they were relatively uncertain in the study area the root mean squared error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 were used as indicators of goodness of fit legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 their definitions can be referred to xu et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation comparison between the simulated and observed gwls for all 50 observation wells during the simulation period 1991 2010 are described in fig 4 spatial distribution of the main calibrated hydrogeological parameters i e kx and sy is presented in fig 5 results showed that the simulated gwls matched well with the observed ones both for calibration and validation these produced a rmse 2 6 m a nse 0 999 and a r2 0 998 during calibration period 1991 2000 similar fitness values were also obtained during validation period 2001 2010 with rmse 3 9 m nse 0 996 and r2 0 998 note that the 50 observation wells have different change trends as they were distributed in areas with different geomorphology land cover gwd and water use structure our modeling could well describe the various trends of gwl fluctuations fig 6 typically as continuous decreasing trend e g well 7 relatively stable trend e g wells 16 17 23 and 26 and the decreasing and then increasing trend e g wells 1 8 and 10 the third trend was rarely captured in previous modeling studies partly due to the over simplification of recharge from irrigation in addition the wet normal and dry years were all included in the simulation period thus this further indicated that our present simulation results are reasonable and convincing we also noted that the simulated crests or troughs of gwls occurred a little earlier or later than the observed ones for some wells in some years this could be mainly attributed to the lack of detailed irrigation data during that year meanwhile there was a relatively large difference between the simulated and observed gwls for wells in mountain front areas e g around wells 7 and 34 figs 1 and 6 it was caused by that the observation gwl data was limited and the hydrologic gradient was too high to get an accurate initial gwls in those areas despite that the inter annual changes of gwls were considered to be well captured in terms of long term 20 year simulation fig 6 overall our calibrated model should be reasonable to simulate the groundwater dynamics for the zhangye basin and hence could be used as a useful tool to analyze the complicated groundwater behavior and to support the restoration of groundwater balance 3 2 groundwater dynamics model simulations provided detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of gwls and gwds for the period of 1991 2010 figs 7 and 8 groundwater mainly flowed from south to north in zhangye basin it received recharge in the upper parts of the heihe river and discharged into the heihe river in the middle and lower stream in the north basin fig 7 gradient was large in the south part of the basin as well as along the heihe river while with very gentle slopes in the central plain part results indicated that gwls had a main trend of declining during the past 20 years with various changes in time and space figs 6 7 and 9 the average gwl for the whole basin had a continuously decreasing trend its decreasing rate was equal to 9 5 cm a 1 from 1991 to 1995 8 5 cm a 1 from 1995 to 2000 9 4 cm a 1 from 2000 to 2005 and 7 8 cm a 1 from 2005 to 2010 respectively meanwhile it was found that gwls also rose up in some local part during the wet period 2005 2010 z3 z5 and l1 with the abundant river runoff in these wet years and associated large irrigation applied in these wet years fig 9 nevertheless for the areas with heavy groundwater exploitation the decline rates of gwls were still larger than that in the previous years z4 and g6 figs 3 and 9 note that the gwl change trends could be classified as three typically types and were described in detail in the following parts relatively stable trend was found in irrigation districts along the heihe river e g around well 16 17 23 and 26 figs 6 and 9 due to still relatively large irrigation and consequently significant recharge from irrigation as well as close water exchange with the heihe river there was often excessive river water diversion while almost no groundwater pumping because of very convenient diversion conditions this resulted in large amounts of vertical deep percolation or lateral water flow towards the heihe river thus the groundwater system was in an appropriate state here with a small fluctuation of annual changes of gwls on the other hand decreasing and then increasing trend was observed in the upper parts of the heihe river and liyuan river e g around wells 1 and 8 slight fluctuations were observed from 1991 to 2000 in those years the reason for decrease could be attributed to the expansion of farmlands i e doubled almost depending on the over exploitation of groundwater i e increasing more than 3 times however since 2003 surface river runoff entering into zhangye basin became larger and subsequently more river water was diverted for irrigation in these major irrigation districts in upstream area meanwhile the groundwater exploitation and the farmland area were nearly unchanged thus these factors caused larger deep percolation and or larger groundwater recharge resulting in an increase in water table from 2005 to 2010 fig 9 however this restoration of gwls was more induced by the increase in surface water in continuous wet years therefore reasonable control of farmland area and groundwater management was still necessary in normal and dry years the more serious problem was that a continuously or even extremely decreasing trend occurred in the southeast farmland in the z4 and northwest parts farmland in the g6 of the plain where all of water use was from groundwater exploitation typically as around well 7 figs 6 7 and 9 the decreasing rate even reached to 2 m a 1 at most in some years the area of farmland was triple in 2010 as compared to 1990 meanwhile groundwater exploitation became twice as before the decrease of irrigation depth for unit area resulted in the reduction of deep percolation and thus a decrease of groundwater recharge eventually gwl decreased continuously from 1991 to 2010 and the decreasing rate was closely related to the total amount of groundwater exploitation this might lead to an unfavorable condition for natural vegetation 3 3 critical gwds spatial and temporal distribution the spatial distribution of gwds at the end of year 1991 1995 2000 2003 2005 and 2010 respectively is presented in fig 8 gwds were larger at the alluvial proluvial fan along the north and south mountain front area ranging from 40 to 50 m to about 800 m the increase in gwd during last 20 years was almost insignificant as compared with its large depths in the fine soil plain where the major agriculture area located gwd varied from approaching ground surface to 30 40 m in space the increase of gwd was relatively obvious considering its shallow characteristics in fine soil plain with the large increases of farmland area and groundwater exploitation it should be noted that this increase may have significant effects on crops and natural vegetation it was found that the gwd increase was particularly significant in the central parts of upstream basin e g around ly8 and z6 the parts on the north of heihe river in downstream basin main groundwater exploitation area e g around g1 g2 and g6 and the parts along the heihe river after the heihe bridge mainly spring overflow zone e g around l2 and l5 figs 3a and 8 for the central parts of plain area gwd was about 1 5 m in the 1990s and changed to be about 1 9 m in 2010 especially the area with gwds of 1 3 m decreased significantly in and around the spring overflow zone the gwds mainly ranged from zero to about 10 20 m with a significant decrease of area with gwds less than 3 m this was also in agreement with the decrease of both the spring area and spring flux in field surveys iggs 2002 the gwd was an important indicator or symbol to reflect the health of eco environment in arid areas thus referring to previous studies guo and liu 2005 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 relationships between gwd and ecological characteristics in zhangye basin could be classified as species diversity decreased as gwd 5 m vegetation coverage and biodiversity decreased significantly as gwd 7 m and the structure of plant community became simple as gwd 9 m the areas for gwd less than 5 m 7 m and 9 m were calculated as shown in fig 10 they all decreased with the percentage of 38 3 34 7 and 33 7 respectively during the past two decades the change of these areas was closely related to the agricultural activities and climate change corresponding to the gwl and gwd changes as described before as shown in fig 10 a relatively higher decreasing rate was found from 1991 to 2003 due to the uncontrolled expansion of irrigated lands and groundwater pumping the area and groundwater use increased from 9 3 104 ha to 14 6 104 ha and from 1 27 108 m3 to 2 9 108 m3 respectively meanwhile the river runoff and surface water diversion were at an average level gentle decreasing rate was found from 2004 to 2010 because of the wetter climate fig 10 during this period more surface water recharged the groundwater system the increments of groundwater pumping were smaller than those of the former years the decrease of area with shallow water tables is consistent with the degradation of vegetation and wetlands in zhangye basin guo and liu 2005 this implies that urgent measures should be taken for eco environmental protection in this basin 3 4 water balance analysis 3 4 1 regional scale the groundwater balance was also analyzed in the simulation period the average volume and the inter annual changes of each balance term are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively results showed that the groundwater balance in zhangye basin was negative at 2 7 108 m3 in average varying at 4 5 108 m3 to 0 6 108 m3 during 1991 2010 except an extremely wet year with 0 11 108 m3 recharge from irrigation water i e from deep percolation and canal seepage and river seepage were the main sources of groundwater recharge fig 10 averagely accounting for 64 3 and 31 7 of the total recharge respectively recharge from irrigation ranged from 7 2 108 m3 to 8 0 108 m3 whereas river seepage ranged from 1 5 108 m3 to 4 5 108 m3 fig 12 the variations were closely related to the amounts of the river runoff entering the basin and the surface water diversion figs 3 and 12 recharge from precipitation was only 0 5 108 m3 a 1 accounted for about 3 of the total recharge groundwater discharge mainly included spring overflow spr groundwater evaporation egw groundwater pumping pgw and discharge to the rivers driv fig 11 with their percentage equaling to 42 3 31 9 17 9 and 7 9 respectively the amount of spr was both affected by surface river runoff and groundwater exploitation except some wet years it presented an obviously decreasing trend as compared with those in 1990s egw decreased continuously with the continuous decline in gwl and areas with shallow water depths fig 12 pgw increased sharply during the simulation period driv was maintained at around 1 0 108 m3 due to the intensive interaction with groundwater and relatively stable gwl in areas along the heihe river it was worth noting that the groundwater system was in a negative balance status even in wet years this implied that gwl would decline continuously in the future if agricultural water use practices in the basin could not be well improved 3 4 2 representative zone according to the long term gwl dynamics four representative zones were defined in the basin fig 13 zone 3 zone 1 zone 2 and zone 4 were representative for the areas with sharp continuous gwl decline slow continuous gwl decline decreasing and then increasing gwl trends and stable gwl trends respectively total water use in zone 1 2 and 4 was based on the joint use of groundwater and river water while that for zone 3 was only from groundwater pumping groundwater balance of four representative zones is calculated and presented in fig 13 results revealed that the average water balance for zone 3 was negative at 100 mm water depth per year and the recharge amount was less than one third of discharge one groundwater funnel had appeared in zone 3 since 2000 with the affected area increasing in the following years this caused obviously negative impact on local ecosystem zone 1 was also facing the similar problems but with less severe situation as zone 3 there used to be enough surface water for zone 1 during 1991 1997 recharge from irrigation being as the main recharge component for groundwater was slightly larger than the discharge components in that period however after 1997 less surface water was diverted for irrigation in those districts far from the heihe river or at the tail of canal system like zone 1 and more groundwater was pumped as supplement to fit the increasing water demand induced by agricultural expansion as a result total groundwater recharge was only half of discharge causing the decline of gwls on the other hand there were also some regions in which the ecosystem was relatively safe such as zone 2 located at the head of canal system could divert enough surface river water for irrigation gwls only declined in a few years especially in dry years and then rose up to a similar level in the following wet years as compared with that in 1991 moreover zone 4 located nearby the heihe river could also receive abundant surface water for irrigation enough or even excessive surface water and the intensive interaction with heihe river had made the gwl in a relatively stable situation however agriculture in those areas should also be limited to a reasonable level so that other areas could obtain more surface water avoiding over groundwater pumping 3 5 insight on irrigation and groundwater management in this study modeling results clearly presented several problems of continuous water table decline and the related impact factors in a long term period increase in irrigated area and irrigation water demand resulted in significant gwl decline the reduction of river water allocation after applying ewdp led to larger or excessive groundwater exploitation due to unreasonable management of groundwater pumping and relatively lower efficiency of water saving practices that mainly focused on construction of canal system for economic benefits but in deficit of well management the area with gwds less than critical ones was even reduced by 30 which was obviously dangerous evidence to the growth of natural vegetation and the health of ecosystem the recovery of groundwater level in some local areas was mainly caused by wetter climate in 2000s instead of management improvement the overall declining trend of gwls was still foreseen if irrigation water crop pattern and land use were maintained as present those would strongly challenge the sustainable development of the zhangye basin and require a balance between economic development and ecosystem restoration modeling results showed that the appropriate alternatives should have focused on 1 controlling or even reducing the farmland area e g returning farmlands to grasslands 2 supervising groundwater pumping and or close wells in those areas with significant gwl decline e g in downstream basin 3 implementing the water saving practices wsps at both farmland and regional scale to improve field water use efficiency increase conveyance efficiency by means of providing services in practices and prevent the possible over groundwater pumping in lower reaches of canals and rivers strategies to restore eco environment should also be determined according to the local conditions and classification overall how to recover the groundwater levels was quite necessary to be studied in future the effects of various alternatives on groundwater dynamics would be further investigated in our follow up researches 4 conclusion the zhangye basin of heihe river basin hrb was chosen as the representative case for analyzing the long term groundwater dynamics affected by the rapid development of irrigated agriculture in arid inland river basins of northwest china a three dimensional groundwater flow model was developed for the zhangye basin of middle oasis of hrb with carefully considering the recharge from field irrigation determined by using an ago hydrological model swap epic the model was well calibrated and validated with the groundwater level gwl data of 50 observation wells over the periods of 1991 2001 and 2001 2010 respectively then the model was used to analyze the long term gwl dynamics and water balance changes and to further identify their impact factors firstly the detailed groundwater dynamics for a long term period 20 years were given in this study compared to the former researches three gwl trends were found i e relatively stable trend decreasing and then increasing trend and continuously or even extremely decreasing trend as a result the average gwl declined with an average rate of 9 cm a 1 for the zhangye basin secondly recharge from irrigation water rirg and that from river seepage rriv respectively accounted for 64 3 and 31 7 of the total recharge whereas the spring overflow spr groundwater evaporation egw groundwater pumping pgw and discharge to the rivers driv accounted for 42 3 31 9 17 9 and 7 9 of the total discharge respectively the balance of groundwater system for the zhangye basin was negative with a value of 2 7 108 m3 per year in average thirdly some areas with large groundwater exploitation were suffering from the continuous gwl decline the average storage change δs could reach to 100 mm water depth resulting in obvious groundwater funnel in the basin fourthly the area with critical groundwater depth e g 5 m has reduced about 30 in 2010 as compared with that in 1991 relevant ecosystem restoring measures were also proposed focusing on controlling or reducing the farmland area and groundwater exploitation and promoting the water saving practices it should also be useful to irrigation water use for oasis areas in other inland river basins that are facing the similar water use issues the strategies for restoration measures and the related decision making on groundwater management in oasis areas should be further studied in the follow up researches acknowledgements this research was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china

11465,oasis areas of arid inland river basins in northwest china have been facing intensified water use conflicts between agricultural sector and eco environmental systems since 1990s the reduction of river water allocation to oasis has resulted in the undesirable declines of groundwater levels gwls with the increase in irrigated area and groundwater pumping improving water management and restoring gwls become a great concern for those areas in this study the middle oasis of heihe river basin hrb was selected as the representative case for such an endeavor a three dimensional groundwater flow model was established for the zhangye basin a sub basin of hrb to obtain a better understanding of groundwater dynamics in middle oasis particularly for investigating the effects of agricultural water use a major advantage of this model is that the spatial and temporal recharge from irrigation has been described in details with considering the result obtained by an ago hydrological model swap epic simulation the model was well calibrated and validated over the period of 1991 2010 simulation of gwls matched well with the observed 20 year gwls in the 50 wells then spatiotemporal groundwater dynamics and groundwater budget were quantitatively analyzed for the zhangye basin during 1991 2010 in particular the modeling results revealed three different changing trends of gwls based on the analysis of groundwater dynamics and budget for four representative zones results indicated that negative balance of groundwater was mainly caused by over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation resulting in a gwl decline of 9 cm a 1 in average and even 2 m decline in some years at local areas the area with critical groundwater depth e g 5 m has reduced about 30 in 2010 as compared to that in 1991 finally recommendations on how to restore gwls were proposed with emphasis on irrigation water and land use adjustment and groundwater pumping control our results are expected to provide implications for recovering the groundwater status in oasis areas of inland river basins in arid northwest china keywords numerical modeling groundwater level water budget irrigation management modflow 1 introduction water scarcity and resulting water use conflicts have become a great concern to river basin management in arid and semi arid areas worldwide the challenge is more serious to most arid inland river basins with large irrigated agriculture ji et al 2006 white et al 2014 cheng et al 2014 in arid northwest china the rapid expansion of irrigated agriculture has further aggravated the water use conflicts between agriculture and eco environment in the basin in recent decades the conflicts are especially striking for most inland river basins i e tarim river basin heihe river basin shiyanghe river basin and shule river basin fig 1 especially since 1990s cheng et al 2006 zhang et al 2014 the ecological water diversion project ewdp has been implemented in these basins with the purpose of decreasing river water allocation to artificial oasis and aiming to restore ecosystems in downstream basin since 2000 cheng et al 2014 however application of ewdp has resulted in over exploitation of groundwater for irrigation supplement and thus continuous decline of groundwater levels gwls and ecosystem deterioration in the oasis cheng et al 2014 kang et al 2008 huang and pang 2010 zhang et al 2014 therefore a thorough understanding of long term groundwater dynamics affected by agricultural water use is quite necessary and should be the basis for restoring groundwater environment in oasis areas various researches have been carried out to investigate the hydrological processes for seeking reasonable groundwater management in oasis areas the studies involve different aspects of processes and various techniques related to groundwater system e g traditional field experiments jiang et al 2015 chen et al 2006 geostatistical analysis hu et al 2012 remote sensing inversion zhao et al 2013 simulation modeling li and zhao 2010 peng and xu 2010 water chemistry huang and pang 2010 and tracer temperature or isotope experiments huang and pang 2010 yao et al 2015a zhu et al 2008 recently the regional scale hydrological modeling is increasingly considered as a promising tool accomplishing the research objectives cheng et al 2014 in particular the models with groundwater flow model as the core are preferred and widely adopted in former literatures because of the important role of groundwater and its frequent interactions with surface water in oasis areas zhou et al 2011 wu et al 2014 li et al 2017 huo et al 2011 danierhan et al 2013 xie et al 2012 in such way all the key aspects of hydrological cycles and their interactions could be combined and integrated in the modeling however in most previous studies in arid inland river basins of northwest china the effects of agricultural irrigation on hydrological cycle are significant but usually treated with very simple and not necessarily physically sound approaches for instance irrigation recharge including canal seepage field deep percolation is often simplified as an empirical ratio to irrigation or even uniform distribution in an irrigation system e g wen et al 2007 huo et al 2011 zhou et al 2011 yao et al 2015b nevertheless note that they often have very strong spatial and temporal variations in oasis affected by water conveyance and field irrigation conditions irrigation management crop patterns soils etc jiang et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 jiang 2017 the over simplified approaches are partly caused by the limitation of data availability and partly due to the poor understanding of the agro hydrological processes on the other hand the groundwater dynamic analysis in most previous studies are carried out with a relatively short calibration period mainly 2 6 years e g huo et al 2011 hu et al 2007 xie et al 2012 wu et al 2014 this may not well reflect the long term dynamics of groundwater dynamics in oasis area therefore this study is to investigate the long term effect of intense agricultural activities on groundwater dynamics in recent decades with the middle oasis of the heihe river basin as a typical example mainly taking into account the huge amounts of shared data in hydrology hydrogeology agriculture land use pattern etc the heihe river basin hrb is the second largest inland river basin in china covering an area of 128 000 km2 it consists of an upstream mountain area a piedmont plain and fine soil valley plain in midstream area i e middle oasis and a downstream area of gobi desert and wetlands fig 1 in recent years excessive diversion for agriculture in the middle oasis has resulted in inadequate discharge to the downstream areas this has raised a few significant ecological issues especially since 1990s typically as natural vegetation degradation soil desertification and terminal lake shrinkage guo et al 2009 cheng et al 2014 with the application of ewdp the positive effects are observed in downstream area at least in the short term e g the recovery of juyan lake and wetlands zhu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 in another aspect more groundwater is exploited for irrigation and significant gwl decline is observed in many parts of middle oasis since 1980s as reported in some previous studies e g zhou et al 2011 mi et al 2015 jiang 2017 the shrinkage of wetland and degradation of natural vegetation has occurred in some local regions thus it is essential to quantitatively recognize the effects of agricultural activities on water cycle and groundwater dynamics at present how to prevent the water table decline and recover the groundwater environment is becoming an urgent issue for the middle oasis taking into account the above mentioned issues this paper aims at exploring the long term groundwater dynamics in middle oasis in recent two decades with detailed consideration of irrigation effects on the basis of previous groundwater modeling and agro hydrological modeling the large volume datasets particularly related to canal conveyance groundwater exploitation field irrigation etc were collected with support of the heihe plan i e a key research plan integrated research on eco hydrological process of heihe river basin us 23 million by national science foundation of china a modflow based three dimensional 3d groundwater flow model was established for zhangye basin a sub basin in middle oasis during 1991 2010 it included improved description of sources from irrigation based on detailed agro hydrological modeling analysis the major objectives were to reproduce the spatiotemporal groundwater dynamics over a long term period 1991 2010 and to identify the main impact factors and to foresee the possible strategies for recovery of groundwater tables in oasis areas the research findings can be applied to similar oasis in other inland river basins in arid northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area 2 1 1 location geography and climate the middle oasis is defined as the region between the yingluo gorge and zhengyi gorge consisting of four sub basins i e zhangye jiuquan east jiuquan west and shandan fig 1 it is one of the most important grain and seed production bases in northwest china it consumes more than 90 of available surface water from the heihe river and contributes approximately 90 of agricultural production value of hrb the mainstream of heihe river mainly flows across the zhangye basin 38 6 39 8 n and 99 2 100 8 e which has the largest irrigated agriculture in middle oasis in addition the zhangye basin is a closed basin with relatively distinctive hydrogeological boundary conditions wen et al 2007 hu et al 2007 zhou et al 2011 in this study the zhangye basin was thus chosen as the simulation domain for groundwater modeling and long term dynamic assessment fig 1 huge amounts of data were available from the heihe plan as presented in table 1 related to hydrology hydrogeology agriculture land use pattern etc the zhangye basin covers the main area of three counties of ganzhou linze and gaotai covering an area of 5500 km2 it is bounded by qilian mountain to the southwest and longshou mountain and heli mountain to the northeast fig 1 there are two typical topographies i e alluvial proluvial fan in front of qilian mountain and river valley fine soil plain fig 2 the topography has a slope of 40 for alluvial proluvial fan and became flat in fine soil plain with an average slope of 2 land surface elevation ranges from 860 m and 2300 m above sea level asl in the northeast plain area and the southwest mountain front area respectively the study area has a typically arid continental climate precipitation is about 140 mm per year mainly occurring in the summer season whereas the mean annual evaporation 20 cm pan reaches to 2050 mm 2 1 2 geology and hydrogeology the zhangye basin is underlain by quaternary sediments mainly the diluvium and alluvial deposits the aquifer system mainly includes the stratum of holocene q4 upper pleistocene q3 and middle pleistocene q2 fig 2 the stratum for early pleistocene q1 is composed of consolidated sediments forming the non permeable bottom boundary for the quaternary aquifer system in the alluvial proluvial fan the q4 stratum is mainly composed of alluvium finer soils sandy gravels and gravels with thickness ranging at 5 30 m the deposits for underlain q3 and q2 are the well sorted pebbles gravels and sand gravels with thickness of 50 100 m and 150 200 m respectively in fine soil plain the deposits for q1 q3 and q4 are similar to that in the alluvial proluvial fan but with finer texture however the q2 stratum has more complex deposits i e gravels and sand gravels interlaced with two low permeable layers clay or loam clay about 5 20 m thickness for each layer thus on the basis of the properties of stratum deposits a single layer water bearing stratum is identified at the alluvial proluvial fan in front of mountain areas meanwhile the multi layer water bearing strata are defined for the fine soil plain including interlaced two low permeable layers for q2 the heihe river and its main tributary liyuanhe river are two main rivers in zhangye basin with average annual runoff of 1 59 billion m3 and 0 23 billion m3 respectively the annual runoff for each of other five tributary rivers is only about 0 011 0 04 billion m3 except for the heihe river surface runoff in other rivers is intercepted by reservoirs and diverted for irrigation note that the six tributary rivers mainly recharge the groundwater as they are intercepted at mountain front fig 1 however the river seepage is too small and is generally negligible hu et al 2007 iggs 2002 for the heihe river the river water strongly recharges groundwater in upstream front mountain area with deeper groundwater depths gwds through seepage i e with seepage of 0 15 billion m3 per year from the yingluo gorge to heihe bridge hu et al 2007 iggs 2002 then the complicated and strong exchanges seepage base flow and spring take place in the valley plain area with shallower gwds irrigation water diverted from the heihe river would largely recharge the groundwater system and finally return back to the heihe river in spring and lateral flow the annual groundwater recharge to heihe river is about 0 7 billion m3 during 1980s iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 as estimated using isotope and temperature tracer however it becomes smaller as groundwater level declines in the past 20 years for instance the flux of a typical spring has decreased from 129 6 l s 1 in 1986 to 51 0 l s 1 in 2011 2 1 3 water use conditions and crop planting there are totally seventeen irrigation districts in zhangye basin fig 3 a including twelve fed by heihe river one fed by liyuan river and the rest smaller ones in the front mountain area the amount of irrigation water is kept at 1 6 1 7 billion m3 accounting for over 90 of the total water use in the basin due to ewdp irrigation water diverted from the river was reduced from 1 65 to 1 35 billion m3 from 1990s to 2010s while the water pumped from aquifers increased from 0 15 to 0 35 billion m3 fig 3b the total irrigation water use remained almost the same due to various reasons related to technique and management issues jiang et al 2015 jiang 2017 the number of groundwater pumping wells were less than 2000 in 1991 but increased to more than 8000 in 2012 in the basin the irrigation water use per unit area actually decreased mainly because of the large investment in canal systems construction i e canal lining and water project regulation and cease of intercropping fig 3c f up to 2011 the percentage of lined canal respectively reached to about 85 and 80 for main canals and tributaries respectively which effetively reduced the canal loss and seepgae however the farmland area has expanded from 90 000 ha to 150 000 ha during 1991 2010 which resulted in little change in total amount of irrigation water a continuous decrease was observed for areas of grass forest water and bare land meanwhile the amount of water for industrial and domestic use increased from 0 05 to 0 09 billion m3 which was almost entirely from groundwater pumping some part of diverted river water was also applied to eco environment sector increasing from 0 05 to 0 09 billion m3 after the application of ewdp overall the total water use for all sectors in zhangye basin varied slightly around 1 8 billion m3 during 1991 2010 the cropping pattern has changed greatly during the last three decades the main crop changed from forage corn and wheat in 1990s to grain corn after 2000 the area for wheat reduced significantly and the intercropping pattern was almost abandoned the remaining irrigated areas also included other croplands e g planted with wheat barley cotton cabbage tomato and pepper and some scattered grasslands and woodlands silt loam and loam are widely distributed in the cultivated farmlands while coarse textured soils are also typical in northeast area of downstream basin surface basin irrigation is the common method there are generally 4 5 irrigation events during crop season april september and also a winter irrigation in november for maintaining appropriate soil moisture conditions for seedling growth in the subsequent spring field deep percolation is relatively large due to the large irrigation amount with relatively large variation in space and time 2 2 model description the modflow 2005 was utilized to develop the groundwater flow model of the zhangye basin with reasonably considering the recharge from field irrigation determined by using an ago hydrological model swap epic modflow is a modular 3d model that includes modules to simulate steady state or transient groundwater flow in confined unconfined aquifers harbaugh 2005 the model is based on solving the 3d partial differential equation of groundwater flow using the finite difference method the governing equation for groundwater flow is as follows 1 x k xx h x y k y y h y z k z z h z w s s h t where kxx kyy kzz are values of hydraulic conductivity along the x y z coordinate axes which are assumed to be parallel to the major axes of hydraulic conductivity l t 1 h is the groundwater level l w are the source sink terms with w 0 for flow out of the groundwater system and w 0 for flow into the system t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 and t is time t the source code of modflow is open and easily accessible various packages have been readily incorporated into the modflow to treat the different boundary conditions and the source sink terms typically as the packages of recharge rch well wel river riv drainage drn and evapotranspiration segments ets modflow has become a powerful and widely used tool in hydrological or hydrogeological competition research and groundwater management particularly the swap epic model was used to help describe the spatiotemporal recharge from field irrigation which was the main source for groundwater with the most uncertainties in zhangye basin swap epic was a one dimensional 1d physical based agro hydrological model that could simulate soil water flow solute transport and crop growth on a field scale and daily time step xu et al 2013 soil water flow and solute transport were described based on the vertically 1d richards equation and advection dispersion equation respectively crop growth and yield were calculated using the modified epic crop growth model more detailed calculation principles for swap epic could be found in xu et al 2013 meanwhile the gis based swap epic has been proposed for simulating the regional agro hydrological processes in a distributed manner by jiang et al 2015 with the spatial combination of various soil crop climate irrigation conditions the calibrated gis based swap epic could provide the reasonable estimation of distributed deep percolation for avoiding the computation complexity we did not directly run the swap epic for the whole simulation period a more reasonable alternative was adopted in this study i e to estimate the recharge coefficients from field irrigation and precipitation ξ for different conditions based on modeling results the ξ values often had strong variations with different soils irrigation depths and plants sophocleous 2004 jiang 2017 swap epic was applied to estimate the ratio of deep percolation to field irrigation and precipitation i e dp ratio in irrigated areas with different soil irrigation and plant conditions when assuming that the deep percolation water could finally recharge to the groundwater the dp ratio should be close to ξ that is the approximate relationship between ξ and the sum of irrigation depth and precipitation could be systematically obtained for irrigated areas thus this approach could provide more accurate and reasonable estimation of recharge from field irrigation for modflow use also the other modeling researches could directly and conveniently use the recommended ξ values to estimate the groundwater recharge with no need to develop and run the distributed agro hydrological models 2 3 numerical hydrological model calibration and validation the domain was discretized into 5 layers according to the lithology of sediments and aquifer characteristics the first layer was the phreatic aquifer including strata of q4 q3 and the q2 part above the first low permeable layer of q2 the second and fourth layers were both composed of low permeable stratum of q2 in the northeast and permeable stratum in the southwest the third layer was defined as the aquifer between above two layers i e two low permeable strata of q2 in the northeast and two permeable strata of q2 in the southwest the fifth layer was the aquifer consisting of the lower part of q2 the q1 with the consolidated sediments i e bedrock was defined as the non permeable bottom for the model domain that is the fifth layer was located between the second low permeable sediments of q2 and consolidated sediments in q1 a uniform grid with square cells of 1000 m was adopted i e 160 rows and 155 columns in horizontal direction the monthly stress period with 10 time steps in each was adopted in model simulation the hydrogeological parameters were set up based on the geologic and hydrogeological reports and literature from previous researches iggs 2002 wen et al 2007 mainly including bore hole and pumping test data conductivity in horizontal direction was set as the same while the conductivity in vertical direction was set up as 10 of that in horizontal direction the specific yield sy for phreatic aquifer was set according to the pumping test its values varied between 0 15 and 0 30 with relative high value 0 4 0 5 set up near the area where the spring spilled out the storage coefficients for confined aquifer were set between 0 00001 m 1 and 0 0001 m 1 2 3 1 initial conditions and lateral boundary initial values of groundwater levels were obtained using the ordinary kriging interpolation technique applied to the observation data of 50 wells at the beginning of 1991 which was also adjusted by adding some control points according to the groundwater flow field reported by other researches wen et al 2007 yao et al 2015b hu et al 2007 thus a reasonable smooth spatial distribution of the groundwater levels was achieved lateral a b and c d fig 1 were both defined as the neumann boundary conditions and the flux was respectively estimated to be 0 01 billion m3 and 0 1 billion m3 using the darcy s law no flow boundary condition was defined for both b c and d e as there were thrust faults and hidden faults along the two boundaries a e was also defined as no flow boundary where the hydraulic connection with yanchi basin was cut off by the yulin mountain uplift 2 3 2 other boundary conditions and sinks sources 2 3 2 1 recharge from irrigation precipitation and spring discharge groundwater recharge from field irrigation and precipitation rfirg l for irrigated areas was calculated as follows 2 r f i r g i r ξ where ir is the irrigation depth l the ξ values can be inferred from the results of an agro hydrological modeling in the zhangye basin by using process based swap epic model in our previous studies jiang et al 2015 jiang 2017 the model was firstly calibrated by using the observed soil and crop data in 23 field sites with five soil types and four crop species of yingke irrigation district during 2012 and 2013 jiang et al 2015 then it was further extended to be used on the scale of zhangye basin and validated with the remote sensing evapotranspiration jiang 2017 simulation results could provide the reasonable deep percolation for whole zhangye basin covering different crops and soil types under various irrigation depths this modeling could provide the reasonable values of dp ratio at 200 cm soil depth covering different combinations of soils crops natural plants and irrigation depths in zhangye basin the ξ value could be seen close to the dp ratio value with relatively deep groundwater depth its values for various land use soil types and irrigation depths are summarized and given in table 2 groundwater recharge from canal seepage rc l was calculated as follows 3 r c q s δ ε where qs is the canal conveyance loss l δ is the ratio of canal seepage to canal conveyance loss and ε is the ratio of groundwater recharge to canal seepage annual data of canal conveyance loss were obtained from zhangye my 2010 the values of δ and ε were available from the previous hydrogeological reports iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 groundwater recharge from precipitation infiltration for the non irrigated areas rp l was calculated as follows 4 r p p e α where pe is the effective precipitation l only considering a single rainfall over 10 mm iggs 2002 and α is the coefficient of precipitation recharge and affected by land cover soils and the size of rainfall event α value was set small 0 05 0 08 in the mountain front area with deep gwds it became larger in the plain area i e 0 08 0 20 increasing with the coarser soil texture and larger rainfall event iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 discharge by spring effluence mainly occurred at the edge of alluvial proluvial fan and areas along the heihe river after the heihe bridge see fig 1 zhao et al 2010 the total volume was estimated to about 0 7 billion m3 in 1980s and decreased to about 0 4 billion m3 in 2010s iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 it could be defined as the areal discharge the location and flux were defined according to the hydrogeological surveys and reports and the observation data of a typical spring in the basin iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 finally the recharge flux from irrigation and rainfall and the discharge flux from spring effluence were incorporated together by using the rch package 2 3 2 2 groundwater exploitation a large number of pumping wells were defined to describe the groundwater exploitation using the wel package the number of wells increased from less than 2000 in 1991 to over 8000 in 2011 with total volume increasing from 0 1 to 0 45 billion m3 zhangye my 2010 detailed information of the pumping wells were collected from the latest survey in 2010 including location construction time water use well depth exploitation volume screen materials etc pumping schedules for agricultural wells were determined as referred to the irrigation schedules zhangye my 2010 in the basin while pumping schedules for industrial and domestic wells were averaged annually pumping wells in a model cell 1000 m 1000 m were integrated into an equivalent well when using the wel package and thus 1885 wells were finally defined in the modeling 2 3 2 3 groundwater evaporation piecewise linear decreasing function was applied to describe the groundwater evaporation egw using the ets package the relationship between evaporation rate and gwd was obtained from the previous experiments for different soils and land covers bare soil cropland grassland and forestland iggs 2002 based on this four pieces of linear equations were determined in ets package the extinction depth and maximum groundwater evaporation rate were set according to different types of soils and land use and also defined according to the experiments and previous literature iggs 2002 iggmed 1982 such as extinction depths for bare land cropland grassland and forestland were 7 10 m 5 10 m 5 m and 15 m respectively with different soil types and species the range of maximum groundwater evaporation for bare land was set as 300 500 mm a 1 for different soils and that for cropland grassland and forestland was respectively 200 300 mm a 1 400 600 mm a 1 and 500 1500 mm a 1 as affected by vegetation density iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 2 3 2 4 water exchange between river and groundwater the main heihe river was defined using the riv package the length of heihe river in the zhangye basin was about 180 km and three hydrological stations were established to gauge the runoff and water levels in the heihe river located at yingluo gorge zhengyi gorge and gaoai gorge detailed monthly river levels of the three stations were collected and applied in the model elevation of the river bed and river width was set up based on the previous survey ma et al 2011 the thickness of the relative impermeable layer was set as 3 m river bed seepage coefficients was set between 1 m d 1 and 0 1 m d 1 the value of 1 m d 1 was used in the alluvial proluvial fan while 0 1 m d 1 was used in the fine soil plain according to the previous studies zhou et al 2011 iggmed 1982 iggs 2002 the liyuan river was defined as areal recharge along the liyuan river the other 5 rivers were ignored since their surface runoff was very small after the irrigation diversion 2 3 3 calibration and validation the monthly gwl data from 50 observation wells during 1990 2010 were used to calibrate and validate the model the simulated gwls were thus aggregated into the monthly values for comparison the data in 1990 were used for warming up the model the observed dataset in 1991 2000 and in 2001 2010 were respectively applied for model calibration and validation parameters referring to the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were calibrated through an iterative process using a trial and error method due to they were relatively uncertain in the study area the root mean squared error rmse nash and sutcliffe model efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 were used as indicators of goodness of fit legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 their definitions can be referred to xu et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation comparison between the simulated and observed gwls for all 50 observation wells during the simulation period 1991 2010 are described in fig 4 spatial distribution of the main calibrated hydrogeological parameters i e kx and sy is presented in fig 5 results showed that the simulated gwls matched well with the observed ones both for calibration and validation these produced a rmse 2 6 m a nse 0 999 and a r2 0 998 during calibration period 1991 2000 similar fitness values were also obtained during validation period 2001 2010 with rmse 3 9 m nse 0 996 and r2 0 998 note that the 50 observation wells have different change trends as they were distributed in areas with different geomorphology land cover gwd and water use structure our modeling could well describe the various trends of gwl fluctuations fig 6 typically as continuous decreasing trend e g well 7 relatively stable trend e g wells 16 17 23 and 26 and the decreasing and then increasing trend e g wells 1 8 and 10 the third trend was rarely captured in previous modeling studies partly due to the over simplification of recharge from irrigation in addition the wet normal and dry years were all included in the simulation period thus this further indicated that our present simulation results are reasonable and convincing we also noted that the simulated crests or troughs of gwls occurred a little earlier or later than the observed ones for some wells in some years this could be mainly attributed to the lack of detailed irrigation data during that year meanwhile there was a relatively large difference between the simulated and observed gwls for wells in mountain front areas e g around wells 7 and 34 figs 1 and 6 it was caused by that the observation gwl data was limited and the hydrologic gradient was too high to get an accurate initial gwls in those areas despite that the inter annual changes of gwls were considered to be well captured in terms of long term 20 year simulation fig 6 overall our calibrated model should be reasonable to simulate the groundwater dynamics for the zhangye basin and hence could be used as a useful tool to analyze the complicated groundwater behavior and to support the restoration of groundwater balance 3 2 groundwater dynamics model simulations provided detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of gwls and gwds for the period of 1991 2010 figs 7 and 8 groundwater mainly flowed from south to north in zhangye basin it received recharge in the upper parts of the heihe river and discharged into the heihe river in the middle and lower stream in the north basin fig 7 gradient was large in the south part of the basin as well as along the heihe river while with very gentle slopes in the central plain part results indicated that gwls had a main trend of declining during the past 20 years with various changes in time and space figs 6 7 and 9 the average gwl for the whole basin had a continuously decreasing trend its decreasing rate was equal to 9 5 cm a 1 from 1991 to 1995 8 5 cm a 1 from 1995 to 2000 9 4 cm a 1 from 2000 to 2005 and 7 8 cm a 1 from 2005 to 2010 respectively meanwhile it was found that gwls also rose up in some local part during the wet period 2005 2010 z3 z5 and l1 with the abundant river runoff in these wet years and associated large irrigation applied in these wet years fig 9 nevertheless for the areas with heavy groundwater exploitation the decline rates of gwls were still larger than that in the previous years z4 and g6 figs 3 and 9 note that the gwl change trends could be classified as three typically types and were described in detail in the following parts relatively stable trend was found in irrigation districts along the heihe river e g around well 16 17 23 and 26 figs 6 and 9 due to still relatively large irrigation and consequently significant recharge from irrigation as well as close water exchange with the heihe river there was often excessive river water diversion while almost no groundwater pumping because of very convenient diversion conditions this resulted in large amounts of vertical deep percolation or lateral water flow towards the heihe river thus the groundwater system was in an appropriate state here with a small fluctuation of annual changes of gwls on the other hand decreasing and then increasing trend was observed in the upper parts of the heihe river and liyuan river e g around wells 1 and 8 slight fluctuations were observed from 1991 to 2000 in those years the reason for decrease could be attributed to the expansion of farmlands i e doubled almost depending on the over exploitation of groundwater i e increasing more than 3 times however since 2003 surface river runoff entering into zhangye basin became larger and subsequently more river water was diverted for irrigation in these major irrigation districts in upstream area meanwhile the groundwater exploitation and the farmland area were nearly unchanged thus these factors caused larger deep percolation and or larger groundwater recharge resulting in an increase in water table from 2005 to 2010 fig 9 however this restoration of gwls was more induced by the increase in surface water in continuous wet years therefore reasonable control of farmland area and groundwater management was still necessary in normal and dry years the more serious problem was that a continuously or even extremely decreasing trend occurred in the southeast farmland in the z4 and northwest parts farmland in the g6 of the plain where all of water use was from groundwater exploitation typically as around well 7 figs 6 7 and 9 the decreasing rate even reached to 2 m a 1 at most in some years the area of farmland was triple in 2010 as compared to 1990 meanwhile groundwater exploitation became twice as before the decrease of irrigation depth for unit area resulted in the reduction of deep percolation and thus a decrease of groundwater recharge eventually gwl decreased continuously from 1991 to 2010 and the decreasing rate was closely related to the total amount of groundwater exploitation this might lead to an unfavorable condition for natural vegetation 3 3 critical gwds spatial and temporal distribution the spatial distribution of gwds at the end of year 1991 1995 2000 2003 2005 and 2010 respectively is presented in fig 8 gwds were larger at the alluvial proluvial fan along the north and south mountain front area ranging from 40 to 50 m to about 800 m the increase in gwd during last 20 years was almost insignificant as compared with its large depths in the fine soil plain where the major agriculture area located gwd varied from approaching ground surface to 30 40 m in space the increase of gwd was relatively obvious considering its shallow characteristics in fine soil plain with the large increases of farmland area and groundwater exploitation it should be noted that this increase may have significant effects on crops and natural vegetation it was found that the gwd increase was particularly significant in the central parts of upstream basin e g around ly8 and z6 the parts on the north of heihe river in downstream basin main groundwater exploitation area e g around g1 g2 and g6 and the parts along the heihe river after the heihe bridge mainly spring overflow zone e g around l2 and l5 figs 3a and 8 for the central parts of plain area gwd was about 1 5 m in the 1990s and changed to be about 1 9 m in 2010 especially the area with gwds of 1 3 m decreased significantly in and around the spring overflow zone the gwds mainly ranged from zero to about 10 20 m with a significant decrease of area with gwds less than 3 m this was also in agreement with the decrease of both the spring area and spring flux in field surveys iggs 2002 the gwd was an important indicator or symbol to reflect the health of eco environment in arid areas thus referring to previous studies guo and liu 2005 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 relationships between gwd and ecological characteristics in zhangye basin could be classified as species diversity decreased as gwd 5 m vegetation coverage and biodiversity decreased significantly as gwd 7 m and the structure of plant community became simple as gwd 9 m the areas for gwd less than 5 m 7 m and 9 m were calculated as shown in fig 10 they all decreased with the percentage of 38 3 34 7 and 33 7 respectively during the past two decades the change of these areas was closely related to the agricultural activities and climate change corresponding to the gwl and gwd changes as described before as shown in fig 10 a relatively higher decreasing rate was found from 1991 to 2003 due to the uncontrolled expansion of irrigated lands and groundwater pumping the area and groundwater use increased from 9 3 104 ha to 14 6 104 ha and from 1 27 108 m3 to 2 9 108 m3 respectively meanwhile the river runoff and surface water diversion were at an average level gentle decreasing rate was found from 2004 to 2010 because of the wetter climate fig 10 during this period more surface water recharged the groundwater system the increments of groundwater pumping were smaller than those of the former years the decrease of area with shallow water tables is consistent with the degradation of vegetation and wetlands in zhangye basin guo and liu 2005 this implies that urgent measures should be taken for eco environmental protection in this basin 3 4 water balance analysis 3 4 1 regional scale the groundwater balance was also analyzed in the simulation period the average volume and the inter annual changes of each balance term are presented in figs 11 and 12 respectively results showed that the groundwater balance in zhangye basin was negative at 2 7 108 m3 in average varying at 4 5 108 m3 to 0 6 108 m3 during 1991 2010 except an extremely wet year with 0 11 108 m3 recharge from irrigation water i e from deep percolation and canal seepage and river seepage were the main sources of groundwater recharge fig 10 averagely accounting for 64 3 and 31 7 of the total recharge respectively recharge from irrigation ranged from 7 2 108 m3 to 8 0 108 m3 whereas river seepage ranged from 1 5 108 m3 to 4 5 108 m3 fig 12 the variations were closely related to the amounts of the river runoff entering the basin and the surface water diversion figs 3 and 12 recharge from precipitation was only 0 5 108 m3 a 1 accounted for about 3 of the total recharge groundwater discharge mainly included spring overflow spr groundwater evaporation egw groundwater pumping pgw and discharge to the rivers driv fig 11 with their percentage equaling to 42 3 31 9 17 9 and 7 9 respectively the amount of spr was both affected by surface river runoff and groundwater exploitation except some wet years it presented an obviously decreasing trend as compared with those in 1990s egw decreased continuously with the continuous decline in gwl and areas with shallow water depths fig 12 pgw increased sharply during the simulation period driv was maintained at around 1 0 108 m3 due to the intensive interaction with groundwater and relatively stable gwl in areas along the heihe river it was worth noting that the groundwater system was in a negative balance status even in wet years this implied that gwl would decline continuously in the future if agricultural water use practices in the basin could not be well improved 3 4 2 representative zone according to the long term gwl dynamics four representative zones were defined in the basin fig 13 zone 3 zone 1 zone 2 and zone 4 were representative for the areas with sharp continuous gwl decline slow continuous gwl decline decreasing and then increasing gwl trends and stable gwl trends respectively total water use in zone 1 2 and 4 was based on the joint use of groundwater and river water while that for zone 3 was only from groundwater pumping groundwater balance of four representative zones is calculated and presented in fig 13 results revealed that the average water balance for zone 3 was negative at 100 mm water depth per year and the recharge amount was less than one third of discharge one groundwater funnel had appeared in zone 3 since 2000 with the affected area increasing in the following years this caused obviously negative impact on local ecosystem zone 1 was also facing the similar problems but with less severe situation as zone 3 there used to be enough surface water for zone 1 during 1991 1997 recharge from irrigation being as the main recharge component for groundwater was slightly larger than the discharge components in that period however after 1997 less surface water was diverted for irrigation in those districts far from the heihe river or at the tail of canal system like zone 1 and more groundwater was pumped as supplement to fit the increasing water demand induced by agricultural expansion as a result total groundwater recharge was only half of discharge causing the decline of gwls on the other hand there were also some regions in which the ecosystem was relatively safe such as zone 2 located at the head of canal system could divert enough surface river water for irrigation gwls only declined in a few years especially in dry years and then rose up to a similar level in the following wet years as compared with that in 1991 moreover zone 4 located nearby the heihe river could also receive abundant surface water for irrigation enough or even excessive surface water and the intensive interaction with heihe river had made the gwl in a relatively stable situation however agriculture in those areas should also be limited to a reasonable level so that other areas could obtain more surface water avoiding over groundwater pumping 3 5 insight on irrigation and groundwater management in this study modeling results clearly presented several problems of continuous water table decline and the related impact factors in a long term period increase in irrigated area and irrigation water demand resulted in significant gwl decline the reduction of river water allocation after applying ewdp led to larger or excessive groundwater exploitation due to unreasonable management of groundwater pumping and relatively lower efficiency of water saving practices that mainly focused on construction of canal system for economic benefits but in deficit of well management the area with gwds less than critical ones was even reduced by 30 which was obviously dangerous evidence to the growth of natural vegetation and the health of ecosystem the recovery of groundwater level in some local areas was mainly caused by wetter climate in 2000s instead of management improvement the overall declining trend of gwls was still foreseen if irrigation water crop pattern and land use were maintained as present those would strongly challenge the sustainable development of the zhangye basin and require a balance between economic development and ecosystem restoration modeling results showed that the appropriate alternatives should have focused on 1 controlling or even reducing the farmland area e g returning farmlands to grasslands 2 supervising groundwater pumping and or close wells in those areas with significant gwl decline e g in downstream basin 3 implementing the water saving practices wsps at both farmland and regional scale to improve field water use efficiency increase conveyance efficiency by means of providing services in practices and prevent the possible over groundwater pumping in lower reaches of canals and rivers strategies to restore eco environment should also be determined according to the local conditions and classification overall how to recover the groundwater levels was quite necessary to be studied in future the effects of various alternatives on groundwater dynamics would be further investigated in our follow up researches 4 conclusion the zhangye basin of heihe river basin hrb was chosen as the representative case for analyzing the long term groundwater dynamics affected by the rapid development of irrigated agriculture in arid inland river basins of northwest china a three dimensional groundwater flow model was developed for the zhangye basin of middle oasis of hrb with carefully considering the recharge from field irrigation determined by using an ago hydrological model swap epic the model was well calibrated and validated with the groundwater level gwl data of 50 observation wells over the periods of 1991 2001 and 2001 2010 respectively then the model was used to analyze the long term gwl dynamics and water balance changes and to further identify their impact factors firstly the detailed groundwater dynamics for a long term period 20 years were given in this study compared to the former researches three gwl trends were found i e relatively stable trend decreasing and then increasing trend and continuously or even extremely decreasing trend as a result the average gwl declined with an average rate of 9 cm a 1 for the zhangye basin secondly recharge from irrigation water rirg and that from river seepage rriv respectively accounted for 64 3 and 31 7 of the total recharge whereas the spring overflow spr groundwater evaporation egw groundwater pumping pgw and discharge to the rivers driv accounted for 42 3 31 9 17 9 and 7 9 of the total discharge respectively the balance of groundwater system for the zhangye basin was negative with a value of 2 7 108 m3 per year in average thirdly some areas with large groundwater exploitation were suffering from the continuous gwl decline the average storage change δs could reach to 100 mm water depth resulting in obvious groundwater funnel in the basin fourthly the area with critical groundwater depth e g 5 m has reduced about 30 in 2010 as compared with that in 1991 relevant ecosystem restoring measures were also proposed focusing on controlling or reducing the farmland area and groundwater exploitation and promoting the water saving practices it should also be useful to irrigation water use for oasis areas in other inland river basins that are facing the similar water use issues the strategies for restoration measures and the related decision making on groundwater management in oasis areas should be further studied in the follow up researches acknowledgements this research was jointly supported by the national natural science foundation of china

11466,the search for new water resources for irrigation is a mandatory requirement in mediterranean agroecosystems the impacts of irrigation with water from different origins were evaluated in the soil microbial community and plant physiology of grapefruit and mandarin trees in the south east of spain the following treatments were considered i freshwater with an electrical conductivity ec of 1 0 ds m 1 from the tagus segura water transfer canal and well tw ii reclaimed water ec 3 21 ds m 1 from a wastewater treatment plant rw iii irrigation with tw except in the second stage of fruit development when rw was utilized twc and iv irrigation with rw except in the second stage when tw was used rwc phospholipid fatty acids plfas revealed that microbial biomass was higher in the grapefruit soil than in the mandarin soil in grapefruit soil tw treatment showed a lower bacterial plfa content than rw rwc and twc while rw showed the lowest values in the mandarin soil in grapefruit soil β glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities were greater in rw and twc than in tw and rwc under mandarin the greatest activity of these enzymes was recorded in the twc treatment the saline stress caused lower net photosynthesis a and stomatal conductance g s in plants of rw rwc and twc than in plants of tw treatment the annual use of reclaimed water or the combined irrigation with twc benefited microbial biomass and enzyme activities of grapefruit soil in contrast the microbial community of mandarin soil seemed more affected by the annual irrigation with reclaimed water keywords irrigation soil microbial community enzyme activities semiarid plant physiology 1 introduction in mediterranean regions water availability is predicted to decrease in the coming decades the region of murcia located in the south east of spain is characterized by a deficit of water resources that reaches 606 mm3 ibor et al 2011 in these conditions farmers need to handle the deficit of water or consider non conventional water resources for irrigation mounzer et al 2013 the use of water reclaimed from wastewaters is a feasible option for agriculture this water has the problem of containing an excess of salts that may increase the electrical conductivity and the risk of soil salinization becerra castro et al 2015 and containing contaminants either of these factors could affect the productivity of agroecosystems ibekwe et al 2010 conversely reclaimed water has readily available sources of organic matter that could improve the productivity in agricultural areas chen et al 2008 in this sense several studies have revealed that the use of reclaimed water has benefits on the productivity and physiology of citrus sp crops garcía orenes et al 2015 pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 nevertheless the salinity and the heavy metal content of wastewaters must be considered for the irrigation of citrus sp pereira et al 2011 grattan et al 2015 paudel et al 2016 found that treated wastewater negatively affected citrus sp root system while these effects were strongly dependent on soil texture so meaning that soil properties must be carefully considered when wastewater irrigation is utilized alternatively irrigation with combined wastewater and freshwater can be an adequate solution to the problems commonly related to wastewater use in citrus sp agroecosystems such high salinity and boron concentration pedrero and alarcón 2009 soil is the fundamental substrate of agriculture however the profound evaluation of the impacts of wastewater irrigation in soil has been not frequently carried out together with plant responses within soil microorganisms are greatly responsible for the dynamics of organic matter which remain fundamental to crop yield and soil sustainability acosta martínez et al 2003 zornoza et al 2015 moreover soil microbial properties can act as early warning indicators of changes in ecosystems nannipieri et al 1990 bastida et al 2008a tejada and benítez 2014 zornoza et al 2015 in this sense the potential negative effects of wastewaters in plants can be early detected by soil microbial parameters traditionally the activity of microorganisms has been evaluated by microbial ecosystemic indicators such as soil respiration and enzyme activities involved in the cycles of c n and p bastida et al 2008a rodríguez morgado et al 2015 furthermore phospholipid fatty acids plfas can be used for evaluating the impact of agricultural practices on the biomass and structure of the soil microbial community frostegard et al 1993 bastida et al 2008b torres et al 2015 nevertheless the impacts of irrigation with reclaimed water in soil microbial community are controversial and further studies are required for instance several studies found that long term irrigation with reclaimed water in a semiarid soil fostered the activity of the soil microbial community without negative effects in microbial biomass meli et al 2002 garcía orenes et al 2015 while other studies reported increases of soil microbial biomass adrover et al 2012 or an absence of variations in soil microbial activity elifantz et al 2011 in some cases changes in soil microbial activity after irrigation with reclaimed water have been related to variations in the composition of the soil microbial community wafula et al 2015 however frenk et al 2015 observed that reclaimed water did not impact the composition of the soil microbial community in a previous study the impact of regulated deficit irrigation and water quality freshwater vs saline reclaimed water in the soil microbial community of a grapefruit orchard was evaluated bastida et al 2017 however there are no studies that have evaluated the responses of the soil microbial community to the alternative irrigation with different water sources i e freshwater or reclaimed water through the growing season this strategy could minimize the negative impacts of the continuous irrigation with reclaimed water and the same time avoids an excessive utilization of freshwater which is limiting in south east spain here we extent the knowledge on the adaptations to water scarcity in mediterranean agroecosystems for this purpose we evaluate the impacts of combinations of water from different sources in the soil microbial community of two crops with distinct water demands mandarin and grapefruit pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 the reason behind this objective is that citrus spp are less susceptibile to reclaimed water in summer nicolás et al 2016 hence the use of reclaimed water exclusively in summer with freshwater being used the rest of the year can be an adequate approach to save water in mediterranean areas however the impacts of combined treatments in comparison to single water source irrigation on soil sustainability including chemical and microbiological indicators are not fully known from a water management perspective this study aims to answer to the following question is it better the irrigation with wastewater alone or in combination with freshwater we hypothesized that reclaimed water would increase the soil salinity and that the responses of the soil microbial community would be mediated by the sensitivity of each rootstock and crop to salinity in this respect combinations of water from different sources might represent a proper strategy for combating water limitations in mediterranean agroecosystems while maintaining soil sustainability furthermore given the different plant water relationships of the two citrus spp studied here soil microbial biomass and community structure were expected to differ between crops and between irrigation treatments 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area irrigation treatments and soil sampling the experiment was carried out in campotéjar murcia spain 38 07 18 n 1 13 15 w with a mediterranean semiarid climate the annual reference evapotranspiration et0 and rainfall are on average 1326 and 300 mm respectively within this area an orchard of 1 ha was cultivated with 2 crops one crop consisted of 16 year old mandarin trees citrus clementina cv orogrande grafted on carrizo

from a nearby wastewater treatment plant ec 3 21 ds m 1 reclaimed water rw treatments tw and rw were applied along the growing season for both citrus species from 2008 onwards in the third and fourth treatments the trees were irrigated by combining the water sources in different ways either the trees were irrigated with tw except in the second stage of fruit development 55 65 days between late june and mid september when rw was applied twc or conversely the trees were irrigated with rw except in this second stage when tw was used rwc from 2013 treatments twc and rwc were applied to soils

2015 which corresponds to the harvest period for both species the provided water analyses correspond to annual average values for 2014 and 2015 n 12 the irrigation system consisted of a single drip line laid on the soil surface next to each tree row this system provided three pressure compensating in line emitters per tree each discharging 4 l h 1 which were placed 0 85 m from the trunk and spaced 0 9 m apart in the mandarin trees and were placed 1 m from the trunk and spaced 1 m apart in the grapefruit trees the irrigation doses were scheduled on the basis of the daily crop

mid may until early october to 3 days per week in winter the trees were irrigated at 100 etc from january to december the total amount of water applied was quantified with inline water flow meters the amount of water applied was 5945 and 7531 m3 ha 1 for grapefruit and mandarin respectively the irrigation was controlled automatically by a head unit programmer and electro hydraulic valves all treatments included application of the same amounts of fertilizer n p2o5 k2o applied through the drip irrigation system 215 100 90 kg ha 1 year 1 for mandarin trees and 215 110 150 kg ha 1 year 1 for grapefruit trees weeds were eradicated in the orchard by applying the farmers commonly used pest control methods romero trigueros et al 2017 a layout depicting the drip lines for mandarin and grapefruit is available in mounzer et al 2013 and pedrero et al 2015 respectively three replicate plots n 3 for each treatment and crop were established a composite soil sample under the canopy of one tree for each of the three plots was sampled in october 2015 each composite soil sample was composed of six subsamples the samples were sieved at 2 mm a fraction of each sample was stored at room temperature for chemical analysis and the rest was stored at 4 c until the biochemical and microbial analyses were done 2 2 water characterization soil characteristics and sampling water samples were analyzed as described by bastida et al 2017 the soil within the first 90 cm depth had a loamy texture 24 clay 33 loam and 43 sand with an average bulk density of 1 37 g cm 3 soil was classified as a

photosynthesis a and stomatal conductance gs the stem water potential ψs was affected significantly by crop table 2 lower annual average values of a and g s were observed in plants irrigated with rw rwc or twc in comparison to tw table 5 the average annual values of a ranged between 12 92 and 9 76 μmol m 2 s 1 in tw and rwc respectively in the case of grapefruit in mandarin trees the values were 8 77 and 6 81 μmol m 2 s 1 in tw and rw respectively similar pattern was observed in the average annual values of gs which ranged between 0 161 and 0 105 mol m 2 s 1 in tw and rwc respectively for grapefruit in mandarin trees the values were 0 086 and 0 062 mol m 2 s 1 in tw and rw respectively table 5 regarding plant water status both species reached similar ψstem values in the different irrigation treatments although grapefruit had a lower average annual value of 1 11 mpa across the treatments with respect to 0 81 mpa in mandarin trees the yield was influenced by crop but not by irrigation treatment table 2 grapefruit yield was similar for all irrigation treatments and reached about 100 t ha 1 table 5 in the case of mandarin tw rw and rwc showed similar yields while twc reached higher values of 45 t ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 the biomass and structure of the soil microbial community irrigation treatments did not negatively influenced the yield of grapefruit and mandarin in comparison to tw treatments however our analysis revealed that irrigation treatments did influenced the belowground soil microbial community in a crop specific manner the analysis of plfas suggested different sensitivities of the soil microbial communities from grapefruit and mandarin crops to the irrigation treatments these findings are probably related to the sensitivity of each rootstock and root growth to salinity these results highlight the importance of evaluating the impact of irrigation systems on the soil microbial community of different crops several studies have demonstrated plant species specific effects in soil microbial biomass through the use of plfas eo et al 2015 stefanowicz et al 2016 the greater microbial biomass in grapefruit soil was linked to the greater plant activity and yield in comparison to mandarin as revealed by the higher net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in grapefruit the bacterial biomass was stimulated by irrigation with reclaimed water rw twc and rwc in grapefruit soil but not in mandarin soil moreover the use of rw during the whole year decreased the microbial biomass in mandarin soil while the seasonal combinations twc and rwc mantained it at the control level tw as hypothesized the combined water treatments influenced positively the biomass of the soil microbial community but this effect was dependent on the crop nevertheless mandarin yield was higher in twc than in other treatments however this higher yield in twc was not related to a similar response in soil microbial biomass the distinct responses of the two species could be due to the fact that rootstocks had different physiological resilience to salinity pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 citrus macrophylla is tolerant to salinity while carrizo citrange is more sensitive indeed a significant decrease in mandarin net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance was observed in treatment rw which coincided with the lower soil microbial biomass in comparison to tw however no negative effects of irrigation with reclaimed water were observed in grapefruit indeed there were not significant differences in grapefruit yield between the assayed treatments previous research has highlighted that plant water relations may be affected by water origin paranychianakis et al 2004 and ψstem may regulate processes such leaf physiological parameters a and g s gomes et al 2004 thus the distinct physiological nature and water relations of each crop could have a critical influence on the structure of belowground microbial communities indeed various studies particularly in agroecosystems have noticed that plant species may alter the structure of the microbial community kowalchuk et al 2002 haichar et al 2008 it is noteworthy that the selection of a particular microbial community under each of the two crop species studied here occurred even though both crops were located in the same soil and received the same irrigation treatments furthermore we found clear impacts of the irrigation treatments on the structure of the soil microbial communities under both crops as demonstrated in other studies gatta et al 2015 garcía orenes et al 2015 the structures of the communities from tw and rw soil were clearly different from those of the combined treatments indeed the application of rw only in summer twc increased the ratio between gram positive and gram negative bacterial fatty acids in comparison to the irrigation during the whole year with reclaimed water rw the fact that the gram positive bacteria include groups with endosporulation ability could mean that the twc treatment promoted a reservoir of microbial activity in soil indeed the increase of gram positive in comparison to gram negative bacteria has been suggested as an indicator of soil resistance against harsh conditions de vries and shade 2013 however twc and rwc clustered closely for both crops overall these findings suggest that i the structure of the microbial community is controlled predominantly by the plant species i e root growth or the rootstock tolerance to salinity rather than by the irrigation treatments ii the irrigation treatments impacted the structure of the microbial community of each crop and may explain further changes in microbial activity as discussed below and iii combined dual irrigation twc and rwc treatments led to the evolution of a similar community structure since the microbial community of wastewater has short persistence in soil garcía orenes et al 2007 becerra castro et al 2015 it is possible that the changes in community structure are due to the combination of the fertility effect of wastewater and the growth inhibition caused by salinity becerra castro et al 2015 4 2 the activity of the soil microbial community the respiration of organic matter by soil microbial communities produces co2 in the present study soil respiration and enzyme activities were higher overall under grapefruit trees than under mandarin probably these results derive from the greater plant activity of grapefruit and the promotion of a more abundant microbial community under grapefruit as revealed by the analysis of plfas the soil under grapefruit exhibited greater activity in terms of soil respiration and enzymes related to the cycles of c n and p with treatments rw rwc and twc than with tw several studies observed increased extracellular enzyme activities in soils treated with reclaimed water and explained that the soluble organic matter contained in such water can act as a substrate for these enzymes and for microbial growth adrover et al 2012 chen et al 2015 garcía orenes et al 2015 nevertheless changes in enzyme activities and respiration can be also explained by variations in community structure as observed in this study despite the efforts to evaluate these extracellular enzymes involved in the cycling of nutrients little has been done to understand the responses of polyphenol oxidase in agroecosystems this enzyme participates in the formation of soil humic substances sinsabaugh 2010 lucas borja et al 2012 interestingly the activity of this enzyme was greatest with treatment rw for grapefruit soil and with rwc for mandarin this result not only reinforces the differing impact of reclaimed water on the soil biogeochemistry under the two crops but also highlights potential differences in the stabilization of organic matter under each crop although some authors have argued that elevated salinity could produce a less efficient microbial community in terms of using c sources rietz and haynes 2003 we found evidence that supports the selection of a resistant and well adapted microbial community which maintains nutrient cycling in soil for instance the microbial biomass of mandarin soil was low for rw in comparison to twc but its high microbial efficiency is manifested by the higher mb toc and resp toc ratios for rw in comparison to twc thus it seems that a less abundant but more efficient microbial community was selected under mandarin trees receiving rw irrigation and that this microbial community made use of the soluble organic matter contained in the reclaimed water 5 conclusion irrigation with reclaimed water did not negatively impact the soil microbial community of semiarid soils under grapefruit and mandarin crops indeed the annual use of reclaimed water or the dual irrigation with twc influenced positively the microbial biomass and biogeochemical activities of soil microbial communities under grapefruit the mandarin community seemed more sensitive to the annual irrigation with rw but overall responded positively to dual irrigation particularly twc changes in biomass and activity were coupled to variations in the structure of the microbial community these microbial responses were probably shaped by the specific plant physiology the rootstock sensitivity to salinity and water relations of the crop these findings support the specific selection of a given microbial community by each crop overall crop yield was not negatively affected by the irrigation with reclaimed water our results evidenced that the use of reclaimed water when crop demands cannot be satisfied does not negatively affect soil sustainability acknowledgements felipe bastida is grateful the spanish government for his ramón y cajal

11466,the search for new water resources for irrigation is a mandatory requirement in mediterranean agroecosystems the impacts of irrigation with water from different origins were evaluated in the soil microbial community and plant physiology of grapefruit and mandarin trees in the south east of spain the following treatments were considered i freshwater with an electrical conductivity ec of 1 0 ds m 1 from the tagus segura water transfer canal and well tw ii reclaimed water ec 3 21 ds m 1 from a wastewater treatment plant rw iii irrigation with tw except in the second stage of fruit development when rw was utilized twc and iv irrigation with rw except in the second stage when tw was used rwc phospholipid fatty acids plfas revealed that microbial biomass was higher in the grapefruit soil than in the mandarin soil in grapefruit soil tw treatment showed a lower bacterial plfa content than rw rwc and twc while rw showed the lowest values in the mandarin soil in grapefruit soil β glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities were greater in rw and twc than in tw and rwc under mandarin the greatest activity of these enzymes was recorded in the twc treatment the saline stress caused lower net photosynthesis a and stomatal conductance g s in plants of rw rwc and twc than in plants of tw treatment the annual use of reclaimed water or the combined irrigation with twc benefited microbial biomass and enzyme activities of grapefruit soil in contrast the microbial community of mandarin soil seemed more affected by the annual irrigation with reclaimed water keywords irrigation soil microbial community enzyme activities semiarid plant physiology 1 introduction in mediterranean regions water availability is predicted to decrease in the coming decades the region of murcia located in the south east of spain is characterized by a deficit of water resources that reaches 606 mm3 ibor et al 2011 in these conditions farmers need to handle the deficit of water or consider non conventional water resources for irrigation mounzer et al 2013 the use of water reclaimed from wastewaters is a feasible option for agriculture this water has the problem of containing an excess of salts that may increase the electrical conductivity and the risk of soil salinization becerra castro et al 2015 and containing contaminants either of these factors could affect the productivity of agroecosystems ibekwe et al 2010 conversely reclaimed water has readily available sources of organic matter that could improve the productivity in agricultural areas chen et al 2008 in this sense several studies have revealed that the use of reclaimed water has benefits on the productivity and physiology of citrus sp crops garcía orenes et al 2015 pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 nevertheless the salinity and the heavy metal content of wastewaters must be considered for the irrigation of citrus sp pereira et al 2011 grattan et al 2015 paudel et al 2016 found that treated wastewater negatively affected citrus sp root system while these effects were strongly dependent on soil texture so meaning that soil properties must be carefully considered when wastewater irrigation is utilized alternatively irrigation with combined wastewater and freshwater can be an adequate solution to the problems commonly related to wastewater use in citrus sp agroecosystems such high salinity and boron concentration pedrero and alarcón 2009 soil is the fundamental substrate of agriculture however the profound evaluation of the impacts of wastewater irrigation in soil has been not frequently carried out together with plant responses within soil microorganisms are greatly responsible for the dynamics of organic matter which remain fundamental to crop yield and soil sustainability acosta martínez et al 2003 zornoza et al 2015 moreover soil microbial properties can act as early warning indicators of changes in ecosystems nannipieri et al 1990 bastida et al 2008a tejada and benítez 2014 zornoza et al 2015 in this sense the potential negative effects of wastewaters in plants can be early detected by soil microbial parameters traditionally the activity of microorganisms has been evaluated by microbial ecosystemic indicators such as soil respiration and enzyme activities involved in the cycles of c n and p bastida et al 2008a rodríguez morgado et al 2015 furthermore phospholipid fatty acids plfas can be used for evaluating the impact of agricultural practices on the biomass and structure of the soil microbial community frostegard et al 1993 bastida et al 2008b torres et al 2015 nevertheless the impacts of irrigation with reclaimed water in soil microbial community are controversial and further studies are required for instance several studies found that long term irrigation with reclaimed water in a semiarid soil fostered the activity of the soil microbial community without negative effects in microbial biomass meli et al 2002 garcía orenes et al 2015 while other studies reported increases of soil microbial biomass adrover et al 2012 or an absence of variations in soil microbial activity elifantz et al 2011 in some cases changes in soil microbial activity after irrigation with reclaimed water have been related to variations in the composition of the soil microbial community wafula et al 2015 however frenk et al 2015 observed that reclaimed water did not impact the composition of the soil microbial community in a previous study the impact of regulated deficit irrigation and water quality freshwater vs saline reclaimed water in the soil microbial community of a grapefruit orchard was evaluated bastida et al 2017 however there are no studies that have evaluated the responses of the soil microbial community to the alternative irrigation with different water sources i e freshwater or reclaimed water through the growing season this strategy could minimize the negative impacts of the continuous irrigation with reclaimed water and the same time avoids an excessive utilization of freshwater which is limiting in south east spain here we extent the knowledge on the adaptations to water scarcity in mediterranean agroecosystems for this purpose we evaluate the impacts of combinations of water from different sources in the soil microbial community of two crops with distinct water demands mandarin and grapefruit pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 the reason behind this objective is that citrus spp are less susceptibile to reclaimed water in summer nicolás et al 2016 hence the use of reclaimed water exclusively in summer with freshwater being used the rest of the year can be an adequate approach to save water in mediterranean areas however the impacts of combined treatments in comparison to single water source irrigation on soil sustainability including chemical and microbiological indicators are not fully known from a water management perspective this study aims to answer to the following question is it better the irrigation with wastewater alone or in combination with freshwater we hypothesized that reclaimed water would increase the soil salinity and that the responses of the soil microbial community would be mediated by the sensitivity of each rootstock and crop to salinity in this respect combinations of water from different sources might represent a proper strategy for combating water limitations in mediterranean agroecosystems while maintaining soil sustainability furthermore given the different plant water relationships of the two citrus spp studied here soil microbial biomass and community structure were expected to differ between crops and between irrigation treatments 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental area irrigation treatments

grapefruit trees weeds were eradicated in the orchard by applying the farmers commonly used pest control methods romero trigueros et al 2017 a layout depicting the drip lines for mandarin and grapefruit is available in mounzer et al 2013 and pedrero et al 2015 respectively three replicate plots n 3 for each treatment and crop were established a composite soil sample under the canopy of one tree for each of the three plots was sampled in october 2015 each composite soil sample was composed of six subsamples the samples were sieved at 2 mm a fraction of each sample was stored at room temperature for chemical analysis and the rest was stored at 4 c until the biochemical and microbial analyses were done 2 2 water characterization soil characteristics and sampling water samples were

was greatest in twc soil in the case of grapefruit and in rw in the case of mandarin table 3 the ratio between respiration and toc was greatest in twc soil samples for grapefruit in contrast for mandarin this ratio was lowest in twc samples the enzyme activities were higher in grapefruit soil than in mandarin soil with the exception of β glucosidase cellobiohydrolase and p phenol oxidase for twc the enzyme activites of soils irrigated with reclaimed water were never lower than for tw fig 3 in grapefruit soil the β glucosidase and cellobiohydrolase activities were greater in rw and twc than in tw and rwc in mandarin soil these enzyme activities were greatest for twc and no differences were observed between tw and rwc the p phenol oxidase activity was greatest for rw soil in the case of grapefruit and for rwc in the case of mandarin fig 3 urease activity was higher for rw than for the rest of the treatments for both crops fig 4 for both crops the n acetyl glucosaminidase activity was greatest for rw and twc phosphatase activity was greatest for twc under both crops 3 4 plant physiology and crop yield the treatment and crop and their interaction influenced significantly the net photosynthesis a and stomatal conductance gs the stem water potential ψs was affected significantly by crop table 2 lower annual average values of a and g s were observed in plants irrigated with rw rwc or twc in comparison to tw table 5 the average annual values of a ranged between 12 92 and 9 76 μmol m 2 s 1 in tw and rwc respectively in the case of grapefruit in mandarin trees the values were 8 77 and 6 81 μmol m 2 s 1 in tw and rw respectively similar pattern was observed in the average annual values of gs which ranged between 0 161 and 0 105 mol m 2 s 1 in tw and rwc respectively for grapefruit in mandarin trees the values were 0 086 and 0 062 mol m 2 s 1 in tw and rw respectively table 5 regarding plant water status both species reached similar ψstem values in the different irrigation treatments although grapefruit had a lower average annual value of 1 11 mpa across the treatments with respect to 0 81 mpa in mandarin trees the yield was influenced by crop but not by irrigation treatment table 2 grapefruit yield was similar for all irrigation treatments and reached about 100 t ha 1 table 5 in the case of mandarin tw rw and rwc showed similar yields while twc reached higher values of 45 t ha 1 4 discussion 4 1 the biomass and structure of the soil microbial community irrigation treatments did not negatively influenced the yield of grapefruit and mandarin in comparison to tw treatments however our analysis revealed that irrigation treatments did influenced the belowground soil microbial community in a crop specific manner the analysis of plfas suggested different sensitivities of the soil microbial communities from grapefruit and mandarin crops to the irrigation treatments these findings are probably related to the sensitivity of each rootstock and root growth to salinity these results highlight the importance of evaluating the impact of irrigation systems on the soil microbial community of different crops several studies have demonstrated plant species specific effects in soil microbial biomass through the use of plfas eo et al 2015 stefanowicz et al 2016 the greater microbial biomass in grapefruit soil was linked to the greater plant activity and yield in comparison to mandarin as revealed by the higher net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in grapefruit the bacterial biomass was stimulated by irrigation with reclaimed water rw twc and rwc in grapefruit soil but not in mandarin soil moreover the use of rw during the whole year decreased the microbial biomass in mandarin soil while the seasonal combinations twc and rwc mantained it at the control level tw as hypothesized the combined water treatments influenced positively the biomass of the soil microbial community but this effect was dependent on the crop nevertheless mandarin yield was higher in twc than in other treatments however this higher yield in twc was not related to a similar response in soil microbial biomass the distinct responses of the two species could be due to the fact that rootstocks had different physiological resilience to salinity pedrero et al 2015 nicolás et al 2016 citrus macrophylla is tolerant to salinity while carrizo citrange is more sensitive indeed a significant decrease in mandarin net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance was observed in treatment rw which coincided with the lower soil microbial biomass in comparison to tw however no negative effects of irrigation with reclaimed water were observed in grapefruit indeed there were not significant differences in grapefruit yield between the assayed treatments previous research has highlighted that plant water relations may be affected by water origin paranychianakis et al 2004 and ψstem may regulate processes such leaf physiological parameters a and g s gomes et al 2004 thus the distinct physiological nature and water relations of each crop could have a critical influence on the structure of belowground microbial communities indeed various studies particularly in agroecosystems have noticed that plant species may alter the structure of the microbial community kowalchuk et al 2002 haichar et al 2008 it is noteworthy that the selection of a particular microbial community under each of the two crop species studied here occurred even though both crops were located in the same soil and received the same irrigation treatments furthermore we found clear impacts of the irrigation treatments on the structure of the soil microbial communities under both crops as demonstrated in other studies gatta et al 2015 garcía orenes et al 2015 the structures of the communities from tw and rw soil were clearly different from those of the combined treatments indeed the application of rw only in summer twc increased the ratio between gram positive and gram negative bacterial fatty acids in comparison to the irrigation during the whole year with reclaimed water rw the fact that the gram positive bacteria include groups with endosporulation ability could mean that the twc treatment promoted a reservoir of microbial activity in soil indeed the increase of gram positive in comparison to gram negative bacteria has been suggested as an indicator of soil resistance against harsh conditions de vries and shade 2013 however twc and rwc clustered closely for both crops overall these findings suggest that i the structure of the microbial community is controlled predominantly by the plant species i e root growth or the rootstock tolerance to salinity rather than by the irrigation treatments ii the irrigation treatments impacted the structure of the microbial community of each crop and may explain further changes in microbial activity as discussed below and iii combined dual irrigation twc and rwc treatments led to the evolution of a similar community structure since the microbial community of wastewater has short persistence in soil garcía orenes et al 2007 becerra castro et al 2015 it is possible that the changes in community structure are due to the combination of the fertility effect of wastewater and the growth inhibition caused by salinity becerra castro et al 2015 4 2 the activity of the soil microbial community the respiration of organic matter by soil microbial communities produces co2 in the present study soil respiration and enzyme activities were higher overall under grapefruit trees than under mandarin probably these results derive from the greater plant activity of grapefruit and the promotion of a more abundant microbial community under grapefruit as revealed by the analysis of plfas the soil under grapefruit exhibited greater activity in terms of soil respiration and enzymes related to the cycles of c n and p with treatments rw rwc and twc than with tw several studies observed increased extracellular enzyme activities in soils treated with reclaimed water and explained that the soluble organic matter contained in such water can act as a substrate for these enzymes and for microbial growth adrover et al 2012 chen et al 2015 garcía orenes et al 2015 nevertheless changes in enzyme activities and respiration can be also explained by variations in community structure as observed in this study despite the efforts to evaluate these extracellular enzymes involved in the cycling of nutrients little has been done to understand the responses of polyphenol oxidase in agroecosystems this enzyme participates in the formation of soil humic substances sinsabaugh 2010 lucas borja et al 2012 interestingly the activity of this enzyme was greatest with treatment rw for grapefruit soil and with rwc for mandarin this result not only reinforces the differing impact of reclaimed water on the soil biogeochemistry under the two crops but also highlights potential differences in the stabilization of organic matter under each crop although some authors have argued that elevated salinity could produce a less efficient microbial community in terms of using c sources rietz and haynes 2003 we found evidence that supports the selection of a resistant and well adapted microbial community which maintains nutrient cycling in soil for instance the microbial biomass of mandarin soil was low for rw in comparison to twc but its high microbial efficiency is manifested by the higher mb toc and resp toc ratios for rw in comparison to twc thus it seems that a less abundant but more efficient microbial community was selected under mandarin trees receiving rw irrigation and that this microbial community made use of the soluble organic matter contained in the reclaimed water 5 conclusion irrigation with reclaimed water did not negatively impact the soil microbial community of semiarid soils under grapefruit and mandarin crops indeed the annual use of reclaimed water or the dual irrigation with twc influenced positively the microbial biomass and biogeochemical activities of soil microbial communities under grapefruit the mandarin community seemed more sensitive to the annual irrigation with rw but overall responded positively to dual irrigation particularly twc changes in biomass and activity were coupled to variations in the structure of the microbial community these microbial responses were probably shaped by the specific plant physiology the rootstock sensitivity to salinity and water relations of the crop these findings support the specific selection of a given microbial community by each crop overall crop yield was not negatively affected by the irrigation with reclaimed water our results evidenced that the use of reclaimed water when crop demands cannot be satisfied does not negatively affect soil sustainability acknowledgements felipe bastida is grateful the spanish government for his ramón y cajal

11467,improvements in soil water balance modeling can be beneficial for optimizing irrigation management to account for spatial variability in soil properties and evapotranspiration et a remote sensing based et and water balance model was tested for irrigation management in an experiment at two university of nebraska lincoln research sites located near mead and brule nebraska both fields included a center pivot equipped with variable rate irrigation vri the study included maize in 2015 and 2016 and soybean in 2016 at mead and maize in 2016 at brule for a total of 210 plot years four irrigation treatments were applied at mead including vri based on a remote sensing model vri rs vri based on neutron probe soil water content measurement vri np uniform irrigation based on neutron probe measurement and rainfed only the vri rs and uniform treatments were applied at brule landsat 7 and 8 imagery were used for model input in 2015 the remote sensing model included reflectance based crop coefficients for et estimation in the water balance in 2016 a hybrid component of the model was activated which included energy balance modeled et as an input both 2015 and 2016 had above average precipitation at mead subsequently irrigation amounts were relatively low seasonal irrigation was greatest for the vri rs treatment in all cases because of drift in the water balance model this was likely caused by excessive soil evaporation estimates irrigation application for the vri np at mead was about 0 mm 6 mm and 12 mm less in separate analyses than for the uniform treatment irrigation for the vri rs was about 40 mm 50 mm and 98 mm greater in separate analyses than the uniform at mead and about 18 mm greater at brule for maize at mead treatment effects were primarily limited to hydrologic responses e g et with differences in yield generally attributed to random error rainfed soybean yields were greater than vri rs yields which may have been related to yield loss from lodging perhaps due to over irrigation regarding the magnitude of spatial variability in the fields soil available water capacity generally ranked above et precipitation and yield future research should include increased cloud free imagery frequency incorporation of soil water content measurements into the model and improved wet soil evaporation and drainage estimates keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing soil water balance variable rate irrigation 1 introduction modeled water balances are a common method for irrigation management e g martin et al 1990 irrigation management may be improved by using spatial evapotranspiration et and soil water models a number of spatial et models have been developed and tested for this purpose gowda et al 2007 while useful in general spatial et may be of particular interest in variable rate irrigation vri management in previous research lo et al 2016 quantified reductions in pumping from using vri to manage for spatial variability in available water capacity awc but did not account for spatial variability in et accurate subfield scale et and water balance models could provide a valuable spatial component to vri and conventional irrigation application stone et al 2016 used a multispectral remote sensing based et model for vri management with promising results however there is a need for vri research performed at the scale of commercial production fields e g 60 ha one benefit of applying remote sensing based models in irrigation management is that such models include an indirect spatial measurement of the integrated crop response when coupled with spatial soil property data remote sensing et models may be used to compute spatial soil water balances e g neale et al 2012 these models have potential to be used for spatially informed irrigation management furthermore monitoring soil water alone is likely to be an impractical solution for vri management barker et al 2017 determined that three monitoring locations would be needed per management zone if using a neutron probe for their study conditions the hybrid model of neale et al 2012 is one such et and water balance model that is suited for irrigation management barker et al 2018 refined this hybrid model and evaluated its potential for use in vri management the hybrid model is a combination of reflectance based crop coefficients kcbrf bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1989 and the two source energy balance model tseb of norman et al 1995 the kcbrf method follows the reference et etr approach of estimating crop et etc employing a dimensionless crop coefficient kc as 1 e t c e t r k c e t r k s k c b k e where ks kcb and ke are dimensionless water stress basal and evaporation coefficients respectively allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 wright 1982 a water balance model may be used to compute ks and ke as presented by allen et al 1998 the kcb relates to the vegetation s potential to transpire and may change with crop time and location allen et al 1998 wright 1982 we refer to etc computed using kcbrf as etcrf in the remainder of this article in the kcbrf method the kcb is found using relationships between kcb and reflectance based vegetation indices bausch 1993 bausch and neale 1987 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi e g rouse et al 1974 may be used for this purpose as in neale et al 1989 bausch 1993 used the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 for this purpose a water balance can then be computed to model the soil water status of the managed crop root zone allen et al 1998 martin et al 1990 one approach may be to compute the water balance following the united nations food and agricultural organization s irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 hereafter referred to as fao56 such an approach was applied by stone et al 2016 in the hybrid methodology neale et al 2012 used the kcbrf method with a water balance to model soil water depletion the benefit of the hybrid method was that a kcbrf is relatively easy to estimate for periods between multispectral image collection dates barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 thus et may be modeled even on days without remote sensing imagery on thermal infrared image acquisition dates the model of neale et al 2012 also incorporates a second estimate of et using the tseb which is separate from the modeled water balance barker et al 2018 the tseb is a surface energy balance method which partitions remotely sensed radiometric temperature of the land surface into crop and soil temperatures norman et al 1995 the energy balance is solved for both crop and soil components a challenge with the tseb is that it requires thermal infrared imagery limiting its use to dates of image acquisition e g satellite overpass further detail on the tseb model is provided in barker et al 2018 the tseb et is incorporated into the water balance model using statistical interpolation neale et al 2012 the statistical weighting function used by neale et al 2012 to incorporate tseb et into the model is 2 e t w b a e t w b b w e t t s e b e t w b b where the subscripts wb and tseb represent et from the kcbrf based water balance and et from the tseb model respectively and the superscripts b and a are before and after incorporation of the tseb et and w is the kalman gain barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 upon incorporation of the tseb et the water balance is updated by back calculating the root zone depletion that would produce the ks necessary to compute eta wb eq 2 barker et al 2018 geli 2012 thus the hybrid method should be less prone to large water balance drift compared to modeling et with only a kcbrf based water balance other studies have tested the hybrid method e g barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 to adopt the method for irrigation management including vri there remains a need to test the methodology in irrigation scheduling therefore the main objective of the present study was to determine whether managing vri at a production scale using the hybrid model neale et al 2012 would result in reduced irrigation application without yield reduction or at least result in improved irrigation water use efficiency see howell 2001 this was done by using a remote sensing based water balance model to manage irrigation in a field experiment along with other irrigation treatments the spatial variability of awc et and yield were also assessed to identify the importance of each in spatial irrigation management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites a remote sensing based water balance model was tested for vri management in 2015 and 2016 at two field sites the primary study site was a center pivot irrigated field 41 165 n 96 430 w source google earth at the university of nebraska lincoln s eastern nebraska research and extension center located near mead nebraska mead fig 1 the field is approximately 53 ha in cropped area including rainfed corners and an access road as computed using arcgis 10 4 esri redlands ca based on an aerial image from usda fsa 2012 the soils in the field are primarily silty clay loam and silt loam soil survey staff 2016b the field was managed in roughly north and south halves the two halves of the field were cropped in opposite maize soybean annual rotations the field was managed as no till using controlled wheel traffic the only tillage operations were planting and anhydrous ammonia application for maize crops otherwise only minor earthwork had been performed in the field in recent years the field was grazed with cattle during the winter and at least during the winter between 2015 and 2016 cattle were apparently fed additional forage in parts of the field barker et al 2017 includes further description of the site the 2015 experiment was implemented in the north half of the field which was maize in 2016 the experiment was expanded into the south half to repeat maize while including soybean in the north half a second field 41 029 n 101 971 w source google earth was added in 2016 at the university of nebraska lincoln s west central water resources field laboratory located near brule nebraska brule fig 1 the brule site approximately 50 ha was in a drier climate and had greater soil variability than the mead site it had alluvial eolian soils which were primarily loam loamy sand and gravely loam soil survey staff 2016a the brule site was managed as a no till continuous maize system and was the site of historic residue management research van donk et al 2012 the study plots were in locations within the field that had no residue removal in recent years table 1 provides a list of planting and harvest dates for the study both fields were irrigated with model 8500 zimmatic lindsay corporation omaha ne center pivots the pivots were equipped with variable rate irrigation options lindsay corporation omaha ne including individual nozzle control sprinklers were mounted on top of the pivot lateral at mead and on drops roughly 2 1 m above ground surface at brule the pivot and vri systems were new in 2014 at mead and in 2015 at brule 2 2 experimental design the treatment design was unstructured with four treatments vri with remote sensing based water balance vri rs vri using neutron probe soil water content vri np uniform irrigation using neutron probe uniform and rainfed in both vri treatments each plot was irrigated according to a plot specific water balance in the vri rs model this plot specific water balance was modeled using remote sensing without updating the water balance with soil water content measurements the vri np treatment was irrigated similarly but used neutron probe measurements to update the water balance and did not include remote sensing input the uniform treatment was managed similarly to the vri np treatment but the water balance for only two of the plots was used to manage the entire treatment the rainfed treatment was prescribed no irrigation all four treatments were applied in the mead field only the vri rs and uniform treatments were included at brule the experimental design at mead was a generalized randomized complete block design k m eskridge personal communication plots were blocked into one of three large blocks based on plot median apparent electrical conductivity eca the median eca for each 30 6 by 60 1 m plot was filtered t lo k a miller and j d luck personal communications and interpolated eca data from a survey taken on november 12 2014 using a veris msp veris technologies salina ks barker et al 2017 deep range eca was used as a surrogate for soil texture specifically clay content see sudduth et al 2005 three eca blocks were generated separately for both the north and south halves of the field using quantiles of median plot eca in the respective half median plot eca was computed without proper regard to geospatial datum differences between interpolated eca data and plots however such should have only minor effect on the blocking assignments fig 1 includes a map of the plot layouts and interpolated eca data the eca blocks in the north are labeled 1 3 in fig 1 while the blocks in the south are labeled 4 6 in the north half of the field each treatment was randomly assigned to six plots within each of the eca blocks for a total of 72 plots the same treatment assignments were maintained in 2015 and 2016 in the south half of the field only three replicates per block treatment combination were included for a total of 36 plots the brule field was divided into blocks based on plot awc described in 2 4 quantiles of plot awc were used to generate five soil blocks radial distance from the pivot center was also included as a blocking criterion at brule to minimize any unexpected effects of the center pivot irrigation system such as a nozzle getting plugged thus the experimental design was a row column design the two treatments were randomly assigned to the six radial blocks pivot spans and the five awc blocks for a total of 30 plots at mead experimental plots were 36 6 m by 60 1 m in length along crop rows plots were sized to account for a 9 1 m irrigation transition area and to accommodate the yield monitor on the harvest combine joe d luck personal communication barker et al 2016 some areas of the mead field were avoided in the plot layout because of proximity to the pivot center a buried utility signs of soil disturbance historic earthwork an abandoned railroad wet low yielding area large within plot variations in eca and accessability barker et al 2017 similar plot dimensions were employed in the brule field i e minimum plot dimension of 36 6 m however other research in that location favored a radial design of the plot layout fig 1 areas near the center of the field were also excluded at brule data from some plots were excluded from the final analysis due to herbicide drift equipment malfunction etc the total number of plots included in the analysis at mead was 66 for 2015 maize 31 for 2016 maize and 56 for 2016 soybean the total number of plots included for maize at brule in 2016 was 26 other minor errors were determined to be negligible see barker 2017 for example during irrigation scheduling a miss entry of data for the southeast rain gauge at arddc for the period june 16 23 2016 resulted in cumulative precipitation that was 0 8 mm less than it should have been there were also some rain gauge data entry errors in 2015 both situations were corrected in post season processing 2 3 experimental satellite weather and soil moisture data primary experimental data included remote sensing imagery weather data and soil water content measurements the remote sensing data used in modeling was landsat 7 and landsat 8 imagery landsat pre collection data usgs eros user services personal communication 9 21 2017 including shortwave surface reflectance data were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs data available from the u s geological survey https lta cr usgs gov citation atmospheric corrections for the thermal infrared imagery were applied using surface emissivity values computed following brunsell and gillies 2002 see also barker et al 2018 a soil emissivity of 0 925 was erroneously used though a value of 0 955 may have been more appropriate brunsell and gillies 2002 vegetation emissivity was assumed to be 0 98 brunsell and gillies 2002 atmospheric correction parameters were obtained from the online application of barsi n d similar to what was detailed by barker et al 2018 using input local ground weather data there was one image for brule july 18 2016 for which correction parameters for the nearest integer latitude and longitude were used because the spatial interpolation of the web application did not work for that date thermal infrared image corrections and shortwave image stacking were performed using erdas imagine 2014 hexagon geospatial madison al necessary weather data were obtained from the high plains regional climate center for the nebraska mesonet memphis 5n and brule 6sw weather stations for the mead and brule sites respectively the memphis 6n weather station is located about 1 km ese of the mead field google earth and the brule 6sw station is located about 400 m ese of the brule field google earth instantaneous weather data for the tseb and etr were computed from hourly data etr was computed using the asce standardized tall reference et equation asce ewri 2005 vegetation height near the weather stations was assumed to be about 0 5 m for mead and 0 2 m for brule etr computations during the experiments measured wind speed was adjusted for use in etr computations in a manner similar to asce ewri 2005 eq b 14c wind speed was adjusted for use in the tseb over the crop canopies assuming an equal friction velocity over the crop and weather station surfaces both of these wind adjustment methods may be less accurate likely resulting in lower estimates of wind speed under some of the study conditions than the method developed by allen and wright 1997 in computing the response variables see 2 6 the adjustment of allen and wright 1997 was used for mead assuming a 0 5 m crop height and upwind distances of 400 m for both the weather station and reference surfaces for computing response variables at brule the wind was adjusted as in the main report of asce ewri 2005 also an incorrect weather station longitude was used in computing etr for mead during the experiment this was corrected when computing the response variables the combined effect of wind adjustment and longitude on annual etr in mead was approximately a 4 increase both years the effect of the wind adjustment at brule was an increase of less than 0 2 in annual etr in addition to the weather station data four isco model 674 rain gauges teledyne isco lincoln ne were installed near the perimeter of the field at the mead field site fig 1 the arithmetic mean precipitation from the four rain gauges was input into the water balance models following approximately weekly downloads when data from one or more rain gauges was missing or suspect it was excluded from the arithmetic mean the isco rain gauges were calibrated prior to both the 2015 and 2016 seasons gauges with unaccepted calibration discrepancies per the manufacturer s stated accuracy were adjusted arithmetically however this adjustment was only applied in post processing for 2015 and the adjustment for 2016 was slightly modified for the mead field the weather station precipitation was only used as needed in real time irrigation management and for season totals included in 3 2 the brule 6sw weather station was the only source of precipitation for the brule field weather station precipitation was taken as is without time adjustment finally barometric pressure data for input into the tseb model was obtained for mead from the nearby neb field 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos station zreda n d zreda et al 2012 for brule barometric pressure data were obtained in the form of altimeter settings from the ogallala awos weather station barometric pressure was computed using the approximate elevation of the brule 6sw weather station hprcc 2018 following nws n d in addition to weather and remote sensing data volumetric soil water content was monitored for each study plot using neutron probes barker et al 2017 model 503 elite soil moisture gauges cpn international concord ca were used to monitor soil water content at mead both a model 503 elite and a model 503dr soil moisture gauges cpn international concord ca were used at brule t lo personal communication neutron probe measurements were taken in an approximately 5 1 cm diameter aluminum access tube installed near the center of each plot at mead access tubes were installed roughly midway between the center of the crop row and the center of the inter row at brule tubes were installed in the center of the crop row measurements were taken at 15 30 46 76 107 and 137 cm below ground surface at mead similar depths were used at brule omitting the 30 cm reading and including a 168 cm reading root zone depth weighted average readings were used to update the water balances for the vri np and uniform treatments neutron probe measurements were taken approximately weekly throughout most of the growing season at mead the north half of the mead field was generally monitored in two days with a couple exceptions the 2016 maize at mead was generally monitored in a single day with a couple exceptions as was the brule site because of logistical difficulties neutron probe readings in the late season of 2016 were limited in frequency at both locations 2 4 water balance models for irrigation scheduling irrigation for the thee irrigated treatments was scheduled using computed daily water balances following fao56 with some deviations the models were also used for all treatments in computing response variables in irrigation scheduling for the vri np and uniform treatments neutron probe data were incorporated into the models as the true daily water status details of regarding this process and variation in 2015 are presented in barker 2017 such variations also include precipitation and irrigation incorporation in 2015 barker 2017 model parameterizations and deviations from the fao56 methodologies are described below crop et for the vri np and uniform treatments was modeled using dual crop coefficients as in eq 1 in 2015 the kcb followed allen and wright 2002 in 2016 the kcb was modified for time scaling in the late season similar to the u s bureau of reclamation s agrimet methodology usbr 2016 in this methodology the kcb is scaled based on the fraction of days between planting and effective full cover as in allen and wright 2002 but the second portion of the season is scaled based on fraction of time between effective full cover and harvest termination rather than a set number of days the corn kcb of allen and wright 2002 was used for maize and an adaptation of their dry bean kcb was used for soybean the primary adjustment to the latter was an extended peak kcb period planting dates for the kcb were fixed however effective full cover and termination dates were tailored to the crop based on historic savi values crop stage and other information for the vri rs treatment etcrf was computed as explained in 2 5 in computing soil evaporation readily evaporable water fao56 was computed using a linear relationship with total evaporable water fao56 based on values from table 19 of fao56 for a 10 cm evaporation layer depth in irrigation scheduling a minimum of readily available water equal to 53 of total available water was erroneously imposed in the final analysis a linear relationship based on fao56 table 19 to compute readily available water was used and included appropriate adjustment for varying depth of the evaporation layer fao56 and upper and lower bounds based on table 19 the soil evaporation model was initiated at field capacity on one of the first two days of the year depending on the site year water stress was computed following fao56 however no adjustment for et potential was made in 2015 irrigation scheduling zero was used for kcb outside of the growing season in 2015 however kcb 0 12 was used in 2016 and in all cases for the final analyses in addition to et surface runoff net irrigation and deep percolation were also modeled runoff was computed using the u s department of agriculture natural resrouces conservation service runoff equation usda nrcs 2004 assuming a curve number of 80 precipitation for each day was treated as a 24 h storm with a single pulse of precipitation net irrigation was computed differently prescribed irrigation quantities were assumed to be the actual gross applied irrigation an application efficiency of 90 was used to compute net infiltrated irrigation the time of irrigation for each plot was determined from the center pivot travel time which was computed from irrigation beginning and ending times end times were estimated for brule speed of travel was assumed to be uniform for a given irrigation cycle other non evaporative subtractions included deep percolation for irrigation scheduling deep percolation dp for all treatments was computed when the modeled soil water exceeded fc in the 1 2 m and 0 9 m soil profile for maize and soybean respectively fao56 when neutron probe soil water content was included if it exceeded fc dp was not computed until the calculation for the following day in 2015 this allowed some et to occur from the excess water in 2016 however modeled depletion was limited to not be less than zero a field capacity limit on the same day as the measurements the water balance models required both field capacity fc and permanent wilting point wp for each plot plot fc was determined based on neutron probe readings lo et al 2017 who cite martin et al 1990 volumetric soil water content readings from june 30 and july 1 2015 were used for this purpose for the 2015 season at mead field capacity for the north half of the mead field was updated in 2016 based on neutron probe readings from may 6 2016 prior to planting of the soybean crop the fc values for the south plots at mead were taken from june 15 and 16 2016 readings most depths were read on june 15 but the 30 cm readings were taken on june 16 2016 for brule the june 30 2016 neutron probe readings were deemed to be an adequate estimate of fc for irrigation scheduling we recognized that this was likely a low estimate at brule because it was mid crop development for both fields the weighted average neutron probe readings down to about 1 2 m were used to compute fc excluding the 15 cm readings at mead the fc used in final analyses ranged from 0 37 to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 at mead and from 0 10 to 0 29 cm3 cm 3 at brule the ranges of fc used in irrigation scheduling were similar in magnitude with maxima and minima within 0 02 cm3 cm 3 of those used in final analyses for any of the site years in 2016 all water balances were initiated at fc at planting in 2015 the initial soil water measurement on june 30 and july 1 was used to initiate all water balances plot wp at mead was based on measurements from soil samples collected in the north half of the field in 2015 wilting point was measured using a model wp4 t dewpoint potentiameter decagon devices inc pullman wa in 2015 an aerial and depth averaged wp from samples processed up to that point was used for all plots additional wp samples were subsequently processed a reasonable relationship was computed between profile averaged wp and deep range eca see 2 2 barker 2017 this was done by pairing each profile wp estimate with a nearby eca pixel from the interpolated survey the accuracy of neutron probe tube locations was possibly quite low in the roughly east west direction the plot wp was computed using mean 10 m eca data resampled to 1 m within a 9 1 m buffer inside each plot the resulting relationship was applied to both sides of the field to determine plot specific wp in 2016 and in final analyses for the brule field wp was determined from measured plot fc and soil survey data this was done by linear interpolation between the maximum and minimum wp and fc from the soil survey map units soil survey staff 2016a this provided a reasonable estimate of awc and was justified because the soil textures were courser than silt loam and thus within the range where fc and wp may have a generally proportional relationship see figure 5 29 of brady and weil 1996 plot wp used in the final analysis ranged from 0 17 to 0 21 cm3 cm 3 at mead and from 0 05 to 0 15 cm3 cm 3 at brule ranges of wp used in irrigation scheduling were within 0 02 cm3 cm 3 of those used in final analyses for any of the site years during irrigation management the average fc and wp for all of the plots in a given crop year were used for the uniform treatment at mead plot specific fc and wp were used for all plots at brule because of the increased variability at that site plot specific fc and wp were used for all plots in the final analysis in irrigation scheduling root zone total available water fao56 was computed using a 1 2 m managed root zone for maize at both sites and a 0 9 m root zone for soybean kranz and specht 2012 the root zone was assumed to begin at 0 1 m and extend linearly to the full managed rooting depth when the kcb reached peak value in scheduling irrigation with the water balance models described above the average daily etr from the previous 20 years was used to forecast et a management allowable depletion merriam 1966 of 45 was used for maize through most of the season but was increased to 60 near the end of the season yonts et al 2008 in soybean mad was set to 55 until around beginning pod kranz and specht 2012 suggest avoiding excess irrigation early in the soybean season following this time mad was reduced to 50 which was maintained through the end of the season kranz and specht 2012 at the end of the season the modeled root zone was extended to 1 2 m yonts et al 2008 irrigation was timed to prevent the water balance from any vri plot or either of the two plots used for managing the uniform treatment the average of the two was used before august 2015 from exceeding mad prior to irrigation thus any of these plots could trigger an irrigation event irrigation was applied to achieve a target depth of 38 1 mm of soil water storage above mad at mead or 25 4 mm above mad at brule gross irrigation was limited to be no greater than 30 5 mm per irrigation at mead or 25 4 mm at brule a minimum limit of 5 1 mm per irrigation for any irrigation treatment plot was included at both sites to prevent the supply pumps from operating at undesirably low flow rates irrigation management effectively began on july 22 2015 and july 1 2016 at mead and on august 8 2016 for brule at brule prescriptions were computed at the beginning of the week and forecasted to be applied by later in the week as the treatments were not imposed until august 8 2016 187 2 mm of uniform irrigation had been prescribed before treatments began an additional 50 8 mm of irrigation was prescribed in a catch up mode the water balances for both treatments for this site showed large estimated soil water deficits applying sufficient irrigation to satisfy the experimental protocol seemed unreasonable it was determined to maintain the scheduling method in place for other research in the study field therefore mad at brule was adjusted upward to an achievable irrigation goal each week based on the magnitude of the measured or modeled soil water depletion in these adjustments the same values of mad were used for both treatments the mad values used during this time were quite large ranging between 75 and 85 of total available water for applied prescriptions the large soil water depletion at brule and increased mad values may have been caused in part by uncertainty in the fc and wp values possible uncertainty in the neutron probe calibrations and possible model drift additional details regarding the water balance models and the irrigation scheduling are presented in barker 2017 2 5 implementation of the hybrid model irrigation prescriptions for the vri rs treatment were developed using satellite imagery the remote sensing based water balance followed the approach of barker et al 2018 and barker 2017 the tseb et and savi calculations were computed using a modified version of the setmi interface barker et al 2018 geli and neale 2012 which was operated within arcgis 10 2 and 10 4 esri redlands ca plot level kcbrf and water balance computations were performed in microsoft excel the setmi computations were performed at either a 0 762 m the crop row spacing or a 1 m scale depending on the site year thus each landsat 30 m pixel became about 900 to about 1600 smaller pixels of equal value plot values of tseb et and savi were determined by taking the average of the small pixels within each plot excluding a 9 1 m irrigation buffer area within the plot using arcgis in 2015 only the kcbrf water balance was used for the vri rs treatment and the kcbrf to savi relationship for maize published by bausch 1993 was used this kcbrf relationship was assumed adequate for use with asce standardized asce ewri 2005 tall reference etr to produce daily kcb we used the maize kcb of allen and wright 2002 the kcbrf values were limited to not exceed 0 96 or be less than 0 15 prior to fitting the kcb curves based on the kcb of allen and wright 2002 in 2016 the recently derived kcbrf relationships of campos et al 2017 were used for both soybean and maize crops barker et al 2018 these relationships were developed using eddy covariance flux data from fields near the mead site campos et al 2017 during irrigation scheduling the average daily growing degree days from the previous 20 years was used in forecasting in applying this method savi was limited to not exceed values that produced kcbrf greater than 0 96 for maize at brule and 0 95 for both crops at mead based on the peak kcb for maize and bean in allen and wright 2002 and values reported by campos et al 2017 a lower limit on savi equivalent to about kcb 0 12 was applied in 2016 this lower limit was likely never reached forecasted peak and projected end of season savi values were added as necessary for the soybean in 2016 to improve the kcb until adequate imagery was available barker et al 2018 the projected peak values were for kcb 0 95 a similar practice was used at brule in 2016 employing only the projected end of season savi in irrigation scheduling for 2016 maize at mead there were too few images available to produce the declining portion of the kcb curve therefore the allen and wright 2002 based kcb was used after effective full cover assumed to occur when the development leg of the kcb curve reached kcb 0 96 in irrigation scheduling kcb was limited to be 0 15 and 0 96 for maize crops and 0 95 for soybean in 2016 the full hybrid model was implemented including both kcbrf et and tseb et barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 the penman monteith formulation for the tseb canopy latent heat flux was implemented following colaizzi et al 2014 we maintained crop height at the peak value for a given pixel as the modeled vegetation index based crop height anderson et al 2004 began to decrease barker et al 2018 modeled leaf area index anderson et al 2004 was not maintained at peak value after august as in barker et al 2018 in coupling the water balance and tseb models a kalman gain eq 2 of 0 78 was used following geli 2012 in implementation of the tseb we used the fraction of cover fc equation similar to li et al 2005 following the formulation in setmi barker et al 2018 geli et al 2014 2 6 response variables and treatment comparisons the irrigation treatment performance was compared using the following response variables measurement period actual et eta the season ending total precipitation less estimated runoff plus net irrigation plus the change in neutron probe soil water storage p ro inet δsw estimated deep percolation dp and yield season total prescribed irrigation was also compared between treatments but since it was a treatment it was analyzed separately from the response variables the hydrologic response variables were computed together using neutron probe measurements and spreadsheet water balances similar to those used in irrigation scheduling the measurement periods for mead were june 24 and 25 through october 6 and 7 2015 june 10 to september 26 2016 for maize and june 9 and 10 through october 31 and november 1 2016 for soybean the computation period for brule maize was june 23 through november 1 2016 the water balances were computed similar to the irrigation scheduling water balances for uniform and vri np treatments however we used the kcbrf methodology discussed by barker et al 2018 to run a daily soil water balance similar to irrigation scheduling for soybean in 2016 and computed fraction of cover from savi similar to barker et al 2018 we did apply a forecasted peak savi kcbrf 0 95 for mead maize in 2016 we effectively did not apply limits to savi prior to computing kcb in the final analyses we similarly did not effectively apply an upper limit on kcb but did limit kcb 0 12 modeled soil evaporation was also dampened by 25 based on possible impacts of crop residue odhiambo and irmak 2012 the surface residue was estimated at two locations in soybean residue on may 18 2016 using a transect method shetlon and jasa 2009 with transects perpendicular to the crop rows the two locations had 46 and 57 residue respectively four locations were measured in the maize residue on about may 13 2016 residue at that time ranged from 47 to 70 with an average of 62 this could represent a reduction in soil evaporation of about 25 30 based on residue alone following fao56 and odhiambo and irmak 2012 in these calculations the root zone was maintained at 1 52 m for mead and about 1 22 m at brule brule had a shallower depth because of missing readings in the deeper neutron probe measurements measurement period eta was estimated from neutron probe measurements and a seasonal water balance eta p ro inet dp δsw the seasonal ro only included rainfall events since runoff from irrigation was already accounted for with the irrigation application efficiency runoff and irrigation were computed as described for irrigation scheduling we used modeled daily soil water balances to compute dp between neutron probe measurement dates which were cumulated to get seasonal dp this method of computing dp was somewhat similar to irmak et al 2014 and djaman and irmak 2012 the combined variable p ro inet δsw was computed for the same measurement periods as dp the combined variable is similar to eta but without accounting for dp eliminating the uncertainty from the method used to compute dp the combined variable represented a quantity much closer to measurement than did dp and eta since we had greater confidence in the measurements and the runoff approximation see 2 4 in computing the response variables the modeled soil water content was allowed to exceed fc for up to three days following the most recent precipitation or irrigation event at mead and one day at brule d l martin personal communication that is the lower constraint of zero root zone depletion was not applied until more than three days had occurred since the last substantial rainfall resulting in 0 effective precipition or irrigation event at mead and one day at brule this change resulted in lower estimates of dp than the dp estimated for irrigation scheduling this three day or one day delay was consistent with the drainage process not being instantaneous the longer delay at mead was because of the finer textured soils at that site as compared with the brule site in the water balance modeling for response variables neutron probe measurements were incorporated as the start of day soil water depletion for the day following the measurement no dp was computed on neutron probe measurement dates all other changes in precipitation estimated runoff irrigation and soil water content were attributed to eta for brule revised neutron probe calibrations better suited to the research field were used in eta computations in the final computations at brule fc for a given plot and depth was computed as the maximum volumetric water content in all dates discluding neutron probe readings shortly after an irrigation event the change in fc at brule also caused a change in wp and awc however the original blocking was still honored in the analysis field capacity values were also updated for the north half of the field at mead based on inclusion of a neutron probe standard count that was excluded in fc for 2016 irrigation in addition to the hydrologic variables yield was also estimated yield estimates were obtained from the production combines onboard yield and moisture monitors yield maps were processed using the usda s yield editor 2 07 software sudduth et al 2012 processed yield maps were verified against field total weighing grain cart n thorson personal communication yield at mead yield was similarly processed for brule using the yield mass and grain moisture contents provided as output from john deere apex software john deere moline il yields were reported at harvest moisture content final plot yields were obtained by computing the average of all yield points in a plot excluding a 12 2 m buffer inside the plot border the intent was that all yield points would be within the estimated irrigation transition area of each plot see higgins et al 2016 since multiple response variables were included they were analyzed with multivariate analysis of variance manova using proc glm in sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc univariate analyses of variance anovas were performed as justified using proc glimmix in sas type iii sums of squares and cross products were used in all anovas blocking was treated as a fixed effect even though some data were missing block by treatment interactions were not included in final analysis each crop year combination was analyzed separately rather than as a multi occasion experiment we acknowledge that manovas and anovas were used though the response and irrigation data were not tested to see whether they were normally distrubited seasonal total prescribed irrigation was analyzed separately from the response variables using anova comparing only the two vri treatments where possible the estimated 95 confidence intervals for least squares means of these two treatments were used to test the null hypothesis that the total prescribed irrigation from each of the vri treatments was equal to zero rainfed or the mean of the uniform treatment in cases such as brule maize 2016 where only one vri treatment was present a simple mean was computed with standard error and confidence intervals using sas proc means 3 results and discussion 3 1 study conditions the growing seasons at mead in 2015 and 2016 were wetter than the 1981 2010 normal for the nearby national weather service global historic climate network mead 6 s station ncei n d the may to october precipitation from the rain gauges at the study field and the mead agronomy farm weather station as needed was 673 mm in 2015 and 678 mm in 2016 the normal precipitation for may to october for the mead 6 s station was 540 mm ncei n d also 2015 and 2016 were low et years with computed may to october etr of 827 and 932 mm respectively these are compared to 989 mm on average for the years 1995 2014 computed using the mead agronomy farm weather station data for brule the climatic conditions were not similar to mead the normal may to october precipitation for the global historic climate network big springs weather station near brule was about 308 mm ncei n d in 2016 the total may to october precipitation for the brule platte valley weather station was about 274 mm based on the normals ncei n d it is expected that brule would have substantially more irrigation than mead the experiment at brule was considered to be a proof of concept for operating the model in drier conditions than observed at mead 3 2 satellite imagery table 2 provides a list of cloud free landsat 7 and landsat 8 images included in irrigation scheduling and in the final analysis the low frequency of cloud free satellite images was a difficulty in this study particularly at mead in 2016 the brule field was in an overlap zone for landsat images which doubled the frequency of satellite overpasses landsat 7 images typically did not pick up all of the plots in a single image therefore only landsat 8 was used at brule there were twelve landsat 8 images that were cloud free at brule in 2016 all of these up to september 11 were used in irrigation scheduling three more end of season images were included in the final analysis there were seven cloud free landsat images over the north half of the mead field in 2015 there were seven cloud free images in 2016 and only the first four up to june 27 and the last one on october 9 included the south half of the field for the soybean in 2016 there were cloud free landsat 7 images on august 22 and september 23 2016 3 3 total prescribed irrigation total gross prescribed irrigation was computed as the sum of prescribed irrigation for all irrigation events table 3 all study plots were included in the prescribed irrigation comparisons for the 2016 maize the vri np and uniform treatments had identical irrigation prescriptions both ended up being uniform with a total seasonal prescription of 20 3 mm this was the minimum applied depth 5 08 mm times the four irrigation events essentially neither of these treatments called for irrigation thus the mean standard error and confidence interval for vri rs for 2016 maize at mead were computed using proc means as was done for brule interestingly for mead maize in 2016 all variability in irrigation for the vri rs treatment was applied in the first irrigation thereafter all subsequent irrigations were uniform applications of the maximum depth allowed for the irrigation protocol 30 45 mm the treatment differences between the two vri treatments were found to be significantly different than zero at the 5 level for 2015 maize standard error of the difference 2 73 mm f 295 p value 0 0001 and 2016 soybean standard error of the difference 3 35 mm f 341 p value 0 0001 the least squares means for the two vri treatments are presented in table 3 with 95 confidence intervals for the treatments for which confidence intervals were computed the intervals did not include the mean irrigation depths for any other treatment estimated mean irrigation did not exceed 118 mm for any of the mead treatments large amounts of precipitation and low et were suspected to be the primary drivers of the relatively small amounts of irrigation in all cases the vri rs resulted in the greatest irrigation table 3 because of overestimation of soil water depletion overestimation of et dp d l martin personal communication and or runoff may have been the cause s of the soil water balance drift since the vri rs water balance was not updated with neutron probe data overestimation of et was suspected in 2015 and in 2016 the overestimation of depletion persisted despite modifications to the model while overestimation of runoff was possible computed runoff used in all final analyses was about 36 mm for maize in 2015 at mead 43 and 44 mm for maize and soybean at mead in 2016 respectively and 23 mm for maize at brule in 2016 these magnitudes do not account for the full discrepancy in irrigation between treatments table 3 except in the case of brule while the hybrid methodology neale et al 2012 was employed in the vri rs in 2016 it apparently did not improve the performance of that treatment at mead the hybrid functionality did not result in soil water depletion adjustments during the experiment since neither the kcbrf nor the tseb models computed water stress conditions in the methodology employed in the field study water balance modeled etcrf was not adjusted if no adjustment was needed to ks thus both years at mead were essentially reliant on the accuracy of the kcbrf and water balance methods this was not the case at brule where the tseb et did cause an adjustment in the water balance at times however the model still seemed to drift from neutron probe measurements it seems that etcrf dp or runoff may have been overestimated at brule as well uncertainty in fc and wp at brule likely also contributed to difficulties in both treatments the vri np treatment which approaches an ideal condition for vri management had the smallest mean prescribed irrigation of the irrigated treatments at mead except for maize in 2016 table 3 the smaller mean prescribed irrigation for the vri np treatment was evidence that the vri np did effectively manage for some of the spatial variability in the field this was evidenced by examining the standard deviation of the total prescribed irrigation for a given site year versus the standard deviation of any single event this was not a rigorous test but it may be evidence that the prescribed irrigation in vri treatments was not oscillating for example if a large irrigation was prescribed to a given plot on one event irrigation was not necessarily light on the same plot later on the variation in total prescribed irrigation between plots would possibly be dampened in this case similar observations were made for the vri rs treatment 3 4 response variable manovas and univariate anovas treatment effects on response variables were first tested using wilks lambda for the type iii sums of squares and cross products we failed to reject the null hypothesis that treatment effects were zero at the 5 significance level for 2016 maize at brule approximate f 1 8 p value 0 191 this null hypothesis was rejected for all mead site years blocking effects were found to be significant at the 5 level for mead soybean in 2016 approximate f 3 7 p value 0 001 similarly blocking effects were significant for mead maize in 2016 approximate f 2 3 p value 0 036 these are interesting results because they suggests differences induced by soil properties as represented by eca at mead in 2016 blocking was not found to be significant for 2015 the awc blocking was expected to have a significant effect at brule but such was not found at the 5 level approximate f 1 8 p value 0 065 the span blocking at brule was also not found to be significant approximate f 1 0 p value 0 471 though it was anticipated to be so this was because of visible edge effects in the satellite imagery at brule some of the edge effects were probably due to the non irrigated surroundings around the field the resolution of the landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor 100 m rocchio 2018 is also acknowledged as a likely cause of edge effects as discussed for some satellites by gowda et al 2007 the univariate anovas were examined for all of the mead site years but not for brule because of the manova results table 4 of all of the univariate anova analyses the null hypotheses that at least one of the treatments had an estimated mean that differed from the others were rejected at the 5 level for all but three cases these cases were dp in 2016 soybean and maize at mead and yield for 2016 maize at mead f 1 38 p value 0 26 f 1 22 p value 0 32 and f 1 17 p value 0 34 respectively 3 5 yield and water use efficiency as mentioned in 2 6 the yield response estiamates were obtained from harvest combine yield maps all yields reported here are at harvest moisture contents in 2015 the average maize yield was 13 1 mg ha 1 based on weighing grain cart data which had moisture contents of 13 7 14 6 with an effective mean of 14 1 the field average yield from the cleaned yield map was computed by yield editor to be 13 2 mg ha 1 with an effective mean moisture content of 13 9 from the yield monitor data in 2016 the grain cart field average maize yield was 13 4 mg ha 1 with moisture contents of 15 7 16 5 with an effective mean of 16 1 the yield map average was 13 7 mg ha 1 with an effective moisture content of 16 0 from the yield monitor data this was a difference of about 2 for soybean in 2016 the field total and yield map average yields were both 4 3 mg ha 1 the moisture contents from the grain cart data were 12 4 14 4 with and effective mean of 13 0 the effective mean moisture content from the yield monitor data was 12 6 no further adjustment or scaling was applied to the yield estimates because they were near the grain cart averages for brule the cleaned maize yield was about 9 7 mg ha 1 with an effective moisture content from the yield monitor data of 14 3 for the processed parts of the field we only processed the yield for the study plots at brule so a comparison with total field yield was not performed estimated least squares means for yield and other response variables are presented in table 4 for yield in the 2015 maize the two vri treatments and the rainfed treatment all had similar estimated means 13 3 mg ha 1 they were only found to be significantly different than the uniform treatment 12 9 mg ha 1 these differences were unlikely to be strictly a response to the irrigation treatment and were attributed to random error for 2016 maize at mead the range in yield was 13 4 14 1 mg ha 1 for rainfed and vri rs respectively treatment differences were not significantly different for 2016 soybean the estimated mean yield in the rainfed treatment was the greatest 4 5 mg ha 1 this was only found to be significantly different than the vri rs treatment 4 2 mg ha 1 the larger estimated mean yield for the rainfed treatment over the vri rs treatment for the soybean may be a result of soybean not having improved yield from increased irrigation this is a known effect as a result of plant lodging from excessive vegetative growth kranz and specht 2012 soybean lodging was observed throughout the field in 2016 irrigation water use efficiency was estimated using the yield estimates from table 4 and the corresponding mean prescribed irrigation excluding the same plots as for the response variables as the method for computing means was different for some of the irrigation treatments simple means of both yield and irrigation using proc means were also used in computing water use efficiency shown in parenthesis for 2015 maize irrigation water use efficiency ranged from 8 3 8 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the uniform treatment to 1 0 0 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri np the vri rs was less than 0 1 0 02 kg ha 1 mm 1 for 2016 maize at mead irrigation water use efficiency ranged from 5 5 5 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri rs treatment to 22 7 17 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri np with 18 6 17 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the uniform note that for this site year vri rs was computed as a simple mean over plots included in the response variable anovas for that site year all irrigation water use efficiencies were negative for the soybean possibly due to yield losses associated with lodging rudnick et al 2016 efficiencies were 5 1 5 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vri np 3 6 3 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 for uniform and 3 0 3 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vri rs efficiencies were not computed for brule due to the lack of a rainfed treatement longer term experiments including dry years would provide a better perspective on how much vri can increase irrigation water use efficiency 3 6 hydrologic response variables while the reported eta values table 4 appear to be low for all site years it should be emphasized that they are for the measurement periods not the full growing seasons neutron probe measurements began 21 38 days after planting therefore an appreciable amount of evapotranspiration is likely not accounted for in the estimated means presented in table 4 in general treatments were expected to be similar although some differences in eta were expected due to increased wet soil evaporation from irrigation for maize in 2015 the vri rs had the greatest estimated mean eta 413 mm this was significantly different than all other treatments with the lowest being rainfed 343 mm this difference 70 mm seems excessive considering the various irrigation treatments were applied after tasseling a similar observation was made for mead maize in 2016 with the vri rs treatment having the greatest eta 492 mm this response was found to be significantly different than all other treatments again the lowest eta was rainfed 393 mm this difference 99 mm seems excessive given that the first irrigation was started on july 15 2016 for the soybean at mead in 2016 eta was greatest for the vri rs 512 mm which was significantly different than the other treatments with the smallest again being rainfed 452 mm this was a 60 mm difference in estimated means differences in eta for maize at brule were not significant and had a smaller range of about 4 mm the large differences in estimated mean eta for individual crop years at mead may be related to uncertainty in the dp computation method possible improvements to estimating dp could include using multiple layer soil water balances djaman and irmak 2012 a more physically based approach such as the wilcox method klocke et al 2010 miller and aarstad 1972 or possibly even inverse modeling foolad et al 2017 such methods may better account for spatial variability in drainage rates the uncertainties in eta computations support the inclusion of dp and of p ro inet δsw as a combined variable for mead maize significant differences in p ro inet δsw were similar to eta with ranges of 70 mm for 2015 and 96 mm for 2016 both were within 20 mm of prescribed irrigation suggesting that this variable accounted for the change in the water balance due to irrigation if all processes were exactly accounted for the differences in p ro inet δsw should be equal to differences in net irrigation for soybean estimated mean p ro inet δsw was greatest for the vri rs treatment 521 mm which is logical this was significantly different than all other treatments with the smallest being 455 mm for rainfed again this difference was within 20 mm of the difference in prescribed irrigation estimated dp in the final analysis was lower than estimated dp during irrigation scheduling see 2 6 no significant differences between treatments were found in dp deep percolation was estimated to be 0 for all plots in 2015 for 2016 maize and soybean at mead dp was estimated to be 13 mm or less and 9 mm or less respectively allowing drainage to occur over the course of multiple days resulted in little dp being estimated deep percolation was estimated to be 13 mm or less for brule 3 7 spatial variability we investigated the spatial variability of the three primary response variables yield eta dp and p ro inet δsw precipitation and awc to identify which variables were most important to quantify spatially for irrigation management only the uniform treatment was included for this purpose this treatment had no intentionally imposed variability and was included for all site years to compare spatial variability the coefficient of variation cv was computed for each variable using microsoft excel table 5 without accounting for blocking or other treatments missing data from some blocks were acknowledged but were not accounted for in this analysis spatial variability in precipitation was computed for the cumulative precipitation from each of four rain gauges at mead the period of june 26 to july 15 and september 9 to october 14 2015 and the period of june 9 through september 13 2016 were used for precipitation another potential driving force for spatial differences in irrigation requirements is run on within the field however this effect was not quantified in the analysis for all cases except 2015 dp had the largest cv which is primarily due to the low magnitude of the estimates deep percolation was computed to be zero for all plots in 2015 the following discussion subsequently ignores dp a better measure of the variability may likely be gleaned by examining cvs for eta and p ro inet δsw for 2015 at mead the greatest variability as defined by the cv was in awc followed by precipitation for 2016 at mead the greatest variability was in awc for the soybean and precipitation for the maize overall the awc precipitation and eta had greater variability than did yield at mead though the cv for awc was less than for yield for 2016 maize suggesting a dampened response of yield to the soil and eta variability at brule awc had the greatest variability which was much larger than at mead part of this difference was related to the smaller mean awc at brule but greater variation was expected at that site due to great soil heterogeneity from table 5 it seems that quantifying awc may be most important for vri management followed by precipitation and et assuming that the cv presented here is representative of the cv of actual et 4 conclusions the vri rs treatment had the greatest mean prescribed irrigation for each crop year combination the differences were attributed to water balance drift even after model improvements were made in 2016 the drift was still apparent overestimation of wet soil evaporation drainage rates and or runoff are suspected as contributing causes of the drift in the final analyses soil evaporation was dampened by 25 based on residue estimates at mead and dp was limited to not occur until it had been more than three days since a rainfall or irrigation event at mead and more than one day later for brule in final analyses d l martin personal communication further improvements to these parts of the model is recommended the remote sensing based model is expected to perform better if coupled with soil water content measurement treatment effects were primarily in eta or p ro inet δsw with increased irrigation generally resulting in greater estimates of both yield differences were small yield differences in maize may have resulted from random error yield reductions in soybean for the vri rs treatment may have been a result of lodging caused by excess irrigation kranz and specht 2012 of the variables considered in this research awc generally had the greatest spatial variability more so than eta or p ro inet δsw however these were still variable and precipitation had the greatest variability for 2016 maize at mead excluding dp thus quantifying spatial variability beyond awc may improve irrigation management the small number of cloud free satellite images was a challenge for properly executing the remote sensing based model however the provisions for real time operation performed well given the number of input images it is expected that the hybrid

11467,improvements in soil water balance modeling can be beneficial for optimizing irrigation management to account for spatial variability in soil properties and evapotranspiration et a remote sensing based et and water balance model was tested for irrigation management in an experiment at two university of nebraska lincoln research sites located near mead and brule nebraska both fields included a center pivot equipped with variable rate irrigation vri the study included maize in 2015 and 2016 and soybean in 2016 at mead and maize in 2016 at brule for a total of 210 plot years four irrigation treatments were applied at mead including vri based on a remote sensing model vri rs vri based on neutron probe soil water content measurement vri np uniform irrigation based on neutron probe measurement and rainfed only the vri rs and uniform treatments were applied at brule landsat 7 and 8 imagery were used for model input in 2015 the remote sensing model included reflectance based crop coefficients for et estimation in the water balance in 2016 a hybrid component of the model was activated which included energy balance modeled et as an input both 2015 and 2016 had above average precipitation at mead subsequently irrigation amounts were relatively low seasonal irrigation was greatest for the vri rs treatment in all cases because of drift in the water balance model this was likely caused by excessive soil evaporation estimates irrigation application for the vri np at mead was about 0 mm 6 mm and 12 mm less in separate analyses than for the uniform treatment irrigation for the vri rs was about 40 mm 50 mm and 98 mm greater in separate analyses than the uniform at mead and about 18 mm greater at brule for maize at mead treatment effects were primarily limited to hydrologic responses e g et with differences in yield generally attributed to random error rainfed soybean yields were greater than vri rs yields which may have been related to yield loss from lodging perhaps due to over irrigation regarding the magnitude of spatial variability in the fields soil available water capacity generally ranked above et precipitation and yield future research should include increased cloud free imagery frequency incorporation of soil water content measurements into the model and improved wet soil evaporation and drainage estimates keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing soil water balance variable rate irrigation 1 introduction modeled water balances are a common method for irrigation management e g martin et al 1990 irrigation management may be improved by using spatial evapotranspiration et and soil water models a number of spatial et models have been developed and tested for this purpose gowda et al 2007 while useful in general spatial et may be of particular interest in variable rate irrigation vri management in previous research lo et al 2016 quantified reductions in pumping from using vri to manage for spatial variability in available water capacity awc but did not account for spatial variability in et accurate subfield scale et and water balance models could provide a valuable spatial component to vri and conventional irrigation application stone et al 2016 used a multispectral remote sensing based et model for vri management with promising results however there is a need for vri research performed at the scale of commercial production fields e g 60 ha one benefit of applying remote sensing based models in irrigation management is that such models include an indirect spatial measurement of the integrated crop response when coupled with spatial soil property data remote sensing et models may be used to compute spatial soil water balances e g neale et al 2012 these models have potential to be used for spatially informed irrigation management furthermore monitoring soil water alone is likely to be an impractical solution for vri management barker et al 2017 determined that three monitoring locations would be needed per management zone if using a neutron probe for their study conditions the hybrid model of neale et al 2012 is one such et and water balance model that is suited for irrigation management barker et al 2018 refined this hybrid model and evaluated its potential for use in vri management the hybrid model is a combination of reflectance based crop coefficients kcbrf bausch and neale 1987 neale et al 1989 and the two source energy balance model tseb of norman et al 1995 the kcbrf method follows the reference et etr approach of estimating crop et etc employing a dimensionless crop coefficient kc as 1 e t c e t r k c e t r k s k c b k e where ks kcb and ke are dimensionless water stress basal and evaporation coefficients respectively allen et al 1998 jensen and allen 2016 wright 1982 a water balance model may be used to compute ks and ke as presented by allen et al 1998 the kcb relates to the vegetation s potential to transpire and may change with crop time and location allen et al 1998 wright 1982 we refer to etc computed using kcbrf as etcrf in the remainder of this article in the kcbrf method the kcb is found using relationships between kcb and reflectance based vegetation indices bausch 1993 bausch and neale 1987 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi e g rouse et al 1974 may be used for this purpose as in neale et al 1989 bausch 1993 used the soil adjusted vegetation index savi huete 1988 for this purpose a water balance can then be computed to model the soil water status of the managed crop root zone allen et al 1998 martin et al 1990 one approach may be to compute the water balance following the united nations food and agricultural organization s irrigation and drainage paper no 56 allen et al 1998 hereafter referred to as fao56 such an approach was applied by stone et al 2016 in the hybrid methodology neale et al 2012 used the kcbrf method with a water balance to model soil water depletion the benefit of the hybrid method was that a kcbrf is relatively easy to estimate for periods between multispectral image collection dates barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 thus et may be modeled even on days without remote sensing imagery on thermal infrared image acquisition dates the model of neale et al 2012 also incorporates a second estimate of et using the tseb which is separate from the modeled water balance barker et al 2018 the tseb is a surface energy balance method which partitions remotely sensed radiometric temperature of the land surface into crop and soil temperatures norman et al 1995 the energy balance is solved for both crop and soil components a challenge with the tseb is that it requires thermal infrared imagery limiting its use to dates of image acquisition e g satellite overpass further detail on the tseb model is provided in barker et al 2018 the tseb et is incorporated into the water balance model using statistical interpolation neale et al 2012 the statistical weighting function used by neale et al 2012 to incorporate tseb et into the model is 2 e t w b a e t w b b w e t t s e b e t w b b where the subscripts wb and tseb represent et from the kcbrf based water balance and et from the tseb model respectively and the superscripts b and a are before and after incorporation of the tseb et and w is the kalman gain barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 upon incorporation of the tseb et the water balance is updated by back calculating the root zone depletion that would produce the ks necessary to compute eta wb eq 2 barker et al 2018 geli 2012 thus the hybrid method should be less prone to large water balance drift compared to modeling et with only a kcbrf based water balance other studies have tested the hybrid method e g barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 to adopt the method for irrigation management including vri there remains a need to test the methodology in irrigation scheduling therefore the main objective of the present study was to determine whether managing vri at a production scale using the hybrid model neale et al 2012 would result in reduced irrigation application without yield reduction or at least result in improved irrigation water use efficiency see howell 2001 this was done by using a remote sensing based water balance model to manage irrigation in a field experiment along with other irrigation treatments the spatial variability of awc et and yield were also assessed to identify the importance of each in spatial irrigation management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites a remote sensing based water balance model was tested for vri management in 2015 and 2016 at two field sites the primary study site was a center pivot irrigated field 41 165 n 96 430 w source google earth at the university of nebraska lincoln s eastern nebraska research and extension center located near mead nebraska mead fig 1 the field is approximately 53 ha in cropped area including rainfed corners and an access road as computed using arcgis 10 4 esri redlands ca based on an aerial image from usda fsa 2012 the soils in the field are primarily silty clay loam and silt loam soil survey staff 2016b the field was managed in roughly north and south halves the two halves of the field were cropped in opposite maize soybean annual rotations the field was managed as no till using controlled wheel traffic the only tillage operations were planting and anhydrous ammonia application for maize crops otherwise only minor earthwork had been performed in the field in recent years the field was grazed with cattle during the winter and at least during the winter between 2015 and 2016 cattle were apparently fed additional forage in parts of the field barker et al 2017 includes further description of the site the 2015 experiment was implemented in the north half of the field which was maize in 2016 the experiment was expanded into the south half to repeat maize while including soybean in the north half a second field 41 029 n 101 971 w source google earth was added in 2016 at the university of nebraska lincoln s west central water resources field laboratory located near brule nebraska brule fig 1 the brule site approximately 50 ha was in a drier climate and had greater soil variability than the mead site it had alluvial eolian soils which were primarily loam loamy sand and gravely loam soil survey staff 2016a the brule site was managed as a no till continuous maize system and was the site of historic residue management research van donk et al 2012 the study plots were in locations within the field that had no residue removal in recent years table 1 provides a list of planting and harvest dates for the study both fields were irrigated with model 8500 zimmatic lindsay corporation omaha ne center pivots the pivots were equipped with variable rate irrigation options lindsay corporation omaha ne including individual nozzle control sprinklers were mounted on top of the pivot lateral at mead and on drops roughly 2 1 m above ground surface at brule the pivot and vri systems were new in 2014 at mead and in 2015 at brule 2 2 experimental design the treatment design was unstructured with four treatments vri with remote sensing based water balance vri rs vri using neutron probe soil water content vri np uniform irrigation using neutron probe uniform and rainfed in both vri treatments each plot was irrigated according to a plot specific water balance in the vri rs model this plot specific water balance was modeled using remote sensing without updating the water balance with soil water content measurements the vri np treatment was irrigated similarly but used neutron probe measurements to update the water balance and did not include remote sensing input the uniform treatment was managed similarly to the vri np treatment but the water balance for only two of the plots was used to manage the entire treatment the rainfed treatment was prescribed no irrigation all four treatments were applied in the mead field only the vri rs and uniform treatments were included at brule the experimental design at mead was a generalized randomized complete block design k m eskridge personal communication plots were blocked into one of three large blocks based on plot median apparent electrical conductivity eca the median eca for each 30 6 by 60 1 m plot was filtered t lo k a miller and j d luck personal communications and interpolated eca data from a survey taken on november 12 2014 using a veris msp veris technologies salina ks barker et al 2017 deep range eca was used as a surrogate for soil texture specifically clay content see sudduth et al 2005 three eca blocks were generated separately for both the north and south halves of the field using quantiles of median plot eca in the respective half median plot eca was computed without proper regard to geospatial datum differences between interpolated eca data and plots however such should have only minor effect on the blocking assignments fig 1 includes a map of the plot layouts and interpolated eca data the eca blocks in the north are labeled 1 3 in fig 1 while the blocks in the south are labeled 4 6 in the north half of the field each treatment was randomly assigned to six plots within each of the eca blocks for a total of 72 plots the same treatment assignments were maintained in 2015 and 2016 in the south half of the field only three replicates per block treatment combination were included for a total of 36 plots the brule field was divided into blocks based on plot awc described in 2 4 quantiles of plot awc were used to generate five soil blocks radial distance from the pivot center was also included as a blocking criterion at brule to minimize any unexpected effects of the center pivot irrigation system such as a nozzle getting plugged thus the experimental design was a row column design the two treatments were randomly assigned to the six radial blocks pivot spans and the five awc blocks for a total of 30 plots at mead experimental plots were 36 6 m by 60 1 m in length along crop rows plots were sized to account for a 9 1 m irrigation transition area and to accommodate the yield monitor on the harvest combine joe d luck personal communication barker et al 2016 some areas of the mead field were avoided in the plot layout because of proximity to the pivot center a buried utility signs of soil disturbance historic earthwork an abandoned railroad wet low yielding area large within plot variations in eca and accessability barker et al 2017 similar plot dimensions were employed in the brule field i e minimum plot dimension of 36 6 m however other research in that location favored a radial design of the plot layout fig 1 areas near the center of the field were also excluded at brule data from some plots were excluded from the final analysis due to herbicide drift equipment malfunction etc the total number of plots included in the analysis at mead was 66 for 2015 maize 31 for 2016 maize and 56 for 2016 soybean the total number of plots included for maize at brule in 2016 was 26 other minor errors were determined to be negligible see barker 2017 for example during irrigation scheduling a miss entry of data for the southeast rain gauge at arddc for the period june 16 23 2016 resulted in cumulative precipitation that was 0 8 mm less than it should have been there were also some rain gauge data entry errors in 2015 both situations were corrected in post season processing 2 3 experimental satellite weather and soil moisture data primary experimental data included remote sensing imagery weather data and soil water content measurements the remote sensing data used in modeling was landsat 7 and landsat 8 imagery landsat pre collection data usgs eros user services personal communication 9 21 2017 including shortwave surface reflectance data were obtained from the u s geological survey usgs data available from the u s geological survey https lta cr usgs gov citation atmospheric corrections for the thermal infrared imagery were applied using surface emissivity values computed following brunsell and gillies 2002 see also barker et al 2018 a soil emissivity of 0 925 was erroneously used though a value of 0 955 may have been more appropriate brunsell and gillies 2002 vegetation emissivity was assumed to be 0 98 brunsell and gillies 2002 atmospheric correction parameters were obtained from the online application of barsi n d similar to what was detailed by barker et al 2018 using input local ground weather data there was one image for brule july 18 2016 for which correction parameters for the nearest integer latitude and longitude were used because the spatial interpolation of the web application did not work for that date thermal infrared image corrections and shortwave image stacking were performed using erdas imagine 2014 hexagon geospatial madison al necessary weather data were obtained from the high plains regional climate center for the nebraska mesonet memphis 5n and brule 6sw weather stations for the mead and brule sites respectively the memphis 6n weather station is located about 1 km ese of the mead field google earth and the brule 6sw station is located about 400 m ese of the brule field google earth instantaneous weather data for the tseb and etr were computed from hourly data etr was computed using the asce standardized tall reference et equation asce ewri 2005 vegetation height near the weather stations was assumed to be about 0 5 m for mead and 0 2 m for brule etr computations during the experiments measured wind speed was adjusted for use in etr computations in a manner similar to asce ewri 2005 eq b 14c wind speed was adjusted for use in the tseb over the crop canopies assuming an equal friction velocity over the crop and weather station surfaces both of these wind adjustment methods may be less accurate likely resulting in lower estimates of wind speed under some of the study conditions than the method developed by allen and wright 1997 in computing the response variables see 2 6 the adjustment of allen and wright 1997 was used for mead assuming a 0 5 m crop height and upwind distances of 400 m for both the weather station and reference surfaces for computing response variables at brule the wind was adjusted as in the main report of asce ewri 2005 also an incorrect weather station longitude was used in computing etr for mead during the experiment this was corrected when computing the response variables the combined effect of wind adjustment and longitude on annual etr in mead was approximately a 4 increase both years the effect of the wind adjustment at brule was an increase of less than 0 2 in annual etr in addition to the weather station data four isco model 674 rain gauges teledyne isco lincoln ne were installed near the perimeter of the field at the mead field site fig 1 the arithmetic mean precipitation from the four rain gauges was input into the water balance models following approximately weekly downloads when data from one or more rain gauges was missing or suspect it was excluded from the arithmetic mean the isco rain gauges were calibrated prior to both the 2015 and 2016 seasons gauges with unaccepted calibration discrepancies per the manufacturer s stated accuracy were adjusted arithmetically however this adjustment was only applied in post processing for 2015 and the adjustment for 2016 was slightly modified for the mead field the weather station precipitation was only used as needed in real time irrigation management and for season totals included in 3 2 the brule 6sw weather station was the only source of precipitation for the brule field weather station precipitation was taken as is without time adjustment finally barometric pressure data for input into the tseb model was obtained for mead from the nearby neb field 3 cosmic ray soil moisture observing system cosmos station zreda n d zreda et al 2012 for brule barometric pressure data were obtained in the form of altimeter settings from the ogallala awos weather station barometric pressure was computed using the approximate elevation of the brule 6sw weather station hprcc 2018 following nws n d in addition to weather and remote sensing data volumetric soil water content was monitored for each study plot using neutron probes barker et al 2017 model 503 elite soil moisture gauges cpn international concord ca were used to monitor soil water content at mead both a model 503 elite and a model 503dr soil moisture gauges cpn international concord ca were used at brule t lo personal communication neutron probe measurements were taken in an approximately 5 1 cm diameter aluminum access tube installed near the center of each plot at mead access tubes were installed roughly midway between the center of the crop row and the center of the inter row at brule tubes were installed in the center of the crop row measurements were taken at 15 30 46 76 107 and 137 cm below ground surface at mead similar depths were used at brule omitting the 30 cm reading and including a 168 cm reading root zone depth weighted average readings were used to update the water balances for the vri np and uniform treatments neutron probe measurements were taken approximately weekly throughout most of the growing season at mead the north half of the mead field was generally monitored in two days with a couple exceptions the 2016 maize at mead was generally monitored in a single day with a couple exceptions as was the brule site because of logistical difficulties neutron probe readings in the late season of 2016 were limited in frequency at both locations 2 4 water balance models for irrigation scheduling irrigation for the thee irrigated treatments was scheduled using computed daily water balances following fao56 with some deviations the models were also used for all treatments in computing response variables in irrigation scheduling for the vri np and uniform treatments neutron probe data were incorporated into the models as the true daily water status details of regarding this process and variation in 2015 are presented in barker 2017 such variations also include precipitation and irrigation incorporation in 2015 barker 2017 model parameterizations and deviations from the fao56 methodologies are described below crop et for the vri np and uniform treatments was modeled using dual crop coefficients as in eq 1 in 2015 the kcb followed allen and wright 2002 in 2016 the kcb was modified for time scaling in the late season similar to the u s bureau of reclamation s agrimet methodology usbr 2016 in this methodology the kcb is scaled based on the fraction of days between planting and effective full cover as in allen and wright 2002 but the second portion of the season is scaled based on fraction of time between effective full cover and harvest termination rather than a set number of days the corn kcb of allen and wright 2002 was used for maize and an adaptation of their dry bean kcb was used for soybean the primary adjustment to the latter was an extended peak kcb period planting dates for the kcb were fixed however effective full cover and termination dates were tailored to the crop based on historic savi values crop stage and other information for the vri rs treatment etcrf was computed as explained in 2 5 in computing soil evaporation readily evaporable water fao56 was computed using a linear relationship with total evaporable water fao56 based on values from table 19 of fao56 for a 10 cm evaporation layer depth in irrigation scheduling a minimum of readily available water equal to 53 of total available water was erroneously imposed in the final analysis a linear relationship based on fao56 table 19 to compute readily available water was used and included appropriate adjustment for varying depth of the evaporation layer fao56 and upper and lower bounds based on table 19 the soil evaporation model was initiated at field capacity on one of the first two days of the year depending on the site year water stress was computed following fao56 however no adjustment for et potential was made in 2015 irrigation scheduling zero was used for kcb outside of the growing season in 2015 however kcb 0 12 was used in 2016 and in all cases for the final analyses in addition to et surface runoff net irrigation and deep percolation were also modeled runoff was computed using the u s department of agriculture natural resrouces conservation service runoff equation usda nrcs 2004 assuming a curve number of 80 precipitation for each day was treated as a 24 h storm with a single pulse of precipitation net irrigation was computed differently prescribed irrigation quantities were assumed to be the actual gross applied irrigation an application efficiency of 90 was used to compute net infiltrated irrigation the time of irrigation for each plot was determined from the center pivot travel time which was computed from irrigation beginning and ending times end times were estimated for brule speed of travel was assumed to be uniform for a given irrigation cycle other non evaporative subtractions included deep percolation for irrigation scheduling deep percolation dp for all treatments was computed when the modeled soil water exceeded fc in the 1 2 m and 0 9 m soil profile for maize and soybean respectively fao56 when neutron probe soil water content was included if it exceeded fc dp was not computed until the calculation for the following day in 2015 this allowed some et to occur from the excess water in 2016 however modeled depletion was limited to not be less than zero a field capacity limit on the same day as the measurements the water balance models required both field capacity fc and permanent wilting point wp for each plot plot fc was determined based on neutron probe readings lo et al 2017 who cite martin et al 1990 volumetric soil water content readings from june 30 and july 1 2015 were used for this purpose for the 2015 season at mead field capacity for the north half of the mead field was updated in 2016 based on neutron probe readings from may 6 2016 prior to planting of the soybean crop the fc values for the south plots at mead were taken from june 15 and 16 2016 readings most depths were read on june 15 but the 30 cm readings were taken on june 16 2016 for brule the june 30 2016 neutron probe readings were deemed to be an adequate estimate of fc for irrigation scheduling we recognized that this was likely a low estimate at brule because it was mid crop development for both fields the weighted average neutron probe readings down to about 1 2 m were used to compute fc excluding the 15 cm readings at mead the fc used in final analyses ranged from 0 37 to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 at mead and from 0 10 to 0 29 cm3 cm 3 at brule the ranges of fc used in irrigation scheduling were similar in magnitude with maxima and minima within 0 02 cm3 cm 3 of those used in final analyses for any of the site years in 2016 all water balances were initiated at fc at planting in 2015 the initial soil water measurement on june 30 and july 1 was used to initiate all water balances plot wp at mead was based on measurements from soil samples collected in the north half of the field in 2015 wilting point was measured using a model wp4 t dewpoint potentiameter decagon devices inc pullman wa in 2015 an aerial and depth averaged wp from samples processed up to that point was used for all plots additional wp samples were subsequently processed a reasonable relationship was computed between profile averaged wp and deep range eca see 2 2 barker 2017 this was done by pairing each profile wp estimate with a nearby eca pixel from the interpolated survey the accuracy of neutron probe tube locations was possibly quite low in the roughly east west direction the plot wp was computed using mean 10 m eca data resampled to 1 m within a 9 1 m buffer inside each plot the resulting relationship was applied to both sides of the field to determine plot specific wp in 2016 and in final analyses for the brule field wp was determined from measured plot fc and soil survey data this was done by linear interpolation between the maximum and minimum wp and fc from the soil survey map units soil survey staff 2016a this provided a reasonable estimate of awc and was justified because the soil textures were courser than silt loam and thus within the range where fc and wp may have a generally proportional relationship see figure 5 29 of brady and weil 1996 plot wp used in the final analysis ranged from 0 17 to 0 21 cm3 cm 3 at mead and from 0 05 to 0 15 cm3 cm 3 at brule ranges of wp used in irrigation scheduling were within 0 02 cm3 cm 3 of those used in final analyses for any of the site years during irrigation management the average fc and wp for all of the plots in a given crop year were used for the uniform treatment at mead plot specific fc and wp were used for all plots at brule because of the increased variability at that site plot specific fc and wp were used for all plots in the final analysis in irrigation scheduling root zone total available water fao56 was computed using a 1 2 m managed root zone for maize at both sites and a 0 9 m root zone for soybean kranz and specht 2012 the root zone was assumed to begin at 0 1 m and extend linearly to the full managed rooting depth when the kcb reached peak value in scheduling irrigation with the water balance models described above the average daily etr from the previous 20 years was used to forecast et a management allowable depletion merriam 1966 of 45 was used for maize through most of the season but was increased to 60 near the end of the season yonts et al 2008 in soybean mad was set to 55 until around beginning pod kranz and specht 2012 suggest avoiding excess irrigation early in the soybean season following this time mad was reduced to 50 which was maintained through the end of the season kranz and specht 2012 at the end of the season the modeled root zone was extended to 1 2 m yonts et al 2008 irrigation was timed to prevent the water balance from any vri plot or either of the two plots used for managing the uniform treatment the average of the two was used before august 2015 from exceeding mad prior to irrigation thus any of these plots could trigger an irrigation event irrigation was applied to achieve a target depth of 38 1 mm of soil water storage above mad at mead or 25 4 mm above mad at brule gross irrigation was limited to be no greater than 30 5 mm per irrigation at mead or 25 4 mm at brule a minimum limit of 5 1 mm per irrigation for any irrigation treatment plot was included at both sites to prevent the supply pumps from operating at undesirably low flow rates irrigation management effectively began on july 22 2015 and july 1 2016 at mead and on august 8 2016 for brule at brule prescriptions were computed at the beginning of the week and forecasted to be applied by later in the week as the treatments were not imposed until august 8 2016 187 2 mm of uniform irrigation had been prescribed before treatments began an additional 50 8 mm of irrigation was prescribed in a catch up mode the water balances for both treatments for this site showed large estimated soil water deficits applying sufficient irrigation to satisfy the experimental protocol seemed unreasonable it was determined to maintain the scheduling method in place for other research in the study field therefore mad at brule was adjusted upward to an achievable irrigation goal each week based on the magnitude of the measured or modeled soil water depletion in these adjustments the same values of mad were used for both treatments the mad values used during this time were quite large ranging between 75 and 85 of total available water for applied prescriptions the large soil water depletion at brule and increased mad values may have been caused in part by uncertainty in the fc and wp values possible uncertainty in the neutron probe calibrations and possible model drift additional details regarding the water balance models and the irrigation scheduling are presented in barker 2017 2 5 implementation of the hybrid model irrigation prescriptions for the vri rs treatment were developed using satellite imagery the remote sensing based water balance followed the approach of barker et al 2018 and barker 2017 the tseb et and savi calculations were computed using a modified version of the setmi interface barker et al 2018 geli and neale 2012 which was operated within arcgis 10 2 and 10 4 esri redlands ca plot level kcbrf and water balance computations were performed in microsoft excel the setmi computations were performed at either a 0 762 m the crop row spacing or a 1 m scale depending on the site year thus each landsat 30 m pixel became about 900 to about 1600 smaller pixels of equal value plot values of tseb et and savi were determined by taking the average of the small pixels within each plot excluding a 9 1 m irrigation buffer area within the plot using arcgis in 2015 only the kcbrf water balance was used for the vri rs treatment and the kcbrf to savi relationship for maize published by bausch 1993 was used this kcbrf relationship was assumed adequate for use with asce standardized asce ewri 2005 tall reference etr to produce daily kcb we used the maize kcb of allen and wright 2002 the kcbrf values were limited to not exceed 0 96 or be less than 0 15 prior to fitting the kcb curves based on the kcb of allen and wright 2002 in 2016 the recently derived kcbrf relationships of campos et al 2017 were used for both soybean and maize crops barker et al 2018 these relationships were developed using eddy covariance flux data from fields near the mead site campos et al 2017 during irrigation scheduling the average daily growing degree days from the previous 20 years was used in forecasting in applying this method savi was limited to not exceed values that produced kcbrf greater than 0 96 for maize at brule and 0 95 for both crops at mead based on the peak kcb for maize and bean in allen and wright 2002 and values reported by campos et al 2017 a lower limit on savi equivalent to about kcb 0 12 was applied in 2016 this lower limit was likely never reached forecasted peak and projected end of season savi values were added as necessary for the soybean in 2016 to improve the kcb until adequate imagery was available barker et al 2018 the projected peak values were for kcb 0 95 a similar practice was used at brule in 2016 employing only the projected end of season savi in irrigation scheduling for 2016 maize at mead there were too few images available to produce the declining portion of the kcb curve therefore the allen and wright 2002 based kcb was used after effective full cover assumed to occur when the development leg of the kcb curve reached kcb 0 96 in irrigation scheduling kcb was limited to be 0 15 and 0 96 for maize crops and 0 95 for soybean in 2016 the full hybrid model was implemented including both kcbrf et and tseb et barker et al 2018 neale et al 2012 the penman monteith formulation for the tseb canopy latent heat flux was implemented following colaizzi et al 2014 we maintained crop height at the peak value for a given pixel as the modeled vegetation index based crop height anderson et al 2004 began to decrease barker et al 2018 modeled leaf area index anderson et al 2004 was not maintained at peak value after august as in barker et al 2018 in coupling the water balance and tseb models a kalman gain eq 2 of 0 78 was used following geli 2012 in implementation of the tseb we used the fraction of cover fc equation similar to li et al 2005 following the formulation in setmi barker et al 2018 geli et al 2014 2 6 response variables and treatment comparisons the irrigation treatment performance was compared using the following response variables measurement period actual et eta the season ending total precipitation less estimated runoff plus net irrigation plus the change in neutron probe soil water storage p ro inet δsw estimated deep percolation dp and yield season total prescribed irrigation was also compared between treatments but since it was a treatment it was analyzed separately from the response variables the hydrologic response variables were computed together using neutron probe measurements and spreadsheet water balances similar to those used in irrigation scheduling the measurement periods for mead were june 24 and 25 through october 6 and 7 2015 june 10 to september 26 2016 for maize and june 9 and 10 through october 31 and november 1 2016 for soybean the computation period for brule maize was june 23 through november 1 2016 the water balances were computed similar to the irrigation scheduling water balances for uniform and vri np treatments however we used the kcbrf methodology discussed by barker et al 2018 to run a daily soil water balance similar to irrigation scheduling for soybean in 2016 and computed fraction of cover from savi similar to barker et al 2018 we did apply a forecasted peak savi kcbrf 0 95 for mead maize in 2016 we effectively did not apply limits to savi prior to computing kcb in the final analyses we similarly did not effectively apply an upper limit on kcb but did limit kcb 0 12 modeled soil evaporation was also dampened by 25 based on possible impacts of crop residue odhiambo and irmak 2012 the surface residue was estimated at two locations in soybean residue on may 18 2016 using a transect method shetlon and jasa 2009 with transects perpendicular to the crop rows the two locations had 46 and 57 residue respectively four locations were measured in the maize residue on about may 13 2016 residue at that time ranged from 47 to 70 with an average of 62 this could represent a reduction in soil evaporation of about 25 30 based on residue alone following fao56 and odhiambo and irmak 2012 in these calculations the root zone was maintained at 1 52 m for mead and about 1 22 m at brule brule had a shallower depth because of missing readings in the deeper neutron probe measurements measurement period eta was estimated from neutron probe measurements and a seasonal water balance eta p ro inet dp δsw the seasonal ro only included rainfall events since runoff from irrigation was already accounted for with the irrigation application efficiency runoff and irrigation were computed as described for irrigation scheduling we used modeled daily soil water balances to compute dp between neutron probe measurement dates which were cumulated to get seasonal dp this method of computing dp was somewhat similar to irmak et al 2014 and djaman and irmak 2012 the combined variable p ro inet δsw was computed for the same measurement periods as dp the combined variable is similar to eta but without accounting for dp eliminating the uncertainty from the method used to compute dp the combined variable represented a quantity much closer to measurement than did dp and eta since we had greater confidence in the measurements and the runoff approximation see 2 4 in computing the response variables the modeled soil water content was allowed to exceed fc for up to three days following the most recent precipitation or irrigation event at mead and one day at brule d l martin personal communication that is the lower constraint of zero root zone depletion was not applied until more than three days had occurred since the last substantial rainfall resulting in 0 effective precipition or irrigation event at mead and one day at brule this change resulted in lower estimates of dp than the dp estimated for irrigation scheduling this three day or one day delay was consistent with the drainage process not being instantaneous the longer delay at mead was because of the finer textured soils at that site as compared with the brule site in the water balance modeling for response variables neutron probe measurements were incorporated as the start of day soil water depletion for the day following the measurement no dp was computed on neutron probe measurement dates all other changes in precipitation estimated runoff irrigation and soil water content were attributed to eta for brule revised neutron probe calibrations better suited to the research field were used in eta computations in the final computations at brule fc for a given plot and depth was computed as the maximum volumetric water content in all dates discluding neutron probe readings shortly after an irrigation event the change in fc at brule also caused a change in wp and awc however the original blocking was still honored in the analysis field capacity values were also updated for the north half of the field at mead based on inclusion of a neutron probe standard count that was excluded in fc for 2016 irrigation in addition to the hydrologic variables yield was also estimated yield estimates were obtained from the production combines onboard yield and moisture monitors yield maps were processed using the usda s yield editor 2 07 software sudduth et al 2012 processed yield maps were verified against field total weighing grain cart n thorson personal communication yield at mead yield was similarly processed for brule using the yield mass and grain moisture contents provided as output from john deere apex software john deere moline il yields were reported at harvest moisture content final plot yields were obtained by computing the average of all yield points in a plot excluding a 12 2 m buffer inside the plot border the intent was that all yield points would be within the estimated irrigation transition area of each plot see higgins et al 2016 since multiple response variables were included they were analyzed with multivariate analysis of variance manova using proc glm in sas 9 4 sas institute inc cary nc univariate analyses of variance anovas were performed as justified using proc glimmix in sas type iii sums of squares and cross products were used in all anovas blocking was treated as a fixed effect even though some data were missing block by treatment interactions were not included in final analysis each crop year combination was analyzed separately rather than as a multi occasion experiment we acknowledge that manovas and anovas were used though the response and irrigation data were not tested to see whether they were normally distrubited seasonal total prescribed irrigation was analyzed separately from the response variables using anova comparing only the two vri treatments where possible the estimated 95 confidence intervals for least squares means of these two treatments were used to test the null hypothesis that the total prescribed irrigation from each of the vri treatments was equal to zero rainfed or the mean of the uniform treatment in cases such as brule maize 2016 where only one vri treatment was present a simple mean was computed with standard error and confidence intervals using sas proc means 3 results and discussion 3 1 study conditions the growing seasons at mead in 2015 and 2016 were wetter than the 1981 2010 normal for the nearby national weather service global historic climate network mead 6 s station ncei n d the may to october precipitation from the rain gauges at the study field and the mead agronomy farm weather station as needed was 673 mm in 2015 and 678 mm in 2016 the normal precipitation for may to october for the mead 6 s station was 540 mm ncei n d also 2015 and 2016 were low et years with computed may to october etr of 827 and 932 mm respectively these are compared to 989 mm on average for the years 1995 2014 computed using the mead agronomy farm weather station data for brule the climatic conditions were not similar to mead the normal may to october precipitation for the global historic climate network big springs weather station near brule was about 308 mm ncei n d in 2016 the total may to october precipitation for the brule platte valley weather station was about 274 mm based on the normals ncei n d it is expected that brule would have substantially more irrigation than mead the experiment at brule was considered to be a proof of concept for operating the model in drier conditions than observed at mead 3 2 satellite imagery table 2 provides a list of cloud free landsat 7 and landsat 8 images included in irrigation scheduling and in the final analysis the low frequency of cloud free satellite images was a difficulty in this study particularly at mead in 2016 the brule field was in an overlap zone for landsat images which doubled the frequency of satellite overpasses landsat 7 images typically did not pick up all of the plots in a single image therefore only landsat 8 was used at brule there were twelve landsat 8 images that were cloud free at brule in 2016 all of these up to september 11 were used in irrigation scheduling three more end of season images were included in the final analysis there were seven cloud free landsat images over the north half of the mead field in 2015 there were seven cloud free images in 2016 and only the first four up to june 27 and the last one on october 9 included the south half of the field for the soybean in 2016 there were cloud free landsat 7 images on august 22 and september 23 2016 3 3 total prescribed irrigation total gross prescribed irrigation was computed as the sum of prescribed irrigation for all irrigation events table 3 all study plots were included in the prescribed irrigation comparisons for the 2016 maize the vri np and uniform treatments had identical irrigation prescriptions both ended up being uniform with a total seasonal prescription of 20 3 mm this was the minimum applied depth 5 08 mm times the four irrigation events essentially neither of these treatments called for irrigation thus the mean standard error and confidence interval for vri rs for 2016 maize at mead were computed using proc means as was done for brule interestingly for mead maize in 2016 all variability in irrigation for the vri rs treatment was applied in the first irrigation thereafter all subsequent irrigations were uniform applications of the maximum depth allowed for the irrigation protocol 30 45 mm the treatment differences between the two vri treatments were found to be significantly different than zero at the 5 level for 2015 maize standard error of the difference 2 73 mm f 295 p value 0 0001 and 2016 soybean standard error of the difference 3 35 mm f 341 p value 0 0001 the least squares means for the two vri treatments are presented in table 3 with 95 confidence intervals for the treatments for which confidence intervals were computed the intervals did not include the mean irrigation depths for any other treatment estimated mean irrigation did not exceed 118 mm for any of the mead treatments large amounts of precipitation and low et were suspected to be the primary drivers of the relatively small amounts of irrigation in all cases the vri rs resulted in the greatest irrigation table 3 because of overestimation of soil water depletion overestimation of et dp d l martin personal communication and or runoff may have been the cause s of the soil water balance drift since the vri rs water balance was not updated with neutron probe data overestimation of et was suspected in 2015 and in 2016 the overestimation of depletion persisted despite modifications to the model while overestimation of runoff was possible computed runoff used in all final analyses was about 36 mm for maize in 2015 at mead 43 and 44 mm for maize and soybean at mead in 2016 respectively and 23 mm for maize at brule in 2016 these magnitudes do not account for the full discrepancy in irrigation between treatments table 3 except in the case of brule while the hybrid methodology neale et al 2012 was employed in the vri rs in 2016 it apparently did not improve the performance of that treatment at mead the hybrid functionality did not result in soil water depletion adjustments during the experiment since neither the kcbrf nor the tseb models computed water stress conditions in the methodology employed in the field study water balance modeled etcrf was not adjusted if no adjustment was needed to ks thus both years at mead were essentially reliant on the accuracy of the kcbrf and water balance methods this was not the case at brule where the tseb et did cause an adjustment in the water balance at times however the model still seemed to drift from neutron probe measurements it seems that etcrf dp or runoff may have been overestimated at brule as well uncertainty in fc and wp at brule likely also contributed to difficulties in both treatments the vri np treatment which approaches an ideal condition for vri management had the smallest mean prescribed irrigation of the irrigated treatments at mead except for maize in 2016 table 3 the smaller mean prescribed irrigation for the vri np treatment was evidence that the vri np did effectively manage for some of the spatial variability in the field this was evidenced by examining the standard deviation of the total prescribed irrigation for a given site year versus the standard deviation of any single event this was not a rigorous test but it may be evidence that the prescribed irrigation in vri treatments was not oscillating for example if a large irrigation was prescribed to a given plot on one event irrigation was not necessarily light on the same plot later on the variation in total prescribed irrigation between plots would possibly be dampened in this case similar observations were made for the vri rs treatment 3 4 response variable manovas and univariate anovas treatment effects on response variables were first tested using wilks lambda for the type iii sums of squares and cross products we failed to reject the null hypothesis that treatment effects were zero at the 5 significance level for 2016 maize at brule approximate f 1 8 p value 0 191 this null hypothesis was rejected for all mead site years blocking effects were found to be significant at the 5 level for mead soybean in 2016 approximate f 3 7 p value 0 001 similarly blocking effects were significant for mead maize in 2016 approximate f 2 3 p value 0 036 these are interesting results because they suggests differences induced by soil properties as represented by eca at mead in 2016 blocking was not found to be significant for 2015 the awc blocking was expected to have a significant effect at brule but such was not found at the 5 level approximate f 1 8 p value 0 065 the span blocking at brule was also not found to be significant approximate f 1 0 p value 0 471 though it was anticipated to be so this was because of visible edge effects in the satellite imagery at brule some of the edge effects were probably due to the non irrigated surroundings around the field the resolution of the landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor 100 m rocchio 2018 is also acknowledged as a likely cause of edge effects as discussed for some satellites by gowda et al 2007 the univariate anovas were examined for all of the mead site years but not for brule because of the manova results table 4 of all of the univariate anova analyses the null hypotheses that at least one of the treatments had an estimated mean that differed from the others were rejected at the 5 level for all but three cases these cases were dp in 2016 soybean and maize at mead and yield for 2016 maize at mead f 1 38 p value 0 26 f 1 22 p value 0 32 and f 1 17 p value 0 34 respectively 3 5 yield and water use efficiency as mentioned in 2 6 the yield response estiamates were obtained from harvest combine yield maps all yields reported here are at harvest moisture contents in 2015 the average maize yield was 13 1 mg ha 1 based on weighing grain cart data which had moisture contents of 13 7 14 6 with an effective mean of 14 1 the field average yield from the cleaned yield map was computed by yield editor to be 13 2 mg ha 1 with an effective mean moisture content of 13 9 from the yield monitor data in 2016 the grain cart field average maize yield was 13 4 mg ha 1 with moisture contents of 15 7 16 5 with an effective mean of 16 1 the yield map average was 13 7 mg ha 1 with an effective moisture content of 16 0 from the yield monitor data this was a difference of about 2 for soybean in 2016 the field total and yield map average yields were both 4 3 mg ha 1 the moisture contents from the grain cart data were 12 4 14 4 with and effective mean of 13 0 the effective mean moisture content from the yield monitor data was 12 6 no further adjustment or scaling was applied to the yield estimates because they were near the grain cart averages for brule the cleaned maize yield was about 9 7 mg ha 1 with an effective moisture content from the yield monitor data of 14 3 for the processed parts of the field we only processed the yield for the study plots at brule so a comparison with total field yield was not performed estimated least squares means for yield and other response variables are presented in table 4 for yield in the 2015 maize the two vri treatments and the rainfed treatment all had similar estimated means 13 3 mg ha 1 they were only found to be significantly different than the uniform treatment 12 9 mg ha 1 these differences were unlikely to be strictly a response to the irrigation treatment and were attributed to random error for 2016 maize at mead the range in yield was 13 4 14 1 mg ha 1 for rainfed and vri rs respectively treatment differences were not significantly different for 2016 soybean the estimated mean yield in the rainfed treatment was the greatest 4 5 mg ha 1 this was only found to be significantly different than the vri rs treatment 4 2 mg ha 1 the larger estimated mean yield for the rainfed treatment over the vri rs treatment for the soybean may be a result of soybean not having improved yield from increased irrigation this is a known effect as a result of plant lodging from excessive vegetative growth kranz and specht 2012 soybean lodging was observed throughout the field in 2016 irrigation water use efficiency was estimated using the yield estimates from table 4 and the corresponding mean prescribed irrigation excluding the same plots as for the response variables as the method for computing means was different for some of the irrigation treatments simple means of both yield and irrigation using proc means were also used in computing water use efficiency shown in parenthesis for 2015 maize irrigation water use efficiency ranged from 8 3 8 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the uniform treatment to 1 0 0 9 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri np the vri rs was less than 0 1 0 02 kg ha 1 mm 1 for 2016 maize at mead irrigation water use efficiency ranged from 5 5 5 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri rs treatment to 22 7 17 8 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the vri np with 18 6 17 4 kg ha 1 mm 1 for the uniform note that for this site year vri rs was computed as a simple mean over plots included in the response variable anovas for that site year all irrigation water use efficiencies were negative for the soybean possibly due to yield losses associated with lodging rudnick et al 2016 efficiencies were 5 1 5 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vri np 3 6 3 7 kg ha 1 mm 1 for uniform and 3 0 3 0 kg ha 1 mm 1 for vri rs efficiencies were not computed for brule due to the lack of a rainfed treatement longer term experiments including dry years would provide a better perspective on how much vri can increase irrigation water use efficiency 3 6 hydrologic response variables while the reported eta values table 4 appear to be low for all site years it should be emphasized that they are for the measurement periods not the full growing seasons neutron probe measurements began 21 38 days after planting therefore an appreciable amount of evapotranspiration is likely not accounted for in the estimated means presented in table 4 in general treatments were expected to be similar although some differences in eta were expected due to increased wet soil evaporation from irrigation for maize in 2015 the vri rs had the greatest estimated mean eta 413 mm this was significantly different than all other treatments with the lowest being rainfed 343 mm this difference 70 mm seems excessive considering the various irrigation treatments were applied after tasseling a similar observation was made for mead maize in 2016 with the vri rs treatment having the greatest eta 492 mm this response was found to be significantly different than all other treatments again the lowest eta was rainfed 393 mm this difference 99 mm seems excessive given that the first irrigation was started on july 15 2016 for the soybean at mead in 2016 eta was greatest for the vri rs 512 mm which was significantly different than the other treatments with the smallest again being rainfed 452 mm this was a 60 mm difference in estimated means differences in eta for maize at brule were not significant and had a smaller range of about 4 mm the large differences in estimated mean eta for individual crop years at mead may be related to uncertainty in the dp computation method possible improvements to estimating dp could include using multiple layer soil water balances djaman and irmak 2012 a more physically based approach such as the wilcox method klocke et al 2010 miller and aarstad 1972 or possibly even inverse modeling foolad et al 2017 such methods may better account for spatial variability in drainage rates the uncertainties in eta computations support the inclusion of dp and of p ro inet δsw as a combined variable for mead maize significant differences in p ro inet δsw were similar to eta with ranges of 70 mm for 2015 and 96 mm for 2016 both were within 20 mm of prescribed irrigation suggesting that this variable accounted for the change in the water balance due to irrigation if all processes were exactly accounted for the differences in p ro inet δsw should be equal to differences in net irrigation for soybean estimated mean p ro inet δsw was greatest for the vri rs treatment 521 mm which is logical this was significantly different than all other treatments with the smallest being 455 mm for rainfed again this difference was within 20 mm of the difference in prescribed irrigation estimated dp in the final analysis was lower than estimated dp during irrigation scheduling see 2 6 no significant differences between treatments were found in dp deep percolation was estimated to be 0 for all plots in 2015 for 2016 maize and soybean at mead dp was estimated to be 13 mm or less and 9 mm or less respectively allowing drainage to occur over the course of multiple days resulted in little dp being estimated deep percolation was estimated to be 13 mm or less for brule 3 7 spatial variability we investigated the spatial variability of the three primary response variables yield eta dp and p ro inet δsw precipitation and awc to identify which variables were most important to quantify spatially for irrigation management only the uniform treatment was included for this purpose this treatment had no intentionally imposed variability and was included for all site years to compare spatial variability the coefficient of variation cv was computed for each variable using microsoft excel table 5 without accounting for blocking or other treatments missing data from some blocks were acknowledged but were not accounted for in this analysis spatial variability in precipitation was computed for the cumulative precipitation from each of four rain gauges at mead the period of june 26 to july 15 and september 9 to october 14 2015 and the period of june 9 through september 13 2016 were used for precipitation another potential driving force for spatial differences in irrigation requirements is run on within the field however this effect was not quantified in the analysis for all cases except 2015 dp had the largest cv which is primarily due to the low magnitude of the estimates deep percolation was computed to be zero for all plots in 2015 the following discussion subsequently ignores dp a better measure of the variability may likely be gleaned by examining cvs for eta and p ro inet δsw for 2015 at mead the greatest variability as defined by the cv was in awc followed by precipitation for 2016 at mead the greatest variability was in awc for the soybean and precipitation for the maize overall the awc precipitation and eta had greater variability than did yield at mead though the cv for awc was less than for yield for 2016 maize suggesting a dampened response of yield to the soil and eta variability at brule awc had the greatest variability which was much larger than at mead part of this difference was related to the smaller mean awc at brule but greater variation was expected at that site due to great soil heterogeneity from table 5 it seems that quantifying awc may be most important for vri management followed by precipitation and et assuming that the cv presented here is representative of the cv of actual et 4 conclusions the vri rs treatment had the greatest mean prescribed irrigation for each crop year combination the differences were attributed to water balance drift even after model improvements were made in 2016 the drift was still apparent overestimation of wet soil evaporation drainage rates and or runoff are suspected as contributing causes of the drift in the final analyses soil evaporation was dampened by 25 based on residue estimates at mead and dp was limited to not occur until it had been more than three days since a rainfall or irrigation event at mead and more than one day later for brule in final analyses d l martin personal communication further improvements to these parts of the model is recommended the remote sensing based model is expected to perform better if coupled with soil water content measurement treatment effects were primarily in eta or p ro inet δsw with increased irrigation generally resulting in greater estimates of both yield differences were small yield differences in maize may have resulted from random error yield reductions in soybean for the vri rs treatment may have been a result of lodging caused by excess irrigation kranz and specht 2012 of the variables considered in this research awc generally had the greatest spatial variability more so than eta or p ro inet δsw however these were still variable and precipitation had the greatest variability for 2016 maize at mead excluding dp thus quantifying spatial variability beyond awc may improve irrigation management the small number of cloud free satellite images was a challenge for properly executing the remote sensing based model however the provisions for real time operation performed well given the number of input images it is expected that the hybrid

11468,the combined application of different functional chemicals creates challenges both in modeling water flow in soil and quantification of water extraction by crops in dry land farming in the

fallahi et al 2016 liao et al 2012 gao et al 2013 currently some typical chemicals such as superabsorbent polymer sap and fulvic acid fa are commonly combined employed to enhance the utilization ability of crop to soil water and nutrient by taking advantage of their respective properties extensive previous reports suggested that the use of chemicals such as pam fa krilium super slurper sap etc could effect on soil physical and chemical properties crop photosynthesis root growth etc thus regulating transport of water in soil crop system qusdtel 1953 kirkham and runkles 1952 letey 1975 hemyari and nofziger 1981 cooke 1996 abrol et al 2013 koupai et al 2008 hüttermann et al 2009 anjum et al 2011 benhur et al 2015 the cost for using these chemicals is us 560 800 hm 2 which is nearly as cost as fertilizer us 536 953 hm 2 applied for field crop or fruit in each year and adding chemical can greatly improve the fertilizer use efficiency by 18 72 27 06 huang et al 2002 thus making it possible to reduce application of fertilizer as well as environmental pollution caused by fertilizer moreover compared to the application of a single chemical the combined application of multi chemicals has a synergistic effect which is better in improving wue and crops yield the mechanism for this synergistic effect was preliminary explored to reveal that multi chemicals controlled the release of the endogenous hormones in crops ensuring effective use of soil water resources liao et al 2018 liao et al 2015 applied sap and fa combined to maize and the results indicated a significant yield increase of 21 compared to the treatment without chemicals however other studies reported by zhuang et al 2008 and han et al 2004 pointed out that single sap applied to winter wheat can achieve a yield increase of 10 14 and single fa applied to apple can get a yield increase of 4 88 to 7 32 respectively impressively han et al 2005 and li et al 2011 combined use sap and fa to wheat and apple and their results demonstrated that the application of multi chemicals took more beneficial effects than any single chemical on soil moisture and crop yield therefore it is of great significance to study the mechanism of sap and fa combined effect on water extraction disappointedly the previous studies mainly focus on application modes of chemicals lacks of in depth analysis on its effect mechanism besides it is unreliable to develop soil water flow model based on the traditional soil hydraulic parameter system and root response system under sap application because sap s unique characteristics of repeated absorption and release of water produces unstable effects on soil physical and chemical properties and root growth li et al 2014 han et al 2010 guilherme et al 2015 many previous researches have also verified this view in a laboratory experiment bai et al 2010 found sap will reduce soil bulk density with the alternation of wetting and drying cycles in soil and the greater the amount of sap application the lower the bulk density zhou et al 2012 applied sap to maize in a field experiment and found that maize roots became shorter and had larger surface areas in the process of developing model to describe water movement under sap application han et al 2013 also pointed out that sap produced time varying effects on soil hydraulic parameters which made the established model based on traditional soil hydraulic parameter system invalid in simulating soil water movement in addition the response mechanism of crop root growth to multi chemicals application was still unclear which also created challenge for developing a soil water flow model in this study 2 year laboratory and field experiments were carried out to model water flow in soil and further quantify soil water extraction by crops as affected by sap and fa combined application two rwe terms based on density of root length density drl and density of root nitrogen mass density drnm respectively were established to simulate the rate of rwe then a soil water flow model was developed to describe the patterns of water flow in soils the mechanism of sap and fa effects on rwe of maize was explored and the value of water extraction by maize from different soil layers was quantified by employing stable isotope mixing models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the laboratory

collected at jointing stage heading stage and grain filling stage respectively to measure hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope abundance each section of the xylem stem of maize was sampled for 5 cm and then the small 3 4 segment of the stem was put into 100 ml centrifuge tubes and sealed with parafilm membrane meanwhile soil samples were collected at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 100 cm then put into a 100 ml centrifuge tube immediately and sealed with a parafilm membrane all samples were placed in the freezer of 20 c to prevent the change of isotopic composition the water of maize xylem stem and soil samples was extracted by using a vacuum extraction then the collected water was measured using the water isotope analyzer picarro l2120 i usa the method for analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance was displayed in previous studies phillips and gregg 2003 phillips et al 2005 multi source mass balance equation δx f 1 δx1 f 2 δx2 f 3 δx3 f n δxn was applied for calculating contribution ratios of soil water to crop water where f 1 to f n are contribution ratios of water in different soil layers to crop water δx1 and δxn are frequency for the corresponding contribution ratios of different soil layers δx stands for hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance of crop the height stem diameter ear length grain number and yield of maize were measured at harvest stage using the same method as reported by pei et al 2017 3 development of soil water flow model as affected by multi chemicals under the condition of sap and fa combined application since the water holding ability of sap is reduced over time the unsaturated diffusivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of sap treated soil are functions of the soil water content θ and time t rather than only the soil water content θ the time varying functions are denoted by d θ t and k θ t therefore the solution of one dimensional vertical unsaturated soil water flow under effects of sap and fa is described using the equation below 2 θ t z d θ t θ z k θ t z s z t boundary condition θ z 0 θ 0 z 0 z rl θ rl t θ 0 z t 0 d θ t θ z k θ t se t t 0 where d θ t and k θ t respectively denote time varying functions for unsaturated diffusivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm2 d 1 and cm d 1 s z t is the source sink term of rwe cm3 cm 3 d 1 se t is the rate of soil surface evaporation cm d 1 θ is the soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 z is the soil depth cm and rl is maximum root depth cm in eq 2 the source sink term of rwe s z t was established in this study using a general functional form s z t δ h ρ φ s m wang et al 2012 eq 3 where δ h and β φ are dimensionless water stress and salinity stress reduction factors respectively which account for the effects of deficit water and salinity on rwe s m is maximum rwe i e the rate of rwe in optimal water conditions cm3 cm 3 d 1 this study focused on water stress i e the effects of sap on soil water and did not consider salinity stress therefore in order to avoid disturbances to the experimental results caused by salinity stress the tested soil was washed with fresh water several times to minimize the soil salinity letting the salinity stress reduction factor ρ φ be 1 so eq 3 can be rewritten as s z t δ h s m eq 4 the parameter δ h in the eq 4 was calculated using the non linear function δ h 1 1 1 h h d f eq 5 proposed by genuchten 1987 s m was calculated using the drl function s m c drl l d eq 6 proposed by feddes et al 1978 and the drnm function s m c drnm n d eq 7 proposed by shi and zuo 2009 respectively where c drl is the potential water absorption coefficient per unit of drl cm3 cm 1 d 1 c drnm is the potential water absorption coefficient per unit of drnm cm3 mg 1 d 1 ld and nd are values of drl and drnm cm cm 3 and mg cm 3 respectively for development of soil water flow model as affected by sap and fa d θ t k θ t were obtained from a previous report liao et al 2016b c drl c drnm were optimized by the relationship between the s m and ld nd in the optimum water condition respectively f and hd were fitted by the least square procedure employed in the water stress condition respectively h was translated by measured soil water content θ in different soil layers ld and nd were directly got by measured drl and drnm in different soil layers respectively 4 data analysis one way spss15 0 anova was used for statistical tests analysis and plotting were conducted in excel microsoft 2010 power point microsoft 2010 and scientific data analysis and visualization scidavis1 d8 the program for model was written in r language 5 results 5 1 root growth and rwe source sink term the values of drl and drnm of cc ck cc s cc sf1 and cc sf2 in different soil layers after corn seeding were presented in fig 2 respectively in 0 20 cm soil layer these results suggested that the sap and fa combined applied to the soil maize system increased drl by 13 0 28 6 in the early period 15 27 das but this increase of drl gradually diminished to 6 0 6 1 with time over 33 45 das in the same soil layer the application of sap and fa did not greatly increase drnm 4 2 17 1 during the early period 15 27 das however it experienced steady increases by 12 4 21 2 in drnm during 33 45 das in 20 40 cm soil layer it indicated that application of sap and fa has different effects on drl and drnm a non stationary change 7 1 34 2 was observed in drl during 15 45 das and a relatively stable change 10 5 48 0 was found in drnm during the same time the value of c drl at 0 0384 was determined by the fitted relationship between rwe and drl under optimal water conditions fig 3 a and the values of f and h d in the water stress correction factor δ h were estimated from the measurements in the fc sf group by least squares they were 1 74 and 706 fig 3b respectively the value of c drnm at 1 7104 was determined by the fitted relationship between rwe and drnm under optimal water conditions fig 3c and the values of f and h d in the water stress correction factor δ h were estimated from the measurements in the fc sf group by least squares they were 4 55 and 650 fig 3d respectively the matrix potential h z t was estimated by using measured soil water content θ to calculated the van genuchten equation and the parameters fitted from the previous water retention curve liao et al 2016b were displayed in table 4 then a drl based rwe term s z t 0 038l d 1 h 706 1 74 eq 10 and a drnm based rwe term s z t 1 710n d 1 h 650 4 55 eq 11 under the effects of sap and fa were established respectively comparison between drl based and drnm based rwe term was listed in fig 4 the measured value of rwe was obtained by using the inverse method proposed in a previous study liao et al 2016a to calculate the water distribution data of two successive soil profiles got from the controlled soil column experiment the functional forms of the control group s d θ and k θ and the treatment groups d θ t and k θ t presented in a previous study liao et al 2016b were used in this paper the errors for drl based rwe source sink term from 15 21das were obvious the simulated values of rwe from the rnmd based rwe source sink term were consistent with the measured values except for the 0 5 cm soil layer from 27 45das and 15 30 cm soil layer from 15 27das the analysis results table 5 suggested that the average errors of rmse mae and ore for drl were 3 52 10 3 7 1 10 3 21 96 respectively but that for drnm were 2 54 10 3 4 06 10 3 16 it suggested that the rwe source sink term based on drnm better described the patterns of rwe as affected by sap and fa 5 2 modeling water flow in different soil layer in the controlled field experiment four groups of irrigation events were performed the parameters were optimized by data got from the 1st june 21 july 7 and 3rd july 23 august 7 irrigation events and the model was validated by data got from the 2nd july 9 july 22 and 4th august 8 august 24 irrigation events the data got from 1st irrigation event june 21 june 30 and 3rd irrigation event july 23 july 30 were used for optimizing c drnm which yields 1 4289 the f 1 85 h d 1468 35 in δ h were optimized by data got from 1st irrigation event july 1 july 7 and 3rd irrigation event july 31 august 7 then a soil water flow model considering rwe source sink term based on drnm as affected by sap and fa was developed as θ t z d θ t θ z k θ t z 1 4289n d 1 h 1468 35 1 85 the results for water flow in different soil layers fig 5 showed that the simulated values were in good agreement the measured values which was supported by the error analysis table 5 the average values of rmse mae ore for fc sf were 1 14 10 2 2 08 10 2 2 85 respectively it indicated that the developed soil water flow model could better simulate the patterns of water flow in different soil layers 5 3 quantification of water extraction by maize from different soil layers the average moisture of different treatments for 0 100 cm soil layer was 7 9 12 8 application of multi chemicals improved moisture contents in sap treated soil layers and a significant p 0 05 increase of moisture was observed in 10 30 cm soil layer due to sap was applied into 0 25 cm soil layer to store water for soils below 40 cm layer no significant difference was observed the average moisture of chemical treatments was basically higher than ck treatment in 0 40 cm soil layer table 6 the results for analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance suggested that the main extraction depths of maize for different treatments are both in 0 20 cm soil layer in jointing stage with rates at 69 73 for fr ck 56 62 for fr s 67 74 for fr sf 74 79 for fr f respectively fig 6 and 7 for 20 40 cm soil layer the soil water of fr s treatment showed a higher contribution to crop water with rates at 26 41 however very low ratio of contribution was observed in other treatments it was obvious that fa decreased water extraction by maize from soil due to the inhibitory effect of fa on transpiration from 40 100 cm soil layer the results of four treatments indicated low contribution ratios to crop water in heading stage the main extraction depths moved down to 20 40 cm soil layer and soil water contribution of fr ck fr sf fr f treatments to crop water were 66 71 57 70 57 80 respectively however the main extraction depths of maize for fr s treatment are 20 60 cm soil layer with contribution rates at 34 45 in 20 40 cm layer and 34 54 in 40 60 cm layer for soils in 0 20 cm layer and 60 100 cm layer ratios of soil water contributed to crop water were relatively low in grain filling stage the main extraction depths of maize moved up to 0 20 cm soil layer again with contribution rates at 48 63 for fr ck 30 48 for fr s 31 58 for fr sf 33 72 for fr f respectively fr s treatment indicated higher contribution rates in 20 40 cm layer due to sap applied in this layer to store water although fr sf was also applied with sap application of fa restricted water extraction from this soil layer from 40 to 100 cm soil layer water contribution rates were stationary distribution and low 5 4 the growth and yield of maize the growth and yield of maize are shown in table 7 compared to ck treatment the chemicals treatments significantly p 0 05 improved maize yield by 21 3 for fr sf 10 9 for fr f 8 6 for fr s the 100 grain weight was consistent with maize yield which further ensured the reliability of yield the rain fed maize field experiment just accept rainfall and no irrigation therefore maize yield could stands for wue due to the same rainfall was supplied into soil from this point of view the combined application of sap and fa significantly p 0 05 increased the rainfall wue of maize the grain number was increased but no significant difference was observed and the ear length was significantly p 0 05 decreased by fr f but no significant difference for other chemicals treatment for height and stem diameter the chemicals treatments showed improvement at a certain degree 6 discussions the soil water flow model was developed to describe patterns of water flow in different soil layers under multi chemicals application the first problem to be solved is to establish the suitable rwe source sink term because chemicals would change root growth and then affect rate of rwe zhou et al 2012 priya et al 2014 the results suggested that changing rule of drnm was better to coincide with rule of rwe under multi chemicals application similar results were also reported by wang et al 2012 and shi et al 2013 and they pointed out that the rwe source sink term established on drnm was highly effective in simulating the patterns of water extraction although many rwe source sink terms based on drl were established to obtain the desired results prasad 1988 li et al 2001 faria et al 2010 in this study obvious errors were found in rwe source sink term based on drl at 15 27 das fig 5 and the simulated values in 10 25 cm soil layer were obviously less than measured values with the application of fa the errors in 10 25 cm soil layer were decreased however the errors in 5 cm soil layer were increased we speculated that sap limited growth of root length in 15 27 das but as fa applied to maize and took combined effect with sap to increase root length at a certain degree so the rwe source sink term based on drl indicated an improvement in accuracy for simulating the rwe of maize it was generally accepted that the authenticity of rwe source sink term depends on accuracy in measurement of root growth index shi and zuo 2009 casaroli et al 2010 heinen 2014 hence the change of root length results in different simulation precision of rwe source sink term based on drl nevertheless a phenomenon worthy of attention was that errors in 5 cm increased with fa application it suggested that fa promoted the growth of root in 0 25 cm soil layer to negate the limitation effect of sap root growth the 5 cm soil layer was not applied with a sap therefore the root length was increased too much to result in errors of rwe source sink term based on drl for rwe source sink term based on drnm the drnm in 25 40 cm soil layers cannot be detected for less mass which would decrease the accuracy of simulated values in this study the prop roots were not considered in rwe source sink term that would cause errors in simulated values to quantify the water extraction by crops from different sources was hotspot issue with many disputes bleby et al 2010 kanonakata et al 2013 liu et al 2011b leitner et al 2014 in this research we found that the main water extraction depth decreased first then increased during growth period of maize and mainly concentrated in the shallow soil layers 0 20 cm soil layer for jointing stage 20 40 cm soil layer for heading stage 0 20 cm soil layer for grain filling stage it s similar to results got from asbjornsen et al 2007 and wang et al 2010 and they considered the maize utilized water primarily from shallow soil in 0 50 cm layers although some scholars also pointed out that rwe of maize may came from deeper soil kang and zhang 2004 li et al 2011 it was mostly related to the difference of irrigation modes and distribution of roots which had been fully discussed in previous reports jara and stockle 1999 amato and ritchie 2002 wu et al 2016 in addition the results suggested that different chemicals treatments lead to variety of water supply ratios fig 2 sap made obvious effect on sap treated soil layers to improve moisture content and fa further increased contribution ratio of soil water to crop water in sap treated soil layers compared to single chemical application the use of multi chemicals brought a better effect to improve wue table 5 which was same as the previous studies reported by han et al 2005 and liu et al 2011a we got contribution ratios of soil water to crop water during different growth periods of maize though the regulating mechanism was needed to be explored to further explain rule of water transport from soil into crop under multi chemicals application 7 conclusions two rwe source sink term based on drl and drnm respectively were established to describe the rate of rwe under multi chemicals application the results suggested that the values simulated by the rwe source sink term based on drnm were closer to the measured values then a specific soil water flow model was further developed to simulate patterns of water flow in different soil layers and the accuracy of the developed model was verified on the field scale a good simulating result was observed that the average values of rmse mae ore were 1 14 10 2 2 08 10 2 2 85 respectively it indicated the developed model was suitable for describing water flow in different soil layers under multi chemicals application in addition multi chemicals significantly improved moisture content in sap treated soil layers 10 30 cm the main depth of water extraction for maize decreased first and then increased and mainly concentrated in the shallow soil layers 0 20 cm soil layer for jointing stage 20 40 cm soil layer for heading stage 0 20 cm soil layer for grain filling stage after multi chemicals applied to soil maize system the characteristic of water extraction for maize was changed to affect water flow in different soil layers an inspiriting result demonstrated that sap increased soil moisture in sap treated soil layer by storing water and fa further improved the utilization of maize to the stored water thus application of sap and fa played a synergistic role in promoting rainfall wue of maize

fallahi et al 2016 liao et al 2012 gao et al 2013 currently some typical chemicals such as superabsorbent polymer sap and fulvic acid fa are commonly combined employed to enhance the utilization ability of crop to soil water and nutrient by taking advantage of their respective properties extensive previous reports suggested that the use of chemicals such as pam fa krilium super slurper sap etc could effect on soil physical and chemical properties crop photosynthesis root growth etc thus regulating transport of water in soil crop system qusdtel 1953 kirkham and runkles 1952 letey 1975 hemyari and nofziger 1981 cooke 1996 abrol et al 2013 koupai et al 2008 hüttermann et al 2009 anjum et al 2011 benhur et al 2015 the cost for using these chemicals is us 560 800 hm 2 which is nearly as cost as fertilizer us 536 953 hm 2 applied for field crop or fruit in each year and adding chemical can greatly improve the fertilizer use efficiency by 18 72 27 06 huang et al 2002 thus making it possible to reduce application of fertilizer as well as environmental pollution caused by fertilizer moreover compared to the application of a single chemical the combined application of multi chemicals has a synergistic effect which is better in improving wue and crops yield the mechanism for this synergistic effect was preliminary explored to reveal that multi chemicals controlled the release of the endogenous hormones in crops ensuring effective use of soil water resources liao et al 2018 liao et al 2015 applied sap and fa combined to maize and the results indicated a significant yield increase of 21 compared to the treatment without chemicals however other studies reported by zhuang et al 2008 and han et al 2004 pointed out that single sap applied to winter wheat can achieve a yield increase of 10 14 and single fa applied to apple can get a yield increase of 4 88 to 7 32 respectively impressively han et al 2005 and li et al 2011 combined use sap and fa to wheat and apple and their results demonstrated that the application of multi chemicals took more beneficial effects than any single chemical on soil moisture and crop yield therefore it is of great significance to study the mechanism of sap and fa combined effect on water extraction disappointedly the previous studies mainly focus on application modes of chemicals lacks of in depth analysis on its effect mechanism besides it is unreliable to develop soil water flow model based on the traditional soil hydraulic parameter system and root response system under sap application because sap s unique characteristics of repeated absorption and release of water produces unstable effects on soil physical and chemical properties and root growth li et al 2014 han et al 2010 guilherme et al 2015 many previous researches have also verified this view in a laboratory experiment bai et al 2010 found sap will reduce soil bulk density with the alternation of wetting and drying cycles in soil and the greater the amount of sap application the lower the bulk density zhou et al 2012 applied sap to maize in a field experiment and found that maize roots became shorter and had larger surface areas in the process of developing model to describe water movement under sap application han et al 2013 also pointed out that sap produced time varying effects on soil hydraulic parameters which made the established model based on traditional soil hydraulic parameter system invalid in simulating soil water movement in addition the response mechanism of crop root growth to multi chemicals application was still unclear which also created challenge for developing a soil water flow model in this study 2 year laboratory and field experiments were carried out to model water flow in soil and further quantify soil water extraction by crops as affected by sap and fa combined application two rwe terms based on density of root length density drl and density of root nitrogen mass density drnm respectively were established to simulate the rate of rwe then a soil water flow model was developed to describe the patterns of water flow in soils the mechanism of sap and fa effects on rwe of maize was explored and the value of water extraction by maize from different soil layers was quantified by employing stable isotope mixing models 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the laboratory

10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 80 100 cm on may 25 june 7 june 14 june 21 july 10 august 3 to measure its moisture contents using the air dry oven dhg 9146a xylem stem samples and soil samples were collected at jointing stage heading stage and grain filling stage respectively to measure hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope abundance each section of the xylem stem of maize was sampled for 5 cm and then the small 3 4 segment of the stem was put into 100 ml centrifuge tubes and sealed with parafilm membrane meanwhile soil samples were collected at 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 100 cm then put into a 100 ml centrifuge tube immediately and sealed with a parafilm membrane all samples were placed in the freezer of 20 c to prevent the change of isotopic composition the water of maize xylem stem and soil samples was extracted by using a vacuum extraction then the collected water was measured using the water isotope analyzer picarro l2120 i usa the method for analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance was displayed in previous studies phillips and gregg 2003 phillips et al 2005 multi source mass balance equation δx f 1 δx1 f 2 δx2 f 3 δx3 f n δxn was applied for calculating contribution ratios of soil water to crop water where f 1 to f n are contribution ratios of water in different soil layers to crop water δx1 and δxn are frequency for the corresponding contribution ratios of different soil layers δx stands for hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance of crop the height stem diameter ear length grain number and yield of maize were measured at harvest stage using the same method as reported by pei et al 2017 3 development of soil water flow model as affected by multi chemicals under the condition of sap and fa combined application since the water holding ability of sap is reduced over time the unsaturated diffusivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of sap treated soil are functions of the soil water content θ and time t rather than only the soil water content θ the time varying functions are denoted by d θ t and k θ t therefore the solution of one dimensional vertical unsaturated soil water flow under effects of sap and fa is described using the equation below 2 θ t z d θ t θ z k θ t z s z t boundary condition θ z 0 θ 0 z 0 z rl θ rl t θ 0 z t 0 d θ t θ z k θ t se t t 0 where d θ t and k θ t respectively denote time varying functions for unsaturated diffusivity and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm2 d 1 and cm d 1 s z t is the source sink term of rwe cm3 cm 3 d 1 se t is the rate of soil surface evaporation cm d 1 θ is the soil moisture content cm3 cm 3 z is the soil depth cm and rl is maximum root depth cm in eq 2 the source sink term of rwe s z t was established in this study using a general functional form s z t δ h ρ φ s m wang et al 2012 eq 3 where δ h and β φ are dimensionless water stress and salinity stress reduction factors respectively which account for the effects of deficit water and salinity on rwe s m is maximum rwe i e the rate of rwe in optimal water conditions cm3 cm 3 d 1 this study focused on water stress i e the effects of sap on soil water and did not consider salinity stress therefore in order to avoid disturbances to the experimental results caused by salinity stress the tested soil was washed with fresh water several times to minimize the soil salinity letting the salinity stress reduction factor ρ φ be 1 so eq 3 can be rewritten as s z t δ h s m eq 4 the parameter δ h in the eq 4 was calculated using the non linear function δ h 1 1 1 h h d f eq 5 proposed by genuchten 1987 s m was calculated using the drl function s m c drl l d eq 6 proposed by feddes et al 1978 and the drnm function s m c drnm n d eq 7 proposed by shi and zuo 2009 respectively where c drl is the potential water absorption coefficient per unit of drl cm3 cm 1 d 1 c drnm is the potential water absorption coefficient per unit of drnm cm3 mg 1 d 1 ld and nd are values of drl and drnm cm cm 3 and mg cm 3 respectively for development of soil water flow model as affected by sap and fa d θ t k θ t were obtained from a previous report liao et al 2016b c drl c drnm were optimized by the relationship between the s m and ld nd in the optimum water condition respectively f and hd were fitted by the least square procedure employed in the water stress condition respectively h was translated by measured soil water content θ in different soil layers ld and nd were directly got by measured drl and drnm in different soil layers respectively 4 data analysis one way spss15 0 anova was used for statistical tests analysis and plotting were conducted in excel microsoft 2010 power point microsoft 2010 and scientific data analysis and visualization scidavis1 d8 the program for model was written in r language 5 results 5 1 root growth and rwe source sink term the values of drl and drnm of cc ck cc s cc sf1 and cc sf2 in different soil layers after corn seeding were presented in fig 2 respectively in 0 20 cm soil layer these results suggested that the sap and fa combined applied to the soil maize system increased drl by 13 0 28 6 in the early period 15 27 das but this increase of drl gradually diminished to 6 0 6 1 with time over 33 45 das in the same soil layer the application of sap and fa did not greatly increase drnm 4 2 17 1 during the early period 15 27 das however it experienced steady increases by 12 4 21 2 in drnm during 33 45 das in 20 40 cm soil layer it indicated that application of sap and fa has different effects on drl and drnm a non stationary change 7 1 34 2 was observed in drl during 15 45 das and a relatively stable change 10 5 48 0 was found in drnm during the same time the value of c drl at 0 0384 was determined by the fitted relationship between rwe and drl under optimal water conditions fig 3 a and the values of f and h d in the water stress correction factor δ h were estimated from the measurements in the fc sf group by least squares they were 1 74 and 706 fig 3b respectively the value of c drnm at 1 7104 was determined by the fitted relationship between rwe and drnm under optimal water conditions fig 3c and the values of f and h d in the water stress correction factor δ h were estimated from the measurements in the fc sf group by least squares they were 4 55 and 650 fig 3d respectively the matrix potential h z t was estimated by using measured soil water content θ to calculated the van genuchten equation and the parameters fitted from the previous water retention curve liao et al 2016b were displayed in table 4 then a drl based rwe term s z t 0 038l d 1 h 706 1 74 eq 10 and a drnm based rwe term s z t 1 710n d 1 h 650 4 55 eq 11 under the effects of sap and fa were established respectively comparison between drl based and drnm based rwe term was listed in fig 4 the measured value of rwe was obtained by using the inverse method proposed in a previous study liao et al 2016a to calculate the water distribution data of two successive soil profiles got from the controlled soil column experiment the functional forms of the control group s d θ and k θ and the treatment groups d θ t and k θ t presented in a previous study liao et al 2016b were used in this paper the errors for drl based rwe source sink term from 15 21das were obvious the simulated values of rwe from the rnmd based rwe source sink term were consistent with the measured values except for the 0 5 cm soil layer from 27 45das and 15 30 cm soil layer from 15 27das the analysis results table 5 suggested that the average errors of rmse mae and ore for drl were 3 52 10 3 7 1 10 3 21 96 respectively but that for drnm were 2 54 10 3 4 06 10 3 16 it suggested that the rwe source sink term based on drnm better described the patterns of rwe as affected by sap and fa 5 2 modeling water flow in different soil layer in the controlled field experiment four groups of irrigation events were performed the parameters were optimized by data got from the 1st june 21 july 7 and 3rd july 23 august 7 irrigation events and the model was validated by data got from the 2nd july 9 july 22 and 4th august 8 august 24 irrigation events the data got from 1st irrigation event june 21 june 30 and 3rd irrigation event july 23 july 30 were used for optimizing c drnm which yields 1 4289 the f 1 85 h d 1468 35 in δ h were optimized by data got from 1st irrigation event july 1 july 7 and 3rd irrigation event july 31 august 7 then a soil water flow model considering rwe source sink term based on drnm as affected by sap and fa was developed as θ t z d θ t θ z k θ t z 1 4289n d 1 h 1468 35 1 85 the results for water flow in different soil layers fig 5 showed that the simulated values were in good agreement the measured values which was supported by the error analysis table 5 the average values of rmse mae ore for fc sf were 1 14 10 2 2 08 10 2 2 85 respectively it indicated that the developed soil water flow model could better simulate the patterns of water flow in different soil layers 5 3 quantification of water extraction by maize from different soil layers the average moisture of different treatments for 0 100 cm soil layer was 7 9 12 8 application of multi chemicals improved moisture contents in sap treated soil layers and a significant p 0 05 increase of moisture was observed in 10 30 cm soil layer due to sap was applied into 0 25 cm soil layer to store water for soils below 40 cm layer no significant difference was observed the average moisture of chemical treatments was basically higher than ck treatment in 0 40 cm soil layer table 6 the results for analysis of hydrogen and oxygen isotope abundance suggested that the main extraction depths of maize for different treatments are both in 0 20 cm soil layer in jointing stage with rates at 69 73 for fr ck 56 62 for fr s 67 74 for fr sf 74 79 for fr f respectively fig 6 and 7 for 20 40 cm soil layer the soil water of fr s treatment showed a higher contribution to crop water with rates at 26 41 however very low ratio of contribution was observed in other treatments it was obvious that fa decreased water extraction by maize from soil due to the inhibitory effect of fa on transpiration from 40 100 cm soil layer the results of four treatments indicated low contribution ratios to crop water in heading stage the main extraction depths moved down to 20 40 cm soil layer and soil water contribution of fr ck fr sf fr f treatments to crop water were 66 71 57 70 57 80 respectively however the main extraction depths of maize for fr s treatment are 20 60 cm soil layer with contribution rates at 34 45 in 20 40 cm layer and 34 54 in 40 60 cm layer for soils in 0 20 cm layer and 60 100 cm layer ratios of soil water contributed to crop water were relatively low in grain filling stage the main extraction depths of maize moved up to 0 20 cm soil layer again with contribution rates at 48 63 for fr ck 30 48 for fr s 31 58 for fr sf 33 72 for fr f respectively fr s treatment indicated higher contribution rates in 20 40 cm layer due to sap applied in this layer to store water although fr sf was also applied with sap application of fa restricted water extraction from this soil layer from 40 to 100 cm soil layer water contribution rates were stationary distribution and low 5 4 the growth and yield of maize the growth and yield of maize are shown in table 7 compared to ck treatment the chemicals treatments significantly p 0 05 improved maize yield by 21 3 for fr sf 10 9 for fr f 8 6 for fr s the 100 grain weight was consistent with maize yield which further ensured the reliability of yield the rain fed maize field experiment just accept rainfall and no irrigation therefore maize yield could stands for wue due to the same rainfall was supplied into soil from this point of view the combined application of sap and fa significantly p 0 05 increased the rainfall wue of maize the grain number was increased but no significant difference was observed and the ear length was significantly p 0 05 decreased by fr f but no significant difference for other chemicals treatment for height and stem diameter the chemicals treatments showed improvement at a certain degree 6 discussions the soil water flow model was developed to describe patterns of water flow in different soil layers under multi chemicals application the first problem to be solved is to establish the suitable rwe source sink term because chemicals would change root growth and then affect rate of rwe zhou et al 2012 priya et al 2014 the results suggested that changing rule of drnm was better to coincide with rule of rwe under multi chemicals application similar results were also reported by wang et al 2012 and shi et al 2013 and they pointed out that the rwe source sink term established on drnm was highly effective in simulating the patterns of water extraction although many rwe source sink terms based on drl were established to obtain the desired results prasad 1988 li et al 2001 faria et al 2010 in this study obvious errors were found in rwe source sink term based on drl at 15 27 das fig 5 and the simulated values in 10 25 cm soil layer were obviously less than measured values with the application of fa the errors in 10 25 cm soil layer were decreased however the errors in 5 cm soil layer were increased we speculated that sap limited growth of root length in 15 27 das but as fa applied to maize and took combined effect with sap to increase root length at a certain degree so the rwe source sink term based on drl indicated an improvement in accuracy for simulating the rwe of maize it was generally accepted that the authenticity of rwe source sink term depends on accuracy in measurement of root growth index shi and zuo 2009 casaroli et al 2010 heinen 2014 hence the change of root length results in different simulation precision of rwe source sink term based on drl nevertheless a phenomenon worthy of attention was that errors in 5 cm increased with fa application it suggested that fa promoted the growth of root in 0 25 cm soil layer to negate the limitation effect of sap root growth the 5 cm soil layer was not applied with a sap therefore the root length was increased too much to result in errors of rwe source sink term based on drl for rwe source sink term based on drnm the drnm in 25 40 cm soil layers cannot be detected for less mass which would decrease the accuracy of simulated values in this study the prop roots were not considered in rwe source sink term that would cause errors in simulated values to quantify the water extraction by crops from different sources was hotspot issue with many disputes bleby et al 2010 kanonakata et al 2013 liu et al 2011b leitner et al 2014 in this research we found that the main water extraction depth decreased first then increased during growth period of maize and mainly concentrated in the shallow soil layers 0 20 cm soil layer for jointing stage 20 40 cm soil layer for heading stage 0 20 cm soil layer for grain filling stage it s similar to results got from asbjornsen et al 2007 and wang et al 2010 and they considered the maize utilized water primarily from shallow soil in 0 50 cm layers although some scholars also pointed out that rwe of maize may came from deeper soil kang and zhang 2004 li et al 2011 it was mostly related to the difference of irrigation modes and distribution of roots which had been fully discussed in previous reports jara and stockle 1999 amato and ritchie 2002 wu et al 2016 in addition the results suggested that different chemicals treatments lead to variety of water supply ratios fig 2 sap made obvious effect on sap treated soil layers to improve moisture content and fa further increased contribution ratio of soil water to crop water in sap treated soil layers compared to single chemical application the use of multi chemicals brought a better effect to improve wue table 5 which was same as the previous studies reported by han et al 2005 and liu et al 2011a we got contribution ratios of soil water to crop water during different growth periods of maize though the regulating mechanism was needed to be explored to further explain rule of water transport from soil into crop under multi chemicals application 7 conclusions two rwe source sink term based on drl and drnm respectively were established to describe the rate of rwe under multi chemicals application the results suggested that the values simulated by the rwe source sink term based on drnm were closer to the measured values then a specific soil water flow model was further developed to simulate patterns of water flow in different soil layers and the accuracy of the developed model was verified on the field scale a good simulating result was observed that the average values of rmse mae ore were 1 14 10 2 2 08 10 2 2 85 respectively it indicated the developed model was suitable for describing water flow in different soil layers under multi chemicals application in addition multi chemicals significantly improved moisture content in sap treated soil layers 10 30 cm the main depth of water extraction for maize decreased first and then increased and mainly concentrated in the shallow soil layers 0 20 cm soil layer for jointing stage 20 40 cm soil layer for heading stage 0 20 cm soil layer for grain filling stage after multi chemicals applied to soil maize system the characteristic of water extraction for maize was changed to affect water flow in different soil layers an inspiriting result demonstrated that sap increased soil moisture in sap treated soil layer by storing water and fa further improved the utilization of maize to the stored water thus application of sap and fa played a synergistic role in promoting rainfall wue of maize

11469,the purpose of this paper is to review and represent the knowledge that has been gained in irrigation system performance evaluation this article is based on the literature that is concerned with concepts framework and methodologies applied to the assessment and evaluation of irrigation projects and their performance the development of irrigation performance evaluation concepts was represented and different frameworks were discussed in order to assess and evaluate irrigation performance several methods were developed and used the main methods used to evaluate irrigation system performance are the fuzzy set theory direct measurements for indicators analysis hierarchy process ahp and remote sensing rs all these methods were identified and discussed as for the criteria proposed in the literature although they offer a wide range of choices for characterizing all aspects of performance evaluation however still there is no agreed approach that could be offered to assess the performance of different irrigation systems it could be concluded that the selection of the evaluation framework and method largely depends on the nature of irrigation system and the purpose of evaluation keywords irrigation performance evaluation assessment indicators 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is of major importance in many countries all over the world it is important in terms of food security public development and settlement for rural people as world population growths significantly the need for more effective and efficient use of land and water resources is increasing fao 2017 despite their potential for agricultural growth there is a remarkable decrease in the performance of several irrigation projects especially large scale systems which usually perform far below their potential capacity alcon et al 2017 bos et al 2005 dejen 2015 murray rust and snellen 1993 this is mainly due to the poor resources management absence of the planned benefits and the negative health and environmental impacts biswas 1990 this situation has resulted in an increase of interventions directed to improve irrigation projects performance many studies were conducted to investigate the performance assessment and diagnosis in irrigation systems from worldwide regions asia africa europe and south america these studies cover several irrigation projects all over the world in the developed and developing countries e g china india spain sudan etc bouml et al 2009 gorantiwar et al 2005 molden et al 1998 murray rust and snellen 1993 the purpose of performance assessment is to achieve efficient and effective use of resources by providing relevant feedback to the management at all levels bos et al 2005 small and svendsen 1992 moreover it helps with obtaining useful information in order that corrective actions may be taken to maximize the benefits of the irrigation project the performance evaluation also could help with verifying the relevant project lessons learned and developing benchmarks to improve planning implementation and management of similar projects bastiaanssen and bos 1999 bos 1997 it worth mention that the performance evaluation assists in improving the performance of irrigation systems and there are many case studies show how evaluation process helped in enhancing and developing the performance of irrigation projects peopc 2010 the process of performance evaluation is complex since a large number of regular tasks must be performed both concurrently and sequentially and these tasks should be coordinated within available resources constraints biswas 1990 small and svendsen 1992 in order to enhance this process many efforts have been assigned to evaluate the effects of such interventions or to enhance understanding of performance so that further improvement might be introduced alcon et al 2017 bos et al 2005 small and svendsen 1992 sun et al 2017 much has been written including theories methodologies and frameworks related to irrigation performance assessment it is time to review and evaluate what has been written in order to provide better understanding and enabling practitioners to select and apply suitable evaluation procedures that fit their needs the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the empirical literature on different approaches and methodologies applied to irrigation performance evaluation furthermore it provides concluding remarks that represent the strengths and limitations of different performance assessment methods this will provide a guideline to select the appropriate method for a variety of irrigation professionals including scheme managers researchers and consultant agencies 2 methodology a comprehensive review was carried out of empirical literature on the theories and methodologies applied to irrigation performance evaluation up to 2017 more than 70 studies were identified for the literature review that mainly based on published researches including manuscripts from academic journals in addition to some researches presented in books ph d thesis and international agencies reports these studies were categorized into three groups table 1 the first one focus on the concepts and theories related to irrigation performance evaluation the second group is mainly concentrated on the framework and evaluation process the last group is related to the methods tools and techniques applied by different researchers 3 historical review 3 1 the irrigation performance definition there are numerous definitions of irrigation performance referred to by different authors chambers 1976 and lenton 1983 described irrigation performance as knowing the extent to which an irrigation scheme achieved established objectives using the same concept abernethy 1989 stated that the objectives are measured with one or several parameters which are chosen as indicators of the system s goals instead of focusing on the objectives a more general concept for performance developed by small and svendsen 1992 to include the whole system activities including acquisition of inputs and the transformation of inputs into intermediate and final outputs in addition to the effects of these activities on the system itself and on the outside environment considering the concept of strategic management developed by ansoff 1980 murray rust and snellen 1993 defined the system performance as the degree to which an organization s products and services respond to the needs of their customers or users and the efficiency with which the organization uses the available resources this definition considers two type of performance strategic performance and operational performance this definition include all the above definitions since the strategic performance deals with objectives and goals abernethy 1989 chambers 1976 lenton 1983 while operational performance deals with the processes and resources small and svendsen 1992 while discussing and reviewing different methodologies for assessing the performance of irrigation schemes bos et al 2005 concluded that the performance assessment is related to the activities that support all the actions during and after the planning and implementation processes similarly gorantiwar and smout 2005 introduced a detailed definition to describe irrigation scheme performance as the extent to which land and water resources allocated and distributed for users in planning and operation stages to achieve the objectives of the irrigation scheme in total the irrigation performance assessment includes different levels starting from strategic goals through operation process and ending with customer satisfaction with outputs this can be described as an indicator for resources management of the irrigation schemes by measuring this indicator irrigation systems efficiency and sustainability can be observed and monitored through different levels 3 2 the performance evaluation characteristics since the late 1970 s the focus of research in irrigation management moved from the conventional diagnosis which concentrates on the farm level system towards adopting a whole system approach elawad 1991 several workers have developed or advocated various forms of evaluation criteria for irrigation system however in choosing their criteria different approaches have been adopted chambers 1976 states that two steps should be considered in the irrigation system evaluation process first step is to identify the objectives of the irrigation system and then select criteria and indicators which reflect the degree of achievements compared with the set objectives lenton 1983 addressed the performance of large scale irrigation systems which may be serving several thousands of users the criteria which reflect the level of achievement in the objectives require unmanageable volumes of data bhuiyan 1982 discussed the different methodologies for evaluation field research to improve irrigation system performance a different approach concentrating on a single key phenomenon and using it as an index to reflect the overall health of the irrigation system performance the idea is that such an index could easily be measured such approach was adopted by for example malhotra et al 1984 seckler et al 1988 they concluded that for continuous monitoring of large irrigation systems a single approximate indicator of the performance should be adopted several other workers adopted a more comprehensive approach by decomposing the irrigation system into subsystems that reflect the performance at different parts of the irrigation system biswas 1990 bottrall and mundial 1981 bouml et al 2009 garces 1983 gorantiwar and smout 2005 johnston et al 1991 zhi 1989 the analytic hierarchy process ahp used as a tool for irrigation project improvement and help to establish index system of agricultural water management performance alphonce 1997 sun et al 2017 an additional different approach developed by small and svendsen 1992 identified four different types performance assessment on which are linked to the assessment purpose 1 operational performance 2 accountability performance 3 intervention assessment and 4 sustainability performance bos et al 2005 introduced additional type as diagnostic analysis of performance the members of the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid have developed guidelines for irrigation systems performance evaluation bos et al 2005 considerable effort was done to provide a detailed information about the types and nature of indicators used to assess and evaluate irrigation system they provided guidance on the selection of performance indicators and outline procedures that can be used to identify and relieve performance constraints within the irrigation system to sum up the literature on irrigation systems performance criteria reviewed above indicates the multi concepts and different approaches used for the irrigation systems performance evaluation as for the criteria proposed in the literature although they offer a wide range of choice for characterizing all aspects of the performance however still there is no agreed approach that offered to assess and evaluate irrigation system performance 4 framework to evaluate irrigation system performance the framework helps to explain why the performance assessment is needed what data are required what methods of analysis will be used who will use the information provided etc without a suitable framework the performance assessment program may fail to collect all the necessary data and may not provide the required information and understanding bos et al 2005 such a framework must specify clearly both what is being assessed and the concepts of performance that underlie the assessment small and svendsen 1992 moreover the framework has to be capable of allowing assessment of individual systems and permit comparisons with other systems lacking such a framework and its associated set of indicators performance assessment remains a subjective process that has little value for improving irrigation management murray rust and snellen 1993 4 1 the nested systems framework the early form of irrigation system performance framework was developed by small and svendsen 1992 on which irrigation system can be considered to be a subsystem nested within a larger set of agro economic socioeconomic and politico economic systems fig 1 the final output from the irrigation system serves as an input into an irrigated agriculture system likewise the output of this system e g agricultural productivity is an input into a broader agricultural economic system the output of this system e g increased incomes represents an input into a still broader rural economic system whose output in turn is an input into the national development this approach mainly emphasizing irrigation performance framework boundaries which requires not only a clear definition of irrigation system but also the specification of the external boundaries that will be used for the assessment in this context each sub system performance depends on the degree to which lower system attains the goals that have been established for 4 2 evaluation process framework this type of framework aimed to develop the internal process boundary that indicates the types of questions and issues needed to be addressed in assessing causes of good and bad performance the detailed process was described by murray rust and snellen 1993 and with this framework managers at different levels are now better equipped to consider the types of indicators they can use in the performance assessment process a basic characteristic of the framework is that information on outputs from the system is not used as the end result but as the first step in system management assessment the first step in the diagnosis framework presented in fig 2 is to check whether appropriate data exist or not it is essential that data collection be undertaken openly and objectively if a realistic performance assessment is required assuming data exist then the diagnosis can proceed to assess whether the defined targets would actually meet the objectives there is a clear analytical assessment made of whether the outputs are the same as those intended during the planning stage simply if the desired targets and objectives were achieved then the analysis of performance is concerned with whether the objectives were ambitious enough or whether they could have been accomplished with better efficiency 4 3 diagnosis framework this is a generic framework developed by bos et al 2005 this framework illustrates planning and implementing processes for performance assessment programs the framework is based on four phases and sequence questions the first level focus on the broad scope of the performance assessment when the scope issues are decided the performance assessment program can be designed by choosing suitable criteria for the performance assessment and identify the data that will be used in measuring performance indicators the planned program implementation will start with data being collected processed analyzed and evaluated at the final stage of the program it is time to act based on the information delivered with a variety of actions possible ranging from changes organization goals to improvements in daily procedures for the system operation and maintenance to sum up performance evaluation framework is viewed as having two dimensions i the external framework which describe the interaction with outside environment and primarily concern with water delivery and agricultural output and strategic performance that addresses issues of how well decisions are made ii the internal framework which specify a set of relevant processes on a cycle of objective setting planning operation monitoring and control of the management processes and objectives although the processes were offered without detailed procedures of how to measure indicators several efforts have been done to develop different methods for indicators measurements these methods are represented in the next section 5 tools and techniques used for irrigation evaluation 5 1 direct measurements for indicators irrigation performance indicators have been introduced to describe the behavior of irrigation schemes by means of a few and understandable numbers bos and nugteren 1990 in classifying irrigation performance measures early workers abernethy 1989 1985 1984 bos 1979 bottrall and mundial 1981 chambers 1980 lenton 1983 proposed a limited range of empirical indicators to be used at performance evaluation which include productivity equity utility cost effectiveness and sustainability these indicators mainly focus on measuring performance for direct irrigation water elements later on bos 1997 and bos et al 1993 introduced additional indicators which cover a various range of irrigation management aspects on his study bos 1997 proposed a set of 40 indicators that cover water efficiency maintenance environmental sustainability socio economic and management indicators furthermore the international water management institute iwmi published and reviewed a set of 9 indicators of irrigation performance molden et al 1998 the majority of these indicators relate outputs from irrigated agriculture to the major inputs of water land and finance the members of icid provided a detailed information about the types and nature of indicators used to assess and evaluate irrigation system bos et al 2005 they provided a set of 77 indicators categorized into four groups water balance environment economics and emerging indicators they concluded that since performance is assessed from different perspectives indicators from each group should be combined in the assessment process 5 1 1 technical aspects of direct measurements for indicators the indicators can be classified into two groups as follow 1 quantitative indicators this type of indicators tell us whether the activities and actions are actually happening as planned molden et al 1998 quantitative factors can always be expressed as a number represents the progress value how many and how far these indicators are measured as follow x y z where x performance indicator value y measured value of the indicator z base value that could be either targets or related acceptable ranges 1 qualitative indicators qualitative indicators are non numerical factors for determining the level of progress towards a specific goal small and svendsen 1992 these indicators are expressed as either independent measurement such as good better and best or relative terms such as slightly moderately very and extremely murray rust and snellen 1993 there are many case studies have been reported in the literature to demonstrate how performance indicators can be applied to describe actual irrigation practices many authors have recommended indicators to measure irrigation system performance and have given examples of their use at particular irrigation system garces 1983 evaluated the performance of the rice irrigation systems in the philippines zhi 1989 assessed the effect of a rehabilitation program undertaken in irrigation systems in china in his study facon 2001 evaluated the performance of makhamtao uthong project in thailand with a rapid appraisal procedure rap using a field questionnaire to compute internal and external performance indicators gorantiwar and smout 2005 studied the performance of irrigation water management during the area and water allocation with a case study of an irrigation scheme in the semi arid region of india bouml et al 2009 assessed the performance of irrigation water management of the bursa karacabey irrigation scheme kis in turkey using two physical and three financial performance indicators during the period 2002 2007 in his ph d research dejen 2015 evaluated the hydraulic and water delivery performance of two large scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia another group of workers used to apply a cross system comparisons or analyses seckler et al 1988 developed a statistical index system for measuring the performance of irrigation projects the index was applied to a sample of 39 farms on a watercourse for irrigation management in india analysis of strategic and operational performance was conducted by murray rust and snellen 1993 using information from 15 different case studies where there was reasonably reliable information on water delivery performance molden et al 1998 applied nine indicators as means of comparing performance across 18 irrigation systems ararso et al 2009 studied different scenarios of irrigation performance development to improve food production in the sub sahara africa at six sample countries cameroon the democratic republic of the congo ethiopia nigeria sudan and south africa in this context it could be concluded that the selection of performance indicators for irrigation systems depends on boundary conditions and evaluation purpose for continue evaluation as seasonal or annual monitoring process the data required must be manageable and preferably use the type of data routinely available bos et al 2005 furthermore there is a various opinion of including a huge amount of indicators that will give accurate results and others who prefer to use a limited number of indicators in order to make it easier to collect and manage the data 5 2 fuzzy set theory application for irrigation evaluation the fuzzy set theory was developed by zadeh 1978 1965 to deal with situations include a wide range of domains on which information is incomplete imprecise or related to fuzziness the use of the fuzzy theory is also associated with the cases of uncertainty hairiness and irrigation management is one of those cases where the theory concept could be applied elawad 1991 gao 1994 5 2 1 technical aspects of fuzzy theory while in the classical set theory the degree of membership of an element in a set is either 0 or 1 which means an element either belongs or does not belong however in a fuzzy set the degree of membership of an element is designated by its support membership function ranging over the real range span from 0 to 1 dejen 2015 elawad 1991 a fuzzy set a in a set of objects x is characterized by a membership function a x which associates with each point in x a real number in the interval 0 1 with the value at x representing the grade of membership in a zadeh 1978 1965 let x be a set of objects denoted generically by x a fuzzy set a in x is defined as a x μ x where μ x is a membership of support function for example the fuzzy set a for x 1 to 5 is represented as a 1 μ 1 2 μ 2 3 μ 3 4 μ 4 5 μ 5 where μ 1 to μ 5 are support functions of the respective variables of the fuzzy set for qualitative data description ghosh et al 2005 and sam amoah and gowing 2001 applied a universe of possibility range from 1 to 5 with different supports for linguistic expressions from very good high to very bad low however this is not suitable for use in comparing between different projects and decision making related to the improvement of a management system dejen 2015 it would be more convenient if the qualitative expression is converted to a numerical scale for the probability set one of the earliest studies that used the fuzzy theory in the evaluation of irrigation performance was conducted by elawad 1991 he developed the concept of farmer utility fu of an irrigation service which refers to the quality of the services with respect to water users this concept was applied and examined at gezira irrigation scheme sudan the same concept also applied by ghosh et al 2005 to evaluate the performance of irrigation based on the service utility assessment from farmers perspective the study was carried out in mahanadi delta irrigation project in the state of orissa india another study by sam amoah and gowing 2001 applied the fuzzy concept for analyzing the qualitative data of irrigation systems with responses of water users the study examines the systems where data on water delivery are not available or their integrity cannot be guaranteed it is possible to use farmers assessment to determine the effectiveness of the water delivery system this methodology was applied in dawhenya irrigation scheme in ghana additional studies were conducted later to improve and develop the application of fuzzy set theory for irrigation performance assessment gowing et al 1996 malano and gao 1992 montazar et al 2013 in this theory one may select different support functions to represent a particular expression with fuzziness ghosh et al 2005 stated that the choice of a support to represent a fuzzy linguistic expression may depend on the particular problem being taken into concern the fuzzy linguistic expressions and support functions are designated for all variable nevertheless the choice of the support functions needs to be rational gowing et al 1996 5 3 analysis hierarchy process ahp the analysis hierarchy process ahp is a multi criteria decision making technique developed by thomas saaty saaty 2008 2004 1977 which decomposes a complex problem into a hierarchy in which each level is composed of specific elements once the hierarchical model has been developed the weight factor of each element provides a measure of the relative importance of this element for the decision maker alphonce 1997 5 3 1 technical aspects of ahp method in the ahp the overall evaluation of a subject is broken down into main factors and arranged to a hierarchy each evaluation factor has other evaluation elements below to assess itself as the hierarchy level goes down saaty 2004 a comparison will be done for each two evaluation elements as a pair with respect to the contribution to the evaluation factor immediately above them the pairwise comparison is performed with a judgment scale offered by saaty 2008 1977 a research study conducted by okada et al 2008a b introduced improved numerical values as a result of monte carlo simulation which is found very robust in term of the rank reversal compared to saaty s scale table 2 in this method each pairwise comparison assigns a numerical value to the pair corresponding to the relative importance between the two elements after that the evaluated elements are ranked in the respective evaluation factor groups according to the assigned values weight assumed the objects are a1 an and their weights w1 wn to compute the weight factors w of n elements for a object in pairs according to their relative weights the input consists of comparing each pair of the elements okada et al 2008a b the pairwise comparisons may be represented by a matrix as follows a w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w n w 2 w 1 w 2 w 2 w 2 w n w n w 1 w n w 2 w n w n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n the reciprocal value of this comparison is placed in the position aij of a in order to preserve consistency of judgment for example using the 9 points scale shown in table 2 if element two was extremely important with respect to element one then a21 would be given a score of 9 or 1 64 0 if the converse was true element one was strongly favored over element two then a21 would be given the reciprocal score of 1 9 or 1 1 64 0 the pairwise comparison matrix is called a reciprocal matrix for these reasons alphonce 1997 saaty 1977 there are numerous studies have shown the potential and importance of ahp applied to irrigation project evaluation and there would be still options to improve the ahp model toward better evaluation of the irrigation project cao et al 2004 okada et al 2008a b saaty 2008 an algorithm using ahp was developed by karamouz et al 2002 to evaluate and observe pressurized irrigation projects in iran sun et al 2017 established evaluation index system for agricultural water management in irrigation districts by applying ahp concept to three typical irrigation districts in huang huai hai river basin in north china it could be concluded that the ahp provides a flexible and simple statistical method that can turn qualitative indicators to quantitative ones in order to make complex problems hierarchical and systematic saaty 1977 it is highly recommended to be applied at performance evaluation for irrigation organization since it provides deep analysis for the irrigation system 5 4 using remote sensing rs and geographic information systems gis techniques the geographic information systems gis and remote sensing rs techniques have become potential tools for assessing and evaluating irrigation systems performance remote sensing derived satellite images e g evapotranspiration maps can be merged with maps of the irrigation delivery systems to find the real time performance bastiaanssen and bos 1999 the remote sensing could be used to improve the diagnosis under data scarce situations and also provide the opportunity to study the crop growing factors at scales ranging from individual farms to large scale projects level bastiaanssen et al 2000 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 5 4 1 technical aspects of remote sensing method remote sensing management tools provide a system wide and spatially distributed information for the evaluation process according to ahmad et al 2009 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal is most common and powerful tool of remote sensing evapotranspiration algorithm that has been developed to solve on a pixel by pixel basis the energy balance components it is physically based on one layer sensible heat transfer scheme and an empirically based on soil heat flux and net radiation fraction used roerink et al 1997 sebal requires scanned spectral radiances in the visible near infrared and thermal infrared range to determine its constitutive parameters fig 3 fig 3 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal components and attributes roerink et al 1997 using this data evapotranspiration is then calculated from the latent heat flux and the daily averaged net radiation the latent heat flux is computed directly from the surface energy balance at satellite overpass on a pixel by pixel basis as follow λ e r n g 0 h where λe is the latent heat flux λ is the latent heat of vaporization and e is the actual evaporation r n is the net radiation g 0 is the soil heat flux and h is the sensible heat flux the latent heat flux describes the amount of energy consumed to maintain a certain evapotranspiration rate ahmad et al 2009 on the other hand the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is commonly used to determine the density of green cover on a patch of land unhealthy or sparse vegetation reflects more visible light and less near infrared light kogan 1997 wan et al 2004 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is computed as follow n d v i n r i r n r i r where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index nir is the near infra red radiation reflected by vegetation and r is visible radiation reflected by vegetation the ndvi generally ranges from 1 to 1 kogan 1997 one of the earliest studies using the remote sensing techniques was conducted by roerink et al 1997 to computed water efficiency for the rio tunuyan irrigation system argentina bastiaanssen and ali 2003 determined crop production in the indus basin pakistan using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa avhrr satellite images a similar approach applied by ahmad et al 2009 and hamid et al 2011 to use noaa avhrr satellite images for diagnosing irrigation performance of the rachna doab project in pakistan and the rahad scheme in sudan respectively another research using satellite images was conducted by bandara 2003 to assess the water productivity for three large irrigation systems in sri lanka bashir et al 2008 and santos et al 2008 estimated irrigation efficiency from the spatial seasonal actual evapotranspiration et and computed crop water requirement using satellite data and remote sensing zwart and leclert 2010 evaluated irrigation performance of the office du niger in mali by using remote sensing techniques mamad 2010 assessed of the land and water productivity at different spatial scales within the gezira scheme sudan using satellite data for the same scheme al zayed et al 2015 and thiruvarudchelvan 2010 used satellite images to calculate irrigation efficiency indicators to assess the irrigation performance remote sensing is a useful tool for water managers to assess where scarce water resources are wasted and where in a given region the water productivity can be improved zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 it could be said that the spatial information will play a vital role in the future of the irrigation system evaluation 5 5 summary of tools and techniques in order to measure and evaluate irrigation performance effectively it is very important to select the appropriate evaluation method in this study the main four methods of irrigation performance evaluation were identified and discussed these methods are direct measurements for indicators fuzzy set theory analysis hierarchy process ahp and remote sensing rs the advantages and disadvantages of each method in addition to the main references are summarized below in table 3 6 conclusion irrigation projects performance evaluation is critical and vital to ensure sustainability of irrigated agriculture the literature and previous studies have provided the conceptual framework for performance assessment of irrigation schemes as for the criteria proposed in the literature although they offer a wide range of choice for characterizing all aspects of the performance evaluation nevertheless still there is no agreed approach and framework that offered to assess and evaluate irrigation system performance in order to measure and evaluate irrigation performance several methods were developed and used in this review the main four methods of irrigation performance evaluation namely direct measurements for indicators fuzzy set theory analysis hierarchy process ahp and remote sensing rs were identified and discussed it could be concluded that the selection of the evaluation method largely depends on the nature of irrigation system and the purpose of the evaluation 7 recommendation for future work in spite the fact that the literature above covers a wide range of topics related to irrigation performance evaluation however there is certainly need to conduct more research for further improvement and development so as to achieve this three topics need to be considered for further research the purpose of the first is to develop the eternal analytical framework that covers the whole components of the irrigation system considering the common factors in the different systems so it could be applied at different irrigation environments this is generally necessary for developing effective role for assisting in irrigation projects evaluation the second topic for research is concerned with improving the evaluation indicators through further revision and refinement these studies are about the development of detailed indices for particular issues of uncertainty qualitative indicators on which appear to require in depth studies of its own finally the third topic concerns with the development of software models that make it easy to analyze the massive amount of data in the evaluation process especially if the evaluation procedures are related to large scale irrigation projects these topics are generally necessary for developing more effective administrative for managing and supervising irrigation projects of any kind acknowledgement this paper is part of a study supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 51579070 
11469,the purpose of this paper is to review and represent the knowledge that has been gained in irrigation system performance evaluation this article is based on the literature that is concerned with concepts framework and methodologies applied to the assessment and evaluation of irrigation projects and their performance the development of irrigation performance evaluation concepts was represented and different frameworks were discussed in order to assess and evaluate irrigation performance several methods were developed and used the main methods used to evaluate irrigation system performance are the fuzzy set theory direct measurements for indicators analysis hierarchy process ahp and remote sensing rs all these methods were identified and discussed as for the criteria proposed in the literature although they offer a wide range of choices for characterizing all aspects of performance evaluation however still there is no agreed approach that could be offered to assess the performance of different irrigation systems it could be concluded that the selection of the evaluation framework and method largely depends on the nature of irrigation system and the purpose of evaluation keywords irrigation performance evaluation assessment indicators 1 introduction irrigated agriculture is of major importance in many countries all over the world it is important in terms of food security public development and settlement for rural people as world population growths significantly the need for more effective and efficient use of land and water resources is increasing fao 2017 despite their potential for agricultural growth there is a remarkable decrease in the performance of several irrigation projects especially large scale systems which usually perform far below their potential capacity alcon et al 2017 bos et al 2005 dejen 2015 murray rust and snellen 1993 this is mainly due to the poor resources management absence of the planned benefits and the negative health and environmental impacts biswas 1990 this situation has resulted in an increase of interventions directed to improve irrigation projects performance many studies were conducted to investigate the performance assessment and diagnosis in irrigation systems from worldwide regions asia africa europe and south america these studies cover several irrigation projects all over the world in the developed and developing countries e g china india spain sudan etc bouml et al 2009 gorantiwar et al 2005 molden et al 1998 murray rust and snellen 1993 the purpose of performance assessment is to achieve efficient and effective use of resources by providing relevant feedback to the management at all levels bos et al 2005 small and svendsen 1992 moreover it helps with obtaining useful information in order that corrective actions may be taken to maximize the benefits of the irrigation project the performance evaluation also could help with verifying the relevant project lessons learned and developing benchmarks to improve planning implementation and management of similar projects bastiaanssen and bos 1999 bos 1997 it worth mention that the performance evaluation assists in improving the performance of irrigation systems and there are many case studies show how evaluation process helped in enhancing and developing the performance of irrigation projects peopc 2010 the process of performance evaluation is complex since a large number of regular tasks must be performed both concurrently and sequentially and these tasks should be coordinated within available resources constraints biswas 1990 small and svendsen 1992 in order to enhance this process many efforts have been assigned to evaluate the effects of such interventions or to enhance understanding of performance so that further improvement might be introduced alcon et al 2017 bos et al 2005 small and svendsen 1992 sun et al 2017 much has been written including theories methodologies and frameworks related to irrigation performance assessment it is time to review and evaluate what has been written in order to provide better understanding and enabling practitioners to select and apply suitable evaluation procedures that fit their needs the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the empirical literature on different approaches and methodologies applied to irrigation performance evaluation furthermore it provides concluding remarks that represent the strengths and limitations of different performance assessment methods this will provide a guideline to select the appropriate method for a variety of irrigation professionals including scheme managers researchers and consultant agencies 2 methodology a comprehensive review was carried out of empirical literature on the theories and methodologies applied to irrigation performance evaluation up to 2017 more than 70 studies were identified for the literature review that mainly based on published researches including manuscripts from academic journals in addition to some researches presented in books ph d thesis and international agencies reports these studies were categorized into three groups table 1 the first one focus on the concepts and theories related to irrigation performance evaluation the second group is mainly concentrated on the framework and evaluation process the last group is related to the methods tools and techniques applied by different researchers 3 historical review 3 1 the irrigation performance definition there are numerous definitions of irrigation performance referred to by different authors chambers 1976 and lenton 1983 described irrigation performance as knowing the extent to which an irrigation scheme achieved established objectives using the same concept abernethy 1989 stated that the objectives are measured with one or several parameters which are chosen as indicators of the system s goals instead of focusing on the objectives a more general concept for performance developed by small and svendsen 1992 to include the whole system activities including acquisition of inputs and the transformation of inputs into intermediate and final outputs in addition to the effects of these activities on the system itself and on the outside environment considering the concept of strategic management developed by ansoff 1980 murray rust and snellen 1993 defined the system performance as the degree to which an organization s products and services respond to the needs of their customers or users and the efficiency with which the organization uses the available resources this definition considers two type of performance strategic performance and operational performance this definition include all the above definitions since the strategic performance deals with objectives and goals abernethy 1989 chambers 1976 lenton 1983 while operational performance deals with the processes and resources small and svendsen 1992 while discussing and reviewing different methodologies for assessing the performance of irrigation schemes bos et al 2005 concluded that the performance assessment is related to the activities that support all the actions during and after the planning and implementation processes similarly gorantiwar and smout 2005 introduced a detailed definition to describe irrigation scheme performance as the extent to which land and water resources allocated and distributed for users in planning and operation stages to achieve the objectives of the irrigation scheme in total the irrigation performance assessment includes different levels starting from strategic goals through operation process and ending with customer satisfaction with outputs this can be described as an indicator for resources management of the irrigation schemes by measuring this indicator irrigation systems efficiency and sustainability can be observed and monitored through different levels 3 2 the performance evaluation characteristics since the late 1970 s the focus of research in irrigation management moved from the conventional diagnosis which concentrates on the farm level system towards adopting a whole system approach elawad 1991 several workers have developed or advocated various forms of evaluation criteria for irrigation system however in choosing their criteria different approaches have been adopted chambers 1976 states that two steps should be considered in the irrigation system evaluation process first step is to identify the objectives of the irrigation system and then select criteria and indicators which reflect the degree of achievements compared with the set objectives lenton 1983 addressed the performance of large scale irrigation systems which may be serving several thousands of users the criteria which reflect the level of achievement in the objectives require unmanageable volumes of data bhuiyan 1982 discussed the different methodologies for evaluation field research to improve irrigation system performance a different approach concentrating on a single key phenomenon and using it as an index to reflect the overall health of the irrigation system performance the idea is that such an index could easily be measured such approach was adopted by for example malhotra et al 1984 seckler et al 1988 they concluded that for continuous monitoring of large irrigation systems a single approximate indicator of the performance should be adopted several other workers adopted a more comprehensive approach by decomposing the irrigation system into subsystems that reflect the performance at different parts of the irrigation system biswas 1990 bottrall and mundial 1981 bouml et al 2009 garces 1983 gorantiwar and smout 2005 johnston et al 1991 zhi 1989 the analytic hierarchy process ahp used as a tool for irrigation project improvement and help to establish index system of agricultural water management performance alphonce 1997 sun et al 2017 an additional different approach developed by small and svendsen 1992 identified four different types performance assessment on which are linked to the assessment purpose 1 operational performance 2 accountability performance 3 intervention assessment and 4 sustainability performance bos et al 2005 introduced additional type as diagnostic analysis of performance the members of the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid have developed guidelines for irrigation systems performance evaluation bos et al 2005 considerable effort was done to provide a detailed information about the types and nature of indicators used to assess and evaluate irrigation system they provided guidance on the selection of performance indicators and outline procedures that can be used to identify and relieve performance constraints within the irrigation system to sum up the literature on irrigation systems performance criteria reviewed above indicates the multi concepts and different approaches used for the irrigation systems performance evaluation as for the criteria proposed in the literature although they offer a wide range of choice for characterizing all aspects of the performance however still there is no agreed approach that offered to assess and evaluate irrigation system performance 4 framework to evaluate irrigation system performance the framework helps to explain why the performance assessment is needed what data are required what methods of analysis will be used who will use the information provided etc without a suitable framework the performance assessment program may fail to collect all the necessary data and may not provide the required information and understanding bos et al 2005 such a framework must specify clearly both what is being assessed and the concepts of performance that underlie the assessment small and svendsen 1992 moreover the framework has to be capable of allowing assessment of individual systems and permit comparisons with other systems lacking such a framework and its associated set of indicators performance assessment remains a subjective process that has little value for improving irrigation management murray rust and snellen 1993 4 1 the nested systems framework the early form of irrigation system performance framework was developed by small and svendsen 1992 on which irrigation system can be considered to be a subsystem nested within a larger set of agro economic socioeconomic and politico economic systems fig 1 the final output from the irrigation system serves as an input into an irrigated agriculture system likewise the output of this system e g agricultural productivity is an input into a broader agricultural economic system the output of this system e g increased incomes represents an input into a still broader rural economic system whose output in turn is an input into the national development this approach mainly emphasizing irrigation performance framework boundaries which requires not only a clear definition of irrigation system but also the specification of the external boundaries that will be used for the assessment in this context each sub system performance depends on the degree to which lower system attains the goals that have been established for 4 2 evaluation process framework this type of framework aimed to develop the internal process boundary that indicates the types of questions and issues needed to be addressed in assessing causes of good and bad performance the detailed process was described by murray rust and snellen 1993 and with this framework managers at different levels are now better equipped to consider the types of indicators they can use in the performance assessment process a basic characteristic of the framework is that information on outputs from the system is not used as the end result but as the first step in system management assessment the first step in the diagnosis framework presented in fig 2 is to check whether appropriate data exist or not it is essential that data collection be undertaken openly and objectively if a realistic performance assessment is required assuming data exist then the diagnosis can proceed to assess whether the defined targets would actually meet the objectives there is a clear analytical assessment made of whether the outputs are the same as those intended during the planning stage simply if the desired targets and objectives were achieved then the analysis of performance is concerned with whether the objectives were ambitious enough or whether they could have been accomplished with better efficiency 4 3 diagnosis framework this is a generic framework developed by bos et al 2005 this framework illustrates planning and implementing processes for performance assessment programs the framework is based on four phases and sequence questions the first level focus on the broad scope of the performance assessment when the scope issues are decided the performance assessment program can be designed by choosing suitable criteria for the performance assessment and identify the data that will be used in measuring performance indicators the planned program implementation will start with data being collected processed analyzed and evaluated at the final stage of the program it is time to act based on the information delivered with a variety of actions possible ranging from changes organization goals to improvements in daily procedures for the system operation and maintenance to sum up performance evaluation framework is viewed as having two dimensions i the external framework which describe the interaction with outside environment and primarily concern with water delivery and agricultural output and strategic performance that addresses issues of how well decisions are made ii the internal framework which specify a set of relevant processes on a cycle of objective setting planning operation monitoring and control of the management processes and objectives although the processes were offered without detailed procedures of how to measure indicators several efforts have been done to develop different methods for indicators measurements these methods are represented in the next section 5 tools and techniques used for irrigation evaluation 5 1 direct measurements for indicators irrigation performance indicators have been introduced to describe the behavior of irrigation schemes by means of a few and understandable numbers bos and nugteren 1990 in classifying irrigation performance measures early workers abernethy 1989 1985 1984 bos 1979 bottrall and mundial 1981 chambers 1980 lenton 1983 proposed a limited range of empirical indicators to be used at performance evaluation which include productivity equity utility cost effectiveness and sustainability these indicators mainly focus on measuring performance for direct irrigation water elements later on bos 1997 and bos et al 1993 introduced additional indicators which cover a various range of irrigation management aspects on his study bos 1997 proposed a set of 40 indicators that cover water efficiency maintenance environmental sustainability socio economic and management indicators furthermore the international water management institute iwmi published and reviewed a set of 9 indicators of irrigation performance molden et al 1998 the majority of these indicators relate outputs from irrigated agriculture to the major inputs of water land and finance the members of icid provided a detailed information about the types and nature of indicators used to assess and evaluate irrigation system bos et al 2005 they provided a set of 77 indicators categorized into four groups water balance environment economics and emerging indicators they concluded that since performance is assessed from different perspectives indicators from each group should be combined in the assessment process 5 1 1 technical aspects of direct measurements for indicators the indicators can be classified into two groups as follow 1 quantitative indicators this type of indicators tell us whether the activities and actions are actually happening as planned molden et al 1998 quantitative factors can always be expressed as a number represents the progress value how many and how far these indicators are measured as follow x y z where x performance indicator value y measured value of the indicator z base value that could be either targets or related acceptable ranges 1 qualitative indicators qualitative indicators are non numerical factors for determining the level of progress towards a specific goal small and svendsen 1992 these indicators are expressed as either independent measurement such as good better and best or relative terms such as slightly moderately very and extremely murray rust and snellen 1993 there are many case studies have been reported in the literature to demonstrate how performance indicators can be applied to describe actual irrigation practices many authors have recommended indicators to measure irrigation system performance and have given examples of their use at particular irrigation system garces 1983 evaluated the performance of the rice irrigation systems in the philippines zhi 1989 assessed the effect of a rehabilitation program undertaken in irrigation systems in china in his study facon 2001 evaluated the performance of makhamtao uthong project in thailand with a rapid appraisal procedure rap using a field questionnaire to compute internal and external performance indicators gorantiwar and smout 2005 studied the performance of irrigation water management during the area and water allocation with a case study of an irrigation scheme in the semi arid region of india bouml et al 2009 assessed the performance of irrigation water management of the bursa karacabey irrigation scheme kis in turkey using two physical and three financial performance indicators during the period 2002 2007 in his ph d research dejen 2015 evaluated the hydraulic and water delivery performance of two large scale irrigation schemes in ethiopia another group of workers used to apply a cross system comparisons or analyses seckler et al 1988 developed a statistical index system for measuring the performance of irrigation projects the index was applied to a sample of 39 farms on a watercourse for irrigation management in india analysis of strategic and operational performance was conducted by murray rust and snellen 1993 using information from 15 different case studies where there was reasonably reliable information on water delivery performance molden et al 1998 applied nine indicators as means of comparing performance across 18 irrigation systems ararso et al 2009 studied different scenarios of irrigation performance development to improve food production in the sub sahara africa at six sample countries cameroon the democratic republic of the congo ethiopia nigeria sudan and south africa in this context it could be concluded that the selection of performance indicators for irrigation systems depends on boundary conditions and evaluation purpose for continue evaluation as seasonal or annual monitoring process the data required must be manageable and preferably use the type of data routinely available bos et al 2005 furthermore there is a various opinion of including a huge amount of indicators that will give accurate results and others who prefer to use a limited number of indicators in order to make it easier to collect and manage the data 5 2 fuzzy set theory application for irrigation evaluation the fuzzy set theory was developed by zadeh 1978 1965 to deal with situations include a wide range of domains on which information is incomplete imprecise or related to fuzziness the use of the fuzzy theory is also associated with the cases of uncertainty hairiness and irrigation management is one of those cases where the theory concept could be applied elawad 1991 gao 1994 5 2 1 technical aspects of fuzzy theory while in the classical set theory the degree of membership of an element in a set is either 0 or 1 which means an element either belongs or does not belong however in a fuzzy set the degree of membership of an element is designated by its support membership function ranging over the real range span from 0 to 1 dejen 2015 elawad 1991 a fuzzy set a in a set of objects x is characterized by a membership function a x which associates with each point in x a real number in the interval 0 1 with the value at x representing the grade of membership in a zadeh 1978 1965 let x be a set of objects denoted generically by x a fuzzy set a in x is defined as a x μ x where μ x is a membership of support function for example the fuzzy set a for x 1 to 5 is represented as a 1 μ 1 2 μ 2 3 μ 3 4 μ 4 5 μ 5 where μ 1 to μ 5 are support functions of the respective variables of the fuzzy set for qualitative data description ghosh et al 2005 and sam amoah and gowing 2001 applied a universe of possibility range from 1 to 5 with different supports for linguistic expressions from very good high to very bad low however this is not suitable for use in comparing between different projects and decision making related to the improvement of a management system dejen 2015 it would be more convenient if the qualitative expression is converted to a numerical scale for the probability set one of the earliest studies that used the fuzzy theory in the evaluation of irrigation performance was conducted by elawad 1991 he developed the concept of farmer utility fu of an irrigation service which refers to the quality of the services with respect to water users this concept was applied and examined at gezira irrigation scheme sudan the same concept also applied by ghosh et al 2005 to evaluate the performance of irrigation based on the service utility assessment from farmers perspective the study was carried out in mahanadi delta irrigation project in the state of orissa india another study by sam amoah and gowing 2001 applied the fuzzy concept for analyzing the qualitative data of irrigation systems with responses of water users the study examines the systems where data on water delivery are not available or their integrity cannot be guaranteed it is possible to use farmers assessment to determine the effectiveness of the water delivery system this methodology was applied in dawhenya irrigation scheme in ghana additional studies were conducted later to improve and develop the application of fuzzy set theory for irrigation performance assessment gowing et al 1996 malano and gao 1992 montazar et al 2013 in this theory one may select different support functions to represent a particular expression with fuzziness ghosh et al 2005 stated that the choice of a support to represent a fuzzy linguistic expression may depend on the particular problem being taken into concern the fuzzy linguistic expressions and support functions are designated for all variable nevertheless the choice of the support functions needs to be rational gowing et al 1996 5 3 analysis hierarchy process ahp the analysis hierarchy process ahp is a multi criteria decision making technique developed by thomas saaty saaty 2008 2004 1977 which decomposes a complex problem into a hierarchy in which each level is composed of specific elements once the hierarchical model has been developed the weight factor of each element provides a measure of the relative importance of this element for the decision maker alphonce 1997 5 3 1 technical aspects of ahp method in the ahp the overall evaluation of a subject is broken down into main factors and arranged to a hierarchy each evaluation factor has other evaluation elements below to assess itself as the hierarchy level goes down saaty 2004 a comparison will be done for each two evaluation elements as a pair with respect to the contribution to the evaluation factor immediately above them the pairwise comparison is performed with a judgment scale offered by saaty 2008 1977 a research study conducted by okada et al 2008a b introduced improved numerical values as a result of monte carlo simulation which is found very robust in term of the rank reversal compared to saaty s scale table 2 in this method each pairwise comparison assigns a numerical value to the pair corresponding to the relative importance between the two elements after that the evaluated elements are ranked in the respective evaluation factor groups according to the assigned values weight assumed the objects are a1 an and their weights w1 wn to compute the weight factors w of n elements for a object in pairs according to their relative weights the input consists of comparing each pair of the elements okada et al 2008a b the pairwise comparisons may be represented by a matrix as follows a w 1 w 1 w 1 w 2 w 1 w n w 2 w 1 w 2 w 2 w 2 w n w n w 1 w n w 2 w n w n a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a n 1 a n 2 a n n the reciprocal value of this comparison is placed in the position aij of a in order to preserve consistency of judgment for example using the 9 points scale shown in table 2 if element two was extremely important with respect to element one then a21 would be given a score of 9 or 1 64 0 if the converse was true element one was strongly favored over element two then a21 would be given the reciprocal score of 1 9 or 1 1 64 0 the pairwise comparison matrix is called a reciprocal matrix for these reasons alphonce 1997 saaty 1977 there are numerous studies have shown the potential and importance of ahp applied to irrigation project evaluation and there would be still options to improve the ahp model toward better evaluation of the irrigation project cao et al 2004 okada et al 2008a b saaty 2008 an algorithm using ahp was developed by karamouz et al 2002 to evaluate and observe pressurized irrigation projects in iran sun et al 2017 established evaluation index system for agricultural water management in irrigation districts by applying ahp concept to three typical irrigation districts in huang huai hai river basin in north china it could be concluded that the ahp provides a flexible and simple statistical method that can turn qualitative indicators to quantitative ones in order to make complex problems hierarchical and systematic saaty 1977 it is highly recommended to be applied at performance evaluation for irrigation organization since it provides deep analysis for the irrigation system 5 4 using remote sensing rs and geographic information systems gis techniques the geographic information systems gis and remote sensing rs techniques have become potential tools for assessing and evaluating irrigation systems performance remote sensing derived satellite images e g evapotranspiration maps can be merged with maps of the irrigation delivery systems to find the real time performance bastiaanssen and bos 1999 the remote sensing could be used to improve the diagnosis under data scarce situations and also provide the opportunity to study the crop growing factors at scales ranging from individual farms to large scale projects level bastiaanssen et al 2000 zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 5 4 1 technical aspects of remote sensing method remote sensing management tools provide a system wide and spatially distributed information for the evaluation process according to ahmad et al 2009 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal is most common and powerful tool of remote sensing evapotranspiration algorithm that has been developed to solve on a pixel by pixel basis the energy balance components it is physically based on one layer sensible heat transfer scheme and an empirically based on soil heat flux and net radiation fraction used roerink et al 1997 sebal requires scanned spectral radiances in the visible near infrared and thermal infrared range to determine its constitutive parameters fig 3 fig 3 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal components and attributes roerink et al 1997 using this data evapotranspiration is then calculated from the latent heat flux and the daily averaged net radiation the latent heat flux is computed directly from the surface energy balance at satellite overpass on a pixel by pixel basis as follow λ e r n g 0 h where λe is the latent heat flux λ is the latent heat of vaporization and e is the actual evaporation r n is the net radiation g 0 is the soil heat flux and h is the sensible heat flux the latent heat flux describes the amount of energy consumed to maintain a certain evapotranspiration rate ahmad et al 2009 on the other hand the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is commonly used to determine the density of green cover on a patch of land unhealthy or sparse vegetation reflects more visible light and less near infrared light kogan 1997 wan et al 2004 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is computed as follow n d v i n r i r n r i r where ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index nir is the near infra red radiation reflected by vegetation and r is visible radiation reflected by vegetation the ndvi generally ranges from 1 to 1 kogan 1997 one of the earliest studies using the remote sensing techniques was conducted by roerink et al 1997 to computed water efficiency for the rio tunuyan irrigation system argentina bastiaanssen and ali 2003 determined crop production in the indus basin pakistan using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa avhrr satellite images a similar approach applied by ahmad et al 2009 and hamid et al 2011 to use noaa avhrr satellite images for diagnosing irrigation performance of the rachna doab project in pakistan and the rahad scheme in sudan respectively another research using satellite images was conducted by bandara 2003 to assess the water productivity for three large irrigation systems in sri lanka bashir et al 2008 and santos et al 2008 estimated irrigation efficiency from the spatial seasonal actual evapotranspiration et and computed crop water requirement using satellite data and remote sensing zwart and leclert 2010 evaluated irrigation performance of the office du niger in mali by using remote sensing techniques mamad 2010 assessed of the land and water productivity at different spatial scales within the gezira scheme sudan using satellite data for the same scheme al zayed et al 2015 and thiruvarudchelvan 2010 used satellite images to calculate irrigation efficiency indicators to assess the irrigation performance remote sensing is a useful tool for water managers to assess where scarce water resources are wasted and where in a given region the water productivity can be improved zwart and bastiaanssen 2007 it could be said that the spatial information will play a vital role in the future of the irrigation system evaluation 5 5 summary of tools and techniques in order to measure and evaluate irrigation performance effectively it is very important to select the appropriate evaluation method in this study the main four methods of irrigation performance evaluation were identified and discussed these methods are direct measurements for indicators fuzzy set theory analysis hierarchy process ahp and remote sensing rs the advantages and disadvantages of each method in addition to the main references are summarized below in table 3 6 conclusion irrigation projects performance evaluation is critical and vital to ensure sustainability of irrigated agriculture the literature and previous studies have provided the conceptual framework for performance assessment of irrigation schemes as for the criteria proposed in the literature although they offer a wide range of choice for characterizing all aspects of the performance evaluation nevertheless still there is no agreed approach and framework that offered to assess and evaluate irrigation system performance in order to measure and evaluate irrigation performance several methods were developed and used in this review the main four methods of irrigation performance evaluation namely direct measurements for indicators fuzzy set theory analysis hierarchy process ahp and remote sensing rs were identified and discussed it could be concluded that the selection of the evaluation method largely depends on the nature of irrigation system and the purpose of the evaluation 7 recommendation for future work in spite the fact that the literature above covers a wide range of topics related to irrigation performance evaluation however there is certainly need to conduct more research for further improvement and development so as to achieve this three topics need to be considered for further research the purpose of the first is to develop the eternal analytical framework that covers the whole components of the irrigation system considering the common factors in the different systems so it could be applied at different irrigation environments this is generally necessary for developing effective role for assisting in irrigation projects evaluation the second topic for research is concerned with improving the evaluation indicators through further revision and refinement these studies are about the development of detailed indices for particular issues of uncertainty qualitative indicators on which appear to require in depth studies of its own finally the third topic concerns with the development of software models that make it easy to analyze the massive amount of data in the evaluation process especially if the evaluation procedures are related to large scale irrigation projects these topics are generally necessary for developing more effective administrative for managing and supervising irrigation projects of any kind acknowledgement this paper is part of a study supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 51579070
