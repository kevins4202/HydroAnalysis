19470,controlled drainage cd is a structural conservation practice in which the drainage outlet is managed in order to reduce drain flow volume and nutrient loads to water bodies the goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of cd to improve water quality for two different seasons and levels of outlet control using ten years of data collected from an agricultural drained field in eastern indiana with two sets of paired plots the rank sum test was used to quantify the impact of cd on cumulative annual drain flow and nitrate n and phosphorus loads cd plots had a statistically significant at 5 level lower annual drain flow eastern pair 39 western pair 25 and nitrate load eastern pair 43 western pair 26 compared to free draining fd plots while annual soluble reactive phosphorus srp and total phosphorus tp loads were not significantly different an ancova model was used to evaluate the impact of cd on daily drain flow nitrate n srp and tp concentrations and loads during the two different periods of control the average percent reduction of daily drain flow was 68 in the eastern pair and 58 in the western pair during controlled drainage at the higher outlet level winter and 64 and 58 at the lower outlet level summer in the eastern and western pairs respectively nitrate load reduction was similar to drain flow reduction while the effect of cd on srp and tp loads was not significant except for the increase in srp in one pair these results from a decade long field monitoring and two different statistical methods enhance our knowledge about water quality impacts of cd system and support this management practice as a reliable system for reducing nitrate loss through subsurface drains mainly caused by flow reduction graphical abstract image 1 keywords drainage water management phosphorus nitrate ancova arma errors subsurface drain 1 introduction subsurface drainage is a necessary water management practice in agricultural fields with naturally poorly drained soil however it contributes to water quality issues studies suggest that nitrate loss through subsurface drainage is the main source of nitrate in surface water david et al 1997 jaynes and colvin 2006 and a leading cause of hypoxia in regions such as the northern gulf of mexico goolsby et al 1999 rabalais et al 2001 phosphorus p can also be transported through drainage systems in dissolved and particulate forms king et al 2015 and preferential flow appears to be a frequent mechanism of p transport into subsurface drains stamm et al 1998 phosphorus loads through subsurface drains are much lower than nitrate loads which has led to less attention to this loss pathway but recent studies have shown the importance of p lost through subsurface drainage king et al 2015 kleinman et al 2015 lam et al 2016 van esbroeck et al 2017 for example smith et al 2015 reported that 49 of soluble p and 48 of total p losses from fields in the st joseph river watershed in northeastern indiana occurred via subsurface discharge many approaches have been suggested in the literature to mitigate water quality issues caused by subsurface drainage among these controlled drainage cd is a structural conservation practice in which the drainage outlet elevation is managed in order to reduce drain flow volume and nutrient loads to water bodies evans et al 1995 fausey 2004 frankenberger et al 2006 singh et al 2007 adeuya et al 2012 gunn et al 2015 williams et al 2015a a comprehensive comparison between controlled and free draining systems from 13 experimental field studies at 7 different locations usa north carolina ohio iowa indiana illinois canada ontario and sweden by skaggs et al 2012 indicated a broad range of reductions from 18 to over 85 in average annual drain flow and from 18 to 79 in annual nitrate loss via drainage under cd in some of these studies denitrification has been found to lower the nitrate n concentrations in the subsurface outflow when drainage was controlled kliewer and gilliam 1995 tan et al 1998 however in most studies the significant decrease in nitrate loads has been shown to be a result of reduction in drain flow rather than the reduction in nitrate n concentrations e g wesström and messing 2007 adeuya et al 2012 lavaire et al 2017 from a synthesis analysis based on 17 measured field studies and 11 modeled studies ross et al 2016 found that cd reduced annual drain flow by 46 and annual nitrate loads by 48 ross et al 2016 additionally reported a 57 reduction in soluble p loads and a 55 reduction in total p loads with cd based on only a few studies available in the literature at that time nash et al 2015 found that cd decreased soluble p load in the subsurface flow by 80 in a claypan soil in missouri due to both a decrease in soluble p concentration and reduced drain flow although field studies on the effect of cd on drain flow and nitrate loss through subsurface drainage have been ongoing for decades most have been conducted for a period of less than 5 years there is also variability in the performance of cd in the literature and a wide range of changes in drain flow and nitrate loads with cd has been reported from different experimental sites this suggests more studies are still required to provide a complete understanding of nitrate and p transport from agricultural fields to surface water bodies under different weather conditions soil types cropping systems and drainage designs over a long term period in addition to variability among sites the design and statistical analysis used to assess cd effects have also varied which may add to the apparent variability in results this paper reports results from a decade long study in indiana having ten years of drain flow and nitrate n concentrations and five years of srp and tp concentrations allows a statistical analysis of the cumulative annual impact of cd in addition to the common paired field statistical analysis of daily values this study also includes p transport through subsurface drains unlike nitrate only a few studies have quantified the impacts of cd on p concentrations and loads via subsurface drains in addition this study evaluates the water quantity and quality impacts of cd during winter high outlet level control period versus summer low outlet level control period which has not been emphasized in previous studies the overall goal of this study was then to evaluate the potential of cd to improve water quality using ten years of data collected from an agricultural drained field in eastern indiana specific objectives were to 1 assess the impact of cd on annual drain flow and nutrient nitrate n srp and tp loads 2 quantify the relative influence of changes in drain flow versus changes in concentration on reductions in load due to cd 3 evaluate the impact of cd during periods of high outlet level control winter and low outlet level control summer 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the controlled drainage experimental site for this study is field w at davis purdue agricultural center dpac located in eastern indiana field w is relatively flat slope 1 with 0 16 km2 39 acre total area divided into four plots northwest nw southwest sw northeast ne and southeast se with areas ranging from 3 5 ha to 3 7 ha fig 1 the four soil series at the site range from very poorly to somewhat poorly drained with a small portion of moderately well drained series the subsurface drainage system was installed in september 2004 with 10 cm 4 inch laterals having an approximate depth of 1 m and spacing of 14 m utt 2010 resulting in a drainage intensity of 1 1 cm day 1 and drainage coefficient of 1 cm day 1 drainage in the se and nw plots was controlled at two different levels during some periods depending on the season fig 2 while the sw and ne were allowed to drain freely this field has been in a corn soybean rotation since 2011 and in continuous corn before that and was managed using chisel plow tillage in the fall and field cultivator tillage in the spring during the study period nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers were applied at different rates prior to and after planting corn table 1 phosphorus was also applied prior to soybean planting in two of the three soybean years the rate and timing of fertilizer applications were uniform for all plots and were based on purdue extension recommendations further details of the site management and data are available in abendroth et al 2017 2 2 operational strategy of controlled drainage drainage was controlled at different levels during winter and summer non growing and growing seasons the drainage outlet was raised to 10 cm below the ground surface after harvest sometime between november and december remained at that level through early to mid april each year winter high level and was lowered to the drain depth a few weeks before planting the outlet was raised to 40 cm below the ground surface after spring fieldwork late may to early june through the end of september summer low level this analysis distinguished the effects of cd during higher level control hl and lower level control ll the dates when the outlets were raised and lowered and the height to which they were raised were similar in most years fig 2 except for 2012 drought and 2015 management error when the drainage outlet was never lowered to the drain depth 2 3 drain flow measurements combined with estimations drain flow has been measured using electromagnetic flow meters krohne waterflux 3070 since 2012 prior to that drain flow monitoring was unreliable but water table was more consistently measured using pressure transducers global water wl 16 installed in observation wells located at the midpoint between two drains in each plot therefore drain flow was estimated using the hooghoudt equation and water table depth measurements for each hour for which water table measurement was available from january 2007 through december 2016 in a method described in saadat et al 2018 estimated drain flow was combined with observations for the periods that drain flow was measured 2012 2016 in order to fill in the gaps due to missing values in the water table observations gaps remained in the drain flow dataset therefore linear regression equations of the flow observations from one plot against a paired plot with the same treatment free or controlled drainage were used to fill the majority of the missing values saadat et al 2018 after drain flow was filled using the methods explained above small gaps 54 days over 10 years still remained in the dataset when there was no measured water table depth or measured flow from the paired plot fig 3 these gaps were mostly during the summertime when drain flow was relatively low compared to other times of the year and days with missing drain flow were not included in the analysis 2 4 sampling and concentration interpolation method automated water samplers isco were used to draw samples from the drainage outlet flow of each plot downstream of the control structure samples were collected every hour when flow was present except during winter and combined into weekly composite samples varying in length from twice a week to biweekly during the winter water samples were collected manually to avoid freezing problems approximately every week whenever flow was present a total of 2130 samples were collected during the study period from which 355 were manually collected grab samples samples were kept frozen until analysis and then analyzed on a seal analytical aq2 auto analyzer to be tested for nitrate nitrite n referred to subsequently as nitrate n soluble reactive phosphorus srp and total phosphorus tp according to us epa methods daily nitrate n srp and tp concentration values needed for the load calculations were estimated using linear interpolation because water quality samples were collected weekly or less frequently the composite samples from the automated samplers were considered representative of all days since the previous sample was collected for manual samples collected in winter daily concentration was calculated using linear interpolation between data points after estimating daily concentrations daily loads were calculated by multiplying the daily drain flow by estimated daily concentrations 2 5 statistics and data analysis in order to evaluate the effect of the cd system statistically the two eastern and western plots were paired due to their similar water table recession characteristics as was also done by saadat et al 2017 two separate analyses were conducted with different purposes the rank sum test was used for annual discharge and load while daily discharge and load and weekly concentration were analyzed using ancova 2 5 1 annual flow and loads using rank sum test annual drain flow and nutrient loads were determined by summing the daily flow and loads for each plot for each calendar year from 2007 to 2016 for drain flow and nitrate loads and from 2012 to 2016 for srp and tp loads the annual reduction in the cd plots was tested using the non parametric rank sum test bradley 1968 the magnitude of change for the rank sum test was estimated with the hodges lehmann estimator hodges and lehmann 1963 which is the median of all possible paired differences between annual flow load in the fd plots and cd plots 2 5 2 daily weekly values using ancova test the analysis of covariance ancova was used to determine the impacts of cd on daily drain flow daily nutrient loads and measured nutrient concentrations approximately weekly for this model two fields control and treated and two periods calibration and treatment are required clausen and spooner 1993 in this study the treatment period was further divided into two periods higher level hl control and lower level ll control periods fig 2 linear regression of the free draining periods calibration was used to test the significance of the relationship between paired observations if the relationship was significant the regressions in the treatment period were tested to determine the significance of the difference between the calibration and treatment periods the general equation used for the ancova model was 1 y β0 β1 x β2 z1 β3 z2 β4 z1 x β5 z2 x e where the dependent variable y is daily drain flow or daily loads or weekly concentrations from the cd site the independent variable x is daily drain flow or daily loads or weekly concentrations from the fd site z is a binary independent variable with z 1 and z 2 equal to 1 during hl and ll treatment periods respectively β 0 5 are regression coefficients provided by the model and e indicates the error term the standard ancova model assumes that the regression residuals are independent and normally distributed due to the high frequency sampling needed to determine drain flow and load residuals were not independent the error term in equation 1 was modeled with an autoregressive moving average model arma to model the autocorrelation in the data the arma error term for the linear regression model can be written as 2 e t i 1 p φ i e t i j 1 q θ j ε t j ε t where e t is the residual error from the model at time t ϕ is the autoregressive parameter θ is the moving average parameter p is the order of the autoregressive part q is the order of the moving average part and εt is a normally distributed random error term a similar method has been used in other water quality studies for example to address the correlation in nitrate and tp concentrations data by fitting a linear regression model with an autoregressive ar term to the data fields et al 2005 gassman et al 2010 however this is the first study to use the ancova model with arma error term to quantify the water quality impacts of cd statistical tests were accomplished using r and the maximum likelihood estimator was used to estimate the regression models with arma error term the significance of the slope and intercept for the free draining and controlled period regression lines was tested at the α 0 05 and α 0 1 level to determine the impacts of cd on drain flow nutrient concentrations and loads in different treatment periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 drain flow 3 1 1 annual drainage volume during free draining periods was similar in fd ne and sw and cd se and nw plots whereas it was lower in cd plots when drainage was controlled fig 4 in all years total annual drainage volume was lower in the two cd plots compared to the fd plots including the dry years 2009 2012 and 2016 when drainage volumes were less than 300 mm y 1 and wet years 2008 and 2011 when total drained water was above 450 mm y 1 in the fd plots the number of days of control varied each year depending on precipitation and field conditions water table level planting and harvesting dates and crop growth stage the rank sum test results for the annual drain flow table 2 indicated that the difference in drainage volume between the fd and cd sites was statistically significant in both pairs the median drainage volume was lower in cd sites by 150 mm y 1 and 82 mm y 1 in the eastern and western pairs respectively the range of individual annual differences was between 88 and 251 mm y 1 in the eastern pair and 25 149 mm y 1 in the western pair also given in table 2 is the range of drainage volume for all plots over 10 years of study period 2007 2016 3 1 2 daily the ancova analysis showed that the relationship between drain flow in the fd and cd plots for the free draining period was significant shown in fig 5 a for the eastern pair the relationships in treatment periods ll fig 5b and hl fig 5c were then compared to the free draining period the modeled relationships for eastern and western pairs fig 6 indicate clearly that cd decreased daily flow under ll summer treatment and even more under hl winter this figure also indicates that the mass difference between free draining period and treatment periods was greater at higher drain flow indicating the greater effectiveness of cd in wet conditions the statistical comparison of these linear regression models with the arma residual term table 3 indicated that both the intercept and slope were significantly different between the free draining period and the two treatment periods meaning that drain flow was significantly affected by cd at both levels summer and winter the effect of cd on daily drain flow during each treatment period was quantified by comparing cumulative observed flow in the cd sites with cumulative flow predicted using the regression equations for each period table 4 to take into account the pre treatment differences in flow between the two fd and cd plots cd reduced drain flow during hl control winter between 58 and 79 in the eastern and 43 73 in the western pair with the average reduction of 138 mm and 111 mm per period in the eastern and western pair respectively the ll control period summer had a similar average reduction compared to hl with the average reduction of 63 mm in the eastern and 59 mm in the western pair the reduction was greater during the hl control period around 2 3rd of the annual reduction in part because it occurs during the time of the year that drain flow is higher 3 2 nitrate and phosphorus concentrations measured nitrate n concentration ranged from 0 3 mg l 1 to 28 3 mg l 1 in all plots over 11 years shown for the eastern pair in fig 7 also shown is the daily drain flow for this pair indicating the effect of cd on reducing drain flow measured phosphorus concentrations mostly ranged from 0 002 mg l 1 to 0 5 mg l 1 for srp and from 0 004 mg l 1 to 1 mg l 1 for tp among all sites shown in fig 8 for the eastern pair two high values in both srp and tp concentrations may have been due to measurement errors or fertilizer application that reached the sampling point these high values only occurred in the cd fields during the free draining or ll control periods and for the purpose of interpolation were removed from the dataset yearly averages of nitrate n concentrations over the study period fig 9 showed that all four plots had a similar range in the mean yearly nitrate concentrations and there were not considerable differences between the fd and cd sites the mean concentration was 8 4 mg l 1 in fd and 8 5 mg l 1 in cd plots the yearly mean concentrations of srp and tp in cd plots tends to be higher than in the fd plots as shown in fig 9 srp had a mean concentration of 0 04 mg l 1 in fd plots and 0 06 mg l 1 in cd plots and the mean concentration of tp was 0 15 mg l 1 and 0 22 mg l 1 in fd and cd plots respectively the ancova analysis using linear models with the arma residual term was conducted only on each pair in which the relationship between sites was significant in the calibration period table 5 the calibration period models were statistically significant for nitrate concentration in both pairs for srp in the eastern pair and for tp in the western pair the linear models for concentrations indicated that there were no significant differences between the slope or the intercept of concentration regressions in any of the treatment levels for nitrate or tp but the intercepts were significantly different in the srp concentration regressions for both hl and ll control periods table 5 fig 10 the effect of cd on nutrient concentrations during each period was determined by comparing the average observed concentration from treatment periods in cd sites with the average predicted concentration using the regression equations table 6 nutrient concentrations increased in most years with cd at hl and ll in both pairs however as stated above table 5 only the increase in srp concentrations were statistically significant 3 3 nitrate and phosphorus loads 3 3 1 annual loads the 10 years of annual nitrate n loads from this site are among the longer datasets quantifying losses from subsurface drained fields the mean annual nitrate n load in the free draining fd fields at this site was 30 kg ha 1 y 1 nitrate n median loads of 37 kg ha 1 y 1 for wet years and 14 kg ha 1 y 1 for dry years were reported by christianson and harmel 2015 for sites with conservation tillage in a review of around 1300 subsurface drainage nutrient load site years of data the mean tp load measured from fd plots was 0 54 kg ha 1 y 1 which is in the range of 0 4 1 6 kg ha 1 y 1 reported by king et al 2015 this phosphorus load was mainly in particulate form with only 28 0 15 kg ha 1 y 1 as srp these results were consistent with bottcher et al 1981 findings and indicated the significance of preferential flow in p transport through subsurface drains time series of the annual nitrate n srp and tp loads fig 11 indicate that throughout the study period nitrate load was lower in cd plots while the pattern was not constant for the srp and tp the mean annual nitrate n load was 30 kg ha 1 y 1 in fd plots and 19 kg ha 1 y 1 in cd plots the rank sum test results on annual loads table 7 also indicated that the differences in nitrate n load between fd and cd sites were statistically significant in both pairs the median nitrate load was lower in cd sites by 12 8 kg ha 1 y 1 and 7 1 kg ha 1 y 1 in the eastern and western pairs respectively the differences in srp and tp loads between fd and cd plots were not statistically significant the smaller sample size 5 years for srp and tp could also weaken the power of the rank sum test the sample size was larger for nitrate 10 years 3 3 2 daily loads the linear regression models of nutrient loads in calibration period between the fd and cd plots were significant for both pairs meaning that the relationships between fd and cd sites can be statistically tested during the treatment periods results indicated that for nitrate load both the intercept and slope were significantly different between the free draining period and the two treatment periods table 8 visual comparison of these linear models fig 12 indicated a reduction in nitrate load with hl cd winter in both pairs and with ll cd summer in the western pair the relationships were more complex and not consistent for p loads in both pairs the linear models on srp and tp loads also showed a reduction in the slope in the eastern pair but an increase in the western pair especially at the ll cd even though some of these differences were not statistically significant table 8 fig 12 also indicated that the mass difference between free draining period and treatment periods was greater at higher loads which coincide with periods of greater drain flow fig 6 comparing cumulative observed values from treatment periods in cd sites with cumulative predicted values obtained from the regression equations indicated that hl cd reduced nitrate load between 33 and 74 during this period in the eastern pair and between 33 and 60 in the western pair with the average reduction per period of 7 8 kg ha 1 and 9 3 kg ha 1 in the eastern and western pairs respectively table 9 the amount of reduction was lower with ll cd compared to hl cd with the average reduction of 3 5 kg ha 1 and 4 3 kg ha 1 found in the eastern and western pairs respectively the effect of cd on p loads varied more over years compared to nitrate and the impact of cd during hl vs ll was not similar between the two pairs table 9 4 discussion comparison of cumulative annual subsurface drainage over ten years of study indicated that cd plots resulted in a statistically significant lower drainage volume than fd plots with the median difference of 150 mm y 1 39 and 82 mm y 1 25 in the eastern and western pairs respectively during this decade precipitation ranged from 800 mm y 1 to 1213 mm y 1 the cumulative annual analysis method avoids the difficulty of accounting for the transition times immediately after changes in outlet level as well as the potential lateral seepage from cd to neighboring fd fields but does not account for the pre treatment differences explicitly however cumulative drain flow was 7 and 13 higher in cd plots during free draining periods over the study period in the eastern and western pairs respectively confirming that the fd plots were not yielding more drainage than cd in general the ancova model results which take into account the pre treatment differences between fd and cd fields indicated an average reduction of 138 mm per period 68 and 111 mm per period 58 in the eastern and western pair respectively when the outlet was at the higher level hl winter and 63 mm per period 64 and 59 mm per period 58 average reduction when the outlet was at the lower level ll summer these results quantify for the first time the greater reduction in drain flow at higher control levels winter where there is sufficient drain flow to control the ancova model indicated an average reduction in annual drain flow of 48 in the eastern and 42 in the western pair when both hl and ll treatment periods as well as free draining periods were included in the annual reduction calculation the higher reductions 48 and 42 from the ancova statistical method compared to the cumulative annual method 39 and 25 are likely due to the pre treatment differences in plot hydrology which are not taken into account in the cumulative method drain flow reductions found through both statistical methods were higher than the 15 24 reduction found by adeuya et al 2012 from two fields in northwestern indiana differences in control levels soil characteristics weather conditions and whether drainage was controlled in the growing seasons or only non growing seasons can lead to variability in the results from different site studies in addition to variability among sites the design and statistical analysis used to assess the cd impacts have also varied among previous studies which may add to the apparent variability in results variations in drain flow reduction with cd obtained from the dpac site using different statistical methods suggest the need for a method which is applicable to most sites and is reliable for comparing water quality impacts of cd from different site studies the impacts of cd on nitrate n srp and tp concentrations were more complex and not consistent across pairs the averages of nitrate n srp and tp concentrations were slightly higher in controlled periods however they were not significantly different from the free draining periods except for the srp in the eastern pair the non significant difference in nitrate concentrations was similar to what the majority of other studies have reported fausey 2005 adeuya et al 2012 williams et al 2015a although some have observed lower nitrate concentration in cd fields the increase in srp was comparable to observations from valero et al 2007 feser et al 2010 and tan and zhang 2011 nutrient concentrations in the soil are affected by different factors such as water table level soil organic matter and temperature cd raises the water table levels leading to anaerobic soil conditions which could be expected to increase denitrification and therefore lower nitrate concentration in drain flow yet other factors such as cold temperature can reduce the amount of denitrification especially when high level control mostly occurs during the wintertime stanford et al 1975 found that denitrification rate decreases almost ten times as the temperature drops from 10 c to 5 c during the five years for which soil temperature data were available 2011 2016 88 of the drain flow during hl controlled periods occurred when the average soil profile temperature was below 10 c therefore denitrification was unlikely to have significantly reduced the nitrate concentration and this is reflected in the similarity of concentrations in fd and cd p concentration in drainage may also increase under cd due to anaerobic soil conditions which facilitate the movement of p in the soil mcdowell et al 2001 this may explain the higher srp concentrations during controlled periods in the eastern pair comparing actual annual values of nitrate n load from fd and cd plots over 10 years showed a median reduction of 12 8 kg ha 1 y 1 43 and 7 1 kg ha 1 y 1 26 in cd plots in the eastern and western pairs respectively the ancova results also indicated that cd at hl decreased nitrate n load by 7 8 kg ha 1 59 in the eastern and by 9 3 kg ha 1 57 in the western pair the average reduction with cd at ll was 3 5 kg ha 1 54 in the eastern and 4 3 kg ha 1 48 in the western pairs the average reductions in nitrate load were comparable to the flow reductions found in this study hl control 68 in the eastern pair and 58 in the western pair ll control 64 in the eastern pair and 58 in the western pair indicating that the main factor contributing to nutrient load reductions in cd sites was still the reduction in drain flow as concentrations were slightly higher not significant in cd fields the effects of cd on phosphorus p load varied more over years compared to nitrate because there were more variations in the p concentrations than nitrate the annual srp and tp loads were greater in cd plots than fd plots in some years and were lower in other years but based on the rank sum test results the differences were not statistically significant similar to the rank sum test results the ancova model also indicated inconsistent results over years and across plots changes in srp and tp loads were not proportional to the flow reduction implying the importance of p concentration that is affected by many factors other than the water table level set by cd cd impact on srp and tp loads quantified in the current study were not similar to the values reported in the literature such as the 80 reduction in soluble p loads observed by nash et al 2015 and the 40 68 reduction in soluble p found by williams et al 2015a p concentration and load are spatially and temporally variable and dependent on a combination of factors including soil characteristics drainage design management practices and climate variables king et al 2015 additionally in the studies conducted by nash et al 2015 and williams et al 2015a the statistical approach was different than the current study and may contribute to the variability in the results an uncertainty analysis on annual nitrate n and srp load estimates at field scale indicated that estimated annual srp loads tended to be less precise and more biased than nitrate n loads estimates williams et al 2015b in order to be able to make any conclusion about the effects of cd on p load more frequent concentration measurements are required especially during storm events since storm discharge can significantly affect the p transport mcdowell et al 2001 schelde et al 2006 zimmer et al 2016 williams et al 2015b recommended a higher sampling frequency for srp compared to nitrate n to yield the same accuracy in annual srp and nitrate n loads estimates in addition to the uncertainties acknowledged in the literature related to the sampling frequency and type e g birgand et al 2010 jiang et al 2014 williams et al 2015b there are some uncertainties related to drain flow dataset for the dpac site due to combining measured drain flow with estimated values detailed explanation of uncertainties associated with measured and estimated drain flow for this site is given in saadat et al 2018 beside the measurement methods load estimation using interpolation can introduce uncertainty into the annual load estimates however williams et al 2015b found that linearly interpolating the concentration combined with continuous flow used in the current study resulted in the best balance between accuracy and precision for annual nutrient load estimates in general the difference between hl winter and ll summer control emphasizes the impacts of control level and season on drain flow and therefore water quality benefits of cd systems the hl winter control during the non growing season provided about 70 of annual water quality benefits and the other 30 was obtained by ll summer control during the growing season furthermore variation over years at one control level can be due to the different duration that drainage was controlled in each year and whether it was a wet or dry year despite the reduction found in drain flow with cd in this and other studies the question of the fate of the retained water and whether the nitrate reduction at the outlet of the subsurface drainage system extends to the watershed scale remains unresolved for example in illinois lavaire et al 2017 found only a 10 reduction in drain flow and nitrate loads with cd when two neighboring fields were both controlled to avoid lateral seepage to the fd neighboring field future research that quantifies the effect of cd on other potential flow paths such as surface runoff and lateral seepage denitrification occurring in these pathways and the potential for increasing nitrous oxide emissions would enable a more complete characterization of the impact of cd 5 conclusions this study evaluated the potential of controlled drainage cd to improve water quality using ten years of field measurements with two different statistical methods the first method was a cumulative annual analysis that avoids the difficulty of accounting for the transition times as well as the potential lateral seepage between the neighboring fields and the second was a rigorous statistical method that accounts for the pre treatment relationship between the cd and fd fields and explicitly models dependence in the data allowing daily data to be used in the analysis results using two separate statistical methods indicate that cd significantly decreased drain flow and nitrate load through subsurface drainage in both eastern and western pairs nitrate concentrations were not significantly affected by cd indicating that load reduction was mainly due to drain flow reduction the cd impacts on phosphorus p loads were more complex and inconsistent over years and across plots but overall during 5 years cd decreased p loads p concentrations were not significantly different except for a significant increase in srp concentration with cd in the eastern pair the higher level of outlet control during the non growing season winter provided about 70 of annual water quality benefits while the lower level used during the growing season summer provided about 30 by quantifying the magnitude of the increased impact this study clarifies the added water quality benefit of controlling drainage at a higher level especially during the non growing season at both control levels the effectiveness of cd was greater when more drain flow or load was present in the field these results support the cd system as a reliable management practice for reducing nitrate loads from subsurface drains mainly due to the reduction in flow future research should investigate phosphorus impacts through event based sampling and the effect of cd on other flow paths such as surface runoff and lateral seepage to fully characterize the impact on nutrient loads at the watershed scale acknowledgements this material is based upon work that is supported by the national institute of food and

19470,controlled drainage cd is a structural conservation practice in which the drainage outlet is managed in order to reduce drain flow volume and nutrient loads to water bodies the goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of cd to improve water quality for two different seasons and levels of outlet control using ten years of data collected from an agricultural drained field in eastern indiana with two sets of paired plots the rank sum test was used to quantify the impact of cd on cumulative annual drain flow and nitrate n and phosphorus loads cd plots had a statistically significant at 5 level lower annual drain flow eastern pair 39 western pair 25 and nitrate load eastern pair 43 western pair 26 compared to free draining fd plots while annual soluble reactive phosphorus srp and total phosphorus tp loads were not significantly different an ancova model was used to evaluate the impact of cd on daily drain flow nitrate n srp and tp concentrations and loads during the two different periods of control the average percent reduction of daily drain flow was 68 in the eastern pair and 58 in the western pair during controlled drainage at the higher outlet level winter and 64 and 58 at the lower outlet level summer in the eastern and western pairs respectively nitrate load reduction was similar to drain flow reduction while the effect of cd on srp and tp loads was not significant except for the increase in srp in one pair these results from a decade long field monitoring and two different statistical methods enhance our knowledge about water quality impacts of cd system and support this management practice as a reliable system for reducing nitrate loss through subsurface drains mainly caused by flow reduction graphical abstract image 1 keywords drainage water management phosphorus nitrate ancova arma errors subsurface drain 1 introduction subsurface drainage is a necessary water management practice in agricultural fields with naturally poorly drained soil however it contributes to water quality issues studies suggest that nitrate loss through subsurface drainage is the main source of nitrate in surface water david et al 1997 jaynes and colvin 2006 and a leading cause of hypoxia in regions such as the northern gulf of mexico goolsby et al 1999 rabalais et al 2001 phosphorus p can also be transported through drainage systems in dissolved and particulate forms king et al 2015 and preferential flow appears to be a frequent mechanism of p transport into subsurface drains stamm et al 1998 phosphorus loads through subsurface drains are much lower than nitrate loads which has led to less attention to this loss pathway but recent studies have shown the importance of p lost through subsurface drainage king et al 2015 kleinman et al 2015 lam et al 2016 van esbroeck et al 2017 for example smith et al 2015 reported that 49 of soluble p and 48 of total p losses from fields in the st joseph river watershed in northeastern indiana occurred via subsurface discharge many approaches have been suggested in the literature to mitigate water quality issues caused by subsurface drainage among these controlled drainage cd is a structural conservation practice in which the drainage outlet elevation is managed in order to reduce drain flow volume and nutrient loads to water bodies evans et al 1995 fausey 2004 frankenberger et al 2006 singh et al 2007 adeuya et al 2012 gunn et al 2015 williams et al 2015a a comprehensive comparison between controlled and free draining systems from 13 experimental field studies at 7 different locations usa north carolina ohio iowa indiana illinois canada ontario and sweden by skaggs et al 2012 indicated a broad range of reductions from 18 to over 85 in average annual drain flow and from 18 to 79 in annual nitrate loss via drainage under cd in some of these studies denitrification has been found to lower the nitrate n concentrations in the subsurface outflow when drainage was controlled kliewer and gilliam 1995 tan et al 1998 however in most studies the significant decrease in nitrate loads has been shown to be a result of reduction in drain flow rather than the reduction in nitrate n concentrations e g wesström and messing 2007 adeuya et al 2012 lavaire et al 2017 from a synthesis analysis based on 17 measured field studies and 11 modeled studies ross et al 2016 found that cd reduced annual drain flow by 46 and annual nitrate loads by 48 ross et al 2016 additionally reported a 57 reduction in soluble p loads and a 55 reduction in total p loads with cd based on only a few studies available in the literature at that time nash et al 2015 found that cd decreased soluble p load in the subsurface flow by 80 in a claypan soil in missouri due to both a decrease in soluble p concentration and reduced drain flow although field studies on the effect of cd on drain flow and nitrate loss through subsurface drainage have been ongoing for decades most have been conducted for a period of less than 5 years there is also variability in the performance of cd in the literature and a wide range of changes in drain flow and nitrate loads with cd has been reported from different experimental sites this suggests more studies are still required to provide a complete understanding of nitrate and p transport from agricultural fields to surface water bodies under different weather conditions soil types cropping systems and drainage designs over a long term period in addition to variability among sites the design and statistical analysis used to assess cd effects have also varied which may add to the apparent variability in results this paper reports results from a decade long study in indiana having ten years of drain flow and nitrate n concentrations and five years of srp and tp concentrations allows a statistical analysis of the cumulative annual impact of cd in addition to the common paired field statistical analysis of daily values this study also includes p transport through subsurface drains unlike nitrate only a few studies have quantified the impacts of cd on p concentrations and loads via subsurface drains in addition this study evaluates the water quantity and quality impacts of cd during winter high outlet level control period versus summer low outlet level control period which has not been emphasized in previous studies the overall goal of this study was then to evaluate the potential of cd to improve water quality using ten years of data collected from an agricultural drained field in eastern indiana specific objectives were to 1 assess the impact of cd on annual drain flow and nutrient nitrate n srp and tp loads 2 quantify the relative influence of changes in drain flow versus changes in concentration on reductions in load due to cd 3 evaluate the impact of cd during periods of high outlet level control winter and low outlet level control summer 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the controlled drainage experimental site for this study is field w at davis purdue agricultural center dpac located in eastern indiana field w is relatively flat slope 1 with 0 16 km2 39 acre total area divided into four plots northwest nw southwest sw northeast ne and southeast se with areas ranging from 3 5 ha to 3 7 ha fig 1 the four soil series at the site range from very poorly to somewhat poorly drained with a small portion of moderately well drained series the subsurface drainage system was installed in september 2004 with 10 cm 4 inch laterals having an approximate depth of 1 m and spacing of 14 m utt 2010 resulting in a drainage intensity of 1 1 cm day 1 and drainage coefficient of 1 cm day 1 drainage in the se and nw plots was controlled at two different levels during some periods depending on the season fig 2 while the sw and ne were allowed to drain freely this field has been in a corn soybean rotation since 2011 and in continuous corn before that and was managed using chisel plow tillage in the fall and field cultivator tillage in the spring during the study period nitrogen n and phosphorus p fertilizers were applied at different rates prior to and after planting corn table 1 phosphorus was also applied prior to soybean planting in two of the three soybean years the rate and timing of fertilizer applications were uniform for all plots and were based on purdue extension recommendations further details of the site management and data are available in abendroth et al 2017 2 2 operational strategy of controlled drainage drainage was controlled at different levels during winter and summer non growing and growing seasons the drainage outlet was raised to 10 cm below the ground surface after harvest sometime between november and december remained at that level through early to mid april each year winter high level and was lowered to the drain depth a few weeks before planting the outlet was raised to 40 cm below the ground surface after spring fieldwork late may to early june through the end of september summer low level this analysis distinguished the effects of cd during higher level control hl and lower level control ll the dates when the outlets were raised and lowered and the height to which they were raised were similar in most years fig 2 except for 2012 drought and 2015 management error when the drainage outlet was never lowered to the drain depth 2 3 drain flow measurements combined with estimations drain flow has been measured using electromagnetic flow meters krohne waterflux 3070 since 2012 prior to that drain flow monitoring was unreliable but water table was more consistently measured using pressure transducers global water wl 16 installed in observation wells located at the midpoint between two drains in each plot therefore drain flow was estimated using the hooghoudt equation and water table depth measurements for each hour for which water table measurement was available from january 2007 through december 2016 in a method described in saadat et al 2018 estimated drain flow was combined with observations for the periods that drain flow was measured 2012 2016 in order to fill in the gaps due to missing values in the water table observations gaps remained in the drain flow dataset therefore linear regression equations of the flow observations from one plot against a paired plot with the same treatment free or controlled drainage were used to fill the majority of the missing values saadat et al 2018 after drain flow was filled using the methods explained above small gaps 54 days over 10 years still remained in the dataset when there was no measured water table depth or measured flow from the paired plot fig 3 these gaps were mostly during the summertime when drain flow was relatively low compared to other times of the year and days with missing drain flow were not included in the analysis 2 4 sampling and concentration interpolation method automated water samplers isco were used to draw samples from the drainage outlet flow of each plot downstream of the control structure samples were collected every hour when flow was present except during winter and combined into weekly composite samples varying in length from twice a week to biweekly during the winter water samples were collected manually to avoid freezing problems approximately every week whenever flow was present a total of 2130 samples were collected during the study period from which 355 were manually collected grab samples samples were kept frozen until analysis and then analyzed on a seal analytical aq2 auto analyzer to be tested for nitrate nitrite n referred to subsequently as nitrate n soluble reactive phosphorus srp and total phosphorus tp according to us epa methods daily nitrate n srp and tp concentration values needed for the load calculations were estimated using linear interpolation because water quality samples were collected weekly or less frequently the composite samples from the automated samplers were considered representative of all days since the previous sample was collected for manual samples collected in winter daily concentration was calculated using linear interpolation between data points after estimating daily concentrations daily loads were calculated by multiplying the daily drain flow by estimated daily concentrations 2 5 statistics and data analysis in order to evaluate the effect of the cd system statistically the two eastern and western plots were paired due to their similar water table recession characteristics as was also done by saadat et al 2017 two separate analyses were conducted with different purposes the rank sum test was used for annual discharge and load while daily discharge and load and weekly concentration were analyzed using ancova 2 5 1 annual flow and loads using rank sum test annual drain flow and nutrient loads were determined by summing the daily flow and loads for each plot for each calendar year from 2007 to 2016 for drain flow and nitrate loads and from 2012 to 2016 for srp and tp loads the annual reduction in the cd plots was tested using the non parametric rank sum test bradley 1968 the magnitude of change for the rank sum test was estimated with the hodges lehmann estimator hodges and lehmann 1963 which is the median of all possible paired differences between annual flow load in the fd plots and cd plots 2 5 2 daily weekly values using ancova test the analysis of covariance ancova was used to determine the impacts of cd on daily drain flow daily nutrient loads and measured nutrient concentrations approximately weekly for this model two fields control and treated and two periods calibration and treatment are required clausen and spooner 1993 in this study the treatment period was further divided into two periods higher level hl control and lower level ll control periods fig 2 linear regression of the free draining periods calibration was used to test the significance of the relationship between paired observations if the relationship was significant the regressions in the treatment period were tested to determine the significance of the difference between the calibration and treatment periods the general equation used for the ancova model was 1 y β0 β1 x β2 z1 β3 z2 β4 z1 x β5 z2 x e where the dependent variable y is daily drain flow or daily loads or weekly concentrations from the cd site the independent variable x is daily drain flow or daily loads or weekly concentrations from the fd site z is a binary independent variable with z 1 and z 2 equal to 1 during hl and ll treatment periods respectively β 0 5 are regression coefficients provided by the model and e indicates the error term the standard ancova model assumes that the regression residuals are independent and normally distributed due to the high frequency sampling needed to determine drain flow and load residuals were not independent the error term in equation 1 was modeled with an autoregressive moving average model arma to model the autocorrelation in the data the arma error term for the linear regression model can be written as 2 e t i 1 p φ i e t i j 1 q θ j ε t j ε t where e t is the residual error from the model at time t ϕ is the autoregressive parameter θ is the moving average parameter p is the order of the autoregressive part q is the order of the moving average part and εt is a normally distributed random error term a similar method has been used in other water quality studies for example to address the correlation in nitrate and tp concentrations data by fitting a linear regression model with an autoregressive ar term to the data fields et al 2005 gassman et al 2010 however this is the first study to use the ancova model with arma error term to quantify the water quality impacts of cd statistical tests were accomplished using r and the maximum likelihood estimator was used to estimate the regression models with arma error term the significance of the slope and intercept for the free draining and controlled period regression lines was tested at the α 0 05 and α 0 1 level to determine the impacts of cd on drain flow nutrient concentrations and loads in different treatment periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 drain flow 3 1 1 annual drainage volume during free draining periods was similar in fd ne and sw and cd se and nw plots whereas it was lower in cd plots when drainage was controlled fig 4 in all years total annual drainage volume was lower in the two cd plots compared to the fd plots including the dry years 2009 2012 and 2016 when drainage volumes were less than 300 mm y 1 and wet years 2008 and 2011 when total drained water was above 450 mm y 1 in the fd plots the number of days of control varied each year depending on precipitation and field conditions water table level planting and harvesting dates and crop growth stage the rank sum test results for the annual drain flow table 2 indicated that the difference in drainage volume between the fd and cd sites was statistically significant in both pairs the median drainage volume was lower in cd sites by 150 mm y 1 and 82 mm y 1 in the eastern and western pairs respectively the range of individual annual differences was between 88 and 251 mm y 1 in the eastern pair and 25 149 mm y 1 in the western pair also given in table 2 is the range of drainage volume for all plots over 10 years of study period 2007 2016 3 1 2 daily the ancova analysis showed that the relationship between drain flow in the fd and cd plots for the free draining period was significant shown in fig 5 a for the eastern pair the relationships in treatment periods ll fig 5b and hl fig 5c were then compared to the free draining period the modeled relationships for eastern and western pairs fig 6 indicate clearly that cd decreased daily flow under ll summer treatment and even more under hl winter this figure also indicates that the mass difference between free draining period and treatment periods was greater at higher drain flow indicating the greater effectiveness of cd in wet conditions the statistical comparison of these linear regression models with the arma residual term table 3 indicated that both the intercept and slope were significantly different between the free draining period and the two treatment periods meaning that drain flow was significantly affected by cd at both levels summer and winter the effect of cd on daily drain flow during each treatment period was quantified by comparing cumulative observed flow in the cd sites with cumulative flow predicted using the regression equations for each period table 4 to take into account the pre treatment differences in flow between the two fd and cd plots cd reduced drain flow during hl control winter between 58 and 79 in the eastern and 43 73 in the western pair with the average reduction of 138 mm and 111 mm per period in the eastern and western pair respectively the ll control period summer had a similar average reduction compared to hl with the average reduction of 63 mm in the eastern and 59 mm in the western pair the reduction was greater during the hl control period around 2 3rd of the annual reduction in part because it occurs during the time of the year that drain flow is higher 3 2 nitrate and phosphorus concentrations measured nitrate n concentration ranged from 0 3 mg l 1 to 28 3 mg l 1 in all plots over 11 years shown for the eastern pair in fig 7 also shown is the daily drain flow for this pair indicating the effect of cd on reducing drain flow measured phosphorus concentrations mostly ranged from 0 002 mg l 1 to 0 5 mg l 1 for srp and from 0 004 mg l 1 to 1 mg l 1 for tp among all sites shown in fig 8 for the eastern pair two high values in both srp and tp concentrations may have been due to measurement errors or fertilizer application that reached the sampling point these high values only occurred in the cd fields during the free draining or ll control periods and for the purpose of interpolation were removed from the dataset yearly averages of nitrate n concentrations over the study period fig 9 showed that all four plots had a similar range in the mean yearly nitrate concentrations and there were not considerable differences between the fd and cd sites the mean concentration was 8 4 mg l 1 in fd and 8 5 mg l 1 in cd plots the yearly mean concentrations of srp and tp in cd plots tends to be higher than in the fd plots as shown in fig 9 srp had a mean concentration of 0 04 mg l 1 in fd plots and 0 06 mg l 1 in cd plots and the mean concentration of tp was 0 15 mg l 1 and 0 22 mg l 1 in fd and cd plots respectively the ancova analysis using linear models with the arma residual term was conducted only on each pair in which the relationship between sites was significant in the calibration period table 5 the calibration period models were statistically significant for nitrate concentration in both pairs for srp in the eastern pair and for tp in the western pair the linear models for concentrations indicated that there were no significant differences between the slope or the intercept of concentration regressions in any of the treatment levels for nitrate or tp but the intercepts were significantly different in the srp concentration regressions for both hl and ll control periods table 5 fig 10 the effect of cd on nutrient concentrations during each period was determined by comparing the average observed concentration from treatment periods in cd sites with the average predicted concentration using the regression equations table 6 nutrient concentrations increased in most years with cd at hl and ll in both pairs however as stated above table 5 only the increase in srp concentrations were statistically significant 3 3 nitrate and phosphorus loads 3 3 1 annual loads the 10 years of annual nitrate n loads from this site are among the longer datasets quantifying losses from subsurface drained fields the mean annual nitrate n load in the free draining fd fields at this site was 30 kg ha 1 y 1 nitrate n median loads of 37 kg ha 1 y 1 for wet years and 14 kg ha 1 y 1 for dry years were reported by christianson and harmel 2015 for sites with conservation tillage in a review of around 1300 subsurface drainage nutrient load site years of data the mean tp load measured from fd plots was 0 54 kg ha 1 y 1 which is in the range of 0 4 1 6 kg ha 1 y 1 reported by king et al 2015 this phosphorus load was mainly in particulate form with only 28 0 15 kg ha 1 y 1 as srp these results were consistent with bottcher et al 1981 findings and indicated the significance of preferential flow in p transport through subsurface drains time series of the annual nitrate n srp and tp loads fig 11 indicate that throughout the study period nitrate load was lower in cd plots while the pattern was not constant for the srp and tp the mean annual nitrate n load was 30 kg ha 1 y 1 in fd plots and 19 kg ha 1 y 1 in cd plots the rank sum test results on annual loads table 7 also indicated that the differences in nitrate n load between fd and cd sites were statistically significant in both pairs the median nitrate load was lower in cd sites by 12 8 kg ha 1 y 1 and 7 1 kg ha 1 y 1 in the eastern and western pairs respectively the differences in srp and tp loads between fd and cd plots were not statistically significant the smaller sample size 5 years for srp and tp could also weaken the power of the rank sum test the sample size was larger for nitrate 10 years 3 3 2 daily loads the linear regression models of nutrient loads in calibration period between the fd and cd plots were significant for both pairs meaning that the relationships between fd and cd sites can be statistically tested during the treatment periods results indicated that for nitrate load both the intercept and slope were significantly different between the free draining period and the two treatment periods table 8 visual comparison of these linear models fig 12 indicated a reduction in nitrate load with hl cd winter in both pairs and with ll cd summer in the western pair the relationships were more complex and not consistent for p loads in both pairs the linear models on srp and tp loads also showed a reduction in the slope in the eastern pair but an increase in the western pair especially at the ll cd even though some of these differences were not statistically significant table 8 fig 12 also indicated that the mass difference between free draining period and treatment periods was greater at higher loads which coincide with periods of greater drain flow fig 6 comparing cumulative observed values from treatment periods in cd sites with cumulative predicted values obtained from the regression equations indicated that hl cd reduced nitrate load between 33 and 74 during this period in the eastern pair and between 33 and 60 in the western pair with the average reduction per period of 7 8 kg ha 1 and 9 3 kg ha 1 in the eastern and western pairs respectively table 9 the amount of reduction was lower with ll cd compared to hl cd with the average reduction of 3 5 kg ha 1 and 4 3 kg ha 1 found in the eastern and western pairs respectively the effect of cd on p loads varied more over years compared to nitrate and the impact of cd during hl vs ll was not similar between the two pairs table 9 4 discussion comparison of cumulative annual subsurface drainage over ten years of study indicated that cd plots resulted in a statistically significant lower drainage volume than fd plots with the median difference of 150 mm y 1 39 and 82 mm y 1 25 in the eastern and western pairs respectively during this decade precipitation ranged from 800 mm y 1 to 1213 mm y 1 the cumulative annual analysis method avoids the difficulty of accounting for the transition times immediately after changes in outlet level as well as the potential lateral seepage from cd to neighboring fd fields but does not account for the pre treatment differences explicitly however cumulative drain flow was 7 and 13 higher in cd plots during free draining periods over the study period in the eastern and western pairs respectively confirming that the fd plots were not yielding more drainage than cd in general the ancova model results which take into account the pre treatment differences between fd and cd fields indicated an average reduction of 138 mm per period 68 and 111 mm per period 58 in the eastern and western pair respectively when the outlet was at the higher level hl winter and 63 mm per period 64 and 59 mm per period 58 average reduction when the outlet was at the lower level ll summer these results quantify for the first time the greater reduction in drain flow at higher control levels winter where there is sufficient drain flow to control the ancova model indicated an average reduction in annual drain flow of 48 in the eastern and 42 in the western pair when both hl and ll treatment periods as well as free draining periods were included in the annual reduction calculation the higher reductions 48 and 42 from the ancova statistical method compared to the cumulative annual method 39 and 25 are likely due to the pre treatment differences in plot hydrology which are not taken into account in the cumulative method drain flow reductions found through both statistical methods were higher than the 15 24 reduction found by adeuya et al 2012 from two fields in northwestern indiana differences in control levels soil characteristics weather conditions and whether drainage was controlled in the growing seasons or only non growing seasons can lead to variability in the results from different site studies in addition to variability among sites the design and statistical analysis used to assess the cd impacts have also varied among previous studies which may add to the apparent variability in results variations in drain flow reduction with cd obtained from the dpac site using different statistical methods suggest the need for a method which is applicable to most sites and is reliable for comparing water quality impacts of cd from different site studies the impacts of cd on nitrate n srp and tp concentrations were more complex and not consistent across pairs the averages of nitrate n srp and tp concentrations were slightly higher in controlled periods however they were not significantly different from the free draining periods except for the srp in the eastern pair the non significant difference in nitrate concentrations was similar to what the majority of other studies have reported fausey 2005 adeuya et al 2012 williams et al 2015a although some have observed lower nitrate concentration in cd fields the increase in srp was comparable to observations from valero et al 2007 feser et al 2010 and tan and zhang 2011 nutrient concentrations in the soil are affected by different factors such as water table level soil organic matter and temperature cd raises the water table levels leading to anaerobic soil conditions which could be expected to increase denitrification and therefore lower nitrate concentration in drain flow yet other factors such as cold temperature can reduce the amount of denitrification especially when high level control mostly occurs during the wintertime stanford et al 1975 found that denitrification rate decreases almost ten times as the temperature drops from 10 c to 5 c during the five years for which soil temperature data were available 2011 2016 88 of the drain flow during hl controlled periods occurred when the average soil profile temperature was below 10 c therefore denitrification was unlikely to have significantly reduced the nitrate concentration and this is reflected in the similarity of concentrations in fd and cd p concentration in drainage may also increase under cd due to anaerobic soil conditions which facilitate the movement of p in the soil mcdowell et al 2001 this may explain the higher srp concentrations during controlled periods in the eastern pair comparing actual annual values of nitrate n load from fd and cd plots over 10 years showed a median reduction of 12 8 kg ha 1 y 1 43 and 7 1 kg ha 1 y 1 26 in cd plots in the eastern and western pairs respectively the ancova results also indicated that cd at hl decreased nitrate n load by 7 8 kg ha 1 59 in the eastern and by 9 3 kg ha 1 57 in the western pair the average reduction with cd at ll was 3 5 kg ha 1 54 in the eastern and 4 3 kg ha 1 48 in the western pairs the average reductions in nitrate load were comparable to the flow reductions found in this study hl control 68 in the eastern pair and 58 in the western pair ll control 64 in the eastern pair and 58 in the western pair indicating that the main factor contributing to nutrient load reductions in cd sites was still the reduction in drain flow as concentrations were slightly higher not significant in cd fields the effects of cd on phosphorus p load varied more over years compared to nitrate because there were more variations in the p concentrations than nitrate the annual srp and tp loads were greater in cd plots than fd plots in some years and were lower in other years but based on the rank sum test results the differences were not statistically significant similar to the rank sum test results the ancova model also indicated inconsistent results over years and across plots changes in srp and tp loads were not proportional to the flow reduction implying the importance of p concentration that is affected by many factors other than the water table level set by cd cd impact on srp and tp loads quantified in the current study were not similar to the values reported in the literature such as the 80 reduction in soluble p loads observed by nash et al 2015 and the 40 68 reduction in soluble p found by williams et al 2015a p concentration and load are spatially and temporally variable and dependent on a combination of factors including soil characteristics drainage design management practices and climate variables king et al 2015 additionally in the studies conducted by nash et al 2015 and williams et al 2015a the statistical approach was different than the current study and may contribute to the variability in the results an uncertainty analysis on annual nitrate n and srp load estimates at field scale indicated that estimated annual srp loads tended to be less precise and more biased than nitrate n loads estimates williams et al 2015b in order to be able to make any conclusion about the effects of cd on p load more frequent concentration measurements are required especially during storm events since storm discharge can significantly affect the p transport mcdowell et al 2001 schelde et al 2006 zimmer et al 2016 williams et al 2015b recommended a higher sampling frequency for srp compared to nitrate n to yield the same accuracy in annual srp and nitrate n loads estimates in addition to the uncertainties acknowledged in the literature related to the sampling frequency and type e g birgand et al 2010 jiang et al 2014 williams et al 2015b there are some uncertainties related to drain flow dataset for the dpac site due to combining measured drain flow with estimated values detailed explanation of uncertainties associated with measured and estimated drain flow for this site is given in saadat et al 2018 beside the measurement methods load estimation using interpolation can introduce uncertainty into the annual load estimates however williams et al 2015b found that linearly interpolating the concentration combined with continuous flow used in the current study resulted in the best balance between accuracy and precision for annual nutrient load estimates in general the difference between hl winter and ll summer control emphasizes the impacts of control level and season on drain flow and therefore water quality benefits of cd systems the hl winter control during the non growing season provided about 70 of annual water quality benefits and the other 30 was obtained by ll summer control during the growing season furthermore variation over years at one control level can be due to the different duration that drainage was controlled in each year and whether it was a wet or dry year despite the reduction found in drain flow with cd in this and other studies the question of the fate of the retained water and whether the nitrate reduction at the outlet of the subsurface drainage system extends to the watershed scale remains unresolved for example in illinois lavaire et al 2017 found only a 10 reduction in drain flow and nitrate loads with cd when two neighboring fields were both controlled to avoid lateral seepage to the fd neighboring field future research that quantifies the effect of cd on other potential flow paths such as surface runoff and lateral seepage denitrification occurring in these pathways and the potential for increasing nitrous oxide emissions would enable a more complete characterization of the impact of cd 5 conclusions this study evaluated the potential of controlled drainage cd to improve water quality using ten years of field measurements with two different statistical methods the first method was a cumulative annual analysis that avoids the difficulty of accounting for the transition times as well as the potential lateral seepage between the neighboring fields and the second was a rigorous statistical method that accounts for the pre treatment relationship between the cd and fd fields and explicitly models dependence in the data allowing daily data to be used in the analysis results using two separate statistical methods indicate that cd significantly decreased drain flow and nitrate load through subsurface drainage in both eastern and western pairs nitrate concentrations were not significantly affected by cd indicating that load reduction was mainly due to drain flow reduction the cd impacts on phosphorus p loads were more complex and inconsistent over years and across plots but overall during 5 years cd decreased p loads p concentrations were not significantly different except for a significant increase in srp concentration with cd in the eastern pair the higher level of outlet control during the non growing season winter provided about 70 of annual water quality benefits while the lower level used during the growing season summer provided about 30 by quantifying the magnitude of the increased impact this study clarifies the added water quality benefit of controlling drainage at a higher level especially during the non growing season at both control levels the effectiveness of cd was greater when more drain flow or load was present in the field these results support the cd system as a reliable management practice for reducing nitrate loads from subsurface drains mainly due to the reduction in flow future research should investigate phosphorus impacts through event based sampling and the effect of cd on other flow paths such as surface runoff and lateral seepage to fully characterize the impact on nutrient loads at the watershed scale acknowledgements this material is based upon work that is supported by the national institute of food and

contaminants ji et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 sun et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 matafonova et al 2018 ling et al 2017 li et al 2015 fang et al 2017 but also as a disinfectant for pathogenic microorganisms such as escherichia coli o157 h7 marine phytoplankton and nonpathogenic bacteria wordofa et al 2017 xia et al 2017a ahn et al 2013 chesney et al 2016 so4 can be generated via homogenous activation of

however the homogenous activation process has some drawbacks such as an uncontrollable radical formation rate and quenching reactions between the radicals and activator which lower contaminant degradation efficiency to overcome these drawback heterogeneous activation of pms or ps using metal oxides naturally occurring minerals and related metal oxides or nanoparticles has also been developed some metal nanoparticles such as fe3o4 mno2 and cufe2o4 fang et al 2013 saputra et al 2013b zhang et al 2013 ren et al 2015 lei et al 2015 and metal free activators such as graphene carbon nanotubes and biochar sun et al 2012 2014 guan et al 2017 lee et al 2016 duan et al 2015 fang et al 2015a have been developed to activate ps or pms for contaminant degradation however the complex fabrication procedures and expensive mass production of these nanomaterials have limited their field applications therefore recent efforts have focused on developing efficient low cost and

pms for contaminant degradation saputra et al 2013a b yu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 for example yu et al reported that pms was catalytically decomposed efficiently by goethite hematite ferrihydrite and birnessite to form free radicals for nitrobenzene degradation yu et al 2016 recently sulfur containing minerals such as pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes and magnetic pyrrhotite have been recognized as efficient activators of oxidants h2o2 ps and o2 for contaminant degradation and water disinfection liang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 oh et al 2011 xia et al 2017b rimstidt and vaughan 2003 zhang et al 2016 for example liang et al found that fe ii of pyrite can activate persulfate efficiently for methyl tert butyl ether oxidation liang et al 2010 in addition the in situ generation of oh from sulfur minerals such as pyrite oxidation by o2 has been reported previously zhang et al 2016 kaur and schoonen 2017 which plays an important role in the transformation of contaminants in the natural occurring environment zhang et al reported that fe ii of pyrite can activate oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species without addition of oxidants zhang et al 2016 fe ii of pyrite is usually considered the dominant factor controlling ps or pms activation and free radical formation because fe ii is an excellent ps and pms activator liang et al 2010 feng et al 2018 however the role of sulfur conversion in free radical generation and contaminant degradation in this process has not been fully explored elucidating the effects of sulfur conversion on free radical generation is also important for ps or pms based in situ chemical oxidation isco remediation of contaminated groundwater and soils this is because the decomposition of pms or ps usually produces a large amount of sulfate ions which would participate in the sulfur cycles in the subsurface environment fang et al 2013 under oxygen limited conditions some reducing sulfur intermediates such as s2 s2o3 2 and so3 2 would be produced from the reduction of sulfate ions in groundwater and soils dockins et al 1980 wine and conrad 1997 the interactions between sulfur intermediates minerals and oxidants would ultimately influence free radical generation contaminant degradation and remediation efficiency therefore this study aimed to i develop an efficient activator of pms for contaminant degradation and explore the mechanism of this process and ii elucidate the role of sulfide or related conversion intermediates in pms activation by pyrite and clarify the mechanism using electron paramagnetic resonance epr free radical quenching reactions x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir diethyl phthalate dep was selected

degradation experiments batch experiments were performed in a plug sealed 250 ml brown flask containing 150 ml of reaction suspension and placed on a magnetic stirrer hj 6 changzhou china at room temperature 25 2 c with a rotary speed of 400 rpm the reaction solution containing dep and pms was prepared with initial ph of 7 0 by adjusting with 1 0 m naoh and 1 0 m h2so4 different amounts of pyrite particles were then added to the reaction solution to initiate degradation the initial concentrations of dep pms and pyrite were 20 mg l 0 5 5 0 mm and 0 1 2 0 g l respectively at different time intervals a 1 ml aliquot of the reaction suspension was withdrawn added to methanol 0 5 ml to quench the reaction and the resulting suspension was filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter the dep concentration dissolved fe and total organic carbon toc in the filtrate were determined using hplc agilent 1200 usa icp ms nexion 300 perkinelmer ca and a toc analyzer toc 42 vcph shimadzu japan respectively to determine degradation intermediates of dep the reaction suspension was extracted with dichloromethane derivatized with n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa trimethylchlorosilane tmcs 99 1 and analyzed by gc ms gc varian cp3800 ms saturn2200 usa control experiments for dep degradation using fes2 or pms alone were performed under identical reaction conditions all experiments were performed in triplicate to obtain mean values with standard deviation 2 3 2 epr and in situ atr ftir experiments the formation of free radicals such as so4 and oh in the pms pyrite system was determined by epr using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping agent briefly the reaction suspension pyrite pms containing dmpo 0 1 m was added to a quartz tube and analyzed by epr emx 10 12 bruker germany at a resonance frequency of 9 77 ghz microwave power of 19 97 mw modulation amplitude of 1 0 g sweep width of 100 g time constant of 40 96 ms sweep time of 83 89 s and receiver gain of 1 0 103 to analyze the formation of sulfite sulfate and hydroxyl radicals in the fe iii so3 2 system the same epr parameters were used as above except for the dmpo concentration 10 mm and receiver gain 2 0 104 in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir experiments were performed using a nicolet is 10 spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa coupled with a diamond crystal as reactor scanning 32 times with a resolution of 2 cm 1 atr ftir experiments were performed using the following procedure fes2 particles were deposited on the diamond surface of the atr ftir device pms solution was dropped on the fes2 surface to initiate the reaction the final pms concentration and fes2 loading were 5 0 mm and 5 0 g l respectively spectra were collected at different reaction intervals other analysis methods used in this study are shown in text s2 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of dep by pms activated using different pyrite fes2 loadings figure s2ashows that 55 of dep 20 mg l was degraded by pms 2 0 mm in the presence of pyrite 0 1 g l while only 8 of dep was decayed by pms or fes2 alone 2 0 g l when the fes2 loading was increased to 2 0 g l dep was completely degraded within 30 min the pseudo first order reaction rate constants kobs of dep degradation increasing from 0 0025 to 0 1273 min 1 as the fes2 loading was increased from 0 1 to 2 0 g l fig 1 a these results indicated that fes2 was effective at activating pms for dep degradation with higher fes2 loadings favoring pms activation and dep degradation figure s3 shows that increasing the pms concentration favored dep degradation with kobs increased from 0 0210 to 0 0553 min 1 as the pms concentration was increased from 0 5 to 1 0 mm figure s3c further increasing the pms concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mm did not produce a significant change in kobs which indicated that the fes2 loading was the dominant factor influencing dep degradation in the excess of pms toc removal was also examined as a function of fes2 loading fig 1b shows that the toc removal increased with increasing fes2 loading from 0 1 to 0 5 g l and a maximum toc removal of 61 1 was achieved using a fes2 loading of 1 0 g l further increasing the fes2 loading to 2 0 and 5 0 g l decreased the toc removal to 50 5 and 44 7 respectively these results indicated that pms activation by fes2 can partially mineralize dep with excess fes2 making a limited contribution to increased toc removal despite an increased fes2 loading accelerating the dep degradation rate significantly fig 1a gc ms analysis were carried out after silylation and four primary silylated intermediates were identified by mass spectral search against the gc ms nist database and the products of dep degradation reported in the previous study chen et al 2016 figure s4 the corresponding structures without silyl groups were identified as monoethyl phthalate mep phthalic acid pa meta hydroxy dep m oh dep and another hydroxylated dep oh dep figure s5 shows that the intensity profiles of the three main products pa mep and m oh dep increased markedly at 60 min and then decayed significantly as the reaction time was prolonged to 240 min which indicated that these intermediates rapidly accumulated at the beginning of the reaction due to fast degradation of dep by free radicals however these intermediates were further degraded and finally mineralized with prolonged reaction time as supported by the toc analysis shown in fig 1b these combined results further indicated that pms activation by fes2 both degraded and mineralized pollutants efficiently 3 2 free radical quenching and epr studies free radical quenching studies were used to identify the dominant radicals in dep degradation fig 2 a shows that dep degradation was greatly inhibited and the dep degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 13 9 and 27 1 with the addition of 10 mm of methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba respectively the results indicate that oh would be the dominant radical accounted for dep degradation but oh derived from the reaction between so4 and h2o oh thus so4 is still the dominant radical controlling dep degradation in the fes2 pms system to further verify this process epr was performed using dmpo as the trapping reagent to detect the dominant radicals as shown in fig 2b epr signals for both so4 and oh dmpo adducts were observed assigned according to their hyperfine splitting constants dmpo so4 an 13 2 g ah 9 6 1 48 and 0 98 g dmpo oh an ah 14 9 g as simulated by epr software figure s6 this indicated that both so4 and oh were generated from pms activation by fes2 the peak intensities of the epr signals increased about 6 6 fold as the fes2 loading was increased from 0 1 to 2 0 g l which suggested that pms activation was greatly enhanced by increasing fes2 loading furthermore the peak intensities of the epr signals increased markedly when the reaction time was extended from 1 to 3 min with only slight changes after 3 min which indicated that so4 and oh were generated at a high and constant rate in the pms fes2 system fig 2c fig 2d shows that increasing pms concentration favored so4 and oh formation the peak intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts increased about 2 2 fold when the pms concentration was increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mm free radical quenching combined with epr results indicated that pms was efficiently activated by fes2 to produce so4 and oh with both types of radical responsible for dep degradation 3 3 mechanism of pms activation by fes2 3 3 1 fe dissolution and cycle although the reaction ph decreased rapidly from 7 0 to 3 0 3 5 during dep degradation due to the decomposition of pms the concentration of fe ion dissolution was 3 4 mg l at a reaction time of 60 min with fes2 loading and pms concentration of 2 0 g l and 2 0 mm respectively figure s7a the dissolved fe ion concentration only accounted for 0 36 of the total fes2 loading used in the fes2 pms system furthermore the concentration of fe ions dissolved in the fes2 pms system was significantly higher than that in the fes2 pms dep system this was due to fes2 being oxidized by free radicals in the absence of dep which increased the dissolution of fe ion these combined results indicated that the presence of dep decreased fes2 dissolution and increased its reactivity in the pms activation process homogenous activation of pms by fe2 or fe3 ion has also been shown to degrade contaminants zou et al 2013 to further test the contribution of fe ion to pms activation for dep degradation the effects of fe2 and fe3 ions on dep degradation in the fes2 pms system were examined fig 3 a and b shows that dep degradation was greatly enhanced by the addition of fe2 or fe3 with the kobs of dep degradation increasing from 0 0209 to 0 0507 min 1 or 0 0209 to 0 0871 min 1 when the fe2 or fe3 concentration was increased from 0 to 50 mg l which indicated that both fe2 and fe3 favored pms activation by fes2 fig 3c fig s7b and s7c interestingly fe3 was found to be more effective than fe2 at enhancing dep in the pms fes2 system despite fe2 theoretically being more reactive toward pms activation homogeneous activation of pms by both fe2 and fe3 made a limited contribution to dep degradation figure s7d this was likely due to fe3 being adsorbed on the fes2 surface and reduced by s2 2 to produce surface bound fe ii which efficiently activated pms for dep degradation this hypothesis was supported by the pyrite surfaces being negatively charged at the present reaction ph due to its relatively low isoelectric point ph 1 2 0 4 fornasiero et al 1992 more importantly it has been well established that fe iii can be reduced to fe ii by s2 2 on the surface of pyrite via one electron transfer process rimstidt and vaughan 2003 to test this hypothesis the adsorption of fe3 on the fes2 surface was determined during pms activation and dep degradation as shown in fig 3d the concentration of fe ions in solution decreased rapidly in the pms fes2 system using an fe3 concentration of 50 mg l 26 5 of fe3 was adsorbed on the fes2 surface which indicated that the surface properties of fes2 favored fe ion adsorption during the reaction when fe2 was added it was first oxidized to fe3 by pms this homogenous process made a limited contribution to dep degradation due to the quenching reaction between fe2 and sulfate radicals 109 m 1 s 1 the formed fe3 was then adsorbed onto the fes2 surface and regenerated surface bound fe2 which efficiently activated pms for dep degradation therefore fe3 was more efficient than fe2 at enhancing dep degradation in the pms fes2 system 3 3 2 regeneration of fe ii by s2 2 on the fes2 surface xps was used to characterize fes2 particles before and after pms activation figure s8 shows that fe ii and s2 2 s8 0 were the dominant fe and s species respectively on the fes2 surface before the reaction table s1 the produced fe iii and s8 0 was ascribed to the oxidation by hno3 during the depuration processes after activation reaction fe ii remained the dominant fe species while new s species such as s5 2 were produced from the oxidation of s2 2 by pms or fe iii on the fes2 particle surface xrd analysis also showed that the fes2 phase changed slightly with no obvious new peak formed before or after the reaction figure s1 moreover fe dissolution was limited during pms activation figure s7a these results showed that s2 2 was the dominant electron donor while fe ii regeneration via the reduction of fe iii by s2 2 on the pyrite surface was the key step controlling radical production and pollutant degradation during pms activation by fes2 this meant that the activation efficiency of fes2 would be reduced once s2 2 was consumed because s2 2 would not be regenerated in the pms fes2 system although fe ii would also be generated from the following reactions eqs 1 and 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 fe iii was more preferred to be reduced by s2 2 in the presence of pms after s2 2 was completely consumed the reduction of fe ii by pms was dominant pathway for fe ii regeneration 1 fe iii hso5 fe ii so5 h 2 fe ii hso5 fe iii so4 oh this hypothesis was supported by the dep degradation rate decreasing over five activation cycle experiments figure s9 shows that dep degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 77 in the second cycle and further decreased to 52 4 in the third cycle and finally 32 7 in the fifth cycle the decrease of dep degradation efficiency also indicated that the reduction of fe iii by s2 2 was more efficient than that of fe iii reduced by pms another probable reason for the decrease of dep degradation efficiency during the cycles was the accumulation of degradation intermediates on the surface of fes2 particles 3 3 3 contribution of sulfur conversion to sulfate radical generation 3 3 3 1 so3 2 formation in the pms fes2 system during the fe ii regeneration and pms activation the different sulfur intermediates were formed the first step of fes2 oxidation reportedly produces a sulfur enriched surface rimstidt and vaughan 2003 and similar results were observed in the present study polysulfides such as s5 2 were formed on the fes2 surface as determined by xps the oxidation of disulfide or polysulfides by pms or fe iii produced a series of s species including s2o3 2 s ii so3 2 s iv and so4 2 s vi however these s species were difficult to identify due to their rapid conversion in the presence of pms for example both s2o3 2 and so3 2 were unstable and easily oxidized to so4 2 to address this issue in situ atr ftir was used to identify the kinetics of s species conversion during pms activation by fes2 the pms concentration and fes2 loading used in this experiment were 5 mm and 5 0 g l respectively as shown in fig 4 the so4 2 band at 1100 cm 1 confirmed that so4 2 was the dominant s species at the start of the reaction for fes2 pms or pms alone figure s10 a new band was formed at 946 cm 1 after 10 min which was characteristic of so3 2 according to the ftir spectrum of so3 2 2 0 mm and a previous study chernyshova 2003 however this peak 946 cm 1 decreased markedly when the reaction time was prolonged to 15 min which was attributed to oxidation by pms or fe iii s2o3 2 was not detected due to being rapidly converted to so3 2 or so4 2 these results indicated that so3 2 was indeed formed during the oxidation of s2 2 by pms but rapidly consumed by pms or fe iii 3 3 3 2 pms activation by so3 2 for sulfate radical generation as so3 2 was present in the fes2 pms system it was hypothesized that pms activation by so3 2 was responsible for so4 generation according to follow reaction eq 3 3 hso 3 hso 5 so 4 so 3 h 2 o 4 so 4 h 2 o o h h to confirm this process epr spectra of 0 1 mm so3 2 and 2 0 mm pms were collected using dmpo as shown in fig 5 a no obvious dmpo so4 or dmpo oh epr signals were observed for pms alone but appeared with the addition of so3 2 at 1 min meanwhile the peak intensities of these signals increased markedly when the reaction time was extended to 5 min for example the peak intensity of dmpo oh increased about 1 9 fold when the reaction time was extended from 1 to 5 min these results indicated that so4 was indeed formed and converted to oh according to eqs 3 and 4 despite the epr signal for so3 radicals being observed due to its relatively low concentration furthermore both s2 2 and s2o3 2 made limited contributions to free radical generation as determined by epr figure s11 with the results suggesting that both s2 and s2o3 2 would not activate pms to produce so4 these combined experimental results suggested that so3 2 was the only s species able to activate pms by producing so4 in the fes2 pms system 3 3 3 3 generation of so4 radicals by fe iii fe ii and so3 2 during pms activation by fes2 fe ii was oxidized to fe iii on the surface of fes2 particles according to eq 5 furthermore the coexistence of so3 2 and fe3 has been reported to initiate radical chain reactions to produce so3 and so4 radicals according to the following reactions eqs 5 8 chen et al 2017 5 fe 2 hso 5 so 4 fe 3 ho 6 fe 3 so 3 2 so 3 fe 2 7 so 3 o 2 so 5 8 so 3 2 so 5 so 4 2 so 4 therefore it was hypothesized that the coexistence of fe3 and so3 2 on the fes2 surface would also contribute to so4 generation epr was used to test this hypothesis by determining the free radicals formed in the fe3 so3 2 system as shown in fig 5b a significant epr signal was observed with peak intensities that increased markedly with increasing reaction time in the fe3 so3 2 system simulation of the epr spectrum was used to obtain the hyperfine splitting constants of this epr signal with an an and ah of 14 7 and 16 g figure s6 respectively which were characteristic of the dmpo so3 adduct resulting from the reaction of so3 with dmpo these results indicated that so3 radicals were produced as shown in eq 6 however no dmpo so4 signal was observed according to eqs 7 and 8 which was attributed to dmpo competing with o2 to react with so3 with the high dmpo concentration inhibiting so4 formation in this process to further examine the formation of so4 the dmpo concentration was decreased to 10 mm to trap so3 and so4 as shown in fig 5c only dmpo so3 was observed after 1 min which indicated that so43 was still the dominant reactive species however both dmpo so4 and dmpo oh signals were observed after 5 min as identified by comparing the experimental and simulated spectra of coexisting dmpo so3 dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts figure s6 after extending the reaction time to 20 min dmpo so4 and dmpo oh were the predominant adducts while dmpo so3 had almost disappeared which suggested that so3 was converted to so4 according to eqs 6 8 as the reaction proceeded these results indicated that the reaction of fe3 and so3 2 on the fes2 surface also contributed to so4 generation in the pms fes2 system according to eq 5 it was concluded that oxygen played an important role in so4 radical formation in the pms fes2 system to confirm that this process contributed to dep degradation the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on dep degradation was examined by purging the pms fes2 system with n2 or o2 as shown in fig 6 a dep degradation was greatly inhibited by purging with n2 with the extent of degradation decreasing markedly from 100 to 24 within 120 min and the corresponding kobs decreasing from 0 0331 to 0 0024 min 1 fig 6b this suggested that fe iii so3 2 accounted for 76 of dep degradation and played an important role in dep degradation in the pms fes2 system furthermore rather than enhancing dep degradation purging with o2 also inhibited dep degradation markedly with the kobs decreasing from 0 0331 to 0 0059 min 1 this was likely due to excess o2 acting as an electron quencher to inhibit pms activation in the pms fes2 system despite increasing the production of so4 via eqs 7 and 8 therefore dep degradation was decreased with the results also indicating that the production of superoxide radical anions o2 from the reaction of o2 and electrons made a limited contribution to pms activation despite o2 having been reported to activate ps on the surface of minerals fang et al 2013 3 3 4 proposed pathways of so4 generation by fes2 activated pms according to the above discussion pathways for pms activation by fes2 are proposed in scheme 1 after pms was added to the fes2 suspension fe ii fe ii on the surface of fes2 particles transferred an electron to pms to induce the formation of a sulfate radical and surface fe iii fe iii as fes2 is a semiconductor the electrons can move from lattice s2 to fe iii leading to the regeneration of fe ii and conversion of the s species in the presence of pms or fe iii disulfide s2 2 was oxidized on the fes2 surface to produce polydisulfides such as s5 2 and s8 0 according to the following reactions eqs 9 13 rimstidt and vaughan 2003 9 py s s o r f e i i i p m s py s s 10 py s s h 2 o py s s oh h 11 py s s oh py s so e h 12 py s so h 2 o py s so 2 2 e 2 h 13 py s so 2 h

process to produce electropositive sulfur py s s eq 9 nucleophilic attack by py s s on h2o eq 10 produced py s oh and a hydrogen ion h this cycle was repeated several times to produce py so3 or so3 2 in solution eqs 11 16 in the oxidations of s2 2 and s2o3 2 by pms or fe iii no radical was involved while so3 2 oxidation by pms or fe iii would induce the formation of so3 and so4 so3 was gradually converted to so4 in the presence of oxygen via radical chain reactions consequently so3 2 pms fe ii pms and so3 2 fe iii reactions all accounted for so4 generation in the fes2 pms system sulfate radicals also reacted with h2o or oh groups to produce hydroxyl radicals with both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals contributing to dep degradation 4 conclusions in the present study pms activation by a model sulfur containing mineral fes2 for dep degradation was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were elucidated pms was found to be activated by fes2 to produce so4 and oh which degraded and mineralized dep efficiently epr atr ftir xps and free radical quenching studies were used to further elucidate the activation mechanism the results suggested that sulfides were the dominant electron donor for pms activation and that sulfur conversion processes played an important role in so4 generation in the pms fes2 system fe ii on the fes2 surface activates pms efficiently but s2 2 was the key factor controlling fe ii regeneration and subsequent pms activation meanwhile different sulfur species such as s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 were formed from the regeneration of fe iii and oxidation of fes2 by pms among the different sulfur species so3 2 was also found to account for so4 generation via direct pms activation or fe iii activation to initiate the radical chain reaction

found to be efficiently activated by fes2 for dep degradation and mineralization achieving 58 9 total organic carbon removal using 0 5 g l fes2 and 2 0 mm pms sulfides were the dominant electron donor

pms for contaminant degradation saputra et al 2013a b yu et al 2016 liu et al 2016 for example yu et al reported that pms was catalytically decomposed efficiently by goethite hematite ferrihydrite and birnessite to form free radicals for nitrobenzene degradation yu et al 2016 recently sulfur containing minerals such as pyrite fes2 mackinawite fes and magnetic pyrrhotite have been recognized as efficient activators of oxidants h2o2 ps and o2 for contaminant degradation and water disinfection liang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 oh et al 2011 xia et al 2017b rimstidt and vaughan 2003 zhang et al 2016 for example liang et al found that fe ii of pyrite can activate persulfate efficiently for methyl tert butyl ether oxidation liang et al 2010 in addition the in situ generation of oh from sulfur minerals such as pyrite oxidation by o2 has been reported previously zhang et al 2016 kaur and schoonen 2017 which plays an important role in the transformation of contaminants in the natural occurring environment zhang et al reported that fe ii of pyrite can activate oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species without addition of oxidants zhang et al 2016 fe ii of pyrite is usually considered the dominant factor controlling ps or pms activation and free radical formation because fe ii is an excellent ps and pms activator liang et al 2010 feng et al 2018 however the role of sulfur conversion in free radical generation and contaminant degradation in this process has not been fully explored elucidating the effects of sulfur conversion on free radical generation is also important for ps or pms based in situ chemical oxidation isco remediation of contaminated groundwater and soils this is because the decomposition of pms or ps usually produces a large amount of sulfate ions which would participate in the sulfur cycles in the subsurface environment fang et al 2013 under oxygen limited conditions some reducing sulfur intermediates such as s2 s2o3 2 and so3 2 would be produced from the reduction of sulfate ions in groundwater and soils dockins et al 1980 wine and conrad 1997 the interactions between sulfur intermediates minerals and oxidants would ultimately influence free radical generation contaminant degradation and remediation efficiency therefore this study aimed to i develop an efficient activator of pms for contaminant degradation and explore the mechanism of this process and ii elucidate the role of sulfide or related conversion intermediates in pms activation by pyrite and clarify the mechanism using electron paramagnetic resonance epr free radical quenching reactions x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir diethyl phthalate dep was selected

degradation experiments batch experiments were performed in a plug sealed 250 ml brown flask containing 150 ml of reaction suspension and placed on a magnetic stirrer hj 6 changzhou china at room temperature 25 2 c with a rotary speed of 400 rpm the reaction solution containing dep and pms was prepared with initial ph of 7 0 by adjusting with 1 0 m naoh and 1 0 m h2so4 different amounts of pyrite particles were then added to the reaction solution to initiate degradation the initial concentrations of dep pms and pyrite were 20 mg l 0 5 5 0 mm and 0 1 2 0 g l respectively at different time intervals a 1 ml aliquot of the reaction suspension was withdrawn added to methanol 0 5 ml to quench the reaction and the resulting suspension was filtered through a 0 22 μm ptfe syringe filter the dep concentration dissolved fe and total organic carbon toc in the filtrate were determined using hplc agilent 1200 usa icp ms nexion 300 perkinelmer ca and a toc analyzer toc 42 vcph shimadzu japan respectively to determine degradation intermediates of dep the reaction suspension was extracted with dichloromethane derivatized with n o bis trimethylsilyl trifluoroacetamide bstfa trimethylchlorosilane tmcs 99 1 and analyzed by gc ms gc varian cp3800 ms saturn2200 usa control experiments for dep degradation using fes2 or pms alone were performed under identical reaction conditions all experiments were performed in triplicate to obtain mean values with standard deviation 2 3 2 epr and in situ atr ftir experiments the formation of free radicals such as so4 and oh in the pms pyrite system was determined by epr using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping agent briefly the reaction suspension pyrite pms containing dmpo 0 1 m was added to a quartz tube and analyzed by epr emx 10 12 bruker germany at a resonance frequency of 9 77 ghz microwave power of 19 97 mw modulation amplitude of 1 0 g sweep width of 100 g time constant of 40 96 ms sweep time of 83 89 s and receiver gain of 1 0 103 to analyze the formation of sulfite sulfate and hydroxyl radicals in the fe iii so3 2 system the same epr parameters were used as above except for the dmpo concentration 10 mm and receiver gain 2 0 104 in situ attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ftir experiments were performed using a nicolet is 10 spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa coupled with a diamond crystal as reactor scanning 32 times with a resolution of 2 cm 1 atr ftir experiments were performed using the following procedure fes2 particles were deposited on the diamond surface of the atr ftir device pms solution was dropped on the fes2 surface to initiate the reaction the final pms concentration and fes2 loading were 5 0 mm and 5 0 g l respectively spectra were collected at different reaction intervals other analysis methods used in this study are shown in text s2 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of dep by pms activated using different pyrite fes2 loadings figure s2ashows that 55 of dep 20 mg l was degraded by pms 2 0 mm in the presence of pyrite 0 1 g l while only 8 of dep was decayed by pms or fes2 alone 2 0 g l when the fes2 loading was increased to 2 0 g l dep was completely degraded within 30 min the pseudo first order reaction rate constants kobs of dep degradation increasing from 0 0025 to 0 1273 min 1 as the fes2 loading was increased from 0 1 to 2 0 g l fig 1 a these results indicated that fes2 was effective at activating pms for dep degradation with higher fes2 loadings favoring pms activation and dep degradation figure s3 shows that increasing the pms concentration favored dep degradation with kobs increased from 0 0210 to 0 0553 min 1 as the pms concentration was increased from 0 5 to 1 0 mm figure s3c further increasing the pms concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mm did not produce a significant change in kobs which indicated that the fes2 loading was the dominant factor influencing dep degradation in the excess of pms toc removal was also examined as a function of fes2 loading fig 1b shows that the toc removal increased with increasing fes2 loading from 0 1 to 0 5 g l and a maximum toc removal of 61 1 was achieved using a fes2 loading of 1 0 g l further increasing the fes2 loading to 2 0 and 5 0 g l decreased the toc removal to 50 5 and 44 7 respectively these results indicated that pms activation by fes2 can partially mineralize dep with excess fes2 making a limited contribution to increased toc removal despite an increased fes2 loading accelerating the dep degradation rate significantly fig 1a gc ms analysis were carried out after silylation and four primary silylated intermediates were identified by mass spectral search against the gc ms nist database and the products of dep degradation reported in the previous study chen et al 2016 figure s4 the corresponding structures without silyl groups were identified as monoethyl phthalate mep phthalic acid pa meta hydroxy dep m oh dep and another hydroxylated dep oh dep figure s5 shows that the intensity profiles of the three main products pa mep and m oh dep increased markedly at 60 min and then decayed significantly as the reaction time was prolonged to 240 min which indicated that these intermediates rapidly accumulated at the beginning of the reaction due to fast degradation of dep by free radicals however these intermediates were further degraded and finally mineralized with prolonged reaction time as supported by the toc analysis shown in fig 1b these combined results further indicated that pms activation by fes2 both degraded and mineralized pollutants efficiently 3 2 free radical quenching and epr studies free radical quenching studies were used to identify the dominant radicals in dep degradation fig 2 a shows that dep degradation was greatly inhibited and the dep degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 13 9 and 27 1 with the addition of 10 mm of methanol meoh and tert butyl alcohol tba respectively the results indicate that oh would be the dominant radical accounted for dep degradation but oh derived from the reaction between so4 and h2o oh thus so4 is still the dominant radical controlling dep degradation in the fes2 pms system to further verify this process epr was performed using dmpo as the trapping reagent to detect the dominant radicals as shown in fig 2b epr signals for both so4 and oh dmpo adducts were observed assigned according to their hyperfine splitting constants dmpo so4 an 13 2 g ah 9 6 1 48 and 0 98 g dmpo oh an ah 14 9 g as simulated by epr software figure s6 this indicated that both so4 and oh were generated from pms activation by fes2 the peak intensities of the epr signals increased about 6 6 fold as the fes2 loading was increased from 0 1 to 2 0 g l which suggested that pms activation was greatly enhanced by increasing fes2 loading furthermore the peak intensities of the epr signals increased markedly when the reaction time was extended from 1 to 3 min with only slight changes after 3 min which indicated that so4 and oh were generated at a high and constant rate in the pms fes2 system fig 2c fig 2d shows that increasing pms concentration favored so4 and oh formation the peak intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts increased about 2 2 fold when the pms concentration was increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mm free radical quenching combined with epr results indicated that pms was efficiently activated by fes2 to produce so4 and oh with both types of radical responsible for dep degradation 3 3 mechanism of pms activation by fes2 3 3 1 fe dissolution and cycle although the reaction ph decreased rapidly from 7 0 to 3 0 3 5 during dep degradation due to the decomposition of pms the concentration of fe ion dissolution was 3 4 mg l at a reaction time of 60 min with fes2 loading and pms concentration of 2 0 g l and 2 0 mm respectively figure s7a the dissolved fe ion concentration only accounted for 0 36 of the total fes2 loading used in the fes2 pms system furthermore the concentration of fe ions dissolved in the fes2 pms system was significantly higher than that in the fes2 pms dep system this was due to fes2 being oxidized by free radicals in the absence of dep which increased the dissolution of fe ion these combined results indicated that the presence of dep decreased fes2 dissolution and increased its reactivity in the pms activation process homogenous activation of pms by fe2 or fe3 ion has also been shown to degrade contaminants zou et al 2013 to further test the contribution of fe ion to pms activation for dep degradation the effects of fe2 and fe3 ions on dep degradation in the fes2 pms system were examined fig 3 a and b shows that dep degradation was greatly enhanced by the addition of fe2 or fe3 with the kobs of dep degradation increasing from 0 0209 to 0 0507 min 1 or 0 0209 to 0 0871 min 1 when the fe2 or fe3 concentration was increased from 0 to 50 mg l which indicated that both fe2 and fe3 favored pms activation by fes2 fig 3c fig s7b and s7c interestingly fe3 was found to be more effective than fe2 at enhancing dep in the pms fes2 system despite fe2 theoretically being more reactive toward pms activation homogeneous activation of pms by both fe2 and fe3 made a limited contribution to dep degradation figure s7d this was likely due to fe3 being adsorbed on the fes2 surface and reduced by s2 2 to produce surface bound fe ii which efficiently activated pms for dep degradation this hypothesis was supported by the pyrite surfaces being negatively charged at the present reaction ph due to its relatively low isoelectric point ph 1 2 0 4 fornasiero et al 1992 more importantly it has been well established that fe iii can be reduced to fe ii by s2 2 on the surface of pyrite via one electron transfer process rimstidt and vaughan 2003 to test this hypothesis the adsorption of fe3 on the fes2 surface was determined during pms activation and dep degradation as shown in fig 3d the concentration of fe ions in solution decreased rapidly in the pms fes2 system using an fe3 concentration of 50 mg l 26 5 of fe3 was adsorbed on the fes2 surface which indicated that the surface properties of fes2 favored fe ion adsorption during the reaction when fe2 was added it was first oxidized to fe3 by pms this homogenous process made a limited contribution to dep degradation due to the quenching reaction between fe2 and sulfate radicals 109 m 1 s 1 the formed fe3 was then adsorbed onto the fes2 surface and regenerated surface bound fe2 which efficiently activated pms for dep degradation therefore fe3 was more efficient than fe2 at enhancing dep degradation in the pms fes2 system 3 3 2 regeneration of fe ii by s2 2 on the fes2 surface xps was used to characterize fes2 particles before and after pms activation figure s8 shows that fe ii and s2 2 s8 0 were the dominant fe and s species respectively on the fes2 surface before the reaction table s1 the produced fe iii and s8 0 was ascribed to the oxidation by hno3 during the depuration processes after activation reaction fe ii remained the dominant fe species while new s species such as s5 2 were produced from the oxidation of s2 2 by pms or fe iii on the fes2 particle surface xrd analysis also showed that the fes2 phase changed slightly with no obvious new peak formed before or after the reaction figure s1 moreover fe dissolution was limited during pms activation figure s7a these results showed that s2 2 was the dominant electron donor while fe ii regeneration via the reduction of fe iii by s2 2 on the pyrite surface was the key step controlling radical production and pollutant degradation during pms activation by fes2 this meant that the activation efficiency of fes2 would be reduced once s2 2 was consumed because s2 2 would not be regenerated in the pms fes2 system although fe ii would also be generated from the following reactions eqs 1 and 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 fe iii was more preferred to be reduced by s2 2 in the presence of pms after s2 2 was completely consumed the reduction of fe ii by pms was dominant pathway for fe ii regeneration 1 fe iii hso5 fe ii so5 h 2 fe ii hso5 fe iii so4 oh this hypothesis was supported by the dep degradation rate decreasing over five activation cycle experiments figure s9 shows that dep degradation efficiency decreased from 100 to 77 in the second cycle and further decreased to 52 4 in the third cycle and finally 32 7 in the fifth cycle the decrease of dep degradation efficiency also indicated that the reduction of fe iii by s2 2 was more efficient than that of fe iii reduced by pms another probable reason for the decrease of dep degradation efficiency during the cycles was the accumulation of degradation intermediates on the surface of fes2 particles 3 3 3 contribution of sulfur conversion to sulfate radical generation 3 3 3 1 so3 2 formation in the pms fes2 system during the fe ii regeneration and pms activation the different sulfur intermediates were formed the first step of fes2 oxidation reportedly produces a sulfur enriched surface rimstidt and vaughan 2003 and similar results were observed in the present study polysulfides such as s5 2 were formed on the fes2 surface as determined by xps the oxidation of disulfide or polysulfides by pms or fe iii produced a series of s species including s2o3 2 s ii so3 2 s iv and so4 2 s vi however these s species were difficult to identify due to their rapid conversion in the presence of pms for example both s2o3 2 and so3 2 were unstable and easily oxidized to so4 2 to address this issue in situ atr ftir was used to identify the kinetics of s species conversion during pms activation by fes2 the pms concentration and fes2 loading used in this experiment were 5 mm and 5 0 g l respectively as shown in fig 4 the so4 2 band at 1100 cm 1 confirmed that so4 2 was the dominant s species at the start of the reaction for fes2 pms or pms alone figure s10 a new band was formed at 946 cm 1 after 10 min which was characteristic of so3 2 according to the ftir spectrum of so3 2 2 0 mm and a previous study chernyshova 2003 however this peak 946 cm 1 decreased markedly when the reaction time was prolonged to 15 min which was attributed to oxidation by pms or fe iii s2o3 2 was not detected due to being rapidly converted to so3 2 or so4 2 these results indicated that so3 2 was indeed formed during the oxidation of s2 2 by pms but rapidly consumed by pms or fe iii 3 3 3 2 pms activation by so3 2 for sulfate radical generation as so3 2 was present in the fes2 pms system it was hypothesized that pms activation by so3 2 was responsible for so4 generation according to follow reaction eq 3 3 hso 3 hso 5 so 4 so 3 h 2 o 4 so 4 h 2 o o h h to confirm this process epr spectra of 0 1 mm so3 2 and 2 0 mm pms were collected using dmpo as shown in fig 5 a no obvious dmpo so4 or dmpo oh epr signals were observed for pms alone but appeared with the addition of so3 2 at 1 min meanwhile the peak intensities of these signals increased markedly when the reaction time was extended to 5 min for example the peak intensity of dmpo oh increased about 1 9 fold when the reaction time was extended from 1 to 5 min these results indicated that so4 was indeed formed and converted to oh according to eqs 3 and 4 despite the epr signal for so3 radicals being observed due to its relatively low concentration furthermore both s2 2 and s2o3 2 made limited contributions to free radical generation as determined by epr figure s11 with the results suggesting that both s2 and s2o3 2 would not activate pms to produce so4 these combined experimental results suggested that so3 2 was the only s species able to activate pms by producing so4 in the fes2 pms system 3 3 3 3 generation of so4 radicals by fe iii fe ii and so3 2 during pms activation by fes2 fe ii was oxidized to fe iii on the surface of fes2 particles according to eq 5 furthermore the coexistence of so3 2 and fe3 has been reported to initiate radical chain reactions to produce so3 and so4 radicals according to the following reactions eqs 5 8 chen et al 2017 5 fe 2 hso 5 so 4 fe 3 ho 6 fe 3 so 3 2 so 3 fe 2 7 so 3 o 2 so 5 8 so 3 2 so 5 so 4 2 so 4 therefore it was hypothesized that the coexistence of fe3 and so3 2 on the fes2 surface would also contribute to so4 generation epr was used to test this hypothesis by determining the free radicals formed in the fe3 so3 2 system as shown in fig 5b a significant epr signal was observed with peak intensities that increased markedly with increasing reaction time in the fe3 so3 2 system simulation of the epr spectrum was used to obtain the hyperfine splitting constants of this epr signal with an an and ah of 14 7 and 16 g figure s6 respectively which were characteristic of the dmpo so3 adduct resulting from the reaction of so3 with dmpo these results indicated that so3 radicals were produced as shown in eq 6 however no dmpo so4 signal was observed according to eqs 7 and 8 which was attributed to dmpo competing with o2 to react with so3 with the high dmpo concentration inhibiting so4 formation in this process to further examine the formation of so4 the dmpo concentration was decreased to 10 mm to trap so3 and so4 as shown in fig 5c only dmpo so3 was observed after 1 min which indicated that so43 was still the dominant reactive species however both dmpo so4 and dmpo oh signals were observed after 5 min as identified by comparing the experimental and simulated spectra of coexisting dmpo so3 dmpo so4 and dmpo oh adducts figure s6 after extending the reaction time to 20 min dmpo so4 and dmpo oh were the predominant adducts while dmpo so3 had almost disappeared which suggested that so3 was converted to so4 according to eqs 6 8 as the reaction proceeded these results indicated that the reaction of fe3 and so3 2 on the fes2 surface also contributed to so4 generation in the pms fes2 system according to eq 5 it was concluded that oxygen played an important role in so4 radical formation in the pms fes2 system to confirm that this process contributed to dep degradation the effect of dissolved oxygen concentration on dep degradation was examined by purging the pms fes2 system with n2 or o2 as shown in fig 6 a dep degradation was greatly inhibited by purging with n2 with the extent of degradation decreasing markedly from 100 to 24 within 120 min and the corresponding kobs decreasing from 0 0331 to 0 0024 min 1 fig 6b this suggested that fe iii so3 2 accounted for 76 of dep degradation and played an important role in dep degradation in the pms fes2 system furthermore rather than enhancing dep degradation purging with o2 also inhibited dep degradation markedly with the kobs decreasing from 0 0331 to 0 0059 min 1 this was likely due to excess o2 acting as an electron quencher to inhibit pms activation in the pms fes2 system despite increasing the production of so4 via eqs 7 and 8 therefore dep degradation was decreased with the results also indicating that the production of superoxide radical anions o2 from the reaction of o2 and electrons made a limited contribution to pms activation despite o2 having been reported to activate ps on the surface of minerals fang et al 2013 3 3 4 proposed pathways of so4 generation by fes2 activated pms according to the above discussion pathways for pms activation by fes2 are proposed in scheme 1 after pms was added to the fes2 suspension fe ii fe ii on the surface of fes2 particles transferred an electron to pms to induce the formation of a sulfate radical and surface fe iii fe iii as fes2 is a semiconductor the electrons can move from lattice s2 to fe iii leading to the regeneration of fe ii and conversion of the s species in the presence of pms or fe iii disulfide s2 2 was oxidized on the fes2 surface to produce polydisulfides such as s5 2 and s8 0 according to the following reactions eqs 9 13 rimstidt and vaughan 2003 9 py s s o r f e i i i p m s py s s 10 py s s h 2 o py s s oh h 11 py s s oh py s so e h 12 py s so h 2 o py s so 2 2 e 2 h 13 py s so 2 h 2 o py s so 3 2 e 2 h 14 py s so 3 py s py so 3 15 py s so 3 py s 2 o 3 2 16 s 2 o 3 2 2 h s h 2 so 3 the disulfide or polydisulfide was then oxidized by pms or fe iii via a single electron transfer process to produce electropositive sulfur py s s eq 9 nucleophilic attack by py s s on h2o eq 10 produced py s oh and a hydrogen ion h this cycle was repeated several times to produce py so3 or so3 2 in solution eqs 11 16 in the oxidations of s2 2 and s2o3 2 by pms or fe iii no radical was involved while so3 2 oxidation by pms or fe iii would induce the formation of so3 and so4 so3 was gradually converted to so4 in the presence of oxygen via radical chain reactions consequently so3 2 pms fe ii pms and so3 2 fe iii reactions all accounted for so4 generation in the fes2 pms system sulfate radicals also reacted with h2o or oh groups to produce hydroxyl radicals with both sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals contributing to dep degradation 4 conclusions in the present study pms activation by a model sulfur containing mineral fes2 for dep degradation was investigated and the underlying mechanisms were elucidated pms was found to be activated by fes2 to produce so4 and oh which degraded and mineralized dep efficiently epr atr ftir xps and free radical quenching studies were used to further elucidate the activation mechanism the results suggested that sulfides were the dominant electron donor for pms activation and that sulfur conversion processes played an important role in so4 generation in the pms fes2 system fe ii on the fes2 surface activates pms efficiently but s2 2 was the key factor controlling fe ii regeneration and subsequent pms activation meanwhile different sulfur species such as s2o3 2 so3 2 and so4 2 were formed from the regeneration of fe iii and oxidation of fes2 by pms among the different sulfur species so3 2 was also found to account for so4 generation via direct pms activation or fe iii activation to initiate the radical chain reaction this study highlights the important role of sulfur conversion in pms activation by pyrite and provides new insights into the mechanism of oxidant activation by sulfur containing minerals

anthropogenic compound is one of the most common groundwater contaminants and often accumulates in aquifers as dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl with other halogenated volatile organic compounds halogenated voc muller et al 2011a us epa 2013 in situ bioremediation may be a promising strategy to detoxify contaminated sites because of its demonstrated efficiency and relatively low cost pandey

detailed protocols to visualise dissimilarities between bacterial taxa associated with dcm degradation principal component analysis pca based on bray curtis dissimilarities of hellinger transformed data was used legendre and gallagher 2001 the relationship between community profiles and hydrogeochemical variables was evaluated by fitting environmental vectors a posteriori onto the pca significance of the fitted vectors was assessed by conducting a 1000 step monte carlo permutation test only hydrochemical variables with p 0 05 were considered significant 3 results 3 1 distribution of halogenated voc and hydrogeochemical conditions although chlorinated ethenes predominate at the investigated site dcm makes a significant contribution to total halogenated voc notably at the source fig 1 cis dce dcm and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca were the main halogenated voc in the source zone 104 61 87 75 and 24 21 mg l 1 respectively n 12 the average proportion of dcm vs halogenated voc in the source and the plume varied among wells figs 1 and si section b chloroform cf which may be a source of dcm when degraded by anoxic bacteria chan et al 2012 lee et al 2012 2015 showed concentrations in the same range as those of dcm in wells pz28 and pz27 and one order of magnitude lower in wells pz26 pz29 and pz5 figs 1 and si section b hydrogeochemical conditions varied spatially suggesting a typical source plume boundary zonation of terminal electron accepting processes see si section a variations in contaminant concentrations may reflect seasonal dynamics of groundwater recharge washington and cameron 2001 see si section b negative redox potential and dissolved oxygen concentrations of about 0 9 1 0 mg l 1 n 16 in the source zone and the plume indicated reducing conditions concentrations of ferrous iron up to 90 33 mg l 1 in pz3 were indicative of iron iii reduction and detection of sulfide suggested sulfate as a relevant electron acceptor in the source and the plume dissolved oxygen concentrations above 1 mg l 1 and eh 0 mv in the plume boundary zone indicated mostly oxic conditions 3 2 distribution of genes associated with dcm biodegradation abundance of the 16s rrna gene was essentially stable with variations usually within an order of magnitude it was highest in the source zone pz26 and pz27 up to 3 4 1011 copies l 1 and decreased in the plume and the plume boundary fig 2 abundance of the dcma gene varied over time within an order of magnitude in the source zone and more widely in the plume zone but was not detected in the plume boundary fig 2 unlike dcma dhla gene abundance varied over time in the source zone fig 2 and was also detected in the boundary zone pz15 abundance of dcma was 5 source to 8 plume orders of magnitude lower compared to rrna relative abundance of dhla compared to rrna was at least one order of magnitude lower than that of dcma in the source zone 3 3 laboratory microcosms and dcm degrading isolates upon incubation dcm concentration remained constant in oxic and anoxic laboratory groundwater microcosms which were not inoculated with hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 except those with pz28 groundwater dcm dissipation occurred in non inoculated pz28 microcosms under oxic conditions but was slow and not complete after 55 days of incubation fig 3 in pz28 microcosms inoculated with hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 dcm was completely dissipated in 23 days under oxic conditions with concomitant chloride accumulation and no apparent lag phase fig 3 whereas dcm was dissipated in 55 days under anoxic conditions si section m similarly microcosms with groundwater from pz29 pz3 pz6 10 pz11 and pz15 showed complete dcm dissipation within 55 days upon amendment with strain gj21 under both oxic and anoxic conditions except for pz3 and pz29 microcosms under anoxic conditions see si section m in comparison dcm was dissipated in 4 days in microcosms with strain gj21 inoculated in sgw mineral medium no significant dcm dissipation was observed in autoclaved controls altogether this confirmed that dcm degrading microorganisms may develop in contaminated groundwater under oxic and anoxic conditions the lag phase was longer in anoxic microcosms and also in microcosms from groundwater highly contaminated with halogenated voc pz3 pz28 pz29 compared to those with lower contaminant concentrations pz11 pz15 si section m this suggests that besides hydrogeological conditions the nature and level of contamination as well as associated toxicity may also affect in situ dcm biodegradation in groundwater obtained sequences of the 16s rrna gene for isolates t28 1 and t28 3 from groundwater pz28 microcosms were identical their closest described relative is the chloromethane degrading hyphomicrobium sp strain lat3 99 identity borodina et al 2005 whereas the dcm degrading hyphomicrobium sp gj21 showed 94 sequence identity see si section n the dcma sequence of the new isolates differed from that of strain gj21 by 11 snps for t28 1 7 amino acid differences and 7 snps 5 amino acid differences for t28 3 notably some of these snps i e 3 snps in strain t28 1 positions 97 114 and 691 of the methylobacterium extorquens dm4 reference and 2 snps in strain t28 3 positions 449 and 778 see si section o had not been detected previously vuilleumier et al 2001 3 4 quantification of in situ dcm degradation 3 4 1 carbon isotopic fractionation from laboratory microcosms δ13c values ranging between 40 and 100 indicated strong enrichment of 13c in dcm during biodegradation in agreement with previous studies nikolausz et al 2006 see si section p for rayleigh plots differences in isotope fractionation were observed depending both on the dcm degrading strain and cultivation conditions the value of εc for dcm degradation by hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 in synthetic medium under oxic conditions 31 3 was similar to that obtained under denitrifying conditions 26 4 tables 1 and si section p however the value of ε c for dcm degradation by strain gj21 under oxic conditions was higher i e less isotopic fractionation in sterilized groundwater from pz28 than in synthetic medium whereas no significant differences were observed under anoxic conditions for strain t28 1 ε c was close to previously reported values ε c values from 46 to 43 for hyphomicrobium sp strain mc8b heraty et al 1999 for strain t28 3 37 4 the ε c value was higher and closer to that of strain gj21 in synthetic medium 31 3 table 1 3 4 2 δ13c of dcm and extent of dcm biodegradation in groundwater carbon isotope composition δ13c of dcm could only be determined in pz27 pz28 and pz29 from the source zone and pz5 from the plume zone table 2 since dcm was below detection limits in the other wells the lowest δ13c value obtained well pz29 was used to represent the isotopic composition of the source r0 assuming that dcm was least degraded at this location richnow et al 2003 changes in δ13c larger than 2 downstream in the groundwater flow path between source and plume confirmed pollutant biodegradation extent of dcm biodegradation was similar in the different campaigns table 2 estimated dcm biodegradation was up to 85 in pz27 upstream of pz29 february 2017 55 2 downstream of the water flow path pz5 february 2017 and only 15 3 in pz28 source zone february 2016 the presence of cf in anoxic areas of the site mainly in wells pz28 and pz27 see si section b is worthy of note cf can be reductively dehalogenated to dcm by some anoxic bacteria which are often taxonomically closely related to anoxic dcm degraders chan et al 2012 lee et al 2012 2015 and in environments from which anoxic dcm degraders were isolated although cf was not found at the dcm source pz29 an isotope mass balance accounting for sequential degradation of cf and dcm could be determined for pz28 and pz27 see si section q this analysis supports concomitant cf and dcm degradation in pz27 with δ13c cf dcm varying over time from 14 4 0 4 to 4 7 0 9 at pz28 in contrast δ13c cf dcm remained below 34 1 0 8 suggesting that the source of cf at the site is located at the level of pz28 3 5 composition of bacterial communities with respect to dcm degradation alpha diversity of the bacterial groundwater community see si section k was similar to that observed in other contaminated aquifers wenderoth et al 2003 feris et al 2004 the distribution of taxa potentially associated with dcm degradation 97 identity in 16s rrna gene sequence with known dcm degrading strains significantly differed between the source and the plume on the one hand and the plume boundary on the other hand p 0 05 and did not change significantly over time i e on a seasonal or yearly basis fig 4 a changes in such taxa correlated best with halogenated voc concentrations redox potential and nitrate nitrite concentrations p 0 05 fig 4b but not with relative abundance of dcma and dhla genes taxa associated with dcm degradation were rare 3 in almost all wells but their relative abundance also differed widely between different zones of the contaminated site si section r operational taxonomic units otus closely related to strain dcmf lee et al 2015 occurred in low redox and highly contaminated wells source pz28 pz29 and plume pz3 pz5 zones in contrast the otu most closely related to the 2 hyphomicrobium strains isolates from well pz28 see section 3 2 and those related to methylophilus leisingeri bader and leisinger 1994 and to bacillus sp strain dma mägli et al 1995 were mainly found in more oxic zones of the plume boundary pz15 pz11 pz17 pz18 other taxa previously associated with dcm biodegradation such as dehalobacter justicia leon et al 2012 xanthobacter autotrophicus janssen et al 1989 and candidatus dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis kleindienst et al 2017 occurred at lower abundance mainly in highly contaminated zones and under reducing conditions the relative abundance of one of the two phylotypes affiliated to presumably dcm fermenting strain dcmf isolated from an organochlorine contaminated site in australia lee et al 2012 2015 was generally one order of magnitude higher than that of the common organohalide dehalorespiring dehalococcoides at the source and in the plume see si section r 4 discussion in this study dcm biodegradation potential in a multi contaminated aquifer was newly evaluated by a combination of experimental approaches this included i qpcr and dna sequencing to evaluate in situ distribution of dehalogenase genes and taxa associated with dcm degradation referred to as biomarkers for short in the following ii ex situ microcosms to evaluate dcm degradation kinetics and isotopic fractionation and iii csia of dcm to estimate in situ the extent of dcm degradation at the site 4 1 dcm degradation potential based on ex situ microcosms microcosm experiments revealed the potential of dcm biodegradation under oxic and anoxic conditions in contaminated groundwater observed differences in lag phase duration before onset of growth of hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 in contaminated groundwater from different piezometers correlated with groundwater contamination level this suggests that toxicity of contaminated groundwater likely affects performance of dcm degrading bacteria as observed previously for tce biodegradation adamson and parkin 2000 in addition redox conditions may also influence prevailing types of dcm degraders and in turn impact dcm degradation kinetics for example sulfate reducing and or methanogenic conditions in the source and plume zones are expected to favor anoxic fermentative biodegradation of dcm lee et al 2015 however the occurrence of facultatively anoxic methylotrophic taxa associated with dcm degradation in the source zone revealed by the isolation of two novel dcm degrading hyphomicrobium sp strains suggests less reduced microenvironments in the source zone in addition carbon isotopic fractionation for dcm under different redox conditions suggest that both oxic and anoxic dcm biodegradation may occur in highly contaminated aquifer zones of the plume laboratory experiments also allowed to derive new reference carbon isotopic fractionation ε c for dcm biodegradation by hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 and for the novel strains t28 1 and t28 3 table 1 these differed from many of the previously reported ε c values for dcm degradation several potential explanations for these findings may be envisaged first of all differences in environmental conditions may influence εc values for instance observed differences in ε c during degradation of dcm by strain gj21 under oxic conditions between synthetic culture medium ε c 31 3 and contaminated pz28 groundwater ε c 22 4 may be associated with higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in groundwater 562 mg l 1 in average on pz28 doc could be used as an auxiliary carbon source and thereby affect growth dcm degradation kinetics i e 0 04 and 3 1 10 3 mm dcm h 1 for gj21 under oxic conditions in synthetic culture medium and pz28 groundwater respectively and potentially isotope fractionation kampara et al 2008 2009 moreover toxic effects of dcm and co contaminants may cause adaptive changes in cell wall composition during the degradation period i e 55 days for denitrifying conditions murínová and dercová 2014 and thereby affect dcm diffusive transport and potentially influence ε c values renpenning et al 2015 deipser and stegmann 1997 the observed range of ε c values for biodegradation of dcm by different bacteria may also primarily reflect different dcm degradation mechanisms elsner 2010 that prevail under different redox conditions table 1 here however ε c obtained for dcm during oxic and denitrifying biodegradation involving hydrolytic transformation and potentially the dehalogenase dcma were surprisingly close to those for anoxic fermentative transformation by dehalobacterium sp mägli et al 1996 trueba santiso et al 2017 on the other hand isotope fractionation may also reflect the underlying reaction chemistry and thus depend on structural variations of the dehalogenase and its active site that may its kinetic properties nikolausz et al 2006 thus structural modifications of the enzyme nikolausz et al 2006 originating from differences in the protein sequences of dcma see si section o may result in different ε c for strains using the same dcm degradation pathway involving the dehalogenase dcma table 1 finally obtained values may also reflect differences in experimental procedures used for ε c determination including analytical accuracy of dcm quantification and δ13c measurements and uncertainty estimation ci 95 or standard deviation in addition mass removal due to repetitive sampling may bias ε c determination buchner et al 2017 this effect was negligible in our case with variation of dcm concentration in the aqueous phase less than 4 after three successive measurements ensuring reliable ε c determination summing up csia of dcm based on carbon alone may not be sufficient to untangle dcm hydrolytic transformation from dcm fermentation in the future multi element csia of dcm δ2h δ13c and δ37cl could be applied for source apportionment as well as to decipher strain specific dcm degradation for the same biochemical reaction or discriminate degradation pathways vogt et al 2016 4 2 field distribution of dcm associated taxa and dcm genes we explored whether the abundance of known dcm degradation genes and associated bacterial taxa could be used as biomarkers to evaluate dcm biodegradation potential in the investigated aquifer figs 2 and 4 unfortunately such genes and the corresponding pathways are not yet well characterised under anoxic conditions abundance of dcma and dhla genes generally found in aerobes was higher in contaminated zones with highly reducing conditions and low oxygen fig 2 in agreement with previous studies e g rodríguez fernández et al 2018 this suggests that abundance of bacteria with these genes is mainly driven by pollutant level and further supports the notion that microoxic environments may also occur in the plume and the source zones of the contaminated site notably the distribution of taxa with representatives known to contain dcma did not match patterns of dcma gene abundance in the plume figs 2 and si section r this points to a still incomplete inventory of microorganisms containing dcma fig 4 in contrast distribution of dhla followed that of xanthobacter sp suggesting dhla as a robust biomarker of biodegradation of dcm as well as of other chlorinated alkanes transformed by haloalkane dehalogenase dhla such as 1 2 dca munro et al 2013 including in more highly contaminated nobre and nobre 2004 predominantly anoxic parts of the site unfortunately no other dehalogenase genes for dcm are presently available despite multiple ongoing studies e g kleindienst et al 2017 lee et al 2015 we thus extended this analysis using the 16s rrna gene taxonomic biomarker focusing on taxa featuring cultured representatives with a demonstrated ability to degrade dcm both total bacterial richness schao and relative abundance of taxa potentially associated with dcm degradation changed along with contaminant level see si sections k and r further the obtained data suggest that the distribution of taxa associated with dcm degradation may also occur in relation to their sensitivity to pollutant mixtures fig 4 indeed increased occurrence of aerobes and facultative anaerobes such as hyphomicrobium methylophilus and bacillus in less contaminated zones of the plume as observed here was already reported previously e g kohler staub et al 1995 freedman et al 1997 muller et al 2011a in addition observed changes in relative abundance of different taxa associated with dcm degradation depending on redox potential or nitrate nitrite concentrations fits predicted favored metabolic regimes of corresponding taxa under different redox conditions in groundwater see si sections a and r under more anoxic zones on site taxa affiliated to dehalobacter sp justicia leon et al 2012 candidatus dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis kleindienst et al 2017 and strain dcmf lee et al 2015 were found indicating the occurrence of anoxic dcm degraders fig 4 on the other hand bacterial populations related to the fermentative dcm degrader dehalobacterium formicoaceticum mägli et al 1996 were not detected interestingly taxa bearing potential for anoxic dcm fermentation were essentially associated to the highly contaminated and reduced zone of the plume particularly for those related to dehalobacter sp and strain dcmf this is consistent with strict anoxic and obligatory dehalorespiring metabolism of these strains justicia leon et al 2012 among the two otus affiliated with strain dcmf on the site only one was typically found in contaminated wells with low redox potential this suggests that only strains within the otu associated with high contaminant levels feature strains capable of dcm biodegradation 4 3 combining bacterial biomarkers and csia to evaluate dcm degradation in situ potential molecular biomarkers alone are not sufficient to prove dcm biodegradation and our results also suggest that their occurrence in groundwater may not be directly correlated with observed changes in dcm concentration which depends on processes of unknown nature and magnitude in this work the csia approach also allowed to quantify in situ biodegradation of dcm independently of degradation independent concentration changes assuming that isotope fractionation due to dcm abiotic degradation was negligible under groundwater conditions as previously suggested tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 the extent of biodegradation estimated considering a panel of microbial degradation pathways potentially active in the aquifer remained constant in the investigated wells over the short investigation period of this study 2015 2017 this suggests low temporal variability of in situ dcm biodegradation characteristics table 2 nevertheless the differences observed in the extent of biodegradation along the different flow paths from the source pz29 to wells downstream pz28 pz27 and pz5 may reflect different groundwater hydrogeochemistry and associated bacterial populations involved in dcm degradation atashgahi et al 2017 for instance biodegradation over the short initial distance pz29 pz28 was estimated to be modest suggesting a limited onset of dcm biodegradation near the source table 2 in contrast up to 85 biodegradation is predicted for the flow path pz29 pz27 indicating a hot spot of dcm biodegradation in this area indeed time and distance dependent in situ first order biodegradation rate constants λt λs were consistently higher for this flow path table 2 suggestive of enhanced dcm biodegradation worthy of note this fits well with the observed patterns of relative abundance of taxa associated with anoxic dcm biodegradation as well as of dcma and dhla genes in well pz27 similarly extensive biodegradation up to 55 was also estimated over the longer flow path pz29 pz5 heading further downstream taxa associated with anoxic dcm degraders notably strain dcmf were abundant at the source zone as well as in the downstream plume highlighting the prevalence of anoxic dcm biodegradation 5 conclusions the present study aimed to demonstrate the biodegradation potential of dcm at a former industrial site multi contaminated with many halogenated voc the combination of csia and biomarker analysis confirmed that biodegradation significantly contributed to the observed dcm concentration gradient and to dcm mass depletion in the plume laboratory experiments also demonstrated an intrinsic biodegradation potential of dcm in oxic groundwater from the site our study thus shows that biodegradation of dcm in multi contaminated groundwater can be reliably evaluated by combining complementary in situ and ex situ dna based and chemical approaches gaps of knowledge on relevant dehalogenase genes and associated metabolic pathways for microbial transformation of dcm under anoxic conditions currently represent the main limitation in assessment and application of dcm biodegradation this highlights the need for further fundamental research to

halogenated voc muller et al 2011a us epa 2013 in situ bioremediation may be a promising strategy to detoxify contaminated sites because of its demonstrated efficiency and relatively low cost pandey et al 2009 several laboratory studies have examined mechanisms of microbial dcm degradation in labo under both oxic and anoxic conditions however little is known about biodegradation of dcm in polluted groundwater in particular the diversity and distribution of bacteria and dehalogenase genes associated with dcm biodegradation have not yet been fully explored wright et al 2017 known dcm degraders using dcm as source of carbon and energy are mostly gram negative facultative methylotrophic bacteria mainly belonging to hyphomicrobium e g strains dm2 and gj21 methylobacterium strain dm4 and methylopila vuilleumier et al 2001 muller et al 2011a dcm biodegradation involves a glutathione s transferase gst encoded by the dcma gene leisinger et al 1994 co metabolic dcm biodegradation by the haloalkane dehalogenase dhla a non specific and broad spectrum dehalogenase janssen et al 1989 mainly found in xanthobacter ancylobacter and azoarcus strains munro et al 2013 may also occur in comparison biodegradation of dcm under anoxic conditions is not yet well characterized biodegradation of dcm under nitrate reducing conditions using dcma has been described for facultative methylotrophic bacteria belonging to the hyphomicrobium genus notably hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 leisinger et al 1994 nikolausz et al 2006 bringel et al 2017 and also for an acinetobacter strain freedman et al 1997 dehalobacterium formicoaceticum mägli et al 1996 1998 strains of the genus dehalobacter justicia leon et al 2012 lee et al 2012 strain dcmf lee et al 2015 and the yet to be isolated candidatus dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis kleindienst et al 2017 were shown to metabolize dcm anoxically via a fermentative pathway degrading bacteria and their dehalogenase genes in groundwater may indirectly report upon biodegradation potential of halogenated solvents lee et al 2016 matturro et al 2016 especially when biodegradation cannot be proved by mass balance or occurrence of transformation products in addition compound specific isotope analysis csia can also directly evidence in situ biodegradation of contaminants and help estimate the extent of degradation with respect to non degradative dissipative processes such as sorption and dilution thullner et al 2012 isotope enrichment factors ε to estimate in situ dcm degradation have been determined for different methylotrophic strains under oxic and nitrate reducing conditions heraty et al 1999 nikolausz et al 2006 for a methanogenic enrichment culture containing dehalobacter sp in conjunction with zerovalent iron fe0 lee et al 2015 and for an anoxic fermentative enrichment culture containing dehalobacterium sp trueba santiso et al 2017 however ε values to estimate in situ dcm degradation remain limited in comparison to other halogenated voc in addition and to the best of our knowledge csia has not yet been applied at the field scale to estimate in situ biodegradation of dcm the purpose of this study was thus to investigate the bacterial diversity associated with dcm degradation in a multi contaminated aquifer beneath a former solvent treating plant in order to estimate the dcm degradation potential of this aquifer carbon isotopic fractionation for dcm bacterial degradation was determined and in situ biodegradation of dcm was quantified in parallel in situ and ex situ approaches were combined to investigate the composition of sub populations potentially associated with dcm biodegradation and its response to hydrogeochemical variations potential electron acceptors and contaminants

detailed protocols to visualise dissimilarities between bacterial taxa associated with dcm degradation principal component analysis pca based on bray curtis dissimilarities of hellinger transformed data was used legendre and gallagher 2001 the relationship between community profiles and hydrogeochemical variables was evaluated by fitting environmental vectors a posteriori onto the pca significance of the fitted vectors was assessed by conducting a 1000 step monte carlo permutation test only hydrochemical variables with p 0 05 were considered significant 3 results 3 1 distribution of halogenated voc and hydrogeochemical conditions although chlorinated ethenes predominate at the investigated site dcm makes a significant contribution to total halogenated voc notably at the source fig 1 cis dce dcm and 1 1 1 trichloroethane 1 1 1 tca were the main halogenated voc in the source zone 104 61 87 75 and 24 21 mg l 1 respectively n 12 the average proportion of dcm vs halogenated voc in the source and the plume varied among wells figs 1 and si section b chloroform cf which may be a source of dcm when degraded by anoxic bacteria chan et al 2012 lee et al 2012 2015 showed concentrations in the same range as those of dcm in wells pz28 and pz27 and one order of magnitude lower in wells pz26 pz29 and pz5 figs 1 and si section b hydrogeochemical conditions varied spatially suggesting a typical source plume boundary zonation of terminal electron accepting processes see si section a variations in contaminant concentrations may reflect seasonal dynamics of groundwater recharge washington and cameron 2001 see si section b negative redox potential and dissolved oxygen concentrations of about 0 9 1 0 mg l 1 n 16 in the source zone and the plume indicated reducing conditions concentrations of ferrous iron up to 90 33 mg l 1 in pz3 were indicative of iron iii reduction and detection of sulfide suggested sulfate as a relevant electron acceptor in the source and the plume dissolved oxygen concentrations above 1 mg l 1 and eh 0 mv in the plume boundary zone indicated mostly oxic conditions 3 2 distribution of genes associated with dcm biodegradation abundance of the 16s rrna gene was essentially stable with variations usually within an order of magnitude it was highest in the source zone pz26 and pz27 up to 3 4 1011 copies l 1 and decreased in the plume and the plume boundary fig 2 abundance of the dcma gene varied over time within an order of magnitude in the source zone and more widely in the plume zone but was not detected in the plume boundary fig 2 unlike dcma dhla gene abundance varied over time in the source zone fig 2 and was also detected in the boundary zone pz15 abundance of dcma was 5 source to 8 plume orders of magnitude lower compared to rrna relative abundance of dhla compared to rrna was at least one order of magnitude lower than that of dcma in the source zone 3 3 laboratory microcosms and dcm degrading isolates upon incubation dcm concentration remained constant in oxic and anoxic laboratory groundwater microcosms which were not inoculated with hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 except those with pz28 groundwater dcm dissipation occurred in non inoculated pz28 microcosms under oxic conditions but was slow and not complete after 55 days of incubation fig 3 in pz28 microcosms inoculated with hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 dcm was completely dissipated in 23 days under oxic conditions with concomitant chloride accumulation and no apparent lag phase fig 3 whereas dcm was dissipated in 55 days under anoxic conditions si section m similarly microcosms with groundwater from pz29 pz3 pz6 10 pz11 and pz15 showed complete dcm dissipation within 55 days upon amendment with strain gj21 under both oxic and anoxic conditions except for pz3 and pz29 microcosms under anoxic conditions see si section m in comparison dcm was dissipated in 4 days in microcosms with strain gj21 inoculated in sgw mineral medium no significant dcm dissipation was observed in autoclaved controls altogether this confirmed that dcm degrading microorganisms may develop in contaminated groundwater under oxic and anoxic conditions the lag phase was longer in anoxic microcosms and also in microcosms from groundwater highly contaminated with halogenated voc pz3 pz28 pz29 compared to those with lower contaminant concentrations pz11 pz15 si section m this suggests that besides hydrogeological conditions the nature and level of contamination as well as associated toxicity may also affect in situ dcm biodegradation in groundwater obtained sequences of the 16s rrna gene for isolates t28 1 and t28 3 from groundwater pz28 microcosms were identical their closest described relative is the chloromethane degrading hyphomicrobium sp strain lat3 99 identity borodina et al 2005 whereas the dcm degrading hyphomicrobium sp gj21 showed 94 sequence identity see si section n the dcma sequence of the new isolates differed from that of strain gj21 by 11 snps for t28 1 7 amino acid differences and 7 snps 5 amino acid differences for t28 3 notably some of these snps i e 3 snps in strain t28 1 positions 97 114 and 691 of the methylobacterium extorquens dm4 reference and 2 snps in strain t28 3 positions 449 and 778 see si section o had not been detected previously vuilleumier et al 2001 3 4 quantification of in situ dcm degradation 3 4 1 carbon isotopic fractionation from laboratory microcosms δ13c values ranging between 40 and 100 indicated strong enrichment of 13c in dcm during biodegradation in agreement with previous studies nikolausz et al 2006 see si section p for rayleigh plots differences in isotope fractionation were observed depending both on the dcm degrading strain and cultivation conditions the value of εc for dcm degradation by hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 in synthetic medium under oxic conditions 31 3 was similar to that obtained under denitrifying conditions 26 4 tables 1 and si section p however the value of ε c for dcm degradation by strain gj21 under oxic conditions was higher i e less isotopic fractionation in sterilized groundwater from pz28 than in synthetic medium whereas no significant differences were observed under anoxic conditions for strain t28 1 ε c was close to previously reported values ε c values from 46 to 43 for hyphomicrobium sp strain mc8b heraty et al 1999 for strain t28 3 37 4 the ε c value was higher and closer to that of strain gj21 in synthetic medium 31 3 table 1 3 4 2 δ13c of dcm and extent of dcm biodegradation in groundwater carbon isotope composition δ13c of dcm could only be determined in pz27 pz28 and pz29 from the source zone and pz5 from the plume zone table 2 since dcm was below detection limits in the other wells the lowest δ13c value obtained well pz29 was used to represent the isotopic composition of the source r0 assuming that dcm was least degraded at this location richnow et al 2003 changes in δ13c larger than 2 downstream in the groundwater flow path between source and plume confirmed pollutant biodegradation extent of dcm biodegradation was similar in the different campaigns table 2 estimated dcm biodegradation was up to 85 in pz27 upstream of pz29 february 2017 55 2 downstream of the water flow path pz5 february 2017 and only 15 3 in pz28 source zone february 2016 the presence of cf in anoxic areas of the site mainly in wells pz28 and pz27 see si section b is worthy of note cf can be reductively dehalogenated to dcm by some anoxic bacteria which are often taxonomically closely related to anoxic dcm degraders chan et al 2012 lee et al 2012 2015 and in environments from which anoxic dcm degraders were isolated although cf was not found at the dcm source pz29 an isotope mass balance accounting for sequential degradation of cf and dcm could be determined for pz28 and pz27 see si section q this analysis supports concomitant cf and dcm degradation in pz27 with δ13c cf dcm varying over time from 14 4 0 4 to 4 7 0 9 at pz28 in contrast δ13c cf dcm remained below 34 1 0 8 suggesting that the source of cf at the site is located at the level of pz28 3 5 composition of bacterial communities with respect to dcm degradation alpha diversity of the bacterial groundwater community see si section k was similar to that observed in other contaminated aquifers wenderoth et al 2003 feris et al 2004 the distribution of taxa potentially associated with dcm degradation 97 identity in 16s rrna gene sequence with known dcm degrading strains significantly differed between the source and the plume on the one hand and the plume boundary on the other hand p 0 05 and did not change significantly over time i e on a seasonal or yearly basis fig 4 a changes in such taxa correlated best with halogenated voc concentrations redox potential and nitrate nitrite concentrations p 0 05 fig 4b but not with relative abundance of dcma and dhla genes taxa associated with dcm degradation were rare 3 in almost all wells but their relative abundance also differed widely between different zones of the contaminated site si section r operational taxonomic units otus closely related to strain dcmf lee et al 2015 occurred in low redox and highly contaminated wells source pz28 pz29 and plume pz3 pz5 zones in contrast the otu most closely related to the 2 hyphomicrobium strains isolates from well pz28 see section 3 2 and those related to methylophilus leisingeri bader and leisinger 1994 and to bacillus sp strain dma mägli et al 1995 were mainly found in more oxic zones of the plume boundary pz15 pz11 pz17 pz18 other taxa previously associated with dcm biodegradation such as dehalobacter justicia leon et al 2012 xanthobacter autotrophicus janssen et al 1989 and candidatus dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis kleindienst et al 2017 occurred at lower abundance mainly in highly contaminated zones and under reducing conditions the relative abundance of one of the two phylotypes affiliated to presumably dcm fermenting strain dcmf isolated from an organochlorine contaminated site in australia lee et al 2012 2015 was generally one order of magnitude higher than that of the common organohalide dehalorespiring dehalococcoides at the source and in the plume see si section r 4 discussion in this study dcm biodegradation potential in a multi contaminated aquifer was newly evaluated by a combination of experimental approaches this included i qpcr and dna sequencing to evaluate in situ distribution of dehalogenase genes and taxa associated with dcm degradation referred to as biomarkers for short in the following ii ex situ microcosms to evaluate dcm degradation kinetics and isotopic fractionation and iii csia of dcm to estimate in situ the extent of dcm degradation at the site 4 1 dcm degradation potential based on ex situ microcosms microcosm experiments revealed the potential of dcm biodegradation under oxic and anoxic conditions in contaminated groundwater observed differences in lag phase duration before onset of growth of hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 in contaminated groundwater from different piezometers correlated with groundwater contamination level this suggests that toxicity of contaminated groundwater likely affects performance of dcm degrading bacteria as observed previously for tce biodegradation adamson and parkin 2000 in addition redox conditions may also influence prevailing types of dcm degraders and in turn impact dcm degradation kinetics for example sulfate reducing and or methanogenic conditions in the source and plume zones are expected to favor anoxic fermentative biodegradation of dcm lee et al 2015 however the occurrence of facultatively anoxic methylotrophic taxa associated with dcm degradation in the source zone revealed by the isolation of two novel dcm degrading hyphomicrobium sp strains suggests less reduced microenvironments in the source zone in addition carbon isotopic fractionation for dcm under different redox conditions suggest that both oxic and anoxic dcm biodegradation may occur in highly contaminated aquifer zones of the plume laboratory experiments also allowed to derive new reference carbon isotopic fractionation ε c for dcm biodegradation by hyphomicrobium sp strain gj21 and for the novel strains t28 1 and t28 3 table 1 these differed from many of the previously reported ε c values for dcm degradation several potential explanations for these findings may be envisaged first of all differences in environmental conditions may influence εc values for instance observed differences in ε c during degradation of dcm by strain gj21 under oxic conditions between synthetic culture medium ε c 31 3 and contaminated pz28 groundwater ε c 22 4 may be associated with higher concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in groundwater 562 mg l 1 in average on pz28 doc could be used as an auxiliary carbon source and thereby affect growth dcm degradation kinetics i e 0 04 and 3 1 10 3 mm dcm h 1 for gj21 under oxic conditions in synthetic culture medium and pz28 groundwater respectively and potentially isotope fractionation kampara et al 2008 2009 moreover toxic effects of dcm and co contaminants may cause adaptive changes in cell wall composition during the degradation period i e 55 days for denitrifying conditions murínová and dercová 2014 and thereby affect dcm diffusive transport and potentially influence ε c values renpenning et al 2015 deipser and stegmann 1997 the observed range of ε c values for biodegradation of dcm by different bacteria may also primarily reflect different dcm degradation mechanisms elsner 2010 that prevail under different redox conditions table 1 here however ε c obtained for dcm during oxic and denitrifying biodegradation involving hydrolytic transformation and potentially the dehalogenase dcma were surprisingly close to those for anoxic fermentative transformation by dehalobacterium sp mägli et al 1996 trueba santiso et al 2017 on the other hand isotope fractionation may also reflect the underlying reaction chemistry and thus depend on structural variations of the dehalogenase and its active site that may its kinetic properties nikolausz et al 2006 thus structural modifications of the enzyme nikolausz et al 2006 originating from differences in the protein sequences of dcma see si section o may result in different ε c for strains using the same dcm degradation pathway involving the dehalogenase dcma table 1 finally obtained values may also reflect differences in experimental procedures used for ε c determination including analytical accuracy of dcm quantification and δ13c measurements and uncertainty estimation ci 95 or standard deviation in addition mass removal due to repetitive sampling may bias ε c determination buchner et al 2017 this effect was negligible in our case with variation of dcm concentration in the aqueous phase less than 4 after three successive measurements ensuring reliable ε c determination summing up csia of dcm based on carbon alone may not be sufficient to untangle dcm hydrolytic transformation from dcm fermentation in the future multi element csia of dcm δ2h δ13c and δ37cl could be applied for source apportionment as well as to decipher strain specific dcm degradation for the same biochemical reaction or discriminate degradation pathways vogt et al 2016 4 2 field distribution of dcm associated taxa and dcm genes we explored whether the abundance of known dcm degradation genes and associated bacterial taxa could be used as biomarkers to evaluate dcm biodegradation potential in the investigated aquifer figs 2 and 4 unfortunately such genes and the corresponding pathways are not yet well characterised under anoxic conditions abundance of dcma and dhla genes generally found in aerobes was higher in contaminated zones with highly reducing conditions and low oxygen fig 2 in agreement with previous studies e g rodríguez fernández et al 2018 this suggests that abundance of bacteria with these genes is mainly driven by pollutant level and further supports the notion that microoxic environments may also occur in the plume and the source zones of the contaminated site notably the distribution of taxa with representatives known to contain dcma did not match patterns of dcma gene abundance in the plume figs 2 and si section r this points to a still incomplete inventory of microorganisms containing dcma fig 4 in contrast distribution of dhla followed that of xanthobacter sp suggesting dhla as a robust biomarker of biodegradation of dcm as well as of other chlorinated alkanes transformed by haloalkane dehalogenase dhla such as 1 2 dca munro et al 2013 including in more highly contaminated nobre and nobre 2004 predominantly anoxic parts of the site unfortunately no other dehalogenase genes for dcm are presently available despite multiple ongoing studies e g kleindienst et al 2017 lee et al 2015 we thus extended this analysis using the 16s rrna gene taxonomic biomarker focusing on taxa featuring cultured representatives with a demonstrated ability to degrade dcm both total bacterial richness schao and relative abundance of taxa potentially associated with dcm degradation changed along with contaminant level see si sections k and r further the obtained data suggest that the distribution of taxa associated with dcm degradation may also occur in relation to their sensitivity to pollutant mixtures fig 4 indeed increased occurrence of aerobes and facultative anaerobes such as hyphomicrobium methylophilus and bacillus in less contaminated zones of the plume as observed here was already reported previously e g kohler staub et al 1995 freedman et al 1997 muller et al 2011a in addition observed changes in relative abundance of different taxa associated with dcm degradation depending on redox potential or nitrate nitrite concentrations fits predicted favored metabolic regimes of corresponding taxa under different redox conditions in groundwater see si sections a and r under more anoxic zones on site taxa affiliated to dehalobacter sp justicia leon et al 2012 candidatus dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis kleindienst et al 2017 and strain dcmf lee et al 2015 were found indicating the occurrence of anoxic dcm degraders fig 4 on the other hand bacterial populations related to the fermentative dcm degrader dehalobacterium formicoaceticum mägli et al 1996 were not detected interestingly taxa bearing potential for anoxic dcm fermentation were essentially associated to the highly contaminated and reduced zone of the plume particularly for those related to dehalobacter sp and strain dcmf this is consistent with strict anoxic and obligatory dehalorespiring metabolism of these strains justicia leon et al 2012 among the two otus affiliated with strain dcmf on the site only one was typically found in contaminated wells with low redox potential this suggests that only strains within the otu associated with high contaminant levels feature strains capable of dcm biodegradation 4 3 combining bacterial biomarkers and csia to evaluate dcm degradation in situ potential molecular biomarkers alone are not sufficient to prove dcm biodegradation and our results also suggest that their occurrence in groundwater may not be directly correlated with observed changes in dcm concentration which depends on processes of unknown nature and magnitude in this work the csia approach also allowed to quantify in situ biodegradation of dcm independently of degradation independent concentration changes assuming that isotope fractionation due to dcm abiotic degradation was negligible under groundwater conditions as previously suggested tobiszewski and namieśnik 2012 the extent of biodegradation estimated considering a panel of microbial degradation pathways potentially active in the aquifer remained constant in the investigated wells over the short investigation period of this study 2015 2017 this suggests low temporal variability of in situ dcm biodegradation characteristics table 2 nevertheless the differences observed in the extent of biodegradation along the different flow paths from the source pz29 to wells downstream pz28 pz27 and pz5 may reflect different groundwater hydrogeochemistry and associated bacterial populations involved in dcm degradation atashgahi et al 2017 for instance biodegradation over the short initial distance pz29 pz28 was estimated to be modest suggesting a limited onset of dcm biodegradation near the source table 2 in contrast up to 85 biodegradation is predicted for the flow path pz29 pz27 indicating a hot spot of dcm biodegradation in this area indeed time and distance dependent in situ first order biodegradation rate constants λt λs were consistently higher for this flow path table 2 suggestive of enhanced dcm biodegradation worthy of note this fits well with the observed patterns of relative abundance of taxa associated with anoxic dcm biodegradation as well as of dcma and dhla genes in well pz27 similarly extensive biodegradation up to 55 was also estimated over the longer flow path pz29 pz5 heading further downstream taxa associated with anoxic dcm degraders notably strain dcmf were abundant at the source zone as well as in the downstream plume highlighting the prevalence of anoxic dcm biodegradation 5 conclusions the present study aimed to demonstrate the biodegradation potential of dcm at a former industrial site multi contaminated with many halogenated voc the combination of csia and biomarker analysis confirmed that biodegradation significantly contributed to the observed dcm concentration gradient and to dcm mass depletion in the plume laboratory experiments also demonstrated an intrinsic biodegradation potential of dcm in oxic groundwater from the site our study thus shows that biodegradation of dcm in multi contaminated groundwater can be reliably evaluated by combining complementary in situ and ex situ dna based and chemical approaches gaps of knowledge on relevant dehalogenase genes and associated metabolic pathways for microbial transformation of dcm under anoxic conditions currently represent the main limitation in assessment and application of dcm biodegradation this highlights the need for further fundamental research to implement bioremediation approaches for contamination by dcm the most highly produced and used halogenated solvent worldwide acknowledgments we wish to thank ademe the french agency for the

19473,porous pavements are commonly used stormwater management systems however the understanding of their long term capacity to retain heavy metals is limited this study aims to investigate the long term removal of heavy metals in three different porous pavements porous asphalt pa hydrapave hp and permapave pp over accelerated laboratory experiments representing 26 years with varying hydrological conditions drying wetting periods and flow rates a treatment model that simulates adsorption and desorption processes was developed for the first time to predict the long term heavy metal removal by porous pavements unsurprisingly all tested porous pavements performed better in removing metals that tend to attach to solid particles e g pb al fe than more soluble ones e g cu zn and mn there was a general increase of heavy metal concentrations at the outlet of the pavements over time as a result of a decrease in adsorption capacity of the systems especially after the occurrence of clogging the soluble heavy metals removal decreased with a reduction in flow rates which was speculated to be due to more time being available for desorption of metals and breakdown of accumulated sediments the proposed model simulated the trend fluctuations and peaks of heavy metal concentrations reasonably well achieving the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse values of 0 53 0 68 during model calibration the model was most promising in predicting al and cu release from porous pavements 50 91 of the observed data within the 90 uncertainty bands nse 0 44 0 74 followed by fe and pb 27 77 observations within the bands nse 0 20 0 69 further improvements of the model are needed for it to be applicable for zn and mn keywords k c model process based model clogging adsorption desorption 1 introduction due to the increase in impervious areas alongside rapid urbanisation urban stormwater runoff and pollution have increased significantly goonetilleke et al 2005 zgheib et al 2012 this causes adverse impacts not only on downstream water quality jeng et al 2005 but also on stream health booth and jackson 1997 meanwhile stormwater can also be an alternative resource if collected and treated properly to manage stormwater issues in cities a variety of techniques have been developed under the concept of water sensitive urban design wsud also called low impact development in usa sustainable urban drainage systems in the uk and sponge city in china fletcher et al 2015 porous pavements are one wsud technology that can be easily retrofitted within dense urban areas providing unique opportunities to infiltrate stormwater on site as source control measures without taking up space in urban landscape mullaney and lucke 2014 previous studies of the porous pavements have largely focused on their hydraulic performance bean et al 2007 pezzaniti et al 2009 indeed the ability of porous pavement in reducing peak flow discharges and runoff volumes through filtration to the surrounding soils are the major reasons for their widespread adoption around the world scholz and grabowiecki 2007 mullaney and lucke 2014 clogging i e the decrease of its infiltration capacity is a problem that must be considered if permeable pavements are demanded to be used as an alternative to traditional drainage systems for example brattebo and booth 2003 tested the long term infiltration capacity of four permeable pavement systems in pacific northwest and found they were able to infiltrate virtually all precipitations even during the most intense stormwater 121 mm rainfall over 72 h yong et al 2013 studied the clogging of three permeable pavements using accelerated laboratory experiments results show that clogging of porous pavements varied not only by their design porous asphalt clogged on surface layer while hydrapave clogged at the geotextile layer but also subject to the operational conditions systems exposed to drying periods have longer lifespan porous pavements are usually regarded as being successfully in removing pollutants by adsorption filtering and biological decomposition beecham et al 2012 imran et al 2013 heavy metals are one of the major concerns due to their acute toxicity and long term accumulation and persistence pagotto et al 2000 tested a porous asphalt pavement at a french highway and found 74 pb 62 cd 59 zn and 20 cu were removed the authors argued that higher particulate percentage of heavy metals got more removal 38 9 zn 18 2 ni and 9 4 pb were removed on permeable pavement made of 20 mm grave sub base 280 mm high over several rain events in a car park of south australia beecham et al 2012 myers et al 2011 assessed the impact of residence time on heavy metal retention on permeable pavement with quartzite and dolomite as base material during a large simulated event they discovered that zn cu and pb removal was between 94 and 99 after 144 h of retention in the base layer but the removal was lower 61 zn 35 pb and 30 cu during the initial stages where the residence time was only 1 h dierkes et al 2002 used accelerated experiments to test four different types of pavers at a rainfall intensity of 144 mm h as worst case scenario simulating 5 years of rain in germany results show that 89 98 pb 74 98 cd 89 96 and 72 97 zn were removed respectively same study also suggested that basalt and gravel as subbase materials are better in removing heavy metals than limestone and sandstone materials a recent study by sounthararajah et al 2017 found that using zeolite or basalt as bed material in porous pavements removed 41 72 cd 67 74 cu 38 43 ni 61 72 pb and 63 73 zn respectively during accelerated 80 h period experiment that simulated 10 years of sydney rainfall using uniform distribution of rainfall the methodologies used in the above studies were mostly simple short term field or accelerated laboratory studies on relatively new systems which failed to consider the impact of highly variable operational conditions e g dry wetting periods between events and varying flow rates over life span of these systems brattebo and booth 2003 conducted a rare long term experiment over six year operation on a heavily used porous pavement in a parking area and found that both positive and negative changes of released heavy metal concentrations zn outflow concentration increased from 5 μg l to 10 μg l while that of cu decreased from 10 μg l to 3 μg l during the six year study period in can be concluded that although life span of porous pavements can go well over 25 years the knowledge on how these systems perform in removing heavy metals over long time periods is still limited additionally there is no specific study that investigates heavy metal removal processes within porous pavements which may help to understand the long term removal performance there are models available to simulate the hydraulic behaviour of porous pavements e g in the commercially available software swmm by usepa rossman 2017 a porous pavement system is modelled as an infiltration system that combines three vertical lays i e the surface pavement and the storage layers the method has also been tested by others to understand the hydraulic performance of permeable pavement systems zhang and guo 2015 to account for the clogging process that is often observed in porous pavements yong et al 2013 proposed a simple four parameter black box regression model that for the first time predicts physical clogging as a function of cumulative volume and climatic conditions unfortunately there is a lack of algorithems that can simulate the pollution treatment processes within porous pavement systes the first order kinetic decay model also called k c model serves the mostly widely used method that has also been adopted in software packages such as swmm rossman 2017 and music by ewater ewater 2014 however the inadequacies of k c model are often mentioned due to its simplicity e g assumption of constant k and c value kadlec and knight 1996 newton 2005 newton 2005 successfully used a one parameter first decay model adapted from filtration theory for wastewater treatment to predict particle removal efficiency from pavement with satisfactory e g nse 0 36 0 98 for low flow rates and from negative to 0 39 for high flow rates empirical models and conceptual model adapted from a sediment removal model for a sand filter were developed by he et al 2015 to predict suspend solids and phosphorus removal by a porous concrete pavement the prediction errors were within 5 29 for two validation events these models are however mainly for event based predictions and do not account for specific treatment processes e g adsorption desorption they are also developed for mainly sediments and nutrients not suitable for heavy metals that undergo via different removal mechanisms hence development of a process based water quality model that not only involves key treatment processes but also can simulate long term treatment performance of heavy metal by porous pavements is required to assist in better designs of these systems this paper aims to fill in these knowledge gaps firstly by understanding heavy metal removal performance of three different porous pavements porous asphalt hydrapave and permapave over a long term under different conditions and then developing for the first time a model that not only predicts long term heavy metal removal but also explains the removal processes the specific objectives of this study are to test the treatment performance of the three porous pavements for different heavy metals al cd cr cu fe mn ni pb and zn using accelerated laboratory experiments spanning over 1 year representing 26 years of operation under varying operational conditions understand the impact of clogging pavement type and flow rate on treatment performance and develop test and validate a treatment model accounting for main removal processes e g adsorption and desorption for prediction of long term removal of heavy metals we hypothesis that heavy metals will accumulate in the system and also get released over time from the systems and the metal characteristics pavement design and hydrological conditions are the key influential factors the proposed model accounting for heavy metal adsorption and desorption will be able to provide reasonable predictions for majority of the tested heavy metals but not good for some that have other removal processes 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up three porous pavement systems that are commercially available were used in this study monolithic porous asphalt pa a standard bituminous asphalt surface 40 mm underlaid by a layer of crushed aggregate 40 mm and a highly permeable layer of open graded clean washed aggregate with 40 void space as reservoir bed 570 mm modular hydrapave hp a thick paver made of boral clay and concrete 80 mm which is laid on φ5 mm clean stone 50 mm a geotextile layer and another two sublayers of φ5 20 mm stone 100 mm and φ10 63 mm stone 250 mm permapave pp a thick paver of φ 10 12 mm crashed gravel 50 mm underlaid by a sub base layer of φ 5 20 washed gravel 350 mm we used the same experimental rig fig 1 that has been employed in the parallel studies of the clogging and nutrient removal by the porous pavements as reported in yong et al 2013 the rig had a 550 l tank with constant mixing from which the inflow is evenly distributed via a distribution system peristaltic pump rotating sprinkler into three separate vertical compartments representing three different pavements each has a size of 0 9 0 45 1 95 m three separate tipping bucket rain gauges 0 2 mm tip resolution were installed at the end of the system to monitor the outflow rates results from the clogging study yong et al 2013 have shown that pa and hp exhibited initial clogging i e the ponding above the pavement surfaces overflows after 11 years and 12 year respectively of accelerated operations under various drying and wetting conditions while pp had no sign of clogging after 26 years all the three systems had good performance in removing sediments but had varying performance for nutrients removal depending on the flow rates yong et al 2011 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 inflow synthetic stormwater semi synthetic stormwater was prepared in the 550 l tank according to the methods described previous in stormwater studies blecken et al 2009 with standard australia stormwater quality duncan 1999 the target concentrations of sediments nutrients and heavy metals in semi synthetic stormwater are presented in table 1 together with the primary source of the pollutants 2 2 2 dosing of the system under varying wetting drying regimes over a course of one year 26 years of operation in a typical sub tropical brisbane climate average annual rainfall 1200 mm was simulated under various wetting drying conditions four inflow rates were simulated table 2 with flow a b c and d representing the average rainfall intensity of the 0 39 40 59 60 79 and 80 100 percentile groups respectively in addition a 1 in 5 year design storm over 5 min was also chosen to simulate the typical design storm for small catchments where porous pavements are likely to be installed these flows were estimated from the brisbane runoff frequency curve which was generated using music model ewater 2014 and 6 min rainfall data collected between 1988 and 1997 in brisbane generally each simulated year consisted of four flow types a b c and d which were applied for 96 48 48 and 48 h respectively 48 h represents approximately 52 simulated days note each flow was not applied continuously but with many dry periods see next paragraph for details the total amount of applied annual inflow was 1243 mm close to brisbane annual rainfall the order of the flow types was applied randomly e g in year 1 the sequence of d c b a may be applied while in year 2 it may become the sequence of c a b d the 1 in 5 year stormwater events were simulated in year 5 9 storm 1 8 1 storm 2 11 8 storm 3 15 6 storm 4 19 5 storm 5 and 23 5 storm 6 to account for the drying the inflow was not applied continuously but with dry periods in between each event according to the methods described in our previous work yong et al 2013 it was determined that an average of 21 dry weather periods occurred during any given year in brisbane as such in each simulated year 21 dry periods were mimicked by applying fan heaters at 25 c for 3 h which removed 80 of the moisture content in the pavements that is equivalent to 4 days of natural dry this was determined through a preliminary experiment 2 2 3 sampling and analysis for each flow rate three time weighted samples were collected at both inflow and outflow point over the entire duration of the event to form two composite samples i e one inflow and one outflow the collection of samples was accompanied by ph measurement to enable early predictions to be made about the behaviour of heavy metals in the systems once collected the samples were acidified stored in fridge and then delivered to a nata accredited laboratory for analysis of nine heavy metals in accordance with the standard methods described in apha awwa wpcf 2005 aluminium al cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu iron fe manganese mn nickel ni lead pb and zinc zn the lor limit of report was 0 01 mg l for al and fe and 0 001 mg l for the rest 2 3 long term treatment model development 2 3 1 proposed model algorithms in this study the simple first order decay model k c model kadlec and knight 1996 is adapted with revisions to include adsorption and desorption processes for simulation of the long term of heavy metals from porous pavements the basic equation of the k c model is 1 c o u t c c in c e k q where c in inflow concentration mg l c out outflow concentration mg l c the background concentration mg l k the event decay parameter day l and q is the hydraulic loading in this case flow rate l day equation 1 can be rearranged and written in time step basis for estimating c out as 2 c o u t t c c in t c e k q t the background concentration c is often used as a constant parameter e g in music pre calibrated c values are used for treatment performance modelling for all the treatment measures ewater 2014 however we hypothesised that c is not constant and may 1 decrease due to adsorption process depending on inflow as bench marking concentration and adsorption rate k ad and 2 increase due to desorption process depending on the total amount of pollutant accumulated in the previous time step m t 1 g and desorption rate kdes 1 l so we proposed that 3 c t c in t k a d c in t k d e s m t 1 hence the outflow concentration c out can be estimated using equations 4 and 5 4 c o u t t c in t k a d c in t k d e s m t 1 k a d c in t k d e s m t 1 e k q t 5 m t m t 1 q i n t c in t q o u t t c out t d t the model has three parameters the event decay rate k the adsorption rate k ad and desorption rate kdes the initial condition is m t 0 0 2 3 2 data preparation model calibration and validation the model was tested only for hydrapave hp and porous asphalt pa permapave was excluded for model testing as its outflow rates were not measured properly due to the failure of the rain gauge during the experiment inflow rates were controlled table 2 while the outflow rates were measured using tipping bucket rain gauge 0 2 mm tip the flow rates were then prepared in hourly time steps equivalent to 1 08 simulated day i e approximately daily time step however water quality samples were not collected on hourly time steps but as 48 h 52 simulated days composite samples see section 2 2 3 it was therefore assumed that the concentrations within each 48 h period did not change i e concentrations at any hour within the period were assumed to be the same as the measured composite concentration for the 48 h period in this way inflow and outflow rate as well as heavy metal concentrations were prepared on an hourly time step i e simulated daily time step for the proposed model testing the model was run in a simulated daily time step for the first half of the experiment i e simulated year 1 13 for hp and year 1 10 for pa for model calibration at the middle of the time step when a composite sample was collected the simulated concentration was extracted i e if the composite sample was taken from hour 1 hour 48 excluding the drying period the simulated concentration is extracted at hour 24 all the extracted concentrations from simulation were compared to the concentrations at that time step as observed for model testing using the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 10 000 model runs were conducted for parameter calibration with parameters values randomly sampled from uniform distributions the ranges were informed by preliminary model runs practices refer to table s1 of supplementary material for the detail information the use of uniform distributions was recommended by previous studies by freni and mannina 2010 when there is lack of parameter information validation of the proposed model was performed using the second half of the experiment which is independent of the data for model calibration top 1 of the parameter sets i e 100 from calibration were chosen to generate the parameter distributions which were then used to estimate the model prediction uncertainty 90 probability bands using glue method beven and binley 1992 it should be acknowledged that selection of 100 behavioural runs was quite arbitrary it however still satisfied the minimum runs required by glue and selecting the top 1 simulations resulted in much higher acceptability thresholds e g in this paper nse 0 45 for al cu fe pb and zn comparing to traditional urban drainage models i e 0 0 freni et al 2008 also suggested that higher thresholds not only allow for obtaining more relevant information of parameters responsibility in modelling uncertainty propagation but also allow for a stricter verification of the model the thresholds for mn were however only nse of 0 10 for ha and 0 0 for pa the uncertainty analysis was anyway proceeded using the top 1 parameter sets for mn 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance 3 1 1 overall performance the metal treatment performance of the three porous pavements over 26 simulated years are summarized in table 3 all three pavements had cumulative heavy metals removal rates of over 50 they were the most effective for pb 84 14 al 79 13 fe 77 13 and less for cu 68 19 and zn 66 20 lower but highly variable removal was found for mn 35 35 while for ni net productions were observed in most of the cases which could be entirely due to uncertainty in measurements of very low inflow concentration often of 0 005 mg l cd and cr also had very low inflow concentrations 0 01 mg l and were mostly non detected in outflow samples as such cd cr and ni were then excluded from future discussions these findings have good agreement with previous studies pagotto et al 2000 sounthararajah et al 2017 the different performance between heavy metals can be explained by their affinity to particulates e g pb al and fe are easily attached to sediments in stormwater makepeace et al 1995 and hence can be readily retained when filtering through porous pavements these retained metals can form stable complexes via surface complexation reactions bradl 2004 cu and zn are largely presented in dissolved form makepeace et al 1995 and their retention by porous pavements usually undergo via rather weak processes such as ion exchange mn also has good attachment with sediments organic matter in stormwater and in general the removal process of mn can be very complex in the form of mn oxides bradl 2004 the low and variable removal observed in this study was probably due to the very low inflow concentrations i e 0 0228 0 006 mg l for mn and 0 0032 0 001 mg l for ni when considering reusing treated stormwater or discharging to protect eco system health the degrees of heavy removal by porous pavements were insufficient since the effluent heavy metal mostly exceed australia drinking water guidelines nhmrc nrmmc 2011 and trigger values for aquatic health protect and irrigation except for mn table 3 hence it is suggested further treatment through water sensitive urban design systems e g stormwater biofilters payne et al 2015 or some advanced technologies such as using nano fibrous material filtrations shall be used sounthararajah et al 2017 3 1 2 performance change over time and impact of clogging for majority of the heavy metals a general increasing trend of effluent concentrations with fluctuations was observed over the whole experiment fig 2 the fluctuations were due to the variable input flows and concentrations that mimic reality with six large storm events contributed to the highest outflow peaks with the accumulation of metals in the systems adsorption sites became limited and desorption turned to be more prominent nevertheless the outflow concentrations were still below the inflow concentrations until the end of the experiment e g after 20 26 years of operation indicating that these systems still have capacity for metal removal mn exhibited surprisingly decreasing concentration over time fig 2 e g the effluent mn concentrations were 2 3 times lower in the end compared with the start bradl 2004 suggested that mn oxides are good sinks for cu and fe oxides and can also form pb mn formation hence exhibit co precipitation which enhances mn removal over time another important finding is that in the early stage of the system 1 2 years the systems had poorer performance and exhibited larger variabilities especially for the first few sampling events especially for mn which even had net productions fig 2 for example outflow cu concentrations in the first two years were 0 076 0 048 mg l which dropped to 0 045 0 023 mg l over the following two years therefore porous pavement systems need time to mature for stable and improved performance clogging which occurred in year 11 in pa and year 12 in hp had obvious impact on the system performance fig 2 table 3 it is estimated that after clogging average outflow concentrations were 1 2 2 4 times higher than that before clogging for pa systems and 1 3 3 6 times for hp system as time progressed clogging resulted in an increase in the detention time allowing more time for the desorption process which became more prominent due to the accumulated heavy metals over time than the adsorption this is different from previous study by myers et al 2011 who found that longer residence time led to better removal of zn cu and pb the study however only investigated one single large event i e short term on a fresh permeable pavement that had no clogging issue this reaffirms the importance of this study which looked into the long term performance of the pavement systems in removing heavy metals 3 1 3 impact of pavement type the difference in average removal between the three types of porous pavements were very small up to 5 fig 3 a with exception of the soluble metals cu zn and mn as discussed system clogging had adverse impact on system performance hence the pp which was not clogged performed best for removing these heavy metals e g specifically the average outflow heavy metal concentrations from pp were only 71 and 56 of those from hp and pa respectively table 3 in addition the difference in sub base materials may also contribute to the different observations dierkes et al 2002 observed that paving stones of porous concrete and green apertures similar to pp and pa in this study had better heavy metal retention capacities than pavers with joints similar to hp in this study although gravel and basalt as base material are usually more effective in removing pollutants dierkes et al 2002 the basalt used in pa system of this study used are much coarser than the stones in hp and gravel in pp thus resulting the lowest removal for cu zn and mn 3 1 4 impact of flow rate fig 3b indicates the impact of flow rates on removal as expected the simulated flow representing 1 in 5 yr storm led to the poorest performance e g the average removal of heavy metals except for mn were usually within the range of 40 55 while it was 70 under the other flow rates the differences of average removal rates between other flow rates flow a b c and d were small 10 for particulate metals i e pb al and fe but higher outflow concentrations usually corresponded to larger flow rates e g flow d had 4 times higher average outflow concentrations than flow a table 3 which has good agreement with previous study on the same systems for removal of tp however opposite trend was found for tn yong et al 2011 as for the soluble heavy metals i e cu zn and mn relatively higher removals were observed at flow c surprisingly it was found that the lowest rate flow a had the largest variability in heavy metal removal compared with other flow rates fig 3b which presumably due to the big reduction in removal after clogging table 3 in cases that clogging occurred lower outflow rates were observed and it benefited to the desorption process of these weakly attached metals or breakdown of trapped sediments in the clogging layer facilitated by longer detention during the event as previously reported to impact tn outflow concentration from the systems yong et al 2011 both processes may introduce more uncertainties and result in higher variabilities 3 2 model testing results the performance of the proposed model and values of calibrated parameters are summarized in table 4 with the observed and simulated outflow concentrations presented in fig 4 the overall upwards trend of heavy metal concentrations downwards for mn the fluctuations and peaks were all reasonably modelled with the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse values of 0 53 0 68 for pa and 0 56 0 64 for hp respectively indicating that the model can estimate the release of heavy metals from two porous pavements with satisfactory mn was again an exception and had the poorest model efficiency e 0 13 for hp and 0 00 for pa due to its complex potential removal processes and variable performance observed the calibrated values of adsorption rate k ads and desorption rate k des had good agreement with the pollutant removal performance observed with higher k ads and lower k des values indicating relatively higher removal rates e g the particulate heavy metals pb al and fe are characterized as higher k ads and lower k des values vice versa for the soluble ones zn cu and mn fig 4 illustrates the 90 prediction bands as well as the best fit of prediction best performance was observed for al and cu in both systems with 50 91 of observations covered by the prediction bands table 4 and the trends and fluctuations were simulated reasonably well max nse 0 44 0 74 fe concentrations was over predicted by the model and the best fit of prediction in pa system extended slightly outside of the lower bound of the 90 prediction band nevertheless the overall prediction performance for fe was acceptable evidenced by the nse of 0 42 for pa and 0 69 for hp as for pb the peak concentrations after year 15 were under predicted by the model with relatively poorer model performance 77 and 27 observations within prediction band max nse of 0 20 and 0 39 for pa and hp respectively the model did not predict zn concentrations well nse 0 04 especially for that in hp systems best fit of the predictions were out of the 90 prediction bands and only 22 observations within the band indicating that other important removal processes of these heavy metals not considered in the model e g complexation with other compounds or biological transformation might occur although the model predicted same decreasing trend of mn concentrations as observed it produced the worst model results e g 46 and 9 for hp observations within prediction band max nse of 0 for pa and hp respectively it should be acknowledged that 90 prediction bands were generated in a strict way i e using glue method based on top 1 parameter sets corresponding to cut off thresholds of nse 0 45 for all the metals which in some cases caused the best fit prediction fell out of the 90 prediction bands e g zn in hp system it was checked that the whole prediction band overlapped with the best fit prediction it however provides a stronger verification of the proposed model overall the results indicate that model has abilities to predict long term performance of porous pavements for some heavy metals e g most promisingly for al and cu with high nse values and coverage of observations within the 90 bands followed by fe and pb with lower coverage of observed data within the 90 prediction bands the proposed model has to be improved further for predicting zn and mn removal by the porous pavements e g it is suggested to include more removal processes of these two metals in model the efficiency of the proposed model performance nse values equal to 0 44 0 74 for al and cu 0 42 0 69 for fe and 0 20 0 29 for pb are reasonably good except for zn and mn nse from negative to 0 04 and have good agreements to previous reported water quality models for porous pavements e g newton 2005 s one parameter first decay model adapted from filtration theory can predict particle removal efficient from pavement systems under several individual events with different levels of satisfactory low flow rates with nse 0 36 0 98 and high flow rates with nse from negative to 0 39 he et al 2015 s empirical model developed based on laboratory data also provided good predictions on six field tests results for tss and tp removal by porous concrete pavement with errors of up to 2 9 for average removal rates the same study also tested a sediment removal conceptual model and reported prediction errors of 1 3 and 5 8 for tss removal rates for two validation field events as seen these existing models are simple and can perform well they however were just validated against individual events and could not be used for predicting long term performance of pavement systems that are exposed to continuous stormwater events the current proposed model however has overcome these shortcomings and this study for the first time developed a new process based model specifically for heavy metals involving both adsorption and desorption processes more importantly its greater utility has been supported by the ability to simulate long term treatment performance thus can assist in better design of pavement systems 4 conclusions this study tested the long term treatment performance of three porous pavements porous asphalt pa hydrapave hp and permapave pp in removing heavy metals using accelerated laboratory experiments spanning over 1 year simulating 26 years of operations intermittent dry wetting periods were also simulated with varying flow conditions to represent a realistic operational scheme a water quality model that includes adsorption and desorption processes was proposed and tested using experimental data the main findings are all three porous pavements were good in removing heavy metals with average cumulative removal rates over 26 years of operations being 84 14 for pb 79 13 for al 77 13 for fe 68 19 for fe 66 20 for zn and 35 35 for mn metals with higher particulate fractions pb al and fe usually were easier to be retained by the pavements compared to soluble ones e g cu zn and mn over the simulated 26 year period effluent concentrations generally increased indicating the long term release of heavy metals as a result of adsorption and desorption process it was found that the porous systems took 1 2 years to mature for better and more stable performance clogging led to poorer system performance with higher variability permapave pp had the best performance as it was never clogged over the period followed by hydrapave hp and porous asphalt pa lower removals of soluble heavy metals was observed in the pavements with coarser sub materials in pa flow rates influenced the heavy metal removal with higher outflow concentrations usually corresponded to higher flowrate especially for the soluble heavy metals low flow rates was also not preferred especially after clogging occurred as it benefited to desorption processes and breakdown of accumulated sediments leading to higher variability in heavy metal outflow concentrations the proposed model was successfully calibrated against the data collected from first half of the accelerated experiment e g 10 13 years with the estimated nse values 0 53 0 68 except for mn which had nse of 0 0 0 13 the prediction results indicate that the proposed model was promising for predict the releasing of al and cu from the porous pavements 50 91 of observations covered by the prediction bands max nse 0 44 0 74 it can also be applied for fe and

19473,porous pavements are commonly used stormwater management systems however the understanding of their long term capacity to retain heavy metals is limited this study aims to investigate the long term removal of heavy metals in three different porous pavements porous asphalt pa hydrapave hp and permapave pp over accelerated laboratory experiments representing 26 years with varying hydrological conditions drying wetting periods and flow rates a treatment model that simulates adsorption and desorption processes was developed for the first time to predict the long term heavy metal removal by porous pavements unsurprisingly all tested porous pavements performed better in removing metals that tend to attach to solid particles e g pb al fe than more soluble ones e g cu zn and mn there was a general increase of heavy metal concentrations at the outlet of the pavements over time as a result of a decrease in adsorption capacity of the systems especially after the occurrence of clogging the soluble heavy metals removal decreased with a reduction in flow rates which was speculated to be due to more time being available for desorption of metals and breakdown of accumulated sediments the proposed model simulated the trend fluctuations and peaks of heavy metal concentrations reasonably well achieving the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse values of 0 53 0 68 during model calibration the model was most promising in predicting al and cu release from porous pavements 50 91 of the observed data within the 90 uncertainty bands nse 0 44 0 74 followed by fe and pb 27 77 observations within the bands nse 0 20 0 69 further improvements of the model are needed for it to be applicable for zn and mn keywords k c model process based model clogging adsorption desorption 1 introduction due to the increase in impervious areas alongside rapid urbanisation urban stormwater runoff and pollution have increased significantly goonetilleke et al 2005 zgheib et al 2012 this causes adverse impacts not only on downstream water quality jeng et al 2005 but also on stream health booth and jackson 1997 meanwhile stormwater can also be an alternative resource if collected and treated properly to manage stormwater issues in cities a variety of techniques have been developed under the concept of water sensitive urban design wsud also called low impact development in usa sustainable urban drainage systems in the uk and sponge city in china fletcher et al 2015 porous pavements are one wsud technology that can be easily retrofitted within dense urban areas providing unique opportunities to infiltrate stormwater on site as source control measures without taking up space in urban landscape mullaney and lucke 2014 previous studies of the porous pavements have largely focused on their hydraulic performance bean et al 2007 pezzaniti et al 2009 indeed the ability of porous pavement in reducing peak flow discharges and runoff volumes through filtration to the surrounding soils are the major reasons for their widespread adoption around the world scholz and grabowiecki 2007 mullaney and lucke 2014 clogging i e the decrease of its infiltration capacity is a problem that must be considered if permeable pavements are demanded to be used as an alternative to traditional drainage systems for example brattebo and booth 2003 tested the long term infiltration capacity of four permeable pavement systems in pacific northwest and found they were able to infiltrate virtually all precipitations even during the most intense stormwater 121 mm rainfall over 72 h yong et al 2013 studied the clogging of three permeable pavements using accelerated laboratory experiments results show that clogging of porous pavements varied not only by their design porous asphalt clogged on surface layer while hydrapave clogged at the geotextile layer but also subject to the operational conditions systems exposed to drying periods have longer lifespan porous pavements are usually regarded as being successfully in removing pollutants by adsorption filtering and biological decomposition beecham et al 2012 imran et al 2013 heavy metals are one of the major concerns due to their acute toxicity and long term accumulation and persistence pagotto et al 2000 tested a porous asphalt pavement at a french highway and found 74 pb 62 cd 59 zn and 20 cu were removed the authors argued that higher particulate percentage of heavy metals got more removal 38 9 zn 18 2 ni and 9 4 pb were removed on permeable pavement made of 20 mm grave sub base 280 mm high over several rain events in a car park of south australia beecham et al 2012 myers et al 2011 assessed the impact of residence time on heavy metal retention on permeable pavement with quartzite and dolomite as base material during a large simulated event they discovered that zn cu and pb removal was between 94 and 99 after 144 h of retention in the base layer but the removal was lower 61 zn 35 pb and 30 cu during the initial stages where the residence time was only 1 h dierkes et al 2002 used accelerated experiments to test four different types of pavers at a rainfall intensity of 144 mm h as worst case scenario simulating 5 years of rain in germany results show that 89 98 pb 74 98 cd 89 96 and 72 97 zn were removed respectively same study also suggested that basalt and gravel as subbase materials are better in removing heavy metals than limestone and sandstone materials a recent study by sounthararajah et al 2017 found that using zeolite or basalt as bed material in porous pavements removed 41 72 cd 67 74 cu 38 43 ni 61 72 pb and 63 73 zn respectively during accelerated 80 h period experiment that simulated 10 years of sydney rainfall using uniform distribution of rainfall the methodologies used in the above studies were mostly simple short term field or accelerated laboratory studies on relatively new systems which failed to consider the impact of highly variable operational conditions e g dry wetting periods between events and varying flow rates over life span of these systems brattebo and booth 2003 conducted a rare long term experiment over six year operation on a heavily used porous pavement in a parking area and found that both positive and negative changes of released heavy metal concentrations zn outflow concentration increased from 5 μg l to 10 μg l while that of cu decreased from 10 μg l to 3 μg l during the six year study period in can be concluded that although life span of porous pavements can go well over 25 years the knowledge on how these systems perform in removing heavy metals over long time periods is still limited additionally there is no specific study that investigates heavy metal removal processes within porous pavements which may help to understand the long term removal performance there are models available to simulate the hydraulic behaviour of porous pavements e g in the commercially available software swmm by usepa rossman 2017 a porous pavement system is modelled as an infiltration system that combines three vertical lays i e the surface pavement and the storage layers the method has also been tested by others to understand the hydraulic performance of permeable pavement systems zhang and guo 2015 to account for the clogging process that is often observed in porous pavements yong et al 2013 proposed a simple four parameter black box regression model that for the first time predicts physical clogging as a function of cumulative volume and climatic conditions unfortunately there is a lack of algorithems that can simulate the pollution treatment processes within porous pavement systes the first order kinetic decay model also called k c model serves the mostly widely used method that has also been adopted in software packages such as swmm rossman 2017 and music by ewater ewater 2014 however the inadequacies of k c model are often mentioned due to its simplicity e g assumption of constant k and c value kadlec and knight 1996 newton 2005 newton 2005 successfully used a one parameter first decay model adapted from filtration theory for wastewater treatment to predict particle removal efficiency from pavement with satisfactory e g nse 0 36 0 98 for low flow rates and from negative to 0 39 for high flow rates empirical models and conceptual model adapted from a sediment removal model for a sand filter were developed by he et al 2015 to predict suspend solids and phosphorus removal by a porous concrete pavement the prediction errors were within 5 29 for two validation events these models are however mainly for event based predictions and do not account for specific treatment processes e g adsorption desorption they are also developed for mainly sediments and nutrients not suitable for heavy metals that undergo via different removal mechanisms hence development of a process based water quality model that not only involves key treatment processes but also can simulate long term treatment performance of heavy metal by porous pavements is required to assist in better designs of these systems this paper aims to fill in these knowledge gaps firstly by understanding heavy metal removal performance of three different porous pavements porous asphalt hydrapave and permapave over a long term under different conditions and then developing for the first time a model that not only predicts long term heavy metal removal but also explains the removal processes the specific objectives of this study are to test the treatment performance of the three porous pavements for different heavy metals al cd cr cu fe mn ni pb and zn using accelerated laboratory experiments spanning over 1 year representing 26 years of operation under varying operational conditions understand the impact of clogging pavement type and flow rate on treatment performance and develop test and validate a treatment model accounting for main removal processes e g adsorption and desorption for prediction of long term removal of heavy metals we hypothesis that heavy metals will accumulate in the system and also get released over time from the systems and the metal characteristics pavement design and hydrological conditions are the key influential factors the proposed model accounting for heavy metal adsorption and desorption will be able to provide reasonable predictions for majority of the tested heavy metals but not good for some that have other removal processes 2 methods 2 1 experimental set up three porous pavement systems that are commercially available were used in this study monolithic porous asphalt pa a standard bituminous asphalt surface 40 mm underlaid by a layer of crushed aggregate 40 mm and a highly permeable layer of open graded clean washed aggregate with 40 void space as reservoir bed 570 mm modular hydrapave hp a thick paver made of boral clay and concrete 80 mm which is laid on φ5 mm clean stone 50 mm a geotextile layer and another two sublayers of φ5 20 mm stone 100 mm and φ10 63 mm stone 250 mm permapave pp a thick paver of φ 10 12 mm crashed gravel 50 mm underlaid by a sub base layer of φ 5 20 washed gravel 350 mm we used the same experimental rig fig 1 that has been employed in the parallel studies of the clogging and nutrient removal by the porous pavements as reported in yong et al 2013 the rig had a 550 l tank with constant mixing from which the inflow is evenly distributed via a distribution system peristaltic pump rotating sprinkler into three separate vertical compartments representing three different pavements each has a size of 0 9 0 45 1 95 m three separate tipping bucket rain gauges 0 2 mm tip resolution were installed at the end of the system to monitor the outflow rates results from the clogging study yong et al 2013 have shown that pa and hp exhibited initial clogging i e the ponding above the pavement surfaces overflows after 11 years and 12 year respectively of accelerated operations under various drying and wetting conditions while pp had no sign of clogging after 26 years all the three systems had good performance in removing sediments but had varying performance for nutrients removal depending on the flow rates yong et al 2011 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 inflow synthetic stormwater semi synthetic stormwater was prepared in the 550 l tank according to the methods described previous in stormwater studies blecken et al 2009 with standard australia stormwater quality duncan 1999 the target concentrations of sediments nutrients and heavy metals in semi synthetic stormwater are presented in table 1 together with the primary source of the pollutants 2 2 2 dosing of the system under varying wetting drying regimes over a course of one year 26 years of operation in a typical sub tropical brisbane climate average annual rainfall 1200 mm was simulated under various wetting drying conditions four inflow rates were simulated table 2 with flow a b c and d representing the average rainfall intensity of the 0 39 40 59 60 79 and 80 100 percentile groups respectively in addition a 1 in 5 year design storm over 5 min was also chosen to simulate the typical design storm for small catchments where porous pavements are likely to be installed these flows were estimated from the brisbane runoff frequency curve which was generated using music model ewater 2014 and 6 min rainfall data collected between 1988 and 1997 in brisbane generally each simulated year consisted of four flow types a b c and d which were applied for 96 48 48 and 48 h respectively 48 h represents approximately 52 simulated days note each flow was not applied continuously but with many dry periods see next paragraph for details the total amount of applied annual inflow was 1243 mm close to brisbane annual rainfall the order of the flow types was applied randomly e g in year 1 the sequence of d c b a may be applied while in year 2 it may become the sequence of c a b d the 1 in 5 year stormwater events were simulated in year 5 9 storm 1 8 1 storm 2 11 8 storm 3 15 6 storm 4 19 5 storm 5 and 23 5 storm 6 to account for the drying the inflow was not applied continuously but with dry periods in between each event according to the methods described in our previous work yong et al 2013 it was determined that an average of 21 dry weather periods occurred during any given year in brisbane as such in each simulated year 21 dry periods were mimicked by applying fan heaters at 25 c for 3 h which removed 80 of the moisture content in the pavements that is equivalent to 4 days of natural dry this was determined through a preliminary experiment 2 2 3 sampling and analysis for each flow rate three time weighted samples were collected at both inflow and outflow point over the entire duration of the event to form two composite samples i e one inflow and one outflow the collection of samples was accompanied by ph measurement to enable early predictions to be made about the behaviour of heavy metals in the systems once collected the samples were acidified stored in fridge and then delivered to a nata accredited laboratory for analysis of nine heavy metals in accordance with the standard methods described in apha awwa wpcf 2005 aluminium al cadmium cd chromium cr copper cu iron fe manganese mn nickel ni lead pb and zinc zn the lor limit of report was 0 01 mg l for al and fe and 0 001 mg l for the rest 2 3 long term treatment model development 2 3 1 proposed model algorithms in this study the simple first order decay model k c model kadlec and knight 1996 is adapted with revisions to include adsorption and desorption processes for simulation of the long term of heavy metals from porous pavements the basic equation of the k c model is 1 c o u t c c in c e k q where c in inflow concentration mg l c out outflow concentration mg l c the background concentration mg l k the event decay parameter day l and q is the hydraulic loading in this case flow rate l day equation 1 can be rearranged and written in time step basis for estimating c out as 2 c o u t t c c in t c e k q t the background concentration c is often used as a constant parameter e g in music pre calibrated c values are used for treatment performance modelling for all the treatment measures ewater 2014 however we hypothesised that c is not constant and may 1 decrease due to adsorption process depending on inflow as bench marking concentration and adsorption rate k ad and 2 increase due to desorption process depending on the total amount of pollutant accumulated in the previous time step m t 1 g and desorption rate kdes 1 l so we proposed that 3 c t c in t k a d c in t k d e s m t 1 hence the outflow concentration c out can be estimated using equations 4 and 5 4 c o u t t c in t k a d c in t k d e s m t 1 k a d c in t k d e s m t 1 e k q t 5 m t m t 1 q i n t c in t q o u t t c out t d t the model has three parameters the event decay rate k the adsorption rate k ad and desorption rate kdes the initial condition is m t 0 0 2 3 2 data preparation model calibration and validation the model was tested only for hydrapave hp and porous asphalt pa permapave was excluded for model testing as its outflow rates were not measured properly due to the failure of the rain gauge during the experiment inflow rates were controlled table 2 while the outflow rates were measured using tipping bucket rain gauge 0 2 mm tip the flow rates were then prepared in hourly time steps equivalent to 1 08 simulated day i e approximately daily time step however water quality samples were not collected on hourly time steps but as 48 h 52 simulated days composite samples see section 2 2 3 it was therefore assumed that the concentrations within each 48 h period did not change i e concentrations at any hour within the period were assumed to be the same as the measured composite concentration for the 48 h period in this way inflow and outflow rate as well as heavy metal concentrations were prepared on an hourly time step i e simulated daily time step for the proposed model testing the model was run in a simulated daily time step for the first half of the experiment i e simulated year 1 13 for hp and year 1 10 for pa for model calibration at the middle of the time step when a composite sample was collected the simulated concentration was extracted i e if the composite sample was taken from hour 1 hour 48 excluding the drying period the simulated concentration is extracted at hour 24 all the extracted concentrations from simulation were compared to the concentrations at that time step as observed for model testing using the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 10 000 model runs were conducted for parameter calibration with parameters values randomly sampled from uniform distributions the ranges were informed by preliminary model runs practices refer to table s1 of supplementary material for the detail information the use of uniform distributions was recommended by previous studies by freni and mannina 2010 when there is lack of parameter information validation of the proposed model was performed using the second half of the experiment which is independent of the data for model calibration top 1 of the parameter sets i e 100 from calibration were chosen to generate the parameter distributions which were then used to estimate the model prediction uncertainty 90 probability bands using glue method beven and binley 1992 it should be acknowledged that selection of 100 behavioural runs was quite arbitrary it however still satisfied the minimum runs required by glue and selecting the top 1 simulations resulted in much higher acceptability thresholds e g in this paper nse 0 45 for al cu fe pb and zn comparing to traditional urban drainage models i e 0 0 freni et al 2008 also suggested that higher thresholds not only allow for obtaining more relevant information of parameters responsibility in modelling uncertainty propagation but also allow for a stricter verification of the model the thresholds for mn were however only nse of 0 10 for ha and 0 0 for pa the uncertainty analysis was anyway proceeded using the top 1 parameter sets for mn 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment performance 3 1 1 overall performance the metal treatment performance of the three porous pavements over 26 simulated years are summarized in table 3 all three pavements had cumulative heavy metals removal rates of over 50 they were the most effective for pb 84 14 al 79 13 fe 77 13 and less for cu 68 19 and zn 66 20 lower but highly variable removal was found for mn 35 35 while for ni net productions were observed in most of the cases which could be entirely due to uncertainty in measurements of very low inflow concentration often of 0 005 mg l cd and cr also had very low inflow concentrations 0 01 mg l and were mostly non detected in outflow samples as such cd cr and ni were then excluded from future discussions these findings have good agreement with previous studies pagotto et al 2000 sounthararajah et al 2017 the different performance between heavy metals can be explained by their affinity to particulates e g pb al and fe are easily attached to sediments in stormwater makepeace et al 1995 and hence can be readily retained when filtering through porous pavements these retained metals can form stable complexes via surface complexation reactions bradl 2004 cu and zn are largely presented in dissolved form makepeace et al 1995 and their retention by porous pavements usually undergo via rather weak processes such as ion exchange mn also has good attachment with sediments organic matter in stormwater and in general the removal process of mn can be very complex in the form of mn oxides bradl 2004 the low and variable removal observed in this study was probably due to the very low inflow concentrations i e 0 0228 0 006 mg l for mn and 0 0032 0 001 mg l for ni when considering reusing treated stormwater or discharging to protect eco system health the degrees of heavy removal by porous pavements were insufficient since the effluent heavy metal mostly exceed australia drinking water guidelines nhmrc nrmmc 2011 and trigger values for aquatic health protect and irrigation except for mn table 3 hence it is suggested further treatment through water sensitive urban design systems e g stormwater biofilters payne et al 2015 or some advanced technologies such as using nano fibrous material filtrations shall be used sounthararajah et al 2017 3 1 2 performance change over time and impact of clogging for majority of the heavy metals a general increasing trend of effluent concentrations with fluctuations was observed over the whole experiment fig 2 the fluctuations were due to the variable input flows and concentrations that mimic reality with six large storm events contributed to the highest outflow peaks with the accumulation of metals in the systems adsorption sites became limited and desorption turned to be more prominent nevertheless the outflow concentrations were still below the inflow concentrations until the end of the experiment e g after 20 26 years of operation indicating that these systems still have capacity for metal removal mn exhibited surprisingly decreasing concentration over time fig 2 e g the effluent mn concentrations were 2 3 times lower in the end compared with the start bradl 2004 suggested that mn oxides are good sinks for cu and fe oxides and can also form pb mn formation hence exhibit co precipitation which enhances mn removal over time another important finding is that in the early stage of the system 1 2 years the systems had poorer performance and exhibited larger variabilities especially for the first few sampling events especially for mn which even had net productions fig 2 for example outflow cu concentrations in the first two years were 0 076 0 048 mg l which dropped to 0 045 0 023 mg l over the following two years therefore porous pavement systems need time to mature for stable and improved performance clogging which occurred in year 11 in pa and year 12 in hp had obvious impact on the system performance fig 2 table 3 it is estimated that after clogging average outflow concentrations were 1 2 2 4 times higher than that before clogging for pa systems and 1 3 3 6 times for hp system as time progressed clogging resulted in an increase in the detention time allowing more time for the desorption process which became more prominent due to the accumulated heavy metals over time than the adsorption this is different from previous study by myers et al 2011 who found that longer residence time led to better removal of zn cu and pb the study however only investigated one single large event i e short term on a fresh permeable pavement that had no clogging issue this reaffirms the importance of this study which looked into the long term performance of the pavement systems in removing heavy metals 3 1 3 impact of pavement type the difference in average removal between the three types of porous pavements were very small up to 5 fig 3 a with exception of the soluble metals cu zn and mn as discussed system clogging had adverse impact on system performance hence the pp which was not clogged performed best for removing these heavy metals e g specifically the average outflow heavy metal concentrations from pp were only 71 and 56 of those from hp and pa respectively table 3 in addition the difference in sub base materials may also contribute to the different observations dierkes et al 2002 observed that paving stones of porous concrete and green apertures similar to pp and pa in this study had better heavy metal retention capacities than pavers with joints similar to hp in this study although gravel and basalt as base material are usually more effective in removing pollutants dierkes et al 2002 the basalt used in pa system of this study used are much coarser than the stones in hp and gravel in pp thus resulting the lowest removal for cu zn and mn 3 1 4 impact of flow rate fig 3b indicates the impact of flow rates on removal as expected the simulated flow representing 1 in 5 yr storm led to the poorest performance e g the average removal of heavy metals except for mn were usually within the range of 40 55 while it was 70 under the other flow rates the differences of average removal rates between other flow rates flow a b c and d were small 10 for particulate metals i e pb al and fe but higher outflow concentrations usually corresponded to larger flow rates e g flow d had 4 times higher average outflow concentrations than flow a table 3 which has good agreement with previous study on the same systems for removal of tp however opposite trend was found for tn yong et al 2011 as for the soluble heavy metals i e cu zn and mn relatively higher removals were observed at flow c surprisingly it was found that the lowest rate flow a had the largest variability in heavy metal removal compared with other flow rates fig 3b which presumably due to the big reduction in removal after clogging table 3 in cases that clogging occurred lower outflow rates were observed and it benefited to the desorption process of these weakly attached metals or breakdown of trapped sediments in the clogging layer facilitated by longer detention during the event as previously reported to impact tn outflow concentration from the systems yong et al 2011 both processes may introduce more uncertainties and result in higher variabilities 3 2 model testing results the performance of the proposed model and values of calibrated parameters are summarized in table 4 with the observed and simulated outflow concentrations presented in fig 4 the overall upwards trend of heavy metal concentrations downwards for mn the fluctuations and peaks were all reasonably modelled with the nash sutcliffe coefficient nse values of 0 53 0 68 for pa and 0 56 0 64 for hp respectively indicating that the model can estimate the release of heavy metals from two porous pavements with satisfactory mn was again an exception and had the poorest model efficiency e 0 13 for hp and 0 00 for pa due to its complex potential removal processes and variable performance observed the calibrated values of adsorption rate k ads and desorption rate k des had good agreement with the pollutant removal performance observed with higher k ads and lower k des values indicating relatively higher removal rates e g the particulate heavy metals pb al and fe are characterized as higher k ads and lower k des values vice versa for the soluble ones zn cu and mn fig 4 illustrates the 90 prediction bands as well as the best fit of prediction best performance was observed for al and cu in both systems with 50 91 of observations covered by the prediction bands table 4 and the trends and fluctuations were simulated reasonably well max nse 0 44 0 74 fe concentrations was over predicted by the model and the best fit of prediction in pa system extended slightly outside of the lower bound of the 90 prediction band nevertheless the overall prediction performance for fe was acceptable evidenced by the nse of 0 42 for pa and 0 69 for hp as for pb the peak concentrations after year 15 were under predicted by the model with relatively poorer model performance 77 and 27 observations within prediction band max nse of 0 20 and 0 39 for pa and hp respectively the model did not predict zn concentrations well nse 0 04 especially for that in hp systems best fit of the predictions were out of the 90 prediction bands and only 22 observations within the band indicating that other important removal processes of these heavy metals not considered in the model e g complexation with other compounds or biological transformation might occur although the model predicted same decreasing trend of mn concentrations as observed it produced the worst model results e g 46 and 9 for hp observations within prediction band max nse of 0 for pa and hp respectively it should be acknowledged that 90 prediction bands were generated in a strict way i e using glue method based on top 1 parameter sets corresponding to cut off thresholds of nse 0 45 for all the metals which in some cases caused the best fit prediction fell out of the 90 prediction bands e g zn in hp system it was checked that the whole prediction band overlapped with the best fit prediction it however provides a stronger verification of the proposed model overall the results indicate that model has abilities to predict long term performance of porous pavements for some heavy metals e g most promisingly for al and cu with high nse values and coverage of observations within the 90 bands followed by fe and pb with lower coverage of observed data within the 90 prediction bands the proposed model has to be improved further for predicting zn and mn removal by the porous pavements e g it is suggested to include more removal processes of these two metals in model the efficiency of the proposed model performance nse values equal to 0 44 0 74 for al and cu 0 42 0 69 for fe and 0 20 0 29 for pb are reasonably good except for zn and mn nse from negative to 0 04 and have good agreements to previous reported water quality models for porous pavements e g newton 2005 s one parameter first decay model adapted from filtration theory can predict particle removal efficient from pavement systems under several individual events with different levels of satisfactory low flow rates with nse 0 36 0 98 and high flow rates with nse from negative to 0 39 he et al 2015 s empirical model developed based on laboratory data also provided good predictions on six field tests results for tss and tp removal by porous concrete pavement with errors of up to 2 9 for average removal rates the same study also tested a sediment removal conceptual model and reported prediction errors of 1 3 and 5 8 for tss removal rates for two validation field events as seen these existing models are simple and can perform well they however were just validated against individual events and could not be used for predicting long term performance of pavement systems that are exposed to continuous stormwater events the current proposed model however has overcome these shortcomings and this study for the first time developed a new process based model specifically for heavy metals involving both adsorption and desorption processes more importantly its greater utility has been supported by the ability to simulate long term treatment performance thus can assist in better design of pavement systems 4 conclusions this study tested the long term treatment performance of three porous pavements porous asphalt pa hydrapave hp and permapave pp in removing heavy metals using accelerated laboratory experiments spanning over 1 year simulating 26 years of operations intermittent dry wetting periods were also simulated with varying flow conditions to represent a realistic operational scheme a water quality model that includes adsorption and desorption processes was proposed and tested using experimental data the main findings are all three porous pavements were good in removing heavy metals with average cumulative removal rates over 26 years of operations being 84 14 for pb 79 13 for al 77 13 for fe 68 19 for fe 66 20 for zn and 35 35 for mn metals with higher particulate fractions pb al and fe usually were easier to be retained by the pavements compared to soluble ones e g cu zn and mn over the simulated 26 year period effluent concentrations generally increased indicating the long term release of heavy metals as a result of adsorption and desorption process it was found that the porous systems took 1 2 years to mature for better and more stable performance clogging led to poorer system performance with higher variability permapave pp had the best performance as it was never clogged over the period followed by hydrapave hp and porous asphalt pa lower removals of soluble heavy metals was observed in the pavements with coarser sub materials in pa flow rates influenced the heavy metal removal with higher outflow concentrations usually corresponded to higher flowrate especially for the soluble heavy metals low flow rates was also not preferred especially after clogging occurred as it benefited to desorption processes and breakdown of accumulated sediments leading to higher variability in heavy metal outflow concentrations the proposed model was successfully calibrated against the data collected from first half of the accelerated experiment e g 10 13 years with the estimated nse values 0 53 0 68 except for mn which had nse of 0 0 0 13 the prediction results indicate that the proposed model was promising for predict the releasing of al and cu from the porous pavements 50 91 of observations covered by the prediction bands max nse 0 44 0 74 it can also be applied for fe and pb but with lower confidence nse 0 42 0 69 for fe and 0 20 0 29 for pb and smaller coverage of observed data within the 90 prediction bands the proposed model has to be improved further if it is to be used for predicting zn and mn removal by the porous pavements appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 1 multimedia component

nutrients volatile fatty acids vfas as the main product in the acidogenesis phase of was anaerobic digestion are considered to be a promising platform to recover carbon from was because of its diversified potential application compared to gaseous products kleerebezem et al 2015 mixed culture mc polyhydroxyalkanoate pha synthesis using was acidogenic vfas has attracted increasing research interest in the context of growing needs for environmental benign bioplastic jiang et al 2009 jia et al 2013a morgan sagastume et al 2015 huang et al 2018 enough vfa conversion rate should be the primary concern for was acidification when it is linked to mc pha process various methods to promote vfa yield in was acidification have been developed e g using pretreatments zhang et al 2015 through in situ processing control such as the regulation of ph chen et al 2017 yuan et al 2006 temperature hao and wang 2015 additives guan et al 2017 and through substrate component regulation based on carbon to nitrogen ratio guo et al 2015 ma et al 2017 through these ways hydrolysis of organic matters and acidification process have been enhanced however the residual proteins and polysaccharides in was acidification products cannot be directly used in pha synthesis and will further negatively affect the pha production jia et al 2013a morgan sagastume et al 2010 although vfa yield is the most common indicator in anaerobic acidification optimization acidification degree which denotes the vfa proportion in the soluble carbon in the acidification liquid is a more proper parameter when considering the substrate availability for the downstream biological processes more importantly to further optimize the mc pha process specific requirement for substrate composition needs to be considered the fraction of hydroxyvalerate hv monomer in the polymer is positively associated with the proportion of vfa odd i e the total abundance of vfas with odd carbon atoms such as propionic iso and valeric acids in the vfa mixture lemos et al 2006 higher hv content brings more toughness which can effectively improve the processing performance of the polymer dias et al 2006 therefore to extend the processing window of the final products of mc pha process hv content needs to be flexibly manipulated thus vfa odd proportion in the substrate needs to be regulated in a wide range studies on the regulation of propionic acid production during anaerobic fermentation using pure strain acidification chen et al 2013 novel additive luo et al 2015 and varying substrate garcia aguirre et al 2017 have been reported however compared to the plenty of studies focusing on the promotion of total vfa production more investigations focusing on product composition are still needed therefore an oriented was acidification process is necessary to meet the substrate requirement of the downstream mc pha production and such process should be able to effectively regulate vfa odd production and improve acidification degree among the methods applied to enhance the vfa production reaction ph was a frequently concerned factor which can affect both the vfa yield and its composition jankowska et al 2015 alkaline acidification ph from 8 to 10 can significantly enhance the was hydrolysis and acidification yuan et al 2006 yu et al 2008 however it seemed to be inefficient to regulate vfa odd production with vfa odd proportions usually not exceeding 40 of total vfas and narrow response amplitudes by solely changing the reaction ph under this condition jankowska et al 2015 peng et al 2009 β cyclodextrin β cd has been observed to be a promoter for the solubilization of organic matters in was but it showed no significant effect on the vfa composition without ph control yang et al 2012 and the effect of β cd on vfa odd proportion under alkaline condition remains unknown regulating carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of the was by adding carbon rich substrate has proved to be able to significantly enhance the vfa production and influence the vfa odd proportion and the response range was found to depend on the nature of the supplementary material luo et al 2015 rughoonundun et al 2012 as an over produced chemical glycerol possesses high reduction degree so that more propionic acids can be produced to maintain the redox balance in pure culture glycerol acidification wang and yang 2013 however this potential advantage has not been verified in alkaline mixed culture acidification process research on the enhancement of vfa odd production in the pure culture acidification e g propionibacterium mainly focused on the optimization of metabolic flux wang and yang 2013 however as one of the important research points in mixed culture was acidification process the evolution of vfa odd production related function bodies should be of concern enrichment of a propionic acid producing bacteria propionibacterineae and reduction of a vfa odd consuming bacteria proteobacteria were both observed when alkyl polyglucose was added into the was acidification system which was considered to be the main reason for the reinforcement of vfa odd production under this condition luo et al 2015 more investigations at the microbial ecological level need to be conducted to further understand the mechanisms of vfa odd regulation in this study reaction ph fraction of added β cd and glycerol were selected as the regulators and response surface methodology rsm was used to perform the proposed oriented was acidification the reliability and effectiveness of the regulation strategy were further tested in semi continuous reactors the dynamics of microbial community along with the variation of the operating conditions and the roles of anaerobic microbial community in the vfa odd oriented acidification of was were investigated as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the inoculum and feedstock pure was used as both the inoculum and feedstock was taken from a secondary sedimentation tank in a local waste water treatment plant employing a a o process with a sludge retention time srt of 15 days harbin china the characteristics of the was are described in table 1 chemical pure β cd aladdin china was used to enhance the was hydrolysis chemical pure glycerol xilong scientific china was used as the carbon addition of the feedstock 2 2 experiment set up and basic operation two kinds of anaerobic reactors were used in this research namely the batch reactor fig 1 a used for the rsm experiment with a working volume of 500 ml and the semi continuous reactor fig 1b with a working volume of 5 5 l both kinds of reactors were made from polymethyl methacrylate pmma reaction temperature was kept constant in mesophilic conditions 35 1 c and reaction ph was regulated with naoh 3 mol l by the auto controller according to the experiment design pure nitrogen was bubbled through the distributor after the feedstock was added the mixture was mechanically stirred at 550 rpm in both kinds of reactors 2 3 rsm and batch acidification assays reaction ph fraction of glycerol and β cd in the feedstock were selected as three variables and c n was used in this study to accurately measure the glycerol fraction a three variable five level central composite design ccd as shown in table 2 was developed to guide the experiment in this study design expert software v 8 05 usa this design consisted of six axial points coded as 1 68 eight fractional points coded as 1 and six replications of center points coded as 0 the vfa odd proportion and acidification degree of the sludge samples taken from the reactors at day 10 were set as the actual response factors two predictive polynominal quadratic models also the basis of oriented acidification strategy in this study were obtained according to the regression analysis of the software before each assay started the glycerol and β cd were mixed with was based on the given proportion quantified by c n and g gtss respectively in addition acidification assays using sole was sole glycerol was glycerol mixture and was starch mixture were conducted at ph 9 to evaluate synergistic effect of was and added carbon source initial c n was regulated to 20 in the acidification assays using was glycerol and was starch and the details of the inoculation and operation were the same with that of the rsm assays all the batch acidification assays were operated for 12 days in this research 2 4 semi continuous acidification and pha production test to test the reliability of the oriented acidification strategies two semi continuous reactors working volume of 5 5l for each were operated under three different conditions i e different combinations of ph c n and β cd proportion based on the optimal regulation strategy reactor i was operated under condition 1 ph 8 0 c n 16 β cd 0 1 g g tss throughout 40 days of operation reactor ii was operated under condition 2 ph 8 5 c n 12 β cd 0 05 g g tss for 20 days and then switched to condition 3 ph 9 0 c n 9 β cd 0 15 g g tss the details of the three conditions were also shown in the result section after 4l of was was inoculated each reactor was firstly operated without feeding for one week the feedstock was then pumped into the reactors after equal volume of mixed liquor was pumped out both reactors were fed four times per day of which srt was kept at 8 25 day the feedstock loading rate was kept at 2 36 0 09 gvss l day the acidification products collected under the three conditions were clarified by ceramic membrane and used as the substrate for mc pha production respectively the mcs were acclimated under the feast famine mode huang et al 2018 using clarified acidification liquid obtained from reactor i for two months operating details can be seen in supplementary information s1 fed batch pha accumulation assays were used to test the maximum intracellular pha content and final polymer composition batch reactors 500 ml were inoculated with mcs 200 ml collected from the acclimating reactor and fed with 200 ml of the substrate i e clarified fermentation liquid which respectively collected from the semi continuous reactors under different conditions the concentration of the fed substrate was approximately 5 8 g cod l each time when the substrate was exhausted indicated by a rapid increase in do concentration the aeration stopped and mc floc settled two hundred milliliter of supernatant was then removed after settling and the same volume of the substrate was added the mcs were fed five times in a whole fed batch assay 2 5 microbial community analysis sludge samples were taken from the semi continuous reactors along the operation and stored at 80 c before using the total genomic dna was extracted from the biomass samples using an e z n a bacterial dna kit omega usa 16s rrna gene were subjected to high throughput sequencing by shanghai realbio technology co ltd shanghai china using the illumina hiseq pe250 sequencing platform illumina inc ca usa the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna genes were amplified with primer 341f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 further data processing were the same as described in our previous publications huang et al 2018 otu table were generated after data sets rarefied to 40 000 reads per sample raw sequence data is available at ncbi bioproject prjna411763 2 6 parameter analysis elements of carbon c and nitrogen n of the was were determined by an elemental analyzer elementar vario el cube german vfa odd content was calculated as the sum of the contents of measured vfas with odd carbon atoms including propionic n valeric and iso valeric acid protein and saccharide were measured using lowry protein detection kit labaide china and phenol sulfate acid methods gerhardt et al 1994 respectively total suspended solid tss soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were obtained according to the standard methods of chinese sepac 2002 acidification degree was calculated by dividing the sum of the vfa molecules in mg cod l by scod of the terminal fermented liquid filtrated by 0 45 μm polyether sulfone filter the quantification of pha was performed using a gas chromatograph gc7890n agilent united states with a flame ionization detector fid as previously described wen et al 2012 quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime were obtained using α shannon and simpson index and β weighted unifrac distance diversity for each sample α diversity index was evaluated based on sequenced 40 000 clean reads the principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted based on the weighted unifrac distances of the biomass samples the heat map exhibiting relative abundances of otus was generated using microsoft excel v 2013 correlations between microbial community members and system function were calculated using redundancy analysis rda in the canoco 5 0 lepx and smilauer 2003 2 7 statistical analysis the system function related parameters during the stable phases of the semi continuous reactors were compared using one way anova test conducted in the ibm spss statistics v 20 p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant unless otherwise stated 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical acidification in a single acidification assay the temporal profiles of vfa soluble protein and saccharide in the liquid phase in a typical single was acidification assay 11days operation with reaction ph 8 c n 20 and β cd 0 1 g gtss are shown in fig 2 the acidification degree reached 30 53 2 45 at day 2 and did not increase significantly from day 3 to day 7 but increased sharply to 88 72 3 02 in day 9 and kept relatively steady afterwards this two stage variation was mainly attributed to the start up mode of acidification assays including both batch and semi continuous assays in this study as the was was used as both the inoculum and feedstock an enrichment period for acidogenic bacteria was need during this period although the release process of protein and saccharide within was flocs was enhanced by the alkaline condition and β cd addition yang et al 2012 yuan et al 2006 yu et al 2008 less vfas were produced due to the possible relative low population of acidogenic groups soluble saccharides rapidly increased to 200 10 56 mg l by day 2 and kept at a relative balanced state afterwards by contrast soluble protein showed an opposite trend between day 7 and day 8 it decreased from 413 76 15 25 mg l to 346 47 12 04 mg l and reached a new balanced state afterwards which suggests that soluble saccharides and protein in the liquid phase were in a dynamic balance between dissociation and uptake by the acidogenic bacteria during the acidification process compared to the two stage variation of the acidification degree vfa odd proportion sharply increased to 57 89 3 66 at day 4 and kept relatively steady afterwards showing that there was no clear correlation between the composition and the total yield of vfas 3 2 vfa odd based orientaed acidification strategy using rsm twenty batch acidification assays were conducted according the ccd plan of the rsm table 2 the fit summary of the software suggested that the quadratic model with a higher significance compared to other fitting models can be used as the appropriate one for both two responses vfa odd proportion and acidification degree the following two mathematical regressions using coded factors table 2 were generated r 1 vfa odd proportion 257 92 59 99a 384 62b 3 42c 25 76ab 0 81ac 0 11bc 4 05a2 417 54 b2 0 29 c2 r 2 acidification degree 734 84

from the analysis the two regression models showed high significance as the f tests was of very low probability values pmodel f r1 0 0001 pmodel f r2 0 0013 with high enough adequate precision 11 38 for r 1 and 9 97 for r 2 the regression models proved to be applicable good precision and reliability of the two models were indicated by their relatively low values of the coefficient of variation cv which was 9 35 for r 1 and 11 48 for r 2 respectively the actual values were distributed relatively near to the straight line in the predicted versus actual plots for r 1 and r 2 data not shown which further supported the reliability of the models the contour and 3d surface plots of rsm for response r 1 and r 2 are shown in fig 3 and fig s1 by holding one factor at zero level respectively 3 2 2 impacts of the three factors for vfa odd proportion the main effect of reaction ph a and glycerol fraction c the second order effect of reaction ph a2 β cd fraction b2 and glycerol fraction c2 and the two level interactions of reaction ph and glycerol fraction ac were considered as the significant model terms according to their low probability values 0 05 in the f tests of the anova analysis table s1 as can be seen in fig 3b and fig s1b a high percentage of vfa odd greater than 60 of the total vfas which is comparable to the value achieved using pure propionibacteria acidification chen et al 2013 can be obtained in the area with feed c n ranging from 15 to 20 and ph ranging from 8 0 to 9 5 when β cd fraction was held at zero level 0 2 g gtss it can be observed that under alkaline condition increasing reaction ph led to the decrease of vfa odd proportion overall the negative effect of high reaction ph on propionic acid production has been reported in literature using both the pure culture chen et al 2013 and mixed culture was acidification assays feng et al 2009 in the rsm assays in this research the main component of the vfa odd mixtures was also propionic acid generally exceeding 90 of the vfa odd concrete data not shown as an important factor in the conversion step of pyruvate to propionic acid vitamin b12 generally cannot exist in the strong alkaline conditions ma et al 2017 savvi et al 2008 which should be closely associated to the inhibition of high reaction ph on the propionic accumulation the relative impact weight of glycerol fraction 9 88 was higher than that of reaction ph 5 99 according to the corresponding f values obtained from the anova analysis which reveals that glycerol fraction was a more important factor affecting the vfa odd production the vfa odd proportion was reported to decrease with c n increasing from 7 to 20 when perennial ryegrass was used as the additive jia et al 2013b whereas in this research a converse relationship was obtained when c n ranged from 7 to 18 only when c n increased higher than 18 the vfa odd proportion decreased jia et al 2013b believed that substrate with a higher c n e g 20 was considered to be more balanced for microbes and thus can enhance the activity of acidification related enzymes however higher fraction of vfa even vfa with even carbon atoms mainly acetic and butyric acid was obtained in the finial products in their research which implied that activities of enzymes associated with vfa odd production e g oxaloacetate transcarboxylase for propionic acid were not preferentially enhanced compared to those associated with vfa even production the different results in vfa odd proportions with the higher c n between this study and jia et al 2013b work were probably caused by the nature of the adding carbon source perennial ryegrass versus glycerol which will be further discussed in a later section for the acidification degree the main effect of reaction ph a the second order effect of reaction ph a2 and β cd addition b2 and the two level interactions of reaction ph and glycerol fraction ac were considered as the significant model terms according to their low probability values 0 05 in the f tests as can be seen in fig 3e and fig s1e the high acidification degree larger than 90 can be obtained in the area with reaction ph ranging from 7 5 to 8 5 and c n ranging from 15 to 20 when β cd addition was held at zero level 0 2 g gtss reaction ph had the maximum impact weight which was quantified by the maximum coefficient value 15 30 compared to other factors sludge matrix will be fully decomposed at high ph condition especially within ph 9 to 10 thus an effective contact between extracellular organic matters and enzymes was ensured and an enhanced vfa accumulation was resulted yu et al 2008 however as shown in fig 3d e and fig s1d e the acidification degree decreased remarkably when reaction ph ranged from 9 to 10 in this research the varied feedstock composition caused by the glycerol addition might be responsible for the discrepant response of the acidification degree to reaction ph compared to the was acidification process mainly limited by sludge matrix decomposition yu et al 2008 the acidification of was and glycerol will depend more on the enzymatic process and the activities of these biotic reactions could be inhibited by the high reaction ph feng et al 2009 luo et al 2015 ma et al 2017 alkaline ph and β cd addition have been reported to have similar function in making the organic matters more soluble and bioavailable yuan et al 2006 yang et al 2012 however the isolated was acidification assays at ph 9 0 conducted previously in our research showed that compared to the control assay without β cd addition the acidification degree of assays with β cd of 0 2 g gtss and 0 3 g gtss increased by 22 48 and 32 31 respectively fig s2 indicating that β cd could further enhanced the was hydrolysis process under alkaline ph condition 3 2 3 the synergistic effect of was and glycerol on the vfa odd production in order to reveal the role of glycerol addition in the enhancement of the vfa odd production vfa production from the sole was sole glycerol with 10 mass percent of was as inoculum and was glycerol mixture were compared fig 4 a the vfa odd proportions of 28 5 2 4 and 36 2 3 6 were obtained in the acidification of sole was and sole glycerol respectively both below that in the acidification of was glycerol mixture 61 8 2 2 this indicated that the enhancement of the vfa odd production was caused by the synergistic effect of was and glycerol the addition of carbon rich substrate in the low c n was have been reported to be an effective way to enhance the release of hydrolysis related enzymes and then facilitated the accumulation of vfas or relative precursors substrate chen et al 2013 yu et al 2008 in this study such enhancement was also verified as can be seen in fig 4b the vfa generated fromwas and glycerol c n 20 at ph 9 was 573 7 3 7 mgcod gvss which was much higher than those with sole was and sole glycerol 230 7 6 4 and 243 7 3 4 mgcod gvss respectively however the synergistic enhancement has never been associated with vfa odd production in the mixed culture acidification before two aspects i e the c n ratio and the added carbon type need to be considered when further evaluating the effect of glycerol addition to distinguish the effect in such two aspects another acidification assay under the same feed c n but using starch as the added carbon was conducted the vfa odd proportion of was glycerol mixture was obviously higher than that of the was starch mixture 49 3 2 fig 4a although their vfa yield was similar fig 4b this proved that was acidification with glycerol addition showed preference in vfa odd accumulation therefore the carbon type further affected vfa odd production on the basis of the effect of balanced feed c n 3 2 4 optimization the optimization criteria set for the oriented acidification was originated from the consideration that the fermented product is going to be effectively utilized in the downstream pha production process the maximum vfa odd proportion is not the only goal in the oriented acidification since the vfa odd proportion in the fermented product should be flexibly regulated to achieve the maximization of the process window of the p 3hb co 3hv which is determined by the hb hv ratio therefore both vfa odd proportion and acidification degree should be considered in oriented acidification process the optimization strategy was generated from the overlapped plots obtained from varying reaction ph and c n while changing β cd addition ratio discontinuously on the contours of response surfaces of r 1 and r 2 see details in fig 5 the highlighted areas of the overlapped plots were considered as the satisfaction zone by defining the desired vfa odd proportion higher than 40 and acidification degree higher than 60 3 3 semi continuous acidification and pha production semi continuous anaerobic reactors were operated to test the feasibility effectiveness and accuracy of the oriented acidification strategies operating condition 1 figs 5a 2 fig 5b and 3 fig 5c with gradient predicted vfa odd proportions were selected from the overlapped plots within the optimization criteria as can be seen in fig 6 a and b for all the three conditions steady state of both vfa odd proportion and acidification degree were achieved after an adaptive phase 5 8 days indicating the feasibility of the oriented strategies vfa odd proportion of 59 51 1 13 46 57 1 90 and 36 84 0 56 were obtained under condition 1 2 and 3 respectively the significant gradient in vfa odd proportion values with significant differences p 0 0001 in anova test as shown in fig s3a verified the effectiveness of the oriented acidification strategy in vfa composition regulation on the contrary the acidification degree showed no significant difference as shown in fig s3b the average acidification degree was 83 23 0 72 65 14 1 46 and 69 04 1 14 under condition1 2 and 3 respectively the different sensitivity of these two parameters in response to the variation of the operating conditions just met the criteria set for the oriented acidification i e enough acidification degree was ensured when vfa odd proportion was regulated the maximum vfa odd proportion of 59 51 1 13 and acidification degree of 83 23 0 72 were achieved simultaneously under condition 1 and propionic acid was the dominant component in the vfa mixtures fig 6c it is worth noting that the measured vfa odd proportion and acidification degree in all the three systems were lower than the predicated values obtained from the regression models fig 6a and b the deviations of the acidification degree were larger than those of vfa odd proportion under all the three conditions indicating that acidification degree was more sensitive to a decreased srt in the semi continuous reactors 8 25 days compared to that in the rsm assays 10 days moreover the deviation of the acidification degree under condition 3 the lowest c n was larger than that under condition 1 and 2 which indicated that the total vfa production might be more sensitive to the srt under low c n where sludge matrix decomposition was the rate limiting step the acidification liquid obtained from the reactors under the three conditions was collected and used for pha production by mixed cultures as can be seen in table 3 for all the three pha accumulation assays the final pha content exceeded 55 of cell dry weight the monomer hv proportion in the polymer can be regulated from 42 3 3 3 to 72 4 5 2 which showed high correlations with the vfa odd fraction in the acidification product to give a perspective of the practical potential of the oriented acidification strategies condition 1 hv proportion of 72 4 5 2 was used as an illustration the calculation showed that 2 13 kg pure glycerol and 0 21 kg β cd were required for one kg produced pha based on the pha conversion rate in the batch pha production assay of 0 81 gcod pha gcod s and the vfa yield in the was acidification assay of 0 55 gcod gtss glycerol is currently an over produced chemical and crude glycerol a by product in the biodiesel production process can be used instead to further decrease the costs of external carbon addition 3 4 microbial community dynamics during the oriented acidification 3 4 1 frequent and dominant species twelve samples were taken from the semi continuous reactors under steady state six of which were from condition 1 three were from condition 2 and three were from condition 3 the otus with 97 similarity were mainly classified into 7 phyla proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria candidatus saccharibacteria acidobacteria and euryarchaeota phylum proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes are frequently observed in bio waste anaerobic acidification reactors for their ability to degrade a wide range of substances such as protein cellulose and pectin chouari et al 2005 zitomer et al 2016 in this study the frequent species in the microbial community were denoted by the otus with the relative abundance exceeding 1 5 in at least 2 samples twenty nine frequent otus were screened and classified as shown in fig 7 a which are mainly from classes of bacteroidetes actinobacteria alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria bacilli clostridia and methanobacteria based on the average relative abundance otu 6 genus trichococcus otu 13 phylum bacteroidetes and otu 16 genus dechloromonas dominated under condition 1 otu 6 and otu 4 genus methanobrevibacter dominated under condition 2 and otu 6 otu 11 genus clostridium xivb and otu 8 family ruminococcaceae were the dominant species under condition 3 the well known biogas producer phylum euryarchaeota was also identified in the was acidification reactors otu 4 genus methanobrevibacter identified as a hydrogen utilizing methane producer and also an indirect vfa consumer was observed in high relative abundance 18 74 under conditions 2 strains isolated from this genus were found to be able to exist in anaerobic system with short hrt maspolim et al 2015 and alkaline ph e g 8 3 9 3 boone et al 1986 in the acidification system in this research three factors might inhibit the function of methane producer 1 alkaline condition reaction ph higher than 9 0 condition 3 could significantly inhibit the metabolic activity of methane producers yuan et al 2006 2 β cd which was shown to adversely affect the methane production yang et al 2012 3 propionate accumulation methane producers were considered to be sensitive to the toxicity of the propionate barredo and evison 1991 compared to condition 1 and 3 operating condition 2 had the lowest β cd concentration 0 05 g g tss relative lower reaction ph 8 5 and propionate concentration 22 mmol l and the combination of these conditions would create a suitable niche for the bacteria belonging to genus methanobrevibacter the comparatively lower predicted acidification degree under condition 2 can be attributed to the higher relative abundance of such indirect vfa consumers with the existence of hydrogen producing bacteria e g bacteria in genus petrimonas sun et al 2015 the higher sensitivity to short srt pulled down the observed acidification degree under condition 3 which became close to the value under condition 2 3 4 2 structure evolution the overall difference of the microbial community structure under the three operating conditions is exhibited via comparing α and β diversity of the microbial community for α diversity indicated by shannon and simpson indexes the species richness and community evenness under condition 1 and 3 were similar while the species richness and community evenness under condition 2 was apparently lower than those under condition 1 and 3 as shown in fig 7b otu 4 genus methanobrevibacter and otu 6 genus dechloromonas together accounted for 36 27 of the detected sequences which was far greater than the sum of relative abundances of the dominant species under condition 1 16 2 and 3 20 2 indicating the significant dominance of the top species under condition 2 for β diversity emphasizing the community difference among samples the weighted unifrac distances between any two of these samples were calculated according to both phylogenetic relationship and relative abundance of taxa in each sample the pcoa analysis was then conducted based on the matrix of the weighted pair wise unifrac distances between samples as can be seen in fig 7c the samples can be apparently clustered into three groups corresponding to the operating conditions and the three groups located in different quadrants in the pcoa plot indicating that the inter group difference was more obvious than the intra group difference therefore it can be concluded that the operating conditions significantly influenced the microbial community structure both at the genotypic and the taxonomic abundance level 3 4 3 function groups in the semi continuous reactor three kinds of correlations including species species vfa vfa and vfa species were evaluated using rda by projecting one factor s arrowheads onto the imaginary line running in the direction of another factor s arrows based on the clustering of the arrows of the frequent species on the rda map functional groups that synchronously varied and closely related to the variations of the specific vfa in the acidification process can be distinguished as can be seen in fig 8 a totally 13 frequent species all in the third quadrant and colored by orange can be incorporated into the microbial function group related to propionic acid production denoted by gprop in this study along with the operating condition from 1 to 3 the proportion of propionic acid decreased from 54 40 2 67 to 33 99 1 96 while the proportion of acetic butyric and valeric acid showed opposite variation trends the members of function groups related to acetic blue color butyric and valeric acids grey color production were much less compared to those related to propionic acid production in this study four subgroups in the gprop can be partitioned based on the trophic levels in the acidification process producer cooperator competitor and consumer fig 8b obligate propionic acid producer such as genus propionibacterium chen et al 2013 was not observed in the acidification system as can be seen in table 4 otu 21 belonging to genus proteinborus was defined as producers for it has demonstrated the ability to produce propionic acid using amino acid as the substrate otu 45 belonging to genus petrimonas and otu 78 belonging to order clostridiales were another two producers as they have proved to be capable of producing propionic acid using lactate as the substrate otu 20 42 belonging to the genus lactococcus and otu 55 belonging to genus bacteroides can be defined as cooperators since their end metabolites such as lactate and succinate can be further taken up by the propionic producers otu 61 belonging to genus tissierella was defined as a competitor because it would utilize amino acid as the substrate to solely produce acetate and no reference has reported the propionic acid production in the fermentation tests using strains of genus tissierella this competitor stayed at the same trophic level below the cooperators and shared similar resources lactate and amino acid with the propionic acid producers but showed synchronous instead of inverse relationships with them the possible close substrate affinity and growth kinetic might result in the co occurrence pattern under competition volterra 1926 otu 16 belonging to genus dechloromonas and otu 54 belonging to genus novosphingobium were defined as consumers in the gprop as they have demonstrated the ability of consuming the propionate to reduce the nitrite the dependency of the bacteria in gprop on the glycerol proportion in the feedstock as quantified by c n shown in fig 8c could explain the dominant impact of c n on the vfa odd production although obligate propionic acid producer like propionibacterium which has a complete metabolic pathway of propionic acid production was not detected in the semi continuous acidification systems it was highly possible that bacteria within the gprop at different trophic levels cooperators and producers as shown in fig 8b connected their metabolic pathways to form a complete metabolic chain from glycerol amino acid and carbohydrate to propionic acid in the gprop the acidifying bacteria using amino acid and saccharide e g otu 21 would synchronously varied with the variation of bacteria using glycerol e g otu 20 herewith it can be speculated that this ecological synergism contributed to the synergistic enhancement of was and glycerol on the vfa odd production described in section 3 2 3 4 conclusion in this study the strategy of oriented was acidification based on rsm was demonstrated to be able to enhance and effectively regulate the vfa odd proportion while keeping a high acidification degree in the finial fermentation products by changing the reaction ph fraction of added β cd and glycerol the glycerol addition ratio was found to be the predominant impact factor in regulating the vfa odd proportion according to the anova test and the carbon type further affected vfa odd production on the basis of the effect of balanced feed c n the significant succession of microbial community in the semi continuous acidification system should be the internal cause of the variation of vfa composition the propionic acid production related microbial function group was partitioned into producers cooperators competitors and consumers and the producers and cooperators within the gprop would jointly support the function of propionic accumulation in the oriented acidification process

19474,as the main intermediate metabolite in anaerobic digestion of wasted activated sludge was volatile fatty acids vfas are proper substrate for mixed culture mc polyhydroxyalkanoate pha synthesis to further optimize the performance of mc pha production process vfa odd i e vfa with odd carbon atoms oriented acidification process was proposed and conducted in this study three regulation factors including reaction ph fraction of added β cyclodextrin β cd and glycerol were selected and response surface methodology rsm was used to enhance and effectively regulate the vfa odd production while maintaining enough acidification degree in the was acidification high percentage of vfa odd larger than 60 and dominated by propionic acid can be obtained in the operating condition area with glycerol addition ratio quantified by c n ranging from 15 to 20 and reaction ph ranging from 8 0 to 9 5 when β cd addition was held at zero level 0 2 g gtss according to the rsm semi continuous acidification and mc pha production assays further verified the reliability and effectiveness of the vfa odd oriented acidification strategy microbial function group related to propionic acid production gprop was defined based on the relationships between system function and microbial community structure and 13 frequent species were found being involved in the gprop roles of the group members in the oriented acidification were analyzed to understand the mechanisms of the regulation of vfa odd production at microbial ecological level a synergistic effect of was and glycerol on the vfa odd production in the acidification process was revealed based on the ecological analysis graphical abstract image 1 keywords wasted activated sludge was oriented acidification vfa odd response surface methodology rsm microbial function group 1 introduction the role of waste activated sludge was has changed from troublesome second pollutant needing high energy disposal to valuable resource rich in carbon and nutrients volatile fatty acids vfas as the main product in the acidogenesis phase of was anaerobic digestion are considered to be a promising platform to recover carbon from was because of its diversified potential application compared to gaseous products kleerebezem et al 2015 mixed culture mc polyhydroxyalkanoate pha synthesis using was acidogenic vfas has attracted increasing research interest in the context of growing needs for environmental benign bioplastic jiang et al 2009 jia et al 2013a morgan sagastume et al 2015 huang et al 2018 enough vfa conversion rate should be the primary concern for was acidification when it is linked to mc pha process various methods to promote vfa yield in was acidification have been developed e g using pretreatments zhang et al 2015 through in situ processing control such as the regulation of ph chen et al 2017 yuan et al 2006 temperature hao and wang 2015 additives guan et al 2017 and through substrate component regulation based on carbon to nitrogen ratio guo et al 2015 ma et al 2017 through these ways hydrolysis of organic matters and acidification process have been enhanced however the residual proteins and polysaccharides in was acidification products cannot be directly used in pha synthesis and will further negatively affect the pha production jia et al 2013a morgan sagastume et al 2010 although vfa yield is the most common indicator in anaerobic acidification optimization acidification degree which denotes the vfa proportion in the soluble carbon in the acidification liquid is a more proper parameter when considering the substrate availability for the downstream biological processes more importantly to further optimize the mc pha process specific requirement for substrate composition needs to be considered the fraction of hydroxyvalerate hv monomer in the polymer is positively associated with the proportion of vfa odd i e the total abundance of vfas with odd carbon atoms such as propionic iso and valeric acids in the vfa mixture lemos et al 2006 higher hv content brings more toughness which can effectively improve the processing performance of the polymer dias et al 2006 therefore to extend the processing window of the final products of mc pha process hv content needs to be flexibly manipulated thus vfa odd proportion in the substrate needs to be regulated in a wide range studies on the regulation of propionic acid production during anaerobic fermentation using pure strain acidification chen et al 2013 novel additive luo et al 2015 and varying substrate garcia aguirre et al 2017 have been reported however compared to the plenty of studies focusing on the promotion of total vfa production more investigations focusing on product composition are still needed therefore an oriented was acidification process is necessary to meet the substrate requirement of the downstream mc pha production and such process should be able to effectively regulate vfa odd production and improve acidification degree among the methods applied to enhance the vfa production reaction ph was a frequently concerned factor which can affect both the vfa yield and its composition jankowska et al 2015 alkaline acidification ph from 8 to 10 can significantly enhance the was hydrolysis and acidification yuan et al 2006 yu et al 2008 however it seemed to be inefficient to regulate vfa odd production with vfa odd proportions usually not exceeding 40 of total vfas and narrow response amplitudes by solely changing the reaction ph under this condition jankowska et al 2015 peng et al 2009 β cyclodextrin β cd has been observed to be a promoter for the solubilization of organic matters in was but it showed no significant effect on the vfa composition without ph control yang et al 2012 and the effect of β cd on vfa odd proportion under alkaline condition remains unknown regulating carbon to nitrogen ratio c n of the was by adding carbon rich substrate has proved to be able to significantly enhance the vfa production and influence the vfa odd proportion and the response range was found to depend on the nature of the supplementary material luo et al 2015 rughoonundun et al 2012 as an over produced chemical glycerol possesses high reduction degree so that more propionic acids can be produced to maintain the redox balance in pure culture glycerol acidification wang and yang 2013 however this potential advantage has not been verified in alkaline mixed culture acidification process research on the enhancement of vfa odd production in the pure culture acidification e g propionibacterium mainly focused on the optimization of metabolic flux wang and yang 2013 however as one of the important research points in mixed culture was acidification process the evolution of vfa odd production related function bodies should be of concern enrichment of a propionic acid producing bacteria propionibacterineae and reduction of a vfa odd consuming bacteria proteobacteria were both observed when alkyl polyglucose was added into the was acidification system which was considered to be the main reason for the reinforcement of vfa odd production under this condition luo et al 2015 more investigations at the microbial ecological level need to be conducted to further understand the mechanisms of vfa odd regulation in this study reaction ph fraction of added β cd and glycerol were selected as the regulators and response surface methodology rsm was used to perform the proposed oriented was acidification the reliability and effectiveness of the regulation strategy were further tested in semi continuous reactors the dynamics of microbial community along with the variation of the operating conditions and the roles of anaerobic microbial community in the vfa odd oriented acidification of was were investigated as well 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of the inoculum and feedstock pure was used as both the inoculum and feedstock was taken from a secondary sedimentation tank in a local waste water treatment plant employing a a o process with a sludge retention time srt of 15 days harbin china the characteristics of the was are described in table 1 chemical pure β cd aladdin china was used to enhance the was hydrolysis chemical pure glycerol xilong scientific china was used as the carbon addition of the feedstock 2 2 experiment set up and basic operation two kinds of anaerobic reactors were used in this research namely the batch reactor fig 1 a used for the rsm experiment with a working volume of 500 ml and the semi continuous reactor fig 1b with a working volume of 5 5 l both kinds of reactors were made from polymethyl methacrylate pmma reaction temperature was kept constant in mesophilic conditions 35 1 c and reaction ph was regulated with naoh 3 mol l by the auto controller according to the experiment design pure nitrogen was bubbled through the distributor after the feedstock was added the mixture was mechanically stirred at 550 rpm in both kinds of reactors 2 3 rsm and batch acidification assays reaction ph fraction of glycerol and β cd in the feedstock were selected as three variables and c n was used in this study to accurately measure the glycerol fraction a three variable five level central composite design ccd as shown in table 2 was developed to guide the experiment in this study design expert software v 8 05 usa this design consisted of six axial points coded as 1 68 eight fractional points coded as 1 and six replications of center points coded as 0 the vfa odd proportion and acidification degree of the sludge samples taken from the reactors at day 10 were set as the actual response factors two predictive polynominal quadratic models also the basis of oriented acidification strategy in this study were obtained according to the regression analysis of the software before each assay started the glycerol and β cd were mixed with was based on the given proportion quantified by c n and g gtss respectively in addition acidification assays using sole was sole glycerol was glycerol mixture and was starch mixture were conducted at ph 9 to evaluate synergistic effect of was and added carbon source initial c n was regulated to 20 in the acidification assays using was glycerol and was starch and the details of the inoculation and operation were the same with that of the rsm assays all the batch acidification assays were operated for 12 days in this research 2 4 semi continuous acidification and pha production test to test the reliability of the oriented acidification strategies two semi continuous reactors working volume of 5 5l for each were operated under three different conditions i e different combinations of ph c n and β cd proportion based on the optimal regulation strategy reactor i was operated under condition 1 ph 8 0 c n 16 β cd 0 1 g g tss throughout 40 days of operation reactor ii was operated under condition 2 ph 8 5 c n 12 β cd 0 05 g g tss for 20 days and then switched to condition 3 ph 9 0 c n 9 β cd 0 15 g g tss the details of the three conditions were also shown in the result section after 4l of was was inoculated each reactor was firstly operated without feeding for one week the feedstock was then pumped into the reactors after equal volume of mixed liquor was pumped out both reactors were fed four times per day of which srt was kept at 8 25 day the feedstock loading rate was kept at 2 36 0 09 gvss l day the acidification products collected under the three conditions were clarified by ceramic membrane and used as the substrate for mc pha production respectively the mcs were acclimated under the feast famine mode huang et al 2018 using clarified acidification liquid obtained from reactor i for two months operating details can be seen in supplementary information s1 fed batch pha accumulation assays were used to test the maximum intracellular pha content and final polymer composition batch reactors 500 ml were inoculated with mcs 200 ml collected from the acclimating reactor and fed with 200 ml of the substrate i e clarified fermentation liquid which respectively collected from the semi continuous reactors under different conditions the concentration of the fed substrate was approximately 5 8 g cod l each time when the substrate was exhausted indicated by a rapid increase in do concentration the aeration stopped and mc floc settled two hundred milliliter of supernatant was then removed after settling and the same volume of the substrate was added the mcs were fed five times in a whole fed batch assay 2 5 microbial community analysis sludge samples were taken from the semi continuous reactors along the operation and stored at 80 c before using the total genomic dna was extracted from the biomass samples using an e z n a bacterial dna kit omega usa 16s rrna gene were subjected to high throughput sequencing by shanghai realbio technology co ltd shanghai china using the illumina hiseq pe250 sequencing platform illumina inc ca usa the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna genes were amplified with primer 341f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 further data processing were the same as described in our previous publications huang et al 2018 otu table were generated after data sets rarefied to 40 000 reads per sample raw sequence data is available at ncbi bioproject prjna411763 2 6 parameter analysis elements of carbon c and nitrogen n of the was were determined by an elemental analyzer elementar vario el cube german vfa odd content was calculated as the sum of the contents of measured vfas with odd carbon atoms including propionic n valeric and iso valeric acid protein and saccharide were measured using lowry protein detection kit labaide china and phenol sulfate acid methods gerhardt et al 1994 respectively total suspended solid tss soluble chemical oxygen demand scod were obtained according to the standard methods of chinese sepac 2002 acidification degree was calculated by dividing the sum of the vfa molecules in mg cod l by scod of the terminal fermented liquid filtrated by 0 45 μm polyether sulfone filter the quantification of pha was performed using a gas chromatograph gc7890n agilent united states with a flame ionization detector fid as previously described wen et al 2012 quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime were obtained using α shannon and simpson index and β weighted unifrac distance diversity for each sample α diversity index was evaluated based on sequenced 40 000 clean reads the principal coordinate analysis pcoa was conducted based on the weighted unifrac distances of the biomass samples the heat map exhibiting relative abundances of otus was generated using microsoft excel v 2013 correlations between microbial community members and system function were calculated using redundancy analysis rda in the canoco 5 0 lepx and smilauer 2003 2 7 statistical analysis the system function related parameters during the stable phases of the semi continuous reactors were compared using one way anova test conducted in the ibm spss statistics v 20 p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant unless otherwise stated 3 results and discussion 3 1 typical acidification in a single acidification assay the temporal profiles of vfa soluble protein and saccharide in the liquid phase in a typical single was acidification assay 11days operation with reaction ph 8 c n 20 and β cd 0 1 g gtss are shown in fig 2 the acidification degree reached 30 53 2 45 at day 2 and did not increase significantly from day 3 to day 7 but increased sharply to 88 72 3 02 in day 9 and kept relatively steady afterwards this two stage variation was mainly attributed to the start up mode of acidification assays including both batch and semi continuous assays in this study as the was was used as both the inoculum and feedstock an enrichment period for acidogenic bacteria was need during this period although the release process of protein and saccharide within was flocs was enhanced by the alkaline condition and β cd addition yang et al 2012 yuan et al 2006 yu et al 2008 less vfas were produced due to the possible relative low population of acidogenic groups soluble saccharides rapidly increased to 200 10 56 mg l by day 2 and kept at a relative balanced state afterwards by contrast soluble protein showed an opposite trend between day 7 and day 8 it decreased from 413 76 15 25 mg l to 346 47 12 04 mg l and reached a new balanced state afterwards which suggests that soluble saccharides and protein in the liquid phase were in a dynamic balance between dissociation and uptake by the acidogenic bacteria during the acidification process compared to the two stage variation of the acidification degree vfa odd proportion sharply increased to 57 89 3 66 at day 4 and kept relatively steady afterwards showing that there was no clear correlation between the composition and the total yield of vfas 3 2 vfa odd based orientaed acidification strategy using rsm twenty batch acidification assays were conducted according the ccd plan of the rsm table 2 the fit summary of the software suggested that the quadratic model with a higher significance compared to other fitting models can be used as the appropriate one for both two responses vfa odd proportion and acidification degree the following two mathematical regressions using coded factors table 2 were generated r 1 vfa odd proportion 257 92 59 99a 384 62b 3 42c 25 76ab 0 81ac 0 11bc 4 05a2 417 54 b2 0 29 c2 r 2 acidification degree 734 84

from the analysis the two regression models showed high significance as the f tests was of very low probability values pmodel f r1 0 0001 pmodel f r2 0 0013 with high enough adequate precision 11 38 for r 1 and 9 97 for r 2 the regression models proved to be applicable good precision and reliability of the two models were indicated by their relatively low values of the coefficient of variation cv which was 9 35 for r 1 and 11 48 for r 2 respectively the actual values were distributed relatively near to the straight line in the predicted versus actual plots for r 1 and r 2 data not shown which further supported the reliability of the models the contour and 3d surface plots of rsm for response r 1 and r 2 are shown in fig 3 and fig s1 by holding one factor at zero level respectively 3 2 2 impacts of the three factors for vfa odd proportion the main effect of reaction ph a and glycerol fraction c the second order effect of reaction ph a2 β cd fraction b2 and glycerol fraction c2 and the two level interactions of reaction ph and glycerol fraction ac were considered as the significant model terms according to their low probability values 0 05 in the f tests of the anova analysis table s1 as can be seen in fig 3b and fig s1b a high percentage of vfa odd greater than 60 of the total vfas which is comparable to the value achieved using pure propionibacteria acidification chen et al 2013 can be obtained in the area with feed c n ranging from 15 to 20 and ph ranging from 8 0 to 9 5 when β cd fraction was held at zero level 0 2 g gtss it can be observed that under alkaline condition increasing reaction ph led to the decrease of vfa odd proportion overall the negative effect of high reaction ph on propionic acid production has been reported in literature using both the pure culture chen et al 2013 and mixed culture was acidification assays feng et al 2009 in the rsm assays in this research the main component of the vfa odd mixtures was also propionic acid generally exceeding 90 of the vfa odd concrete data not shown as an important factor in the conversion step of pyruvate to propionic acid vitamin b12 generally cannot exist in the strong alkaline conditions ma et al 2017 savvi et al 2008 which should be closely associated to the inhibition of high reaction ph on the propionic accumulation the relative impact weight of glycerol fraction 9 88 was higher than that of reaction ph 5 99 according to the corresponding f values obtained from the anova analysis which reveals that glycerol fraction was a more important factor affecting the vfa odd production the vfa odd proportion was reported to decrease with c n increasing from 7 to 20 when perennial ryegrass was used as the additive jia et al 2013b whereas in this research a converse relationship was obtained when c n ranged from 7 to 18 only when c n increased higher than 18 the vfa odd proportion decreased jia et al 2013b believed that substrate with a higher c n e g 20 was considered to be more balanced for microbes and thus can enhance the activity of acidification related enzymes however higher fraction of vfa even vfa with even carbon atoms mainly acetic and butyric acid was obtained in the finial products in their research which implied that activities of enzymes associated with vfa odd production e g oxaloacetate transcarboxylase for propionic acid were not preferentially enhanced compared to those associated with vfa even production the different results in vfa odd proportions with the higher c n between this study and jia et al 2013b work were probably caused by the nature of the adding carbon source perennial ryegrass versus glycerol which will be further discussed in a later section for the acidification degree the main effect of reaction ph a the second order effect of reaction ph a2 and β cd addition b2 and the two level interactions of reaction ph and glycerol fraction ac were considered as the significant model terms according to their low probability values 0 05 in the f tests as can be seen in fig 3e and fig s1e the high acidification degree larger than 90 can be obtained in the area with reaction ph ranging from 7 5 to 8 5 and c n ranging from 15 to 20 when β cd addition was held at zero level 0 2 g gtss reaction ph had the maximum impact weight which was quantified by the maximum coefficient value 15 30 compared to other factors sludge matrix will be fully decomposed at high ph condition especially within ph 9 to 10 thus an effective contact between extracellular organic matters and enzymes was ensured and an enhanced vfa accumulation was resulted yu et al 2008 however as shown in fig 3d e and fig s1d e the acidification degree decreased remarkably when reaction ph ranged from 9 to 10 in this research the varied feedstock composition caused by the glycerol addition might be responsible for the discrepant response of the acidification degree to reaction ph compared to the was acidification process mainly limited by sludge matrix decomposition yu et al 2008 the acidification of was and glycerol will depend more on the enzymatic process and the activities of these biotic reactions could be inhibited by the high reaction ph feng et al 2009 luo et al 2015 ma et al 2017 alkaline ph and β cd addition have been reported to have similar function in making the organic matters more soluble and bioavailable yuan et al 2006 yang et al 2012 however the isolated was acidification assays at ph 9 0 conducted previously in our research showed that compared to the control assay without β cd addition the acidification degree of assays with β cd of 0 2 g gtss and 0 3 g gtss increased by 22 48 and 32 31 respectively fig s2 indicating that β cd could further enhanced the was hydrolysis process under alkaline ph condition 3 2 3 the synergistic effect of was and glycerol on the vfa odd production in order to reveal the role of glycerol addition in the enhancement of the vfa odd production vfa production from the sole was sole glycerol with 10 mass percent of was as inoculum and was glycerol mixture were compared fig 4 a the vfa odd proportions of 28 5 2 4 and 36 2 3 6 were obtained in the acidification of sole was and sole glycerol respectively both below that in the acidification of was glycerol mixture 61 8 2 2 this indicated that the enhancement of the vfa odd production was caused by the synergistic effect of was and glycerol the addition of carbon rich substrate in the low c n was have been reported to be an effective way to enhance the release of hydrolysis related enzymes and then facilitated the accumulation of vfas or relative precursors substrate chen et al 2013 yu et al 2008 in this study such enhancement was also verified as can be seen in fig 4b the vfa generated fromwas and glycerol c n 20 at ph 9 was 573 7 3 7 mgcod gvss which was much higher than those with sole was and sole glycerol 230 7 6 4 and 243 7 3 4 mgcod gvss respectively however the synergistic enhancement has never been associated with vfa odd production in the mixed culture acidification before two aspects i e the c n ratio and the added carbon type need to be considered when further evaluating the effect of glycerol addition to distinguish the effect in such two aspects another acidification assay under the same feed c n but using starch as the added carbon was conducted the vfa odd proportion of was glycerol mixture was obviously higher than that of the was starch mixture 49 3 2 fig 4a although their vfa yield was similar fig 4b this proved that was acidification with glycerol addition showed preference in vfa odd accumulation therefore the carbon type further affected vfa odd production on the basis of the effect of balanced feed c n 3 2 4 optimization the optimization criteria set for the oriented acidification was originated from the consideration that the fermented product is going to be effectively utilized in the downstream pha production process the maximum vfa odd proportion is not the only goal in the oriented acidification since the vfa odd proportion in the fermented product should be flexibly regulated to achieve the maximization of the process window of the p 3hb co 3hv which is determined by the hb hv ratio therefore both vfa odd proportion and acidification degree should be considered in oriented acidification process the optimization strategy was generated from the overlapped plots obtained from varying reaction ph and c n while changing β cd addition ratio discontinuously on the contours of response surfaces of r 1 and r 2 see details in fig 5 the highlighted areas of the overlapped plots were considered as the satisfaction zone by defining the desired vfa odd proportion higher than 40 and acidification degree higher than 60 3 3 semi continuous acidification and pha production semi continuous anaerobic reactors were operated to test the feasibility effectiveness and accuracy of the oriented acidification strategies operating condition 1 figs 5a 2 fig 5b and 3 fig 5c with gradient predicted vfa odd proportions were selected from the overlapped plots within the optimization criteria as can be seen in fig 6 a and b for all the three conditions steady state of both vfa odd proportion and acidification degree were achieved after an adaptive phase 5 8 days indicating the feasibility of the oriented strategies vfa odd proportion of 59 51 1 13 46 57 1 90 and 36 84 0 56 were obtained under condition 1 2 and 3 respectively the significant gradient in vfa odd proportion values with significant differences p 0 0001 in anova test as shown in fig s3a verified the effectiveness of the oriented acidification strategy in vfa composition regulation on the contrary the acidification degree showed no significant difference as shown in fig s3b the average acidification degree was 83 23 0 72 65 14 1 46 and 69 04 1 14 under condition1 2 and 3 respectively the different sensitivity of these two parameters in response to the variation of the operating conditions just met the criteria set for the oriented acidification i e enough acidification degree was ensured when vfa odd proportion was regulated the maximum vfa odd proportion of 59 51 1 13 and acidification degree of 83 23 0 72 were achieved simultaneously under condition 1 and propionic acid was the dominant component in the vfa mixtures fig 6c it is worth noting that the measured vfa odd proportion and acidification degree in all the three systems were lower than the predicated values obtained from the regression models fig 6a and b the deviations of the acidification degree were larger than those of vfa odd proportion under all the three conditions indicating that acidification degree was more sensitive to a decreased srt in the semi continuous reactors 8 25 days compared to that in the rsm assays 10 days moreover the deviation of the acidification degree under condition 3 the lowest c n was larger than that under condition 1 and 2 which indicated that the total vfa production might be more sensitive to the srt under low c n where sludge matrix decomposition was the rate limiting step the acidification liquid obtained from the reactors under the three conditions was collected and used for pha production by mixed cultures as can be seen in table 3 for all the three pha accumulation assays the final pha content exceeded 55 of cell dry weight the monomer hv proportion in the polymer can be regulated from 42 3 3 3 to 72 4 5 2 which showed high correlations with the vfa odd fraction in the acidification product to give a perspective of the practical potential of the oriented acidification strategies condition 1 hv proportion of 72 4 5 2 was used as an illustration the calculation showed that 2 13 kg pure glycerol and 0 21 kg β cd were required for one kg produced pha based on the pha conversion rate in the batch pha production assay of 0 81 gcod pha gcod s and the vfa yield in the was acidification assay of 0 55 gcod gtss glycerol is currently an over produced chemical and crude glycerol a by product in the biodiesel production process can be used instead to further decrease the costs of external carbon addition 3 4 microbial community dynamics during the oriented acidification 3 4 1 frequent and dominant species twelve samples were taken from the semi continuous reactors under steady state six of which were from condition 1 three were from condition 2 and three were from condition 3 the otus with 97 similarity were mainly classified into 7 phyla proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria candidatus saccharibacteria acidobacteria and euryarchaeota phylum proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes are frequently observed in bio waste anaerobic acidification reactors for their ability to degrade a wide range of substances such as protein cellulose and pectin chouari et al 2005 zitomer et al 2016 in this study the frequent species in the microbial community were denoted by the otus with the relative abundance exceeding 1 5 in at least 2 samples twenty nine frequent otus were screened and classified as shown in fig 7 a which are mainly from classes of bacteroidetes actinobacteria alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria bacilli clostridia and methanobacteria based on the average relative abundance otu 6 genus trichococcus otu 13 phylum bacteroidetes and otu 16 genus dechloromonas dominated under condition 1 otu 6 and otu 4 genus methanobrevibacter dominated under condition 2 and otu 6 otu 11 genus clostridium xivb and otu 8 family ruminococcaceae were the dominant species under condition 3 the well known biogas producer phylum euryarchaeota was also identified in the was acidification reactors otu 4 genus methanobrevibacter identified as a hydrogen utilizing methane producer and also an indirect vfa consumer was observed in high relative abundance 18 74 under conditions 2 strains isolated from this genus were found to be able to exist in anaerobic system with short hrt maspolim et al 2015 and alkaline ph e g 8 3 9 3 boone et al 1986 in the acidification system in this research three factors might inhibit the function of methane producer 1 alkaline condition reaction ph higher than 9 0 condition 3 could significantly inhibit the metabolic activity of methane producers yuan et al 2006 2 β cd which was shown to adversely affect the methane production yang et al 2012 3 propionate accumulation methane producers were considered to be sensitive to the toxicity of the propionate barredo and evison 1991 compared to condition 1 and 3 operating condition 2 had the lowest β cd concentration 0 05 g g tss relative lower reaction ph 8 5 and propionate concentration 22 mmol l and the combination of these conditions would create a suitable niche for the bacteria belonging to genus methanobrevibacter the comparatively lower predicted acidification degree under condition 2 can be attributed to the higher relative abundance of such indirect vfa consumers with the existence of hydrogen producing bacteria e g bacteria in genus petrimonas sun et al 2015 the higher sensitivity to short srt pulled down the observed acidification degree under condition 3 which became close to the value under condition 2 3 4 2 structure evolution the overall difference of the microbial community structure under the three operating conditions is exhibited via comparing α and β diversity of the microbial community for α diversity indicated by shannon and simpson indexes the species richness and community evenness under condition 1 and 3 were similar while the species richness and community evenness under condition 2 was apparently lower than those under condition 1 and 3 as shown in fig 7b otu 4 genus methanobrevibacter and otu 6 genus dechloromonas together accounted for 36 27 of the detected sequences which was far greater than the sum of relative abundances of the dominant species under condition 1 16 2 and 3 20 2 indicating the significant dominance of the top species under condition 2 for β diversity emphasizing the community difference among samples the weighted unifrac distances between any two of these samples were calculated according to both phylogenetic relationship and relative abundance of taxa in each sample the pcoa analysis was then conducted based on the matrix of the weighted pair wise unifrac distances between samples as can be seen in fig 7c the samples can be apparently clustered into three groups corresponding to the operating conditions and the three groups located in different quadrants in the pcoa plot indicating that the inter group difference was more obvious than the intra group difference therefore it can be concluded that the operating conditions significantly influenced the microbial community structure both at the genotypic and the taxonomic abundance level 3 4 3 function groups in the semi continuous reactor three kinds of correlations including species species vfa vfa and vfa species were evaluated using rda by projecting one factor s arrowheads onto the imaginary line running in the direction of another factor s arrows based on the clustering of the arrows of the frequent species on the rda map functional groups that synchronously varied and closely related to the variations of the specific vfa in the acidification process can be distinguished as can be seen in fig 8 a totally 13 frequent species all in the third quadrant and colored by orange can be incorporated into the microbial function group related to propionic acid production denoted by gprop in this study along with the operating condition from 1 to 3 the proportion of propionic acid decreased from 54 40 2 67 to 33 99 1 96 while the proportion of acetic butyric and valeric acid showed opposite variation trends the members of function groups related to acetic blue color butyric and valeric acids grey color production were much less compared to those related to propionic acid production in this study four subgroups in the gprop can be partitioned based on the trophic levels in the acidification process producer cooperator competitor and consumer fig 8b obligate propionic acid producer such as genus propionibacterium chen et al 2013 was not observed in the acidification system as can be seen in table 4 otu 21 belonging to genus proteinborus was defined as producers for it has demonstrated the ability to produce propionic acid using amino acid as the substrate otu 45 belonging to genus petrimonas and otu 78 belonging to order clostridiales were another two producers as they have proved to be capable of producing propionic acid using lactate as the substrate otu 20 42 belonging to the genus lactococcus and otu 55 belonging to genus bacteroides can be defined as cooperators since their end metabolites such as lactate and succinate can be further taken up by the propionic producers otu 61 belonging to genus tissierella was defined as a competitor because it would utilize amino acid as the substrate to solely produce acetate and no reference has reported the propionic acid production in the fermentation tests using strains of genus tissierella this competitor stayed at the same trophic level below the cooperators and shared similar resources lactate and amino acid with the propionic acid producers but showed synchronous instead of inverse relationships with them the possible close substrate affinity and growth kinetic might result in the co occurrence pattern under competition volterra 1926 otu 16 belonging to genus dechloromonas and otu 54 belonging to genus novosphingobium were defined as consumers in the gprop as they have demonstrated the ability of consuming the propionate to reduce the nitrite the dependency of the bacteria in gprop on the glycerol proportion in the feedstock as quantified by c n shown in fig 8c could explain the dominant impact of c n on the vfa odd production although obligate propionic acid producer like propionibacterium which has a complete metabolic pathway of propionic acid production was not detected in the semi continuous acidification systems it was highly possible that bacteria within the gprop at different trophic levels cooperators and producers as shown in fig 8b connected their metabolic pathways to form a complete metabolic chain from glycerol amino acid and carbohydrate to propionic acid in the gprop the acidifying bacteria using amino acid and saccharide e g otu 21 would synchronously varied with the variation of bacteria using glycerol e g otu 20 herewith it can be speculated that this ecological synergism contributed to the synergistic enhancement of was and glycerol on the vfa odd production described in section 3 2 3 4 conclusion in this study the strategy of oriented was acidification based on rsm was demonstrated to be able to enhance and effectively regulate the vfa odd proportion while keeping a high acidification degree in the finial fermentation products by changing the reaction ph fraction of added β cd and glycerol the glycerol addition ratio was found to be the predominant impact factor in regulating the vfa odd proportion according to the anova test and the carbon type further affected vfa odd production on the basis of the effect of balanced feed c n the significant succession of microbial community in the semi continuous acidification system should be the internal cause of the variation of vfa composition the propionic acid production related microbial function group was partitioned into producers cooperators competitors and consumers and the producers and cooperators within the gprop would jointly support the function of propionic accumulation in the oriented acidification process
