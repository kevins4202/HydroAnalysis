9555,irrigation plays an important role in crop yield production in arid and semi arid regions however irrigation effects have not been well addressed in the application of crop models at a regional scale due to limited data availability which constrains the reliability and accuracy of simulation results assimilating remote sensing information into crop models can provide a viable approach to reduce associated uncertainties in this study regional irrigation data for winter wheat triticum aestivum l grown on the loess plateau was used to calibrate and validate the chinaagrosys china agricultural system crop model at site and regional scales remote sensing data was then assimilated into the chinaagrosys crop model under four assimilation schemes two remotely sensed assimilation state variables i e lai and ndvi and two assimilation algorithms i e pso partical swarm optimization and sce ua shuffled complex evolution were considered during the winter wheat growing season on the loess plateau 30 6 of the wheat production area was irrigated once 6 7 was irrigated two times 3 7 was irrigated three times and the remaining wheat area was rainfed the r2 values between maturity date lai and yield simulated by the chinaagrosys crop model and observations at 21 agrometeorological stations on the loess plateau were greater than 0 73 0 44 and 0 60 respectively during 2010 2015 the accuracy and spatial heterogeneity of winter wheat yield estimation were effectively improved by assimilating remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model based on regional irrigation data under the four assimilation schemes the combination of pso ndvi produced the highest accuracy for yield estimation in hongtong county 92 8 followed by sce ua ndvi 92 0 our results demonstrated the importance of accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of water availability when applying a crop model in arid and semi arid regions additionally our analysis regarding different assimilation state variables and algorithms indicated that both simulation accuracy and calculation efficiency should be considered when assimilating remote sensing data into a crop model for simulating crop growth at regional scales keywords data assimilation remote sensing data chinaagrosys crop model regional irrigation winter wheat 1 introduction crop models can simulate photosynthesis respiration transpiration and dry matter distribution during periods of crop growth and yield production over recent decades crop models have been widely used to investigate climate change impacts on crop yield bocchiola et al 2013 to schedule farmland irrigation chimonyo et al 2016 and to analyze effects of drought stress on growth crop and yield yin et al 2014 however most crop models were originally developed for plot field scale studies and their regional application has been constrained by the availability of input parameters regarding meteorology soil characteristics agricultural management etc lv et al 2016 satellite remote sensing has rapidly developed and plays an important role in quantifying crop planted area growth monitoring yield forecasting and drought assessment at regional scales sakamoto et al 2013 park et al 2016 chen et al 2018 combining satellite remote sensing data with crop models can result in continuous spatiotemporal modeling of crop growth processes jin et al 2018b huang et al 2019 and can provide strong support for dynamic monitoring of crop growth and yield production at regional scales data assimilation methods that combine the advantages of crop modeling and remote sensing data have been widely developed in recent years ines et al 2013 hu et al 2019 this process is implemented by continuously integrating a variety of observation data and constantly adjusting the trajectory of simulations within the dynamic framework of the crop model huang et al 2015a the variables assimilated into a crop model may include leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi evapotranspiration et soil moisture enhanced vegetation index evi etc de wit and van diepen 2007 curnel et al 2011 ma et al 2013 huang et al 2015b guo et al 2019 previous studies have shown that crop model simulation results were improved by assimilating biophysical variables obtained from remote sensing data kang and özdoğan 2019 lei et al 2020 in contrast the process of upscaling irrigation data to regional scale requires further study irrigation activities are influenced by many factors including water availability irrigation water price crop growth conditions farmers willingness to irrigate a crop etc the timing and amount of irrigation events on farmland have a great amount of uncertainty thereby increasing the difficulties in obtaining irrigation data at a regional scale currently studies regarding regional irrigation data are mainly focused on classifying crop areas as either irrigated or rainfed pervez et al 2014 deines et al 2019 xie et al 2019 however realistically estimating regional crop growth requires information regarding irrigation timing and amount which currently cannot be derived from existing irrigation data sets agricultural production on the loess plateau in china is largely constrained by water availability irrigation plays a critical role in ensuring crop productivity in dry years irrigated wheat yield can be 2 3 times greater than rainfed wheat yield jin et al 2016b the ability of a crop model to accurately simulate yield production and water consumption in this region is compromised by the lack of accurate regional irrigation data usually a crop in an entire study area is assumed to be rainfed or is assumed to use a standard irrigation scenario zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 adhikari et al 2016 different water availability for crops has been considered in some studies but the spatial resolution has been coarse and the irrigated and rainfed conditions were the same for different crops mo et al 2005 in general it is difficult to get reliable irrigation data at a regional scale and therefore the spatial heterogeneity in irrigation data is given less attention when applying a crop model at a regional scale furthermore the influence of spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data on simulation results is seldom considered for the subsequent assimilation of remote sensing data into a crop model de et al 2012 huang et al 2015b jin et al 2016a gilardelli et al 2019 ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data may lead to some uncertainties for the simulation results of crop models in arid and semi arid regions in this study wheat production areas on the loess plateau were classified as either irrigated and rainfed irrigation times were then assumed based on the local irrigation practices and the estimated wheat yield from a light use efficiency model taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data on the loess plateau can improve the accuracy and reliability of yield estimation when assimilating remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys china agricultural system crop model the major scientific objectives of this study were to 1 extract regional irrigation data for winter wheat production on the loess plateau 2 estimate winter wheat lai at 250 m spatial resolution using the prosail radiation transfer model 3 evaluate the performance of chinaagrosys on the loess plateau 4 couple chinaagrosys with the prosail radiation transfer model and build schemes for assimilating remote sensing data based on spatial irrigation data into chinaagrosys 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau is located between 32 41 n and 103 114 e with an area of 648 700 km2 including 341 counties in shanxi shaanxi ningxia henan gansu inner mongolia and qinghai provinces autonomous regions the southeast loess plateau is lower than the northwest and the elevation varies from 500 m to about 3000 m the loess plateau is under the influence of a continental monsoon climate and is a transition zone changing from semi humid to semi arid climate precipitation increases from the northwest 150 250 mm to the southeast above 600 mm and shows large inter annual variation precipitation in wet years can be 2 5 times greater than precipitation in dry years in this study we selected 158 counties that planted winter wheat in the central and southern loess plateau which accounted for 46 3 of the total counties fig 1 the average winter wheat yields in gansu ningxia shaanxi shanxi and henan provinces were 2426 2206 4022 3031 and 4382 kg ha 1 in 2011 respectively winter wheat is usually planted in october and harvested in june of the following year precipitation during the winter wheat growing season is far less than the amount needed to meet the demand for crop growth and yield production irrigation plays an important role in producing high and stable winter wheat yield 2 2 data 2 2 1 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study included mod13q1 ndvi data 16 day 250 m resolution and mod15a2 lai data 8 day 1000 m resolution during the years 2010 2015 two scenes were needed for the modis data to cover the entire loess plateau path row h26v05 and h27v05 after applying re projection mosaic and merging processing to the modis data 1884 3815 pixels in the study area were obtained using the vector shapefile of the loess plateau boundary 2 2 2 meteorological soil and ground observation data meteorological data for the 158 counties on the loess plateau were obtained for the period of 2010 2015 including daily mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine hours precipitation and wind speed a multivariate linear regression model that considered geographic effects longitude latitude elevation slope and aspect was used to interpolate meteorological data elements at a spatial resolution of 250 m to match the remote sensing data jin et al 2018a the spatially explicit soil properties obtained from dai et al 2013 included soil texture saturated water content wilting coefficient and field water holding capacity the ground observation data for winter wheat during 2012 2014 were collected from the water saving agricultural experiment station of northwest a f university at yangling fig 1 the winter wheat cultivar was xiaoyan22 the data for the period of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 were used to calibrate and validate respectively the chinaagrosys crop model there were a total of 21 winter wheat agrometeorological stations across the loess plateau the observation data included planting date maturity date lai yield etc which were used to evaluate the applicability of chinaagrosys the lai data at jointing and heading stages for six agrometeorological stations in shanxi province were used to validate lai values that the look up table described later generated and that chinaagrosys simulated 2 3 chinaagrosys crop model and parameter sensitivity analysis chinaagrosys is a comprehensive soil vegetation atmosphere model in which photosynthesis transpiration and stomatal conductance models were extended from leaf to canopy scale by integrating the leaf water potential dynamic model with the hydrothermal transfer and photosynthetic models in spac soil plant atmosphere continuum chinaagrosys considers the crop growth and hydrothermal transfer process and consists of three sub modules i e soil crop growth and micro meteorology details regarding chinaagrosys can be found in wang et al 2007 the major parameters in chinaagrosys affecting physiological processes controlling crop growth and development include the developmental rate parameters c0 c1 nondimensional quantity lai parameters a0 a1 a2 a3 nondimensional quantity crop specific parameters alpha0 initial quantum efficiency v0 max photosynthesis rate µmol m 2 s 1 and yield parameters b0 b1 b2 nondimensional quantity the most sensitive parameters with respect to crop development and yield production were selected based on an analysis of the influence of the interrelationships between parameters from simulation results this process was helpful in selecting the optimal values of parameters for assimilating remote sensing data into chinaagrosys thereby improving the efficiency of the optimizing algorithm and reducing the computational requirements the global sensitivity analysis of the 11 parameters in chinaagrosys was implemented using the efast extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test method based on the observed lai and yield data at the yangling experimental station from 2012 to 2013 the framework of the sensitivity calculation was constructed using the sensitivity package written in the r program http www r project org and the executable file and parameters file in chinaagrosys were called to calculate the sensitivity for the 11 parameters in the efast method the number of calculations for a single process was n p where n is the number of samples and p is the number of parameters 2 4 classification of irrigated and rainfed wheat yield estimation and irrigation criteria the winter wheat planted area on the loess plateau was extracted based on the variation of the ndvi time series jin et al 2016b yield was estimated using a light use efficiency model jin et al 2018a the timing and amount of irrigation for winter wheat was estimated based on the classification results and the estimated winter wheat yield given that crop growth and yield production in the study areas are largely determined by water availability specifically the irrigation amount was set as 0 mm for rainfed wheat three irrigation levels were used for irrigated wheat irrigated once when yield 4500 kg ha 1 april 2011 irrigated twice when 6000 kg ha yield 4500 kg ha 1 december 2010 and 1 april 2011 and irrigated three times when yield 6000 kg ha 1 december 2010 1 april 2011 and 15 may 2011 the irrigation amount was 50 mm for each irrigation event according to the typical agricultural production practices on the loess plateau 2 5 prosail radiation transfer model and lai inversion 2 5 1 prosail radiation transfer model the prosail radiation transfer model consists of two sub modules i e the prospect model and the sail model the prospect model simulates hemisphere directional reflectance and transmittance at leaf scale in the wavelength range 400 2500 nm then leaf reflectance and transmittance are used to drive the sail model to simulate canopy reflectance the prosail 5b radiation transfer model used in this study was downloaded from http teledetection ipgp jussieu fr prosail details of the prosail 5b model can be found in jacquemoud et al 2009 2 5 2 lai inversion leaf area index is an important input variable used in many land surface models and has been widely used in crop growth monitoring and yield predication sakamoto et al 2013 when assimilating remote sensing data into a crop model at a regional scale results are mainly influenced by the accuracy of retrieved lai generally there are two major ways to retrieve lai using satellite remote sensing data i e empirical semi empirical model inversion and physical model inversion pasolli et al 2015 at present the main data sources used to retrieve the lai product at large scales are modis glass and other satellite remote sensing data at medium spatial resolutions the temporal and spatial resolution of these lai products are 8 days to 1 month and 1 10 km respectively the modis lai product is not crop specific and the lai values of farmland are lower than ground observations duveiller et al 2013 moreover image resolution is too coarse to be used on the loess plateau due to the highly fragmented farmland in this region therefore it is difficult to directly assimilate the 1 km modis lai product into a crop model which may reduce the spatial heterogeneity in the simulation results in this study lai at 250 m spatial resolution was retrieved for the loess plateau based on an ndvi lai look up table derived from the prosail radiation transfer model fig 2 2 5 3 hyperspectral reflectance data of winter wheat hyperspectral reflectance data for the winter wheat canopy were measured with the analytical spectral devices asd field spec pro fr 350 2500 nm spectroradiometer instrument calibration was performed using a standard reference board before and after each measurement of the reflectance spectrum measurements were made between 10 00 and 15 00 when the sky was cloudless and wind speed was low the angle of the spectroradiometer was set as 25º with a height of 1 3 m each winter wheat sample area was measured 10 times the spectroradiometer data were then used to validate the simulation results of the prosail radiation transfer model 2 5 4 conversion between hyperspectral reflectance data and multispectral reflectance data the observed and simulated winter wheat canopy reflectance ranges were 350 2500 nm and 400 2500 nm respectively the modis image was comprised of multispectral reflectance data the modis image data were associated with the hyperspectral data using the spectral response function the wide band reflectance was estimated as follows steven et al 2003 1 ρ i λ r λ φ λ d λ i λ φ λ d λ where ρ is the reflectance of the corresponding band of the satellite sensor i is the ground measured incident solar radiation r is the vegetation canopy reflectance λ is the wavelength φ is the spectral response function of the corresponding satellite sensor band including blue green red near infrared shortwave infrared bands etc the spectral response function in the spectral library was linearly interpolated to match the spectral resolution of the observed and simulated canopy reflectance 2 5 5 lai estimation using the look up table inversion method one modis pixel at 1 km spatial resolution would contain 16 pixels at 250 m spatial resolution if the original modis lai data were directly used then all 16 pixels would have the same value doing so would greatly reduce the spatial heterogeneity in the resulting data simulated by the crop model therefore it was necessary to invert winter wheat lai at 250 m spatial resolution before assimilating remote sensing data into the crop model on the loess plateau the look up table is a relatively simple method to invert lai based on the radiation transfer model the method can produce a global optimum solution and avoid the shortcoming of the neural network that easily obtains the local optimal solution additionally the computation complexity and abnormality are lower than seen for numerical optimization methods during the lai inversion a look up table containing the lai values generated by the prosail radiation transfer model and the corresponding ndvi estimated using canopy reflectance was established based on the forward radiation transfer model 2 6 pso and sce ua optimization algorithms and objective functions particle swarm optimization pso is an intelligent algorithm used to simulate bird clustering and foraging that was developed at the end of the twentieth century kennedy and eberhart 1995 details regarding the pso algorithm can be found in li et al 2015 the global optimization algorithm of sce ua shuffle complex evolution method has been widely used in parameter calibration for hydrological watershed models duan et al 1994 the continuous data assimilation algorithms of pso and sce ua were used in this study by continuously adjusting the parameters of the model the objective function reached the minimum value when the model simulations of lai or ndvi agreed best with the observations the objective function f min was calculated as 2 f min i 1 n x model i x obs i x obs i 2 n where a smaller value of f min means a more accurate simulation result for the model in the equation i 1 2 3 n n is the number of observations and x model i and x obs i are the i th model simulation result and observation respectively 2 7 assimilation of remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys included the three major parts of 1 crop model 2 observation data and 3 assimilation algorithm the crop model supplied the dynamic framework and simulated the crop growth processes by constantly updating the state variables the observation data included remote sensing data and ground observation data etc determining the best match between the model simulation values and observation data was realized using the data assimilation algorithm there are two ways to couple the crop model with remote sensing data at spatiotemporal scale table 1 1 lai as the assimilation state variable fig 3 the difference between lai values that chinaagrorys simulates and the inverted remote sensing data is reduced by continuously adjusting the parameters of the crop model using the optimization algorithm the optimal parameters are obtained when the objective function reaches its minimum value and then crop yield is estimated based on these parameters 2 ndvi as the assimilation state variable fig 3 chinaagrosys and the prosail radiation transfer model are coupled the lai estimated by chinaagrosys is input to the prosail radiation transfer model and ndvi is calculated based on the simulated canopy reflectance the difference between ndvi that the coupled model generates and that remote sensing data estimates is reduced by continuously adjusting the parameters of the crop model using the optimization algorithm the optimal parameters are obtained when the objective function reaches its minimum value and then crop yield is estimated based on these parameters the assimilation framework used four modules 1 the main module whose function was to call the crop model radiation transfer model and submodule for the objective function 2 the settings for the crop model parameters reading the simulation result and calling the radiation transfer model module 3 the radiation transfer model module and 4 the objective function module when running the coupled data assimilation scheme data for latitude longitude altitude planting date irrigation data soil property parameters inverted lai and meteorological parameters for wheat pixels were written into the corresponding site and control files then the crop model and radiation transfer model were continuously called using the optimization algorithm during this process the simulated lai or ndvi was compared with the corresponding state variable to obtain the optimal combination of parameters fig 4 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of irrigation times for winter wheat on the loess plateau irrigated and rainfed wheat areas on the loess plateau were classified according to water availability rainfed wheat accounted for 60 of the winter wheat area planted on the loess plateau and the rest was irrigated wheat irrigation times were different throughout the irrigated wheat area fig 5 the proportion of the wheat area irrigated one two and three times on the loess plateau was 30 6 6 7 and 2 7 respectively hence water availability for winter wheat on the loess plateau exhibited great spatial heterogeneity the difference in water availability for winter wheat on the loess plateau should be taken into account when applying a crop model at a regional scale in order to reduce the uncertainty in simulation results that may be induced by the uncertain regional irrigation data 3 2 applicability assessment of the chinaagrosys crop model on the loess plateau 3 2 1 parameter sensitivity analysis for chinaagrosys the results of the global sensitivity analysis of parameters for chinaagrosys showed that the five lai parameters with the greatest first order sensitivity index values were c1 b2 c0 b0 and b1 with sensitivity values of 30 4 23 9 21 7 11 6 and 10 5 respectively the five lai parameters with the greatest global sensitivity index values were c1 b2 c0 b1 and b0 with sensitivity values of 39 1 35 2 25 7 23 7 and 22 7 respectively the five yield parameters with the greatest first order sensitivity index values were b2 c1 c0 a0 and b0 with sensitivity values of 19 6 13 7 13 3 10 2 and 9 7 respectively and the five yield parameters with the greatest global sensitivity index values were b2 a0 c1 c0 and a2 with sensitivity values of 31 9 23 7 23 5 22 9 and 22 6 respectively fig 6 based on the above results the parameters of c0 c1 and b2 were selected for optimization during the following assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys the initial minimum and maximum values of the optimized parameters are shown in table 2 parameter variation in chinaagrosys induced corresponding changes in maturity date lai biomass and yield for winter wheat lai was used as an example to demonstrate the influence of the variation of c0 c1 and b2 fig 7 the variation of lai with changing c0 and c1 were generally similar as lai increased with the increasing c0 and c1 before the heading stage and vice versa after the heading stage moreover the maximum lai value and the period of occurrence were also influenced by c0 and c1 the b2 parameter mainly affected the maximum value of lai before and after the heading period lai tended to decrease as b2 increased 3 2 2 chinaagrosys crop model evaluation at site and regional scales on the loess plateau the chinaagrosys crop model was calibrated using the observations at the yangling experimental station for the period 2012 2013 simulated lai and cumulative biomass were slightly lower at the early and late winter wheat growth stages overall the variations of simulated lai over time were consistent with observations fig 8 simulations with the chinaagrosys crop model were evaluated against observations at 21 winter wheat agrometeorological stations across the loess plateau for the period 2010 2015 these regional observations included maturity date lai at jointing and heading stages and yield production chinaagrosys simulated values comparable with observations for the study region the r2 values between simulated and observed maturity dates were greater than 0 73 and r2 values for lai and yield were greater than 0 44 and 0 60 respectively fig 9 3 3 inversion of lai at 250 m spatial resolution for winter wheat on the loess plateau 3 3 1 calibration and validation of the prosail radiation transfer model parameter ranges for the prosail radiation transfer model were determined on the basis of a priori knowledge of field measurements and relevant literature pasolli et al 2015 casas et al 2014 the parameter settings were determined based on the sensitivity analysis table 3 the parameter sensitivities of the model simulated results were evaluated by continuously changing one of the parameters in the prosail radiation transfer model our results fig 10 showed that 1 the sensitive band for the chlorophyll parameter cab was 550 nm and reflectance increased with increasing cab 2 reflectance increased with increasing hot spot coefficient hspot most noticeably in the near infrared band 3 reflectance decreased with increasing average leaf inclination lidfa most noticeably in the near infrared band 4 reflectance increased with increasing view zenith angle tto most noticeably in the near infrared band 5 reflectance decreased with increasing solar zenith angle tts most noticeably in the near infrared band based on the asd observed canopy reflectance of winter wheat the sensitive parameters for the prosail radiation transfer model were optimized using the sce ua algorithm simulated canopy reflectance agreed well with observations fig 11 differences between the simulated results and observations were larger in the near infrared band than in the visible band overall the optimized prosail radiation transfer model provided useful data to establish the lai look up table 3 3 2 validation of inverted lai on the loess plateau inverted lai from the look up table and modis lai were evaluated using the ground observed lai at winter wheat jointing and heading stages at six winter wheat agrometeorological stations in shanxi province from 2010 to 2015 the r2 between look up table lai and ground observed lai was greater than 0 54 indicating a good relationship fig 12 the modis pixels at 1 km spatial resolution were heavily influenced by the effect of mixed pixels and resulted in lower lai values for modis than for the look up table inverted lai and ground observed lai 3 4 assimilation of remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model 3 4 1 site level data model assimilation winter wheat growth and development during the 2013 2014 growing season were evaluated using the four schemes to assimilate remote sensing data into chinaagrosys the greatest maximum lai value fig 13 was seen for lai obtained with ndvi as the assimilation state variable followed by the look up table lai as the assimilation state variable the chinaagrosys crop model simulation without assimilation and modis lai as the assimilation state variable lowest maximum lai the corresponding r2 values between the simulated lai under the four assimilation schemes and observed lai were 0 73 0 79 0 75 and 0 86 and the rmse values were 0 89 0 53 0 59 and 2 52 respectively the lai generated by assimilating modis lai into the chinaagrosys crop model was very low because it was influenced by the low values of modis lai during the entire winter wheat growing season the modis lai of winter wheat at the yangling station was somewhat larger in 2013 2014 compared with modis lai shown in fig 12 this is likely due to the highly fragmented planted areas of winter wheat at the agrometeorological stations where modis pixels suffered more effects of mixed pixels the simulation results were improved somewhat by assimilating external remote sensing data into the crop model compared with the simulation results from chinaagrosys without assimilation the r2 between the simulated and observed lai values was improved by assimilating ndvi or look up table lai into the crop model and the changes in simulated lai over time agreed well with the growth and development of winter wheat the rmse between observed lai and simulated lai generated by assimilating ndvi into chinaagrosys was the smallest the accuracy of the simulated yield under the four assimilation schemes was 93 6 92 1 91 9 and 91 8 for the combinations of pso ndvi sce ua ndvi sce ua lai and pso lai respectively table 4 accuracy was highest for the pso ndvi scheme and there were little differences between the other three schemes the order of the assimilation efficiency based on computation time from high to low efficiency was pso lai pso ndvi sce ua ndvi and sce ua lai respectively overall the assimilation using the sce ua algorithm took more time than the pso algorithm during the data assimilation process continuous data assimilation algorithms such as pso and sce ua are very dependent on the accuracy of the external observation data due to the constraints of the algorithms 3 4 2 regional scale data model assimilation it was difficult to implement the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys for all of the 3822 830 wheat pixels on the loess plateau because of the low assimilation efficiency observed at the site scale for the yangling station therefore hongtong county was selected as a representative study area for the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys there were 206 199 pixels contained in hongtong county of which 4881 pixels were winter wheat and it took about 2 4 5 9 days to implement the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys based on the estimated planting date and irrigation data for winter wheat the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys was implemented using two state variables ndvi and lai and two assimilation algorithms pso and sce ua the accuracy of the yield estimation under the four assimilation schemes is shown in table 5 the yield simulation accuracy of the four assimilation schemes in hongtong county in 2011 ordered high to low was pso ndvi 92 8 sce ua ndvi 92 0 pso lai 91 0 and sce ua lai 89 1 overall the accuracy was higher when ndvi was used as assimilation state variable than when lai was used the spatial heterogeneity of rainfed wheat yield was significantly larger than that of irrigated wheat yield in hongtong county the average values of moran s i moran 1950 for rainfed and irrigated wheat were 0 40 and 0 17 respectively fig 14 and fig 15 rainfed wheat yield is largely determined by precipitation conditions resulting in widely varying yield with large spatial fluctuations the area of hongtong county is 1563 km2 and irrigation practices are roughly similar throughout the region irrigated wheat yield is relatively stable and exhibits less spatial fluctuation the estimated yield was higher for irrigated wheat than for rainfed wheat using chinaagrosys without the assimilation of remote sensing data the simulation results were significantly improved by taking into account the regional irrigation data for winter wheat the spatial patterns and values of the simulated rainfed wheat yields were similar to the yields obtained using a light use efficiency model the simulated irrigated wheat yields using a light use efficiency model were higher at some pixels and the results exhibited less spatial heterogeneity than those obtained with the assimilation schemes moran s i for the light use efficiency model was relatively larger compared with the results of chinaagrosys without assimilation of remote sensing data the accuracy and spatial heterogeneity of the estimated yield were further improved not only by assimilating remote sensing data into chinaagrosys but also by taking into account the regional irrigation data for winter wheat for irrigated wheat the average moran s i under the four assimilation schemes was 0 22 which was smaller than the value of 0 45 that was the result of chinaagrosys without assimilation of remote sensing data 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data used for crop modeling irrigation plays an important role in crop growth development and yield production in arid and semi arid regions but the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data has been infrequently considered when applying crop models at regional scales kang et al 2019 hu et al 2019 most of the time crops in study areas have been assumed to be rainfed or set to uniform irrigation scenarios de wit and van diepen 2007 curnel et al 2011 huang et al 2015a the differences between irrigated and rainfed crops have been recognized in some studies but the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data for different crops and irrigation times must be further studied mo et al 2005 gilardelli et al 2019 on the one hand the application of crop models at regional scales faces the problem of upscaling irrigation data but it is difficult to obtain regional irrigation data because irrigation activities are affected by many factors xie et al 2019 on the other hand the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data at regional scales is seldom considered when assimilating remote sensing data into crop models consequently the reliability of the crop modeling results may be reduced due to uncertainty in the regional irrigation data moreover the uncertainty may be further transferred to the results of the crop model with assimilated remote sensing data some studies have focused on classifying irrigated and rainfed crops and the major methods used have been digital unsupervised and supervised classification pervez et al 2014 the food and agriculture organization fao united states geological survey usgs and international water management institute iwmi have published global irrigation maps loveland et al 2000 ozdogan and gutman 2008 however the current irrigation distribution data cannot meet the demand associated with applying a crop model at a regional scale especially the irrigation times and amounts needed by a crop model in order to reduce the uncertainty in regional irrigation data those data were estimated for winter wheat production on the loess plateau first of all the irrigated and rainfed wheat areas on the loess plateau were classified using the method of jin et al 2016b the effect of water availability on winter wheat growth and phenology were taken into account by this method and a machine learning algorithm was involved to avoid the problem of setting thresholds through repeated attempts secondly winter wheat yield was estimated using a light use efficiency model and then the irrigation times for winter wheat were deduced from the estimated yield and typical irrigation practices used on the loess plateau by doing this the uncertainty in the regional irrigation data was reduced to improve the reliability of the simulation results when assimilating remote sensing data into the crop model 4 2 irrigation data needs to be upscaled when applying a crop model at a regional scale data for driving a crop model involves meteorology soil properties crop management parameters etc hence upscaling this input data is the first problem to be solved when applying a crop model at a regional scale obtaining regional management data especially irrigation data is generally more difficult that upscaling meteorological and soil data because crop yields are largely constrained by water availability in arid and semi arid regions we were able to estimate irrigation times for winter wheat from wheat yield data in order to reduce the uncertainty in regional irrigation data this irrigation estimation method goes a step further than previous studies in which crop production was treated as either rainfed or irrigated under a set uniform irrigation scenario across the entire study area however the problem of upscaling irrigation data has not been completely solved since crop models need both irrigation times and amounts tavakoli et al 2015 soil moisture increases rapidly after a crop is irrigated molero et al 2016 soil moisture at high spatial resolution is generated by downscaling the coarse scale satellite soil moisture product djamai et al 2016 then the regional irrigation data can be estimated according to the variation of soil moisture this method will further reduce the uncertainty in regional irrigation data and accordingly improve the simulation results of crop models assimilated with remote sensing data 4 3 the selection of state variables and assimilation algorithm when applying chinaagrosys with assimilated remote sensing data at the regional scale the accuracy of the simulation result is mainly dependent on the accuracy of the parameters derived from remote sensing data it is difficult to obtain a satisfactory lai time series due to the influence of various factors such as weather conditions observation method spatiotemporal resolution of remote sensing data etc huang et al 2015a in this study lai was obtained using a look up table method that used inverted radiation transfer data and the corresponding assimilation result was improved as r2 was slightly lower but rmse was greatly reduced compared with the assimilation result based on modis lai the assimilation result will be improved by increasing the accuracy of the inverted lai the assimilation result is dependent on the accuracy of the inverted parameters for the regional farmland ecosystem single state variables of either ndvi or lai were used in the assimilation of remote sensing data into a crop model in this study but two variables or multiple variables ndvi lai evapotranspiration soil moisture etc could be used together to combine the advantages of multi source observations ines et al 2013 ma et al 2013 mishra et al 2015 another important issue that needs to be addressed when considering the assimilation of remote sensing data into crop models is improving computational efficiency jin et al 2018b computational efficiency is affected by various factors such as the amount of spatiotemporal data the size of the study area the state variables and the algorithm used for the assimilation the continuous assimilation algorithms of pso and sce ua used in this study were time consuming it took at least 42 02 s to implement an assimilation process on a single pixel using an ordinary computer the spatial resolution of the winter wheat pixel was 250 m and there were 1884 3815 pixels on the loess plateau consequently it would take a relatively long time to apply a crop model assimilated with remote sensing data to all pixels due to the large amount of data therefore in this study hongtong county was selected as a representative case study to implement the assimilation of remote sensing data into a crop model the simulation results of crop models assimilated with remote sensing data using the pso and sce ua algorithms are largely dependent on the reliability of the observed data liu et al 2015 the assimilation result is improved by optimizing the parameters of the crop model which may lack consideration of the uncertainties in both observation data and crop model simulation results this may induce some bias in the simulation results and also may be time consuming errors in the observation data and in the crop model are considered by a sequential data assimilation algorithm such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf which we plan to use in a future study the enkf algorithm can continuously assimilate the observed data and avoid the large number of calculations that the continuous data assimilation algorithms needed huang et al 2016 2019 the calculation efficiency for the crop model assimilated with remote sensing data can be greatly improved with the help of parallel computations and a high performance computer zhao et al 2015 doing so will make full use of the advantages of rapidly obtaining large scale regional data by satellite remote sensing and of the simulation products of crop models 5 conclusion in this study the spatial heterogeneity of regional irrigation data for winter wheat was considered for the loess plateau four assimilation schemes were established for assimilating remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model the assimilation schemes were based on two state variables lai and ndvi and two algorithms pso and sce ua the productivity of winter wheat under different water availability conditions was evaluated by chinaagrosys with and without assimilated remote sensing data the main conclusions of the study were 1 rainfed wheat and wheat that was irrigated once accounted for 60 0 and 30 6 respectively of the wheat area and the remaining wheat area was irrigated two or three times 2 a look up table of lai values was established using inverted data from the prosail radiation transfer model and the r2 between the observed lai at jointing and heading stages and the inverted lai at 250 m spatial resolution was greater than 0 54 from 2010 to 2015 3 the global sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the chinaagrosys crop model showed that yield and lai were mainly influenced by the parameters of c0 c1 and b2 the r2 values between the chinaagrosys simulation results maturity date lai and yield and the observations at 21 agrometeorologcial stations were greater than 0 73 0 44 and 0 60 respectively showing good applicability of chinaagrosys for wheat simulation on the loess plateau 4 in general the accuracy of simulation results was higher when ndvi was used as the assimilation state variable and the calculation efficiency was higher when the pso algorithm was used for the assimilation at both site and regional scales the accuracy of simulation results and spatial heterogeneity for simulated winter wheat yield were improved by assimilating remote sensing data into chinaagrosys based on the regional irrigation data when applying a crop model at a regional scale accounting for spatial heterogeneity of regional irrigation data will improve the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results that are generated by assimilating remote sensing data into the crop model accuracy and computational efficiency of a crop model assimilated with remote sensing

9555,irrigation plays an important role in crop yield production in arid and semi arid regions however irrigation effects have not been well addressed in the application of crop models at a regional scale due to limited data availability which constrains the reliability and accuracy of simulation results assimilating remote sensing information into crop models can provide a viable approach to reduce associated uncertainties in this study regional irrigation data for winter wheat triticum aestivum l grown on the loess plateau was used to calibrate and validate the chinaagrosys china agricultural system crop model at site and regional scales remote sensing data was then assimilated into the chinaagrosys crop model under four assimilation schemes two remotely sensed assimilation state variables i e lai and ndvi and two assimilation algorithms i e pso partical swarm optimization and sce ua shuffled complex evolution were considered during the winter wheat growing season on the loess plateau 30 6 of the wheat production area was irrigated once 6 7 was irrigated two times 3 7 was irrigated three times and the remaining wheat area was rainfed the r2 values between maturity date lai and yield simulated by the chinaagrosys crop model and observations at 21 agrometeorological stations on the loess plateau were greater than 0 73 0 44 and 0 60 respectively during 2010 2015 the accuracy and spatial heterogeneity of winter wheat yield estimation were effectively improved by assimilating remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model based on regional irrigation data under the four assimilation schemes the combination of pso ndvi produced the highest accuracy for yield estimation in hongtong county 92 8 followed by sce ua ndvi 92 0 our results demonstrated the importance of accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of water availability when applying a crop model in arid and semi arid regions additionally our analysis regarding different assimilation state variables and algorithms indicated that both simulation accuracy and calculation efficiency should be considered when assimilating remote sensing data into a crop model for simulating crop growth at regional scales keywords data assimilation remote sensing data chinaagrosys crop model regional irrigation winter wheat 1 introduction crop models can simulate photosynthesis respiration transpiration and dry matter distribution during periods of crop growth and yield production over recent decades crop models have been widely used to investigate climate change impacts on crop yield bocchiola et al 2013 to schedule farmland irrigation chimonyo et al 2016 and to analyze effects of drought stress on growth crop and yield yin et al 2014 however most crop models were originally developed for plot field scale studies and their regional application has been constrained by the availability of input parameters regarding meteorology soil characteristics agricultural management etc lv et al 2016 satellite remote sensing has rapidly developed and plays an important role in quantifying crop planted area growth monitoring yield forecasting and drought assessment at regional scales sakamoto et al 2013 park et al 2016 chen et al 2018 combining satellite remote sensing data with crop models can result in continuous spatiotemporal modeling of crop growth processes jin et al 2018b huang et al 2019 and can provide strong support for dynamic monitoring of crop growth and yield production at regional scales data assimilation methods that combine the advantages of crop modeling and remote sensing data have been widely developed in recent years ines et al 2013 hu et al 2019 this process is implemented by continuously integrating a variety of observation data and constantly adjusting the trajectory of simulations within the dynamic framework of the crop model huang et al 2015a the variables assimilated into a crop model may include leaf area index lai normalized difference vegetation index ndvi evapotranspiration et soil moisture enhanced vegetation index evi etc de wit and van diepen 2007 curnel et al 2011 ma et al 2013 huang et al 2015b guo et al 2019 previous studies have shown that crop model simulation results were improved by assimilating biophysical variables obtained from remote sensing data kang and özdoğan 2019 lei et al 2020 in contrast the process of upscaling irrigation data to regional scale requires further study irrigation activities are influenced by many factors including water availability irrigation water price crop growth conditions farmers willingness to irrigate a crop etc the timing and amount of irrigation events on farmland have a great amount of uncertainty thereby increasing the difficulties in obtaining irrigation data at a regional scale currently studies regarding regional irrigation data are mainly focused on classifying crop areas as either irrigated or rainfed pervez et al 2014 deines et al 2019 xie et al 2019 however realistically estimating regional crop growth requires information regarding irrigation timing and amount which currently cannot be derived from existing irrigation data sets agricultural production on the loess plateau in china is largely constrained by water availability irrigation plays a critical role in ensuring crop productivity in dry years irrigated wheat yield can be 2 3 times greater than rainfed wheat yield jin et al 2016b the ability of a crop model to accurately simulate yield production and water consumption in this region is compromised by the lack of accurate regional irrigation data usually a crop in an entire study area is assumed to be rainfed or is assumed to use a standard irrigation scenario zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 adhikari et al 2016 different water availability for crops has been considered in some studies but the spatial resolution has been coarse and the irrigated and rainfed conditions were the same for different crops mo et al 2005 in general it is difficult to get reliable irrigation data at a regional scale and therefore the spatial heterogeneity in irrigation data is given less attention when applying a crop model at a regional scale furthermore the influence of spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data on simulation results is seldom considered for the subsequent assimilation of remote sensing data into a crop model de et al 2012 huang et al 2015b jin et al 2016a gilardelli et al 2019 ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data may lead to some uncertainties for the simulation results of crop models in arid and semi arid regions in this study wheat production areas on the loess plateau were classified as either irrigated and rainfed irrigation times were then assumed based on the local irrigation practices and the estimated wheat yield from a light use efficiency model taking into account the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data on the loess plateau can improve the accuracy and reliability of yield estimation when assimilating remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys china agricultural system crop model the major scientific objectives of this study were to 1 extract regional irrigation data for winter wheat production on the loess plateau 2 estimate winter wheat lai at 250 m spatial resolution using the prosail radiation transfer model 3 evaluate the performance of chinaagrosys on the loess plateau 4 couple chinaagrosys with the prosail radiation transfer model and build schemes for assimilating remote sensing data based on spatial irrigation data into chinaagrosys 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the loess plateau is located between 32 41 n and 103 114 e with an area of 648 700 km2 including 341 counties in shanxi shaanxi ningxia henan gansu inner mongolia and qinghai provinces autonomous regions the southeast loess plateau is lower than the northwest and the elevation varies from 500 m to about 3000 m the loess plateau is under the influence of a continental monsoon climate and is a transition zone changing from semi humid to semi arid climate precipitation increases from the northwest 150 250 mm to the southeast above 600 mm and shows large inter annual variation precipitation in wet years can be 2 5 times greater than precipitation in dry years in this study we selected 158 counties that planted winter wheat in the central and southern loess plateau which accounted for 46 3 of the total counties fig 1 the average winter wheat yields in gansu ningxia shaanxi shanxi and henan provinces were 2426 2206 4022 3031 and 4382 kg ha 1 in 2011 respectively winter wheat is usually planted in october and harvested in june of the following year precipitation during the winter wheat growing season is far less than the amount needed to meet the demand for crop growth and yield production irrigation plays an important role in producing high and stable winter wheat yield 2 2 data 2 2 1 remote sensing data the remote sensing data used in this study included mod13q1 ndvi data 16 day 250 m resolution and mod15a2 lai data 8 day 1000 m resolution during the years 2010 2015 two scenes were needed for the modis data to cover the entire loess plateau path row h26v05 and h27v05 after applying re projection mosaic and merging processing to the modis data 1884 3815 pixels in the study area were obtained using the vector shapefile of the loess plateau boundary 2 2 2 meteorological soil and ground observation data meteorological data for the 158 counties on the loess plateau were obtained for the period of 2010 2015 including daily mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine hours precipitation and wind speed a multivariate linear regression model that considered geographic effects longitude latitude elevation slope and aspect was used to interpolate meteorological data elements at a spatial resolution of 250 m to match the remote sensing data jin et al 2018a the spatially explicit soil properties obtained from dai et al 2013 included soil texture saturated water content wilting coefficient and field water holding capacity the ground observation data for winter wheat during 2012 2014 were collected from the water saving agricultural experiment station of northwest a f university at yangling fig 1 the winter wheat cultivar was xiaoyan22 the data for the period of 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 were used to calibrate and validate respectively the chinaagrosys crop model there were a total of 21 winter wheat agrometeorological stations across the loess plateau the observation data included planting date maturity date lai yield etc which were used to evaluate the applicability of chinaagrosys the lai data at jointing and heading stages for six agrometeorological stations in shanxi province were used to validate lai values that the look up table described later generated and that chinaagrosys simulated 2 3 chinaagrosys crop model and parameter sensitivity analysis chinaagrosys is a comprehensive soil vegetation atmosphere model in which photosynthesis transpiration and stomatal conductance models were extended from leaf to canopy scale by integrating the leaf water potential dynamic model with the hydrothermal transfer and photosynthetic models in spac soil plant atmosphere continuum chinaagrosys considers the crop growth and hydrothermal transfer process and consists of three sub modules i e soil crop growth and micro meteorology details regarding chinaagrosys can be found in wang et al 2007 the major parameters in chinaagrosys affecting physiological processes controlling crop growth and development include the developmental rate parameters c0 c1 nondimensional quantity lai parameters a0 a1 a2 a3 nondimensional quantity crop specific parameters alpha0 initial quantum efficiency v0 max photosynthesis rate µmol m 2 s 1 and yield parameters b0 b1 b2 nondimensional quantity the most sensitive parameters with respect to crop development and yield production were selected based on an analysis of the influence of the interrelationships between parameters from simulation results this process was helpful in selecting the optimal values of parameters for assimilating remote sensing data into chinaagrosys thereby improving the efficiency of the optimizing algorithm and reducing the computational requirements the global sensitivity analysis of the 11 parameters in chinaagrosys was implemented using the efast extended fourier amplitude sensitivity test method based on the observed lai and yield data at the yangling experimental station from 2012 to 2013 the framework of the sensitivity calculation was constructed using the sensitivity package written in the r program http www r project org and the executable file and parameters file in chinaagrosys were called to calculate the sensitivity for the 11 parameters in the efast method the number of calculations for a single process was n p where n is the number of samples and p is the number of parameters 2 4 classification of irrigated and rainfed wheat yield estimation and irrigation criteria the winter wheat planted area on the loess plateau was extracted based on the variation of the ndvi time series jin et al 2016b yield was estimated using a light use efficiency model jin et al 2018a the timing and amount of irrigation for winter wheat was estimated based on the classification results and the estimated winter wheat yield given that crop growth and yield production in the study areas are largely determined by water availability specifically the irrigation amount was set as 0 mm for rainfed wheat three irrigation levels were used for irrigated wheat irrigated once when yield 4500 kg ha 1 april 2011 irrigated twice when 6000 kg ha yield 4500 kg ha 1 december 2010 and 1 april 2011 and irrigated three times when yield 6000 kg ha 1 december 2010 1 april 2011 and 15 may 2011 the irrigation amount was 50 mm for each irrigation event according to the typical agricultural production practices on the loess plateau 2 5 prosail radiation transfer model and lai inversion 2 5 1 prosail radiation transfer model the prosail radiation transfer model consists of two sub modules i e the prospect model and the sail model the prospect model simulates hemisphere directional reflectance and transmittance at leaf scale in the wavelength range 400 2500 nm then leaf reflectance and transmittance are used to drive the sail model to simulate canopy reflectance the prosail 5b radiation transfer model used in this study was downloaded from http teledetection ipgp jussieu fr prosail details of the prosail 5b model can be found in jacquemoud et al 2009 2 5 2 lai inversion leaf area index is an important input variable used in many land surface models and has been widely used in crop growth monitoring and yield predication sakamoto et al 2013 when assimilating remote sensing data into a crop model at a regional scale results are mainly influenced by the accuracy of retrieved lai generally there are two major ways to retrieve lai using satellite remote sensing data i e empirical semi empirical model inversion and physical model inversion pasolli et al 2015 at present the main data sources used to retrieve the lai product at large scales are modis glass and other satellite remote sensing data at medium spatial resolutions the temporal and spatial resolution of these lai products are 8 days to 1 month and 1 10 km respectively the modis lai product is not crop specific and the lai values of farmland are lower than ground observations duveiller et al 2013 moreover image resolution is too coarse to be used on the loess plateau due to the highly fragmented farmland in this region therefore it is difficult to directly assimilate the 1 km modis lai product into a crop model which may reduce the spatial heterogeneity in the simulation results in this study lai at 250 m spatial resolution was retrieved for the loess plateau based on an ndvi lai look up table derived from the prosail radiation transfer model fig 2 2 5 3 hyperspectral reflectance data of winter wheat hyperspectral reflectance data for the winter wheat canopy were measured with the analytical spectral devices asd field spec pro fr 350 2500 nm spectroradiometer instrument calibration was performed using a standard reference board before and after each measurement of the reflectance spectrum measurements were made between 10 00 and 15 00 when the sky was cloudless and wind speed was low the angle of the spectroradiometer was set as 25º with a height of 1 3 m each winter wheat sample area was measured 10 times the spectroradiometer data were then used to validate the simulation results of the prosail radiation transfer model 2 5 4 conversion between hyperspectral reflectance data and multispectral reflectance data the observed and simulated winter wheat canopy reflectance ranges were 350 2500 nm and 400 2500 nm respectively the modis image was comprised of multispectral reflectance data the modis image data were associated with the hyperspectral data using the spectral response function the wide band reflectance was estimated as follows steven et al 2003 1 ρ i λ r λ φ λ d λ i λ φ λ d λ where ρ is the reflectance of the corresponding band of the satellite sensor i is the ground measured incident solar radiation r is the vegetation canopy reflectance λ is the wavelength φ is the spectral response function of the corresponding satellite sensor band including blue green red near infrared shortwave infrared bands etc the spectral response function in the spectral library was linearly interpolated to match the spectral resolution of the observed and simulated canopy reflectance 2 5 5 lai estimation using the look up table inversion method one modis pixel at 1 km spatial resolution would contain 16 pixels at 250 m spatial resolution if the original modis lai data were directly used then all 16 pixels would have the same value doing so would greatly reduce the spatial heterogeneity in the resulting data simulated by the crop model therefore it was necessary to invert winter wheat lai at 250 m spatial resolution before assimilating remote sensing data into the crop model on the loess plateau the look up table is a relatively simple method to invert lai based on the radiation transfer model the method can produce a global optimum solution and avoid the shortcoming of the neural network that easily obtains the local optimal solution additionally the computation complexity and abnormality are lower than seen for numerical optimization methods during the lai inversion a look up table containing the lai values generated by the prosail radiation transfer model and the corresponding ndvi estimated using canopy reflectance was established based on the forward radiation transfer model 2 6 pso and sce ua optimization algorithms and objective functions particle swarm optimization pso is an intelligent algorithm used to simulate bird clustering and foraging that was developed at the end of the twentieth century kennedy and eberhart 1995 details regarding the pso algorithm can be found in li et al 2015 the global optimization algorithm of sce ua shuffle complex evolution method has been widely used in parameter calibration for hydrological watershed models duan et al 1994 the continuous data assimilation algorithms of pso and sce ua were used in this study by continuously adjusting the parameters of the model the objective function reached the minimum value when the model simulations of lai or ndvi agreed best with the observations the objective function f min was calculated as 2 f min i 1 n x model i x obs i x obs i 2 n where a smaller value of f min means a more accurate simulation result for the model in the equation i 1 2 3 n n is the number of observations and x model i and x obs i are the i th model simulation result and observation respectively 2 7 assimilation of remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys included the three major parts of 1 crop model 2 observation data and 3 assimilation algorithm the crop model supplied the dynamic framework and simulated the crop growth processes by constantly updating the state variables the observation data included remote sensing data and ground observation data etc determining the best match between the model simulation values and observation data was realized using the data assimilation algorithm there are two ways to couple the crop model with remote sensing data at spatiotemporal scale table 1 1 lai as the assimilation state variable fig 3 the difference between lai values that chinaagrorys simulates and the inverted remote sensing data is reduced by continuously adjusting the parameters of the crop model using the optimization algorithm the optimal parameters are obtained when the objective function reaches its minimum value and then crop yield is estimated based on these parameters 2 ndvi as the assimilation state variable fig 3 chinaagrosys and the prosail radiation transfer model are coupled the lai estimated by chinaagrosys is input to the prosail radiation transfer model and ndvi is calculated based on the simulated canopy reflectance the difference between ndvi that the coupled model generates and that remote sensing data estimates is reduced by continuously adjusting the parameters of the crop model using the optimization algorithm the optimal parameters are obtained when the objective function reaches its minimum value and then crop yield is estimated based on these parameters the assimilation framework used four modules 1 the main module whose function was to call the crop model radiation transfer model and submodule for the objective function 2 the settings for the crop model parameters reading the simulation result and calling the radiation transfer model module 3 the radiation transfer model module and 4 the objective function module when running the coupled data assimilation scheme data for latitude longitude altitude planting date irrigation data soil property parameters inverted lai and meteorological parameters for wheat pixels were written into the corresponding site and control files then the crop model and radiation transfer model were continuously called using the optimization algorithm during this process the simulated lai or ndvi was compared with the corresponding state variable to obtain the optimal combination of parameters fig 4 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of irrigation times for winter wheat on the loess plateau irrigated and rainfed wheat areas on the loess plateau were classified according to water availability rainfed wheat accounted for 60 of the winter wheat area planted on the loess plateau and the rest was irrigated wheat irrigation times were different throughout the irrigated wheat area fig 5 the proportion of the wheat area irrigated one two and three times on the loess plateau was 30 6 6 7 and 2 7 respectively hence water availability for winter wheat on the loess plateau exhibited great spatial heterogeneity the difference in water availability for winter wheat on the loess plateau should be taken into account when applying a crop model at a regional scale in order to reduce the uncertainty in simulation results that may be induced by the uncertain regional irrigation data 3 2 applicability assessment of the chinaagrosys crop model on the loess plateau 3 2 1 parameter sensitivity analysis for chinaagrosys the results of the global sensitivity analysis of parameters for chinaagrosys showed that the five lai parameters with the greatest first order sensitivity index values were c1 b2 c0 b0 and b1 with sensitivity values of 30 4 23 9 21 7 11 6 and 10 5 respectively the five lai parameters with the greatest global sensitivity index values were c1 b2 c0 b1 and b0 with sensitivity values of 39 1 35 2 25 7 23 7 and 22 7 respectively the five yield parameters with the greatest first order sensitivity index values were b2 c1 c0 a0 and b0 with sensitivity values of 19 6 13 7 13 3 10 2 and 9 7 respectively and the five yield parameters with the greatest global sensitivity index values were b2 a0 c1 c0 and a2 with sensitivity values of 31 9 23 7 23 5 22 9 and 22 6 respectively fig 6 based on the above results the parameters of c0 c1 and b2 were selected for optimization during the following assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys the initial minimum and maximum values of the optimized parameters are shown in table 2 parameter variation in chinaagrosys induced corresponding changes in maturity date lai biomass and yield for winter wheat lai was used as an example to demonstrate the influence of the variation of c0 c1 and b2 fig 7 the variation of lai with changing c0 and c1 were generally similar as lai increased with the increasing c0 and c1 before the heading stage and vice versa after the heading stage moreover the maximum lai value and the period of occurrence were also influenced by c0 and c1 the b2 parameter mainly affected the maximum value of lai before and after the heading period lai tended to decrease as b2 increased 3 2 2 chinaagrosys crop model evaluation at site and regional scales on the loess plateau the chinaagrosys crop model was calibrated using the observations at the yangling experimental station for the period 2012 2013 simulated lai and cumulative biomass were slightly lower at the early and late winter wheat growth stages overall the variations of simulated lai over time were consistent with observations fig 8 simulations with the chinaagrosys crop model were evaluated against observations at 21 winter wheat agrometeorological stations across the loess plateau for the period 2010 2015 these regional observations included maturity date lai at jointing and heading stages and yield production chinaagrosys simulated values comparable with observations for the study region the r2 values between simulated and observed maturity dates were greater than 0 73 and r2 values for lai and yield were greater than 0 44 and 0 60 respectively fig 9 3 3 inversion of lai at 250 m spatial resolution for winter wheat on the loess plateau 3 3 1 calibration and validation of the prosail radiation transfer model parameter ranges for the prosail radiation transfer model were determined on the basis of a priori knowledge of field measurements and relevant literature pasolli et al 2015 casas et al 2014 the parameter settings were determined based on the sensitivity analysis table 3 the parameter sensitivities of the model simulated results were evaluated by continuously changing one of the parameters in the prosail radiation transfer model our results fig 10 showed that 1 the sensitive band for the chlorophyll parameter cab was 550 nm and reflectance increased with increasing cab 2 reflectance increased with increasing hot spot coefficient hspot most noticeably in the near infrared band 3 reflectance decreased with increasing average leaf inclination lidfa most noticeably in the near infrared band 4 reflectance increased with increasing view zenith angle tto most noticeably in the near infrared band 5 reflectance decreased with increasing solar zenith angle tts most noticeably in the near infrared band based on the asd observed canopy reflectance of winter wheat the sensitive parameters for the prosail radiation transfer model were optimized using the sce ua algorithm simulated canopy reflectance agreed well with observations fig 11 differences between the simulated results and observations were larger in the near infrared band than in the visible band overall the optimized prosail radiation transfer model provided useful data to establish the lai look up table 3 3 2 validation of inverted lai on the loess plateau inverted lai from the look up table and modis lai were evaluated using the ground observed lai at winter wheat jointing and heading stages at six winter wheat agrometeorological stations in shanxi province from 2010 to 2015 the r2 between look up table lai and ground observed lai was greater than 0 54 indicating a good relationship fig 12 the modis pixels at 1 km spatial resolution were heavily influenced by the effect of mixed pixels and resulted in lower lai values for modis than for the look up table inverted lai and ground observed lai 3 4 assimilation of remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model 3 4 1 site level data model assimilation winter wheat growth and development during the 2013 2014 growing season were evaluated using the four schemes to assimilate remote sensing data into chinaagrosys the greatest maximum lai value fig 13 was seen for lai obtained with ndvi as the assimilation state variable followed by the look up table lai as the assimilation state variable the chinaagrosys crop model simulation without assimilation and modis lai as the assimilation state variable lowest maximum lai the corresponding r2 values between the simulated lai under the four assimilation schemes and observed lai were 0 73 0 79 0 75 and 0 86 and the rmse values were 0 89 0 53 0 59 and 2 52 respectively the lai generated by assimilating modis lai into the chinaagrosys crop model was very low because it was influenced by the low values of modis lai during the entire winter wheat growing season the modis lai of winter wheat at the yangling station was somewhat larger in 2013 2014 compared with modis lai shown in fig 12 this is likely due to the highly fragmented planted areas of winter wheat at the agrometeorological stations where modis pixels suffered more effects of mixed pixels the simulation results were improved somewhat by assimilating external remote sensing data into the crop model compared with the simulation results from chinaagrosys without assimilation the r2 between the simulated and observed lai values was improved by assimilating ndvi or look up table lai into the crop model and the changes in simulated lai over time agreed well with the growth and development of winter wheat the rmse between observed lai and simulated lai generated by assimilating ndvi into chinaagrosys was the smallest the accuracy of the simulated yield under the four assimilation schemes was 93 6 92 1 91 9 and 91 8 for the combinations of pso ndvi sce ua ndvi sce ua lai and pso lai respectively table 4 accuracy was highest for the pso ndvi scheme and there were little differences between the other three schemes the order of the assimilation efficiency based on computation time from high to low efficiency was pso lai pso ndvi sce ua ndvi and sce ua lai respectively overall the assimilation using the sce ua algorithm took more time than the pso algorithm during the data assimilation process continuous data assimilation algorithms such as pso and sce ua are very dependent on the accuracy of the external observation data due to the constraints of the algorithms 3 4 2 regional scale data model assimilation it was difficult to implement the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys for all of the 3822 830 wheat pixels on the loess plateau because of the low assimilation efficiency observed at the site scale for the yangling station therefore hongtong county was selected as a representative study area for the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys there were 206 199 pixels contained in hongtong county of which 4881 pixels were winter wheat and it took about 2 4 5 9 days to implement the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys based on the estimated planting date and irrigation data for winter wheat the assimilation of remote sensing data into chinaagrosys was implemented using two state variables ndvi and lai and two assimilation algorithms pso and sce ua the accuracy of the yield estimation under the four assimilation schemes is shown in table 5 the yield simulation accuracy of the four assimilation schemes in hongtong county in 2011 ordered high to low was pso ndvi 92 8 sce ua ndvi 92 0 pso lai 91 0 and sce ua lai 89 1 overall the accuracy was higher when ndvi was used as assimilation state variable than when lai was used the spatial heterogeneity of rainfed wheat yield was significantly larger than that of irrigated wheat yield in hongtong county the average values of moran s i moran 1950 for rainfed and irrigated wheat were 0 40 and 0 17 respectively fig 14 and fig 15 rainfed wheat yield is largely determined by precipitation conditions resulting in widely varying yield with large spatial fluctuations the area of hongtong county is 1563 km2 and irrigation practices are roughly similar throughout the region irrigated wheat yield is relatively stable and exhibits less spatial fluctuation the estimated yield was higher for irrigated wheat than for rainfed wheat using chinaagrosys without the assimilation of remote sensing data the simulation results were significantly improved by taking into account the regional irrigation data for winter wheat the spatial patterns and values of the simulated rainfed wheat yields were similar to the yields obtained using a light use efficiency model the simulated irrigated wheat yields using a light use efficiency model were higher at some pixels and the results exhibited less spatial heterogeneity than those obtained with the assimilation schemes moran s i for the light use efficiency model was relatively larger compared with the results of chinaagrosys without assimilation of remote sensing data the accuracy and spatial heterogeneity of the estimated yield were further improved not only by assimilating remote sensing data into chinaagrosys but also by taking into account the regional irrigation data for winter wheat for irrigated wheat the average moran s i under the four assimilation schemes was 0 22 which was smaller than the value of 0 45 that was the result of chinaagrosys without assimilation of remote sensing data 4 discussion 4 1 spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data used for crop modeling irrigation plays an important role in crop growth development and yield production in arid and semi arid regions but the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data has been infrequently considered when applying crop models at regional scales kang et al 2019 hu et al 2019 most of the time crops in study areas have been assumed to be rainfed or set to uniform irrigation scenarios de wit and van diepen 2007 curnel et al 2011 huang et al 2015a the differences between irrigated and rainfed crops have been recognized in some studies but the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data for different crops and irrigation times must be further studied mo et al 2005 gilardelli et al 2019 on the one hand the application of crop models at regional scales faces the problem of upscaling irrigation data but it is difficult to obtain regional irrigation data because irrigation activities are affected by many factors xie et al 2019 on the other hand the spatial heterogeneity of irrigation data at regional scales is seldom considered when assimilating remote sensing data into crop models consequently the reliability of the crop modeling results may be reduced due to uncertainty in the regional irrigation data moreover the uncertainty may be further transferred to the results of the crop model with assimilated remote sensing data some studies have focused on classifying irrigated and rainfed crops and the major methods used have been digital unsupervised and supervised classification pervez et al 2014 the food and agriculture organization fao united states geological survey usgs and international water management institute iwmi have published global irrigation maps loveland et al 2000 ozdogan and gutman 2008 however the current irrigation distribution data cannot meet the demand associated with applying a crop model at a regional scale especially the irrigation times and amounts needed by a crop model in order to reduce the uncertainty in regional irrigation data those data were estimated for winter wheat production on the loess plateau first of all the irrigated and rainfed wheat areas on the loess plateau were classified using the method of jin et al 2016b the effect of water availability on winter wheat growth and phenology were taken into account by this method and a machine learning algorithm was involved to avoid the problem of setting thresholds through repeated attempts secondly winter wheat yield was estimated using a light use efficiency model and then the irrigation times for winter wheat were deduced from the estimated yield and typical irrigation practices used on the loess plateau by doing this the uncertainty in the regional irrigation data was reduced to improve the reliability of the simulation results when assimilating remote sensing data into the crop model 4 2 irrigation data needs to be upscaled when applying a crop model at a regional scale data for driving a crop model involves meteorology soil properties crop management parameters etc hence upscaling this input data is the first problem to be solved when applying a crop model at a regional scale obtaining regional management data especially irrigation data is generally more difficult that upscaling meteorological and soil data because crop yields are largely constrained by water availability in arid and semi arid regions we were able to estimate irrigation times for winter wheat from wheat yield data in order to reduce the uncertainty in regional irrigation data this irrigation estimation method goes a step further than previous studies in which crop production was treated as either rainfed or irrigated under a set uniform irrigation scenario across the entire study area however the problem of upscaling irrigation data has not been completely solved since crop models need both irrigation times and amounts tavakoli et al 2015 soil moisture increases rapidly after a crop is irrigated molero et al 2016 soil moisture at high spatial resolution is generated by downscaling the coarse scale satellite soil moisture product djamai et al 2016 then the regional irrigation data can be estimated according to the variation of soil moisture this method will further reduce the uncertainty in regional irrigation data and accordingly improve the simulation results of crop models assimilated with remote sensing data 4 3 the selection of state variables and assimilation algorithm when applying chinaagrosys with assimilated remote sensing data at the regional scale the accuracy of the simulation result is mainly dependent on the accuracy of the parameters derived from remote sensing data it is difficult to obtain a satisfactory lai time series due to the influence of various factors such as weather conditions observation method spatiotemporal resolution of remote sensing data etc huang et al 2015a in this study lai was obtained using a look up table method that used inverted radiation transfer data and the corresponding assimilation result was improved as r2 was slightly lower but rmse was greatly reduced compared with the assimilation result based on modis lai the assimilation result will be improved by increasing the accuracy of the inverted lai the assimilation result is dependent on the accuracy of the inverted parameters for the regional farmland ecosystem single state variables of either ndvi or lai were used in the assimilation of remote sensing data into a crop model in this study but two variables or multiple variables ndvi lai evapotranspiration soil moisture etc could be used together to combine the advantages of multi source observations ines et al 2013 ma et al 2013 mishra et al 2015 another important issue that needs to be addressed when considering the assimilation of remote sensing data into crop models is improving computational efficiency jin et al 2018b computational efficiency is affected by various factors such as the amount of spatiotemporal data the size of the study area the state variables and the algorithm used for the assimilation the continuous assimilation algorithms of pso and sce ua used in this study were time consuming it took at least 42 02 s to implement an assimilation process on a single pixel using an ordinary computer the spatial resolution of the winter wheat pixel was 250 m and there were 1884 3815 pixels on the loess plateau consequently it would take a relatively long time to apply a crop model assimilated with remote sensing data to all pixels due to the large amount of data therefore in this study hongtong county was selected as a representative case study to implement the assimilation of remote sensing data into a crop model the simulation results of crop models assimilated with remote sensing data using the pso and sce ua algorithms are largely dependent on the reliability of the observed data liu et al 2015 the assimilation result is improved by optimizing the parameters of the crop model which may lack consideration of the uncertainties in both observation data and crop model simulation results this may induce some bias in the simulation results and also may be time consuming errors in the observation data and in the crop model are considered by a sequential data assimilation algorithm such as the ensemble kalman filter enkf which we plan to use in a future study the enkf algorithm can continuously assimilate the observed data and avoid the large number of calculations that the continuous data assimilation algorithms needed huang et al 2016 2019 the calculation efficiency for the crop model assimilated with remote sensing data can be greatly improved with the help of parallel computations and a high performance computer zhao et al 2015 doing so will make full use of the advantages of rapidly obtaining large scale regional data by satellite remote sensing and of the simulation products of crop models 5 conclusion in this study the spatial heterogeneity of regional irrigation data for winter wheat was considered for the loess plateau four assimilation schemes were established for assimilating remote sensing data into the chinaagrosys crop model the assimilation schemes were based on two state variables lai and ndvi and two algorithms pso and sce ua the productivity of winter wheat under different water availability conditions was evaluated by chinaagrosys with and without assimilated remote sensing data the main conclusions of the study were 1 rainfed wheat and wheat that was irrigated once accounted for 60 0 and 30 6 respectively of the wheat area and the remaining wheat area was irrigated two or three times 2 a look up table of lai values was established using inverted data from the prosail radiation transfer model and the r2 between the observed lai at jointing and heading stages and the inverted lai at 250 m spatial resolution was greater than 0 54 from 2010 to 2015 3 the global sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the chinaagrosys crop model showed that yield and lai were mainly influenced by the parameters of c0 c1 and b2 the r2 values between the chinaagrosys simulation results maturity date lai and yield and the observations at 21 agrometeorologcial stations were greater than 0 73 0 44 and 0 60 respectively showing good applicability of chinaagrosys for wheat simulation on the loess plateau 4 in general the accuracy of simulation results was higher when ndvi was used as the assimilation state variable and the calculation efficiency was higher when the pso algorithm was used for the assimilation at both site and regional scales the accuracy of simulation results and spatial heterogeneity for simulated winter wheat yield were improved by assimilating remote sensing data into chinaagrosys based on the regional irrigation data when applying a crop model at a regional scale accounting for spatial heterogeneity of regional irrigation data will improve the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results that are generated by assimilating remote sensing data into the crop model accuracy and computational efficiency of a crop model assimilated with remote sensing

9556,accurate crop modeling at the field level is important for yield prediction and agricultural risk mitigation but is often hindered by the lack of information on field management as well as crop phenology of different cultivars this study aims to develop a data assimilation framework for field level crop modeling without management or crop phenology information for potential remote sensing applications to do this we first present a monte carlo simulation based approach to estimating planting date and quasi calibrated phenological parameters second a simplified fertility stress scheme is developed for the aquacrop model the aim here is not necessarily to improve the aquacrop model but to facilitate ensemble simulation when the field level fertility stress condition is unknown finally in situ soil moisture canopy cover and biomass measurements are assimilated into the model to estimate crop yield with the potential for yield prediction also explored the experiments were performed for a rainfed maize field over 9 growing seasons with each using a different maize cultivar results suggest that the planting dates can be accurately estimated rmse 7 1 days mae 5 4 days and that the simplified fertility stress scheme adequately approximates the biomass and yield estimates from the original aquacrop model under different fertility stress conditions data assimilation improves yield estimation with an rmse of 0 97 mg ha compared to 2 14 mg ha from the no assimilation case yield prediction experiments reveal that the method is able to predict yield within 15 of the observed values

field level crop modeling and yield forecasting using remote sensing data keywords aquacrop data assimilation planting date estimation fertility stress 1 introduction accurate simulation of crop growth is critical to improve field management enhance yield prediction and undertake climate impact assessment boote et al 2013 araya et al 2015 jones et al 2017 many crop models have been developed with different physiological mechanisms levels of complexity and scales of application di paola et al 2016 similar to all numerical modeling approaches crop simulation is susceptible to uncertainties from multiple sources such as the forcing data the model structure and the parameters liu and gupta 2007 ines et al 2013 to improve simulation performance many studies have assimilated measurements relevant to crop growth into crop models data assimilation is a widely used technique in environmental modeling which combines complementary information from observations and model simulations into an optimal estimate reichle 2008 in agricultural data assimilation applications the most frequently assimilated measurements include soil wetness related metrics and crop biophysical variables for example some studies assimilated soil water indices de wit and van diepen 2007 or soil moisture observations directly ines et al 2013 chakrabarti et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 to improve soil water description among biophysical variable assimilation studies various vegetation indices such as leaf area index lai wang et al 2013 chen et al 2018 kang and ozdogan 2019 ziliani et al 2022 fractional canopy cover linker and ioslovich 2017 and other vegetation metrics fang et al 2008 xie et al 2017 have been assimilated to improve foliage development simulation while others have also assimilated biomass observations linker and ioslovich 2017 jin et al 2020 assimilation into coupled hydrological agricultural models pauwels et al 2007 ma et al 2013 li et al 2014 hu et al 2019 and joint assimilation of multiple types of observations pauwels et al 2007 nearing et al 2012 ines et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 has also been reported thorough model calibration is normally required before simulation which can be a data demanding and time consuming task seidel et al 2018 conducted an online survey of crop model calibration practices with results suggesting a median time requirement of 25 days besides the calibration is prone to uncertainties caused by data availability expert knowledge calibration method and even the sequence of parameter calibration palosuo et al 2011 seidel et al 2018 this can become more challenging for regional applications with notable spatial variability in crop phenology introduced when different cultivars are planted to reduce the calibration workload and facilitate regional applications with remote sensing data lu et al 2021b proposed a data assimilation framework for maize simulation with an under calibrated aquacrop model it was assumed that the relative duration of growth stages of different cultivars from the same crop species is similar and thus the phenological parameters may be approximated by uniformly scaling a reference parameter set calibrated under similar environmental conditions to fit the actual canopy growth while this inevitably leads to simulation uncertainties these can be constrained by the assimilation of soil moisture and canopy cover observations the methodology was tested over 6 growing seasons in a rain fed maize field and achieved satisfactory yield estimation accuracy the method can be applied automatically without human intervention and provides potential for pixel level crop modeling with remote sensing data however some key issues need to be addressed to extend the developed methodology to the regional scale remote sensing driven application first field management information such as planting date and plant density play a key role in crop growth nafziger 1994 baum et al 2019 yet these data are often unavailable or are only provided at aggregated regional scales urban et al 2018 for example the national agricultural statistical service nass of the united states department of agriculture usda issues crop progress reports based on weekly survey data but the representative planting date progress and plant density are only provided at the state level some studies have tried to estimate rule based planting dates using temperature precipitation and or evapotranspiration measurements sacks et al 2010 waha et al 2012 dobor et al 2016 but these methods do not perform well in lower latitudes sacks et al 2010 and cannot characterize spatial variability of planting date caused by non climatic factors such as available labor and machinery dobor et al 2016 another category of observation based studies attempted to first detect the green up date i e the earliest reliable evidence of vegetation from reconstructed vegetation index time series urban et al 2018 diao 2020 or from a change in radar backscatter signals phan et al 2018 optical reflectance sadeh et al 2019 or microwave brightness temperature jones et al 2011 and then estimate planting date by assuming the time lag between sowing and the green up date to be constant the estimated green up dates a land surface phenology do not correspond to the actual emergence dates zeng et al 2020 gao and zhang 2021 and expert knowledge is necessary to further generate planting date estimates sadeh et al 2019 further such approaches neglect the strong impact of weather variability such as the timing of rainfall on crop emergence dates marais sicre et al 2016 overall a generic and flexible method is still lacking to estimate the actual planting date at the field level second soil fertility condition can also exhibit strong spatial variability both among and within fields due to factors such as management practices chikowo et al 2014 but is difficult to constrain through the assimilation of soil moisture or canopy cover soil fertility stress has a direct impact on biomass accumulation and yield production van gaelen et al 2015 and is usually calibrated using in situ measurements different from the models that simulate soil fertility impact using nutrient balance approaches van diepen et al 1989 brisson et al 2003 jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 the aquacrop model adopts a semi quantitative approach that characterizes the overall effect on crop growth in the aquacrop model the fertility stress calibration is performed using the following steps 1 run the aquacrop model under no stress conditions to generate a potential biomass production 2 estimate the actual biomass production when the crop growth is only constrained by fertility stress based on literature review or expert knowledge 3 calculate a relative biomass production b rel and 4 use b rel as an input to estimate fertility stress coefficients through a series of parameter adjustment procedures this calibration scheme relies heavily on a good knowledge of the study area and involves complex internal parameter adjustment which can hinder the ensemble simulation of crop growth for areas with heterogeneous fertility stress levels soil fertility stress can potentially be constrained through biomass assimilation but this necessitates a modified fertility impact representation in the model in this study we advance upon the methodology proposed by lu et al 2021b to address the aforementioned issues for remote sensing applications operating under limited information on field management or crop phenology the methodology was augmented by 1 using forcing data from two gridded data sets instead of in situ weather data 2 proposing a monte carlo simulation based method to estimate field level planting date and the corresponding phenological parameters 3 developing a simplified fertility stress simulation scheme to facilitate biomass assimilation and 4 assimilating additional biomass measurements to improve yield estimates the performance of operational yield prediction during the growing season is also explored the objectives of this study were to develop a simple and flexible assimilation framework that enables pixel level crop simulation and yield prediction with minimum requirement for field based data for potential remote sensing applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquacrop model the aquacrop model is a water driven model develop by the food and agriculture organization fao to simulate the growth of key crops worldwide crop growth is simulated using a simple generic module that depicts the water stress impact on canopy development biomass accumulation and yield formation raes et al 2009 the input data required are daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperature and the reference evapotranspiration et 0 in the model simulation the daily crop transpiration is first calculated from et 0 and multiple stress factors and then converted into dry above ground biomass b accumulation using a crop specific water productivity parameter normalized for evaporative demand and co 2 concentration steduto et al 2009 1 b w p t r e t 0 where tr is crop transpiration and wp is the normalized water productivity the yield y is derived as the product of crop dry biomass and the crop specific harvest index hi 2 y b h i a key feature of aquacrop is that it characterizes foliage development by simulating canopy cover fraction instead of the leaf area index lai which is used in many other models steduto et al 2009 crop growth is simulated at a daily time step and both calendar time and thermal time growing degree day gdd can be used in this study an open source version based on the aquacrop v6 0 referred to as aquacrop os hereafter was used foster et al 2017 2 2 study site the csp3 site 41 18 n 96 44 w alt 363 m is located at the university of nebraska lincoln unl eastern nebraska research and extension enrec near mead united states the region features a continental semi arid climate with an annual precipitation of around 680 mm the mean daily maximum temperature is 17 1 c and the mean daily minimum temperature is 4 4 c lu et al 2021a the site is also within the ameriflux network and in situ weather data has been routinely measured since 2001 baldocchi et al 2001 the test field covers an area of 65 4 ha verma et al 2005 and the soils consist mostly of silt loam and silty clay loam foolad et al 2017 maize and soybean are rotationally grown under rain fed conditions and the typical growing season begins in late april or early may and ends in october kalfas et al 2011 for each maize growing season a different maize hybrid cultivar was planted the maize cultivar and management practice information is summarized in table 1 2 3 data 2 3 1 gridded forcing data the weather data including daily precipitation and maximum minimum temperature were derived from the gridded daymet dataset version 3 at 1 km resolution thornton et al 2016 daymet is based on interpolation of in situ weather station observations and also provides vapor pressure shortwave radiation and day length data which were used to calculate et 0 daily wind speed data at 2 m height is also required to calculate et 0 but is not available from daymet the 2 m wind speed data were derived from the 10 m height wind speed extracted from the gridmet dataset at 4 km resolution abatzoglou et al 2014 following a logarithmic wind speed profile et 0 was subsequently calculated with the fao penman monteith fao pm method allen et al 1998 using the daymet and gridmet inputs as well as the latitude and altitude of the study site 2 3 2 in situ observations in situ observations used in this study include the weather and soil moisture measurements from ameriflux as well as the field sampling data of lai and crop biomass the in situ weather data were used to evaluate the performance of the gridded forcing data and the soil moisture canopy and biomass data were assimilated into the model at the ameriflux site hourly soil moisture is routinely measured at 5 depths 10 25 50 100 and 175 cm at 4 profiles within the field using theta probes delta t devices cambridge uk suyker and verma 2008 the hourly measurements were converted to daily values by simple averaging which were subsequently averaged among the 4 profiles to get a daily mean soil moisture at each depth in the field during each growing season lai and crop biomass samples were collected every 10 14 days at 6 intensive measurement zones imzs in the field nguy robertson et al 2015 each imz covers an area of 20 m 20 m which was established for detailed process level studies verma et al 2005 within each imz samples from 4 to 8 plants were collected from a 1 m sampling length the samples were transported on ice to the laboratory and divided into green dead leaves stems and reproductive organs nguy robertson et al 2015 the leaf area was measured using an area meter model li 3100 li cor lincoln ne and the plant parts were dried at 105 c for dry biomass measurement ajaere 2012 as the aquacrop model simulates crop foliage development using the canopy cover fraction the lai samplings were converted to canopy cover fractions using the empirical relationship heng et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 3 c a n o p y c o v e r 1 005 1 e 0 6 l a i 1 2 2 3 3 state level survey data the crop progress reports provided by the usda nass were used to assign a plausible time window for crop planting the crop progress was estimated at state level based on survey data collected weekly from early april to the end of november the surveys include evaluations on the crop progress from over 5000 surveyors based on visual observations across the united states in the report the estimated weekly cumulative progress percentages of maize that are planted emerged silking doughing dented mature and harvested are included in the report seo et al 2019 a state level mean plant population density is also provided by nass the maize progress of planting and the state level mean plant population density from nass for nebraska were used for each growing season respectively 2 4 planting date estimation a monte carlo simulation based method was proposed to estimate the planting date and the crop phenological parameters following lu et al 2021b the relative duration of each growth stage for different cultivars of the same crop is assumed similar hence the crop phenological parameters may be approximated by uniformly scaling a reference phenological parameter set to fit in situ observations under this assumption the aquacrop os model was run for all possible combinations of planting date and phenological scaling factor and the pair that generated a canopy cover simulation that best matched in situ observations was selected as the optimal estimate the phenological parameters calibrated by sandhu and irmak 2019 were used as the reference parameter set the reference parameters were calibrated for the maize hybrid mycogen 2v732 in 2009 in a field about 160 km southwest of our study site the phenological scaling factor was randomly sampled within the range of 0 8 1 2 with an increment of 0 01 after synthesizing scaling factor estimates from lu et al 2021b the year specific maize planting window was determined based on the nass crop progress report for nebraska and local field crop sampling dates for each growing season the start of the planting window was taken as the date when at least 1 of the maize fields in nebraska were planted based on the nass report as the planting progress was only provided at the state level which was often a 2 month window and contained limited information on the local planting dates the field sampling dates were used to narrow down the local planting window the end of the planting window was assumed to be n days before the first field sampling that is maize was assumed to have been planted at least n days before the first field sampling where n is the number of days from planting to emergence based on literature review and a comparison of maize planting and emergence progress from the crop progress reports n was determined to be 12 i e it takes around 12 days from planting to emergence for maize 2 5 fertility stress on biomass accumulation different from other more complex models that simulate the impact of fertility deficiencies using nutrient balance approaches the aquacrop model does not distinguish between different nutrient sources but instead employs an indirect approach by considering the overall effect of fertility stress on canopy development and biomass accumulation vanuytrecht et al 2014 the impact on biomass accumulation is modeled by adjusting wp using a fertility stress coefficient 4 w p a d j i k s w p i w p where ks wp i is the fertility stress coefficient for day i and wp adj i is the adjusted water productivity a ks wp i of 1 means non limiting soil fertility while biomass production is no longer possible when ks wp i reaches the theoretical minimum of 0 ks wp i is assumed to be 1 at emergence and gradually decreases with the depletion of nutrient reservoir as the crop develops ks wp i is simulated as a function of the relative amount of biomass produced b rel and is dependent on local calibration fig 1a to avoid the necessity of local calibration and to facilitate ensemble simulation under varied fertility conditions a new scheme was proposed fig 1b which aims to approximate the biomass simulation from the original scheme using a simplified parameterization the new scheme is based on the original aquacrop approach but assumes that the decrease of ks wp i in the growing season is linear from emergence to crop maturity the advantage of this simplified scheme is two fold first it avoids the requirement of prior knowledge of the expected actual biomass production under only fertility stress and the potential biomass production under non stress condition for the parameter calibration which facilitates applications over large areas where detailed information is often lacking second it enables ensemble simulation under different fertility stress f w p as shown in fig 1b which can provide prior estimates of biomass under a wide range of fertility conditions this could potentially enable the representation of pixel level fertility heterogeneity through data assimilation to distinguish between models using different fertility stress modules the aquacrop os model coupled with the new scheme is referred to as the aquacrop osf model hereafter 2 6 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used to assimilate different types of observations into the aquacrop osf model the enkf is a variant of the kalman filter kalman 1960 based on monte carlo simulation it sequentially synthesizes complementary information from the model simulation the forecast and available observations to generate an optimal estimate the analysis of the model states through a simulation update process evensen 2003 compared to the original kalman filter the enkf is better suited to non linear systems and high dimensional models in the enkf the numerical model is run for a number of realizations with perturbed forcing data and or randomly sampled parameters within a pre defined range to account for uncertainties in the forcing data and or parameters as an observation becomes available each model realization is updated by analyzing the ensemble covariance and the observation error distribution the mean of all updated model realizations is taken as the enkf estimates the evolution of state variables in time can be described by 5 x i t f m x i t 1 f u i t b i t w t where m is the forward model aquacrop osf in this case x i t f is the state vector of the model forecast of the ith realization at time step t u i t is the forcing data b i t is the model parameter vector and w t represents model error the observation is related to the true state by 6 y t hx t v t where y t is the observation x t is the true state h is the observation operator that translates the state variables to the observation and v t is the observation error when an observation is available the enkf updates the state vector of each model realization by 7 x i t a x i t f k t y t hx i t f where x i t a is the state analysis after assimilation k t is the kalman gain which is derived by 8 k t p t f h t hp t f h t r 1 here p t f and r are the covariance of the ensemble model simulation and of the observations respectively when only one observation is available r equals the observation variance in the enkf the model and observation errors are assumed to follow gaussian distribution with zero mean an accurate characterization of the observation errors is key to the enkf performance a constant soil moisture observation error 0 04 m3 m 3 was used based on the evaluation of multi year average soil moisture standard deviation across the 4 soil moisture profiles by contrast the variations of canopy cover and biomass measurements are growth stage dependent for example canopy cover exhibits significant variability in the exponential growth stage and the decay stage while the variability is only marginal near maximum canopy cover lu et al 2021b hence the observation errors of canopy cover and biomass were assumed dynamic and the standard deviations of samplings from the 6 imzs were used for each sampling date separately 2 7 experiment set up nine maize growing seasons were simulated every other year from 2003 to 2019 in which different maize cultivars were planted each year table 1 to address the research questions raised in the introduction several experiments were performed in the following sequence step 1 to evaluate the capacity of the gridded data sets to be used as forcing data daily precipitation cumulative growing degree days gdds and et 0 were calculated and compared with those derived from in situ weather data step 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed simulation based method to estimate field level planting date the approach was applied over the 9 growing seasons using both the gridded and in situ forcing data step 3 to evaluate the utility of the simplified fertility stress scheme to approximate simulations of the original aquacrop model the biomass and yield estimates from the original aquacrop model and the revised aquacrop osf model were compared under different fertility stress conditions step 4 to evaluate the benefit of data assimilation in improving simulation accuracy the aquacrop osf model was run using three strategies 1 the open loop ol ensemble model simulations without data assimilation 2 assimilation of soil moisture and canopy cover data da smcc and 3 assimilation of soil moisture canopy cover and biomass data da smccb the gridded forcing data were used to drive the model and the planting date as well as the corresponding phenological parameters estimated in step 2 were adopted step 5 to evaluate the potential of the proposed methodology for near real time planting date estimation and operational yield forecast during the growing season step 2 was rerun using only observations collected before certain cut off dates within the growing season and the estimates were subsequently used in step 4 to predict the final yield for each growing season the model was initialized on january 1 using the multi year average soil moisture profile to reduce the dependence on accurate prior knowledge of the soil moisture profile the soil hydraulic properties e g field capacity hydraulic conductivity at saturation were generated using a pedotransfer model saxton and rawls 2006 from perturbed soil texture data to account for soil texture variability and to keep the properties consistent following lu et al 2021b the phenological scaling factor was allowed to vary within a 0 05 range around the optimal estimates to account for the parameter uncertainty to mimic the revisit interval and the typical penetration depth of remote sensing soil moisture products only the top layer 10 cm depth soil moisture measurements were assimilated every 3 days as the observations of different variables may be collected on different dates soil moisture canopy cover and biomass measurements were assimilated separately using the enkf with an ensemble size of 200 the key model parameters and the reference phenological parameters are summarized in table 2 2 8 model evaluation the canopy cover and biomass estimates from different simulation strategies were evaluated against field samplings the final yield estimates were evaluated using hand harvested grain yield at the 6 imzs table 1 five statistical metrics were adopted to evaluate the goodness of fit including the pearson correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse the normalized rmse nrmse the bias and the willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1981 the metrics are calculated by 9 r i 1 n s i s o i o i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 11 n r m s e r m s e o 100 12 b i a s 1 n i 1 n s i o i 13 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 where o i stands for the ith observation s i is the corresponding model estimate n is the number of observations available σ s and σ o are the standard deviations of model simulations and observations and s and o are the mean of model simulations and observations respectively the selected metrics were used to assess the goodness of fit from different aspects in which r depicts the linear correlation between the model estimates and observations the rmse and nrmse illustrate the absolute and relative magnitude of the difference between simulation and observation the bias refers to the tendency of overestimation or underestimation and d represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement 3 results 3 1 gridded forcing data evaluation the daily precipitation gdd and et 0 calculated based on the gridded weather data are evaluated against those from in situ weather data during the growing seasons in fig 2 growing season precipitation demonstrates strong variability across years ranging from around 300 mm to over 600 mm overall the magnitude and timing of precipitation events based on the gridded weather data agree well with in situ measurements while the gridded data tend to overestimate precipitation at the study site the growing season total precipitation difference is smaller than 70 mm in most years but is greater than 100 mm in 2007 2009 and 2015 the gdds estimated from both datasets are similar in all growing seasons the gridded data slightly overestimate gdd but the difference is very small the daily et 0 calculated from both datasets are also consistent with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 75 and a mean rmse of 1 17 mm day overall the gridded data agree well with in situ measurements at the study site which supports the use of gridded data as inputs to the aquacrop model 3 2 planting date estimates the planting dates were estimated using the gridded and in situ forcing data with the proposed method respectively to quantify the goodness of fit between the monte carlo simulation of canopy cover development and in situ observations multiple statistical metrics were used to determine the optimal planting date estimates including the pearson correlation coefficient the rmse the unbiased rmse and the kling gupta efficiency kge evaluations suggest that using the unbiased rmse metrics leads to the best planting date estimates shown in fig 3 the estimated planting windows successfully capture the plausible local planting periods for all growing seasons the planting windows show strong inter annual variability with the window width varying between 19 days and 43 days the proposed method perform well using both the gridded and the in situ forcing data and the estimates are consistent and comparable when the gridded forcing data are used the planting date estimation difference is less than 5 days for 5 growing seasons but can reach as large as 15 days in 2003 the overall estimation rmse is 7 1 days and the mean absolute error mae is 5 4 days 3 3 performance of the simplified fertility stress scheme on wp to evaluate the performance of the simplified fertility stress scheme to approximate the biomass and yield simulation from the original aquacrop model the biomass and yield estimates from the aquacrop osf model were compared to those from the aquacrop v6 1 software version under different fertility stress conditions the fertility stress was represented by different b rel variables ranging from 20 to 90 with an increment of 10 the experiments were performed for maize simulation using the aquacrop tutorial data from davis california 1996 for each experiment the aquacrop v6 1 software was first used to simulate biomass and yield for a given b rel and the aquacrop osf model was run using different fertility stress coefficients f w p in fig 1b to find the best approximation of the original aquacrop model outputs the results are shown in fig 4 when crops are not fertility stressed estimates from both methods are the same by definition when the fertility stress is low b rel 70 the estimation difference is small throughout the growing season when the fertility stress is moderate 40 b rel 60 the biomass simulation difference is more evident during the exponential vegetative growth stage at the initial growth stage the transpiration is low and the fertility stress reduction on wp is small hence the impact on biomass accumulation is limited during senescence the fertility stress is relatively high in both schemes leading to a much reduced biomass production rate and hence a small difference in biomass accumulation for high fertility stress conditions b rel 30 the estimation difference is always small as a result of the severely reduced wp in both schemes overall the impact of the simplified fertility stress scheme on wp is limited under diverse conditions with a maximum biomass estimation nrmse of less than 9 the impact on the crop yield is marginal under all conditions with a maximum estimation nrmse of 3 67 the evaluation demonstrates that the simplified fertility stress scheme is capable of approximating the original aquacrop simulations with limited influence on the biomass and yield estimates 3 4 canopy cover estimates based on the assessment of the accuracy of the gridded forcing data and the performance of the simplified fertility stress scheme the aquacrop osf model was used to simulate maize growth over the 9 growing seasons the planting dates estimated in fig 3a and the corresponding phenological scaling factors were used as inputs and the key parameter values ranges summarized in table 2 were used for ensemble generation the canopy cover estimates from ol da smcc and da smccb are compared against in situ observations in fig 5 and the statistical metrics are summarized in table 3 results show that the ol estimates successfully capture the canopy cover dynamics during the growing season which verifies the validity of the estimated planting dates and the corresponding phenological parameters in simulating maize growth for different cultivars the ol simulates canopy growth rate well in most growing seasons but underestimates maximum canopy cover in a few growing seasons e g 2005 and 2009 this may relate to factors such as the soil moisture simulation uncertainty or the unique stress resistance features of different cultivars as the model was not thoroughly calibrated for each cultivar separately when soil moisture and canopy cover observations are assimilated the simulations are significantly improved in all growing seasons which can be seen from the narrower ensemble spreads and the statistical metrics since the biomass accumulation process does not affect canopy cover growth estimates from da smcc and da smccb are mostly comparable 3 5 biomass estimates the biomass evaluations are shown in fig 6 and table 4 the upper and lower boundaries of the patched areas demonstrate the biomass simulations under no fertility stress and extreme fertility stress conditions respectively the ol estimates agree well with observations in some growing seasons when the fertility stress is around average e g 2003 2005 2007 2011 2017 but the performance deteriorates in growing seasons when the fertility stress on biomass production is low e g 2009 2013 or high e g 2015 2019 da smcc improves biomass estimates in most growing seasons particularly in 2009 as a result of the improved characterization of canopy growth dynamics lu et al 2021b when additional biomass observations are assimilated da smccb effectively improved biomass estimates with the estimation nrmse less than 10 in all growing seasons 3 6 yield estimates the evaluations of yield estimates from ol da smcc and da smccb are shown in fig 7 the ol underestimates yield in 2009 and 2013 and overestimates yield in 2019 which is consistent with ol simulations of biomass when soil moisture and canopy cover are assimilated yield estimates are improved in most growing seasons particularly in 2009 the correlation coefficient increases from 0 471 for ol to 0 622 for da smcc and the rmse reduces from 2 14 mg ha for ol to 1 62 mg ha for da smcc da smccb outperforms both ol and da smcc as a result of the direct update ability on biomass simulation when additional biomass estimates are assimilated the correlation coefficient further increases to 0 825 and the rmse reduces to 0 97 mg ha and the bias is also significantly reduced to 0 18 mg ha 3 7 planting date estimation during the growing season the planting date estimation and yield simulation in the above sections were performed in a retrospective manner at the end of the growing season when all observations were available another important topic is to estimate planting dates in the middle of the growing season using observations from early growth stages in order to predict the final yield hence experiments were conducted to estimate the planting dates using only canopy cover observations before several cut off dates for example for a cut off date of july 31 only observations collected before july 31 were used and the other observations collected after this date were assumed unavailable the results are shown in fig 8 as expected the estimation accuracy improves gradually with late cut off dates i e the more observations used the better the estimates but the improvement is moderate when more observations are used when a cut off date of june 30 is used around 2 months after planting the estimation rmse could still reach 7 9 days mae 6 1 days which is slightly worse compared with that using a cut off date of late september rmse 7 1 days mae 5 4 days this may relate to the importance of an accurate depiction of the exponential vegetative growth stage in the determination of planting dates the results suggest that planting dates can be estimated with good accuracy using only early stage observations which lays a good foundation for subsequent crop modeling and yield prediction it is worth noting that despite the comparable planting date estimates the phenological scaling factors estimated using early stage and all season observations can differ since the early stage observations are incapable of characterizing the canopy senescence which is crucial for scaling the total length of the growing season 3 8 operational yield forecast an operational yield forecast simulation was performed using da smccb fig 9 for different cut off dates the corresponding planting date and phenological scaling factor estimated in section 3 7 were used and only observations collected before the cut off date were assimilated into the aquacrop osf model results suggest that the yield prediction accuracy improves with late cut off dates i e more observations lead to improved estimates the estimation nrmse is larger than 25 for a cut off date of june 30 which quickly reduces to less than 18 for a cut off date of july 15 on june 30 maize is at the vegetative growth stage in all growing seasons fig 5 and the canopy cover observations contain little information on the time required to reach maximum canopy cover which is important for the estimation of crop phenology as a result the crop phenology uncertainty leads to large errors in the yield prediction by contrast maize has reached maximum canopy cover by july 15 which leads to an improved characterization of the crop growth cycle consequently an evident improvement in yield estimation is observed from july 15 to august 31 the canopy cover is at the plateau stage in most growing seasons fig 5 hence more canopy cover observations do not provide much additional constraint on crop phenology determination and the improvement in yield prediction is mostly attributed to biomass assimilation in late september maize is at the end of senescence hence the crop phenology can be well depicted and the constraint by observations on the model simulation is also the strongest as a consequence the best yield estimates are obtained by late september as maize is mostly harvested between mid october and mid november table 1 the method is able to predict yield within an nrmse of 20 by mid july 3 5 months before harvest and within an nrmse of 15 by late july 3 months before harvest it is worth noting that these predictions are made without thorough model calibration or any prior knowledge of planting date plant density crop phenology or fertility stress which has potential for applications in other data sparse regions 4 discussion 4 1 impact of planting date estimates planting dates have a large impact on crop growth and yield production since they determine what environmental conditions the crops will experience during different growth stages flohr et al 2017 previous studies in the corn belt in the united states using field trial or crop modeling suggested an optimal planting window from late april to early may nafziger 1994 lauer et al 1999 baum et al 2019 2020 when maize is planted during the optimal planting window the impact on the final yield is typically less than 5 baum et al 2019 among the 9 growing seasons the actual as well as estimated planting mostly occurred within this optimal window consequently the impact of planting date estimates on the yield simulation should be limited the estimation accuracy using the proposed simulation based method is comparable with or better than the traditional rule based and observation based methods at field level for example a global study using the rule based method suggested that the estimation difference was less than 1 month for over 60 of the cultivated area waha et al 2012 this is understandable since the rule based methods are often used to generate a representative average planting date for a large area to maximize the yield or to give planting date input to crop models dobor et al 2016 which do not account for non climatic factors at field level some observation based studies reported similar or better estimates for example urban et al 2018 estimated planting date with an rmse 10 days using the enhanced vegetation index evi and the solar induced fluorescence sif data at county level and sadeh et al 2019 reported an rmse 2 days using the high resolution cubesat data for australian no tillage fields these studies were performed either at aggregated scales or over fields with unique management e g no tillage which reduces the applicability of the methods at field level by contrast the proposed method is not limited to certain crops models or field types and can be applied over other fields with different crop types for field level planting date estimation in this study the canopy cover observations were only available every 10 14 days given that remote sensing techniques have enabled high resolution and high frequency crop monitoring e g 10 m 5 day data from sentinel 2 and 3 m daily from planetscope the estimation accuracy may be further improved overall the proposed method can serve as a useful alternative for field level planting date estimation 4 2 impact of the simplified fertility stress simulation stress caused by low soil fertility nutrient deficiencies is often simulated using nutrient balance modules in process based crop models in contrast the aquacrop model adopts a semi quantitative approach that addresses the aggregated effects on canopy development and biomass accumulation to keep its relatively simple structure steduto et al 2009 this indirect approach still calls for local calibration and the user needs to have prior knowledge of the total biomass from stress free and low fertility treatments for calibration vanuytrecht et al 2014 in general the fertility stress is lowest at the beginning of the growing season when the nutrients are abundant and the requirements from the seedlings are low as the plant grows and biomass accumulates the requirements increase and nutrients deplete causing increasing fertility stress given this the aquacrop os model was coupled with a simplified fertility stress scheme which assumes a linear decrease of the fertility stress coefficient on wp from emergence to maturity it is worth noting that the aim was not to improve or further develop the aquacrop model but rather to provide a workaround to facilitate ensemble simulation with unknown fertility conditions at the field level this inevitably leads to biomass simulation difference with the original aquacrop model which is most evident under moderate fertility stress conditions and during the vegetative growth stage fig 4 the simplified scheme typically gives lower biomass production rate during the vegetative growth stage and higher biomass production rate towards the end of the growing season as a result of the different assumptions of the fertility stress coefficient dynamics as shown in fig 4 there exists an aquacrop osf simulation which could give a good approximation of the original aquacrop simulation of biomass under different fertility stress conditions the impact of the simplified scheme on biomass production is limited under all fertility conditions and the impact on crop yield is marginal it should be mentioned that the original aquacrop model also calibrates fertility stress impact on the maximum canopy cover the canopy growth coefficient and the decline of canopy cover once the maximum canopy cover is reached raes et al 2012 which are not explicitly addressed in the simplified scheme instead the impact on the maximum canopy cover and the canopy growth coefficient can be partly accounted for through the ensemble simulation which generates model estimates based on parameter combinations randomly generated within pre defined ranges when canopy cover observations are assimilated the uncertainties from all these aspects can be effectively constrained fig 5 4 3 respective contribution of different observations three types of observations were assimilated into the aquacrop osf model namely soil moisture canopy cover and biomass observations the added value of assimilating soil moisture and canopy cover separately was evaluated by lu et al 2021b both the soil hydrologic processes and canopy growth have an impact on the biomass and yield production under dry conditions soil moisture is the major limiting factor on crop growth and the water stress coefficient on canopy expansion is more sensitive to soil moisture variations compared to under wet conditions raes et al 2012 as a result the improvement from assimilating soil moisture data on biomass and yield estimation is more evident under wet conditions soil moisture is no longer a strong constraint on crop growth consequently assimilating canopy cover data to better characterize crop transpiration gives better results the joint assimilation of soil moisture and canopy cover outperforms single variable assimilation lu et al 2021b but cannot account for the uncertainty in soil fertility stress compared to soil moisture and canopy cover biomass is more closely linked to crop yield which provides a direct constraint on uncertainties caused by factors such as soil fertility conditions though only infrequently sampled every 10 14 days during the growing season additional biomass assimilation still led to evident improvement in yield estimation fig 7 biomass observations at early stages were also shown to improve yield forecast fig 9 since the assimilation corrects for accumulated biomass errors at the time of observation which provides a more accurate basis for biomass accumulation in the forecast period 4 4 potential for fine scale regional applications the methodology developed in this study mimicked a real application with remote sensing data and provided potential for crop modeling and forecasting at fine scale over data sparse regions the gridded forcing data derived from the daymet and gridmet data sets proved to be consistent and comparable with in situ forcing data and led to comparable planting date estimates for regions not covered by daymet and gridmet other observation or reanalysis based data sets may be used such as the mswep precipitation beck et al 2019 the gldas rodell et al 2004 the pgf sheffield et al 2006 the merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 and the era5 hersbach et al 2020 data sets forcing data from these sources are generally provided at coarser resolution 10 60 km which may not accurately characterize climate variability within the grid cell the impact on crop modeling however is expected to be limited when fine scale remote sensing observations are assimilated to update the model states precision agriculture applications usually benefit from soil moisture data at a spatial resolution finer than 1 km peng et al 2021 soil moisture measurements are available at 1 km resolution from synthetic aperture radar sar detection paloscia et al 2013 merging of multiple microwave data sources bauer marschallinger et al 2018 das et al 2019 or spatial downscaling of microwave based retrievals merlin et al 2012 portal et al 2018 abbaszadeh et al 2019 even finer resolution soil moisture data have also been derived by the synergistic use of different data sources escorihuela et al 2018 ma et al 2020 recently vergopolan et al 2020 combined remotely sensed soil brightness temperature information with a land surface model based on hydrologic response units hrus to derive 30 m soil moisture through data merging at such scales the soil moisture variability mainly comes from topographic features and soil texture crow et al 2012 unlike grid based models the hru based models cluster the spatial domain with similar hydrologic behaviors into different hrus which effectively reveals the fine scale soil moisture variability and at the same time reduces the computational demand this provides a potentially useful data source for fine scale soil moisture here soil moisture data were assimilated every 3 days to be consistent with the majority of remote sensing products but the improvement in crop modeling is still expected when soil moisture data are available at longer time intervals lu et al 2021b canopy cover data can be derived from empirical relations with different vegetation indices based on satellite measurements in the optical and near infrared bands in particular the 30 m landsat data irons et al 2012 the 10 m sentinel 2 data drusch et al 2012 and the 3 m planetscope data mccabe et al 2017 roy et al 2021 have been extensively used in agricultural applications some studies have also developed fusion algorithms for multiple data sources to generate gap free or spectrally consistent data products luo et al 2018 houborg and mccabe 2018 sadeh et al 2021 this enables potential planting date estimation at pixel level using the proposed method since the planting date is normally agricultural parcel specific the canopy cover data may be used to generate a parcel average canopy cover time series for more robust planting date estimation if the crop parcel boundary data are available remote sensing biomass products are less common but some examples include the dry matter productivity dmp data provided by the copernicus land service swinnen et al 2015 biomass data can be estimated using empirical models from vegetation indices han et al 2019 or sar data pichierri et al 2018 or calculated from variables related to light use efficiency such as net primary productivity npp yan and wu 2014 and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar moriondo et al 2007 the method can also be applied in a flexible manner for example if the phenological parameters of certain cultivars are known a priori the planting dates can be estimated using fixed phenological parameters if the fertility stress is relatively uniform over the study area the method can be implemented using narrower fertility stress ranges or fixed stress based on literature review or expert knowledge and only assimilate soil moisture and canopy cover data the results from the yield forecast simulation experiment also demonstrate potential to operationally predict the final yield during the growing season though the prediction accuracy using only early stage observations is lower the method is able to predict the final yield with an nrmse 15 three months before harvest the lead time and prediction accuracy are consistent with previous studies peng et al 2018 kang et al 2020 lu et al 2021b it is worth noting that this predictive ability is achieved without thorough calibration or prior knowledge of crop phenology or field management practices e g planting date plant density fertility condition this suggests that the method can be coupled with weather forecast data to operationally simulate crop growth at fine scale and assimilate observations as they become available to provide dynamic yield forecast during the growing season 4 5 transferability of the method here the test site is within the american corn belt which is historically a high yield region and features largely constant harvest index hi however hi values of tropical maize hybrids are generally 0 1 0 15 lower than those of temperate hybrids lorenz et al 2010 trachsel et al 2016 moreover hi is known to vary with environmental factors and management practices such as extreme temperature rainfall droughts floods and plant density sharma et al 1987 prihar and stewart 1990 unkovich et al 2010 huetsch and schubert 2017 causing large hi spatial variability in certain areas under such conditions the parameter ranges used in this study may not be valid expert knowledge and location relevant literature should be used to predefine reasonable parameter ranges as well as their variability under the local environment doing so will ensure that the ensemble simulation does not produce apparent bias which may skew the data assimilation implementation 5 conclusion field based information such as planting date plant density soil fertility condition and crop phenological parameters are generally required for effective field level crop modeling however such information is not routinely available at fine spatial and temporal scales this study builds upon previous research and further advances a data assimilation framework for maize simulation without the need for field based data support a monte carlo simulation based method was first proposed to estimate planting date and the quasi calibrated phenological parameters the original fertility stress scheme in the aquacrop model was then simplified to facilitate ensemble simulation under different fertility stress conditions the in situ soil moisture canopy cover and biomass measurements were subsequently assimilated into the modified aquacrop model to estimate maize yield and the potential for yield prediction was evaluated the results suggest that the proposed approach estimates planting date well using gridded forcing data the estimated rmse is 7 1 days and the mae is 5 4 days the simplified fertility stress scheme is able to deliver a good approximate of the biomass and yield simulation from the original aquacrop model under different fertility stress conditions when soil moisture and canopy cover data are assimilated the yield estimation is improved with an rmse of 1 62 mg ha compared to 2 14 mg ha from the no assimilation case when additional biomass data are assimilated the rmse is further reduced to 0 97 mg ha yield prediction experiments suggest that the method is able to predict the final yield during the growing season the yield can be predicted with a normalized rmse 15 around 3 months prior to harvest and the prediction improves as more observations become available the proposed methodology does not rely on field based data support suggesting that the assimilated observations can potentially be retrieved from remote sensing which illustrates the potential for field level crop modeling and yield forecasting at the regional scale

9556,accurate crop modeling at the field level is important for yield prediction and agricultural risk mitigation but is often hindered by the lack of information on field management as well as crop phenology of different cultivars this study aims to develop a data assimilation framework for field level crop modeling without management or crop phenology information for potential remote sensing applications to do this we first present a monte carlo simulation based approach to estimating planting date and quasi calibrated phenological parameters second a simplified fertility stress scheme is developed for the aquacrop model the aim here is not necessarily to improve the aquacrop model but to facilitate ensemble simulation when the field level fertility stress condition is unknown finally in situ soil moisture canopy cover and biomass measurements are assimilated into the model to estimate crop yield with the potential for yield prediction also explored the experiments were performed for a rainfed maize field over 9 growing seasons with each using a different maize cultivar results suggest that the planting dates can be accurately estimated rmse 7 1 days mae 5 4 days and that the simplified fertility stress scheme adequately approximates the biomass and yield estimates from the original aquacrop model under different fertility stress conditions data assimilation improves yield estimation with an rmse of 0 97 mg ha compared to 2 14 mg ha from the no assimilation case yield prediction experiments reveal that the method is able to predict yield within 15 of the observed values up to 3 months before harvest the proposed methodology does not rely on field based information e g planting date plant density crop phenology fertility condition and illustrates the potential for field level crop modeling and yield forecasting using remote sensing data keywords aquacrop data assimilation planting date estimation fertility stress 1 introduction accurate simulation of crop growth is critical to improve field management enhance yield prediction and undertake climate impact assessment boote et al 2013 araya et al 2015 jones et al 2017 many crop models have been developed with different physiological mechanisms levels of complexity and scales of application di paola et al 2016 similar to all numerical modeling approaches crop simulation is susceptible to uncertainties from multiple sources such as the forcing data the model structure and the parameters liu and gupta 2007 ines et al 2013 to improve simulation performance many studies have assimilated measurements relevant to crop growth into crop models data assimilation is a widely used technique in environmental modeling which combines complementary information from observations and model simulations into an optimal estimate reichle 2008 in agricultural data assimilation applications the most frequently assimilated measurements include soil wetness related metrics and crop biophysical variables for example some studies assimilated soil water indices de wit and van diepen 2007 or soil moisture observations directly ines et al 2013 chakrabarti et al 2014 zhang et al 2020 to improve soil water description among biophysical variable assimilation studies various vegetation indices such as leaf area index lai wang et al 2013 chen et al 2018 kang and ozdogan 2019 ziliani et al 2022 fractional canopy cover linker and ioslovich 2017 and other vegetation metrics fang et al 2008 xie et al 2017 have been assimilated to improve foliage development simulation while others have also assimilated biomass observations linker and ioslovich 2017 jin et al 2020 assimilation into coupled hydrological agricultural models pauwels et al 2007 ma et al 2013 li et al 2014 hu et al 2019 and joint assimilation of multiple types of observations pauwels et al 2007 nearing et al 2012 ines et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 has also been reported thorough model calibration is normally required before simulation which can be a data demanding and time consuming task seidel et al 2018 conducted an online survey of crop model calibration practices with results suggesting a median time requirement of 25 days besides the calibration is prone to uncertainties caused by data availability expert knowledge calibration method and even the sequence of parameter calibration palosuo et al 2011 seidel et al 2018 this can become more challenging for regional applications with notable spatial variability in crop phenology introduced when different cultivars are planted to reduce the calibration workload and facilitate regional applications with remote sensing data lu et al 2021b proposed a data assimilation framework for maize simulation with an under calibrated aquacrop model it was assumed that the relative duration of growth stages of different cultivars from the same crop species is similar and thus the phenological parameters may be approximated by uniformly scaling a reference parameter set calibrated under similar environmental conditions to fit the actual canopy growth while this inevitably leads to simulation uncertainties these can be constrained by the assimilation of soil moisture and canopy cover observations the methodology was tested over 6 growing seasons in a rain fed maize field and achieved satisfactory yield estimation accuracy the method can be applied automatically without human intervention and provides potential for pixel level crop modeling with remote sensing data however some key issues need to be addressed to extend the developed methodology to the regional scale remote sensing driven application first field management information such as planting date and plant density play a key role in crop growth nafziger 1994 baum et al 2019 yet these data are often unavailable or are only provided at aggregated regional scales urban et al 2018 for example the national agricultural statistical service nass of the united states department of agriculture usda issues crop progress reports based on weekly survey data but the representative planting date progress and plant density are only provided at the state level some studies have tried to estimate rule based planting dates using temperature precipitation and or evapotranspiration measurements sacks et al 2010 waha et al 2012 dobor et al 2016 but these methods do not perform well in lower latitudes sacks et al 2010 and cannot characterize spatial variability of planting date caused by non climatic factors such as available labor and machinery dobor et al 2016 another category of observation based studies attempted to first detect the green up date i e the earliest reliable evidence of vegetation from reconstructed vegetation index time series urban et al 2018 diao 2020 or from a change in radar backscatter signals phan et al 2018 optical reflectance sadeh et al 2019 or microwave brightness temperature jones et al 2011 and then estimate planting date by assuming the time lag between sowing and the green up date to be constant the estimated green up dates a land surface phenology do not correspond to the actual emergence dates zeng et al 2020 gao and zhang 2021 and expert knowledge is necessary to further generate planting date estimates sadeh et al 2019 further such approaches neglect the strong impact of weather variability such as the timing of rainfall on crop emergence dates marais sicre et al 2016 overall a generic and flexible method is still lacking to estimate the actual planting date at the field level second soil fertility condition can also exhibit strong spatial variability both among and within fields due to factors such as management practices chikowo et al 2014 but is difficult to constrain through the assimilation of soil moisture or canopy cover soil fertility stress has a direct impact on biomass accumulation and yield production van gaelen et al 2015 and is usually calibrated using in situ measurements different from the models that simulate soil fertility impact using nutrient balance approaches van diepen et al 1989 brisson et al 2003 jones et al 2003 keating et al 2003 the aquacrop model adopts a semi quantitative approach that characterizes the overall effect on crop growth in the aquacrop model the fertility stress calibration is performed using the following steps 1 run the aquacrop model under no stress conditions to generate a potential biomass production 2 estimate the actual biomass production when the crop growth is only constrained by fertility stress based on literature review or expert knowledge 3 calculate a relative biomass production b rel and 4 use b rel as an input to estimate fertility stress coefficients through a series of parameter adjustment procedures this calibration scheme relies heavily on a good knowledge of the study area and involves complex internal parameter adjustment which can hinder the ensemble simulation of crop growth for areas with heterogeneous fertility stress levels soil fertility stress can potentially be constrained through biomass assimilation but this necessitates a modified fertility impact representation in the model in this study we advance upon the methodology proposed by lu et al 2021b to address the aforementioned issues for remote sensing applications operating under limited information on field management or crop phenology the methodology was augmented by 1 using forcing data from two gridded data sets instead of in situ weather data 2 proposing a monte carlo simulation based method to estimate field level planting date and the corresponding phenological parameters 3 developing a simplified fertility stress simulation scheme to facilitate biomass assimilation and 4 assimilating additional biomass measurements to improve yield estimates the performance of operational yield prediction during the growing season is also explored the objectives of this study were to develop a simple and flexible assimilation framework that enables pixel level crop simulation and yield prediction with minimum requirement for field based data for potential remote sensing applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquacrop model the aquacrop model is a water driven model develop by the food and agriculture organization fao to simulate the growth of key crops worldwide crop growth is simulated using a simple generic module that depicts the water stress impact on canopy development biomass accumulation and yield formation raes et al 2009 the input data required are daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum

2021a the site is also within the ameriflux network and in situ weather data has been routinely measured since 2001 baldocchi et al 2001 the test field covers an area of 65 4 ha verma et al 2005 and the soils consist mostly of silt loam and silty clay loam foolad et al 2017 maize and soybean are rotationally grown under rain fed conditions and the typical growing season begins in late april or early may and ends in october kalfas et al 2011 for each maize growing season a different maize hybrid cultivar was planted the maize cultivar and management practice information is summarized in table 1 2 3 data 2 3 1 gridded forcing data the weather data including daily precipitation and maximum minimum temperature were derived from the gridded daymet dataset version 3 at 1 km resolution thornton et al 2016 daymet is based on interpolation of in situ weather station observations and also provides vapor pressure shortwave radiation and day length data which were used to calculate et 0 daily wind speed data at 2 m height is also required to calculate et 0 but is not available from daymet the 2 m wind speed data were derived from the 10 m height wind speed extracted from the gridmet dataset at 4 km resolution abatzoglou et al 2014 following a logarithmic wind speed profile et 0 was subsequently calculated with the fao penman monteith fao pm method allen et al 1998 using the daymet and gridmet inputs as well as the latitude and altitude of the study site 2 3 2 in situ observations in situ observations used in this study include the weather and soil moisture measurements from ameriflux as well as the field sampling data of lai and crop biomass the in situ weather data were used to evaluate the performance of the gridded forcing data and the soil moisture canopy and

crop progress reports provided by the usda nass were used to assign a plausible time window for crop planting the crop progress was estimated at state level based on survey data collected weekly from early april to the end of november the surveys include evaluations on the crop progress from over 5000 surveyors based on visual observations across the united states in the report the estimated weekly cumulative progress percentages of maize that are planted emerged silking doughing dented mature and harvested are included in the report seo et al 2019 a state level mean plant population density is also provided by nass the maize progress of planting and the state level mean plant population density from nass for nebraska were used for each growing season respectively 2 4 planting date estimation a monte carlo simulation based method was proposed to estimate the planting date and the crop phenological parameters following lu et al 2021b the relative duration of each growth stage for different cultivars of the same crop is assumed similar hence the crop phenological parameters may be approximated by uniformly scaling a reference phenological parameter set to fit in situ observations under this assumption the aquacrop os model was run for all possible combinations of planting date and phenological scaling factor and the pair that generated a canopy cover simulation that best matched in situ observations was selected as the optimal estimate the phenological parameters calibrated by sandhu and irmak 2019 were used as the reference parameter set the reference parameters were calibrated for the maize hybrid mycogen 2v732 in 2009 in a field about 160 km southwest of our study site the phenological scaling factor was randomly sampled within the range of 0 8 1 2 with an increment of 0 01 after synthesizing scaling factor estimates from lu et al 2021b the year specific maize planting window was determined based on the nass crop progress report for nebraska and local field crop sampling dates for each growing season the start of the planting window was taken as the date when at least 1 of the maize fields in nebraska were planted based on the nass report as the planting progress was only provided at the state level which was often a 2 month window and contained limited information on the local planting dates the field sampling dates were used to narrow down the local planting window the end of the planting window was assumed to be n days before the first field sampling that is maize was assumed to have been planted at least n days before the first field sampling where n is the number of days from planting to emergence based on literature review and a comparison of maize planting and emergence progress from the crop progress reports n was determined to be 12 i e it takes around 12 days from planting to emergence for maize 2 5 fertility stress on biomass accumulation different from other more complex models that simulate the impact of fertility deficiencies using nutrient balance approaches the aquacrop model does not distinguish between different nutrient sources but instead employs an indirect approach by considering the overall effect of fertility stress on canopy development and biomass accumulation vanuytrecht et al 2014 the impact on biomass accumulation is modeled by adjusting wp using a fertility stress coefficient 4 w p a d j i k s w p i w p where ks wp i is the fertility stress coefficient for day i and wp adj i is the adjusted water productivity a ks wp i of 1 means non limiting soil fertility while biomass production is no longer possible when ks wp i reaches the theoretical minimum of 0 ks wp i is assumed to be 1 at emergence and gradually decreases with the depletion of nutrient reservoir as the crop develops ks wp i is simulated as a function of the relative amount of biomass produced b rel and is dependent on local calibration fig 1a to avoid the necessity of local calibration and to facilitate ensemble simulation under varied fertility conditions a new scheme was proposed fig 1b which aims to approximate the biomass simulation from the original scheme using a simplified parameterization the new scheme is based on the original aquacrop approach but assumes that the decrease of ks wp i in the growing season is linear from emergence to crop maturity the advantage of this simplified scheme is two fold first it avoids the requirement of prior knowledge of the expected actual biomass production under only fertility stress and the potential biomass production under non stress condition for the parameter calibration which facilitates applications over large areas where detailed information is often lacking second it enables ensemble simulation under different fertility stress f w p as shown in fig 1b which can provide prior estimates of biomass under a wide range of fertility conditions this could potentially enable the representation of pixel level fertility heterogeneity through data assimilation to distinguish between models using different fertility stress modules the aquacrop os model coupled with the new scheme is referred to as the aquacrop osf model hereafter 2 6 ensemble kalman filter the ensemble kalman filter enkf was used to assimilate different types of observations into the aquacrop osf model the enkf is a variant of the kalman filter kalman 1960 based on monte carlo simulation it sequentially synthesizes complementary information from the model simulation the forecast and available observations to generate an optimal estimate the analysis of the model states through a simulation update process evensen 2003 compared to the original kalman filter the enkf is better suited to non linear systems and high dimensional models in the enkf the numerical model is run for a number of realizations with perturbed forcing data and or randomly sampled parameters within a pre defined range to account for uncertainties in the forcing data and or parameters as an observation becomes available each model realization is updated by analyzing the ensemble covariance and the observation error distribution the mean of all updated model realizations is taken as the enkf estimates the evolution of state variables in time can be described by 5 x i t f m x i t 1 f u i t b i t w t where m is the forward model aquacrop osf in this case x i t f is the state vector of the model forecast of the ith realization at time step t u i t is the forcing data b i t is the model parameter vector and w t represents model error the observation is related to the true state by 6 y t hx t v t where y t is the observation x t is the true state h is the observation operator that translates the state variables to the observation and v t is the observation error when an observation is available the enkf updates the state vector of each model realization by 7 x i t a x i t f k t y t hx i t f where x i t a is the state analysis after assimilation k t is the kalman gain which is derived by 8 k t p t f h t hp t f h t r 1 here p t f and r are the covariance of the ensemble model simulation and of the observations respectively when only one observation is available r equals the observation variance in the enkf the model and observation errors are assumed to follow gaussian distribution with zero mean an accurate characterization of the observation errors is key to the enkf performance a constant soil moisture observation error 0 04 m3 m 3 was used based on the evaluation of multi year average soil moisture standard deviation across the 4 soil moisture profiles by contrast the variations of canopy cover and biomass measurements are growth stage dependent for example canopy cover exhibits significant variability in the exponential growth stage and the decay stage while the variability is only marginal near maximum canopy cover lu et al 2021b hence the observation errors of canopy cover and biomass were assumed dynamic and the standard deviations of samplings from the 6 imzs were used for each sampling date separately 2 7 experiment set up nine maize growing seasons were simulated every other year from 2003 to 2019 in which different maize cultivars were planted each year table 1 to address the research questions raised in the introduction several experiments were performed in the following sequence step 1 to evaluate the capacity of the gridded data sets to be used as forcing data daily precipitation cumulative growing degree days gdds and et 0 were calculated and compared with those derived from in situ weather data step 2 to evaluate the performance of the proposed simulation based method to estimate field level planting date the approach was applied over the 9 growing seasons using both the gridded and in situ forcing data step 3 to evaluate the utility of the simplified fertility stress scheme to approximate simulations of the original aquacrop model the biomass and yield estimates from the original aquacrop model and the revised aquacrop osf model were compared under different fertility stress conditions step 4 to evaluate the benefit of data assimilation in improving simulation accuracy the aquacrop osf model was run using three strategies 1 the open loop ol ensemble model simulations without data assimilation 2 assimilation of soil moisture and canopy cover data da smcc and 3 assimilation of soil moisture canopy cover and biomass data da smccb the gridded forcing data were used to drive the model and the planting date as well as the corresponding phenological parameters estimated in step 2 were adopted step 5 to evaluate the potential of the proposed methodology for near real time planting date estimation and operational yield forecast during the growing season step 2 was rerun using only observations collected before certain cut off dates within the growing season and the estimates were subsequently used in step 4 to predict the final yield for each growing season the model was initialized on january 1 using the multi year average soil moisture profile to reduce the dependence on accurate prior knowledge of the soil moisture profile the soil hydraulic properties e g field capacity hydraulic conductivity at saturation were generated using a pedotransfer model saxton and rawls 2006 from perturbed soil texture data to account for soil texture variability and to keep the properties consistent following lu et al 2021b the phenological scaling factor was allowed to vary within a 0 05 range around the optimal estimates to account for the parameter uncertainty to mimic the revisit interval and the typical penetration depth of remote sensing soil moisture products only the top layer 10 cm depth soil moisture measurements were assimilated every 3 days as the observations of different variables may be collected on different dates soil moisture canopy cover and biomass measurements were assimilated separately using the enkf with an ensemble size of 200 the key model parameters and the reference phenological parameters are summarized in table 2 2 8 model evaluation the canopy cover and biomass estimates from different simulation strategies were evaluated against field samplings the final yield estimates were evaluated using hand harvested grain yield at the 6 imzs table 1 five statistical metrics were adopted to evaluate the goodness of fit including the pearson correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse the normalized rmse nrmse the bias and the willmott s index of agreement d willmott 1981 the metrics are calculated by 9 r i 1 n s i s o i o i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 r m s e i 1 n s i o i 2 n 11 n r m s e r m s e o 100 12 b i a s 1 n i 1 n s i o i 13 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 where o i stands for the ith observation s i is the corresponding model estimate n is the number of observations available σ s and σ o are the standard deviations of model simulations and observations and s and o are the mean of model simulations and observations respectively the selected metrics were used to assess the goodness of fit from different aspects in which r depicts the linear correlation between the model estimates and observations the rmse and nrmse illustrate the absolute and relative magnitude of the difference between simulation and observation the bias refers to the tendency of overestimation or underestimation and d represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error 1 indicates a perfect match and 0 indicates no agreement 3 results 3 1 gridded forcing data evaluation the daily precipitation gdd and et 0 calculated based on the gridded weather data are evaluated against those from in situ weather data during the growing seasons in fig 2 growing season precipitation demonstrates strong variability across years ranging from around 300 mm to over 600 mm overall the magnitude and timing of precipitation events based on the gridded weather data agree well with in situ measurements while the gridded data tend to overestimate precipitation at the study site the growing season total precipitation difference is smaller than 70 mm in most years but is greater than 100 mm in 2007 2009 and 2015 the gdds estimated from both datasets are similar in all growing seasons the gridded data slightly overestimate gdd but the difference is very small the daily et 0 calculated from both datasets are also consistent with a mean correlation coefficient of 0 75 and a mean rmse of 1 17 mm day overall the gridded data agree well with in situ measurements at the study site which supports the use of gridded data as inputs to the aquacrop model 3 2 planting date estimates the planting dates were estimated using the gridded and in situ forcing data with the proposed method respectively to quantify the goodness of fit between the monte carlo simulation of canopy cover development and in situ observations multiple statistical metrics were used to determine the optimal planting date estimates including the pearson correlation coefficient the rmse the unbiased rmse and the kling gupta efficiency kge evaluations suggest that using the unbiased rmse metrics leads to the best planting date estimates shown in fig 3 the estimated planting windows successfully capture the plausible local planting periods for all growing seasons the planting windows show strong inter annual variability with the window width varying between 19 days and 43 days the proposed method perform well using both the gridded and the in situ forcing data and the estimates are consistent and comparable when the gridded forcing data are used the planting date estimation difference is less than 5 days for 5 growing seasons but can reach as large as 15 days in 2003 the overall estimation rmse is 7 1 days and the mean absolute error mae is 5 4 days 3 3 performance of the simplified fertility stress scheme on wp to evaluate the performance of the simplified fertility stress scheme to approximate the biomass and yield simulation from the original aquacrop model the biomass and yield estimates from the aquacrop osf model were compared to those from the aquacrop v6 1 software version under different fertility stress conditions the fertility stress was represented by different b rel variables ranging from 20 to 90 with an increment of 10 the experiments were performed for maize simulation using the aquacrop tutorial data from davis california 1996 for each experiment the aquacrop v6 1 software was first used to simulate biomass and yield for a given b rel and the aquacrop osf model was run using different fertility stress coefficients f w p in fig 1b to find the best approximation of the original aquacrop model outputs the results are shown in fig 4 when crops are not fertility stressed estimates from both methods are the same by definition when the fertility stress is low b rel 70 the estimation difference is small throughout the growing season when the fertility stress is moderate 40 b rel 60 the biomass simulation difference is more evident during the exponential vegetative growth stage at the initial growth stage the transpiration is low and the fertility stress reduction on wp is small hence the impact on biomass accumulation is limited during senescence the fertility stress is relatively high in both schemes leading to a much reduced biomass production rate and hence a small difference in biomass accumulation for high fertility stress conditions b rel 30 the estimation difference is always small as a result of the severely reduced wp in both schemes overall the impact of the simplified fertility stress scheme on wp is limited under diverse conditions with a maximum biomass estimation nrmse of less than 9 the impact on the crop yield is marginal under all conditions with a maximum estimation nrmse of 3 67 the evaluation demonstrates that the simplified fertility stress scheme is capable of approximating the original aquacrop simulations with limited influence on the biomass and yield estimates 3 4 canopy cover estimates based on the assessment of the accuracy of the gridded forcing data and the performance of the simplified fertility stress scheme the aquacrop osf model was used to simulate maize growth over the 9 growing seasons the planting dates estimated in fig 3a and the corresponding phenological scaling factors were used as inputs and the key parameter values ranges summarized in table 2 were used for ensemble generation the canopy cover estimates from ol da smcc and da smccb are compared against in situ observations in fig 5 and the statistical metrics are summarized in table 3 results show that the ol estimates successfully capture the canopy cover dynamics during the growing season which verifies the validity of the estimated planting dates and the corresponding phenological parameters in simulating maize growth for different cultivars the ol simulates canopy growth rate well in most growing seasons but underestimates maximum canopy cover in a few growing seasons e g 2005 and 2009 this may relate to factors such as the soil moisture simulation uncertainty or the unique stress resistance features of different cultivars as the model was not thoroughly calibrated for each cultivar separately when soil moisture and canopy cover observations are assimilated the simulations are significantly improved in all growing seasons which can be seen from the narrower ensemble spreads and the statistical metrics since the biomass accumulation process does not affect canopy cover growth estimates from da smcc and da smccb are mostly comparable 3 5 biomass estimates the biomass evaluations are shown in fig 6 and table 4 the upper and lower boundaries of the patched areas demonstrate the biomass simulations under no fertility stress and extreme fertility stress conditions respectively the ol estimates agree well with observations in some growing seasons when the fertility stress is around average e g 2003 2005 2007 2011 2017 but the performance deteriorates in growing seasons when the fertility stress on biomass production is low e g 2009 2013 or high e g 2015 2019 da smcc improves biomass estimates in most growing seasons particularly in 2009 as a result of the improved characterization of canopy growth dynamics lu et al 2021b when additional biomass observations are assimilated da smccb effectively improved biomass estimates with the estimation nrmse less than 10 in all growing seasons 3 6 yield estimates the evaluations of yield estimates from ol da smcc and da smccb are shown in fig 7 the ol underestimates yield in 2009 and 2013 and overestimates yield in 2019 which is consistent with ol simulations of biomass when soil moisture and canopy cover are assimilated yield estimates are improved in most growing seasons particularly in 2009 the correlation coefficient increases from 0 471 for ol to 0 622 for da smcc and the rmse reduces from 2 14 mg ha for ol to 1 62 mg ha for da smcc da smccb outperforms both ol and da smcc as a result of the direct update ability on biomass simulation when additional biomass estimates are assimilated the correlation coefficient further increases to 0 825 and the rmse reduces to 0 97 mg ha and the bias is also significantly reduced to 0 18 mg ha 3 7 planting date estimation during the growing season the planting date estimation and yield simulation in the above sections were performed in a retrospective manner at the end of the growing season when all observations were available another important topic is to estimate planting dates in the middle of the growing season using observations from early growth stages in order to predict the final yield hence experiments were conducted to estimate the planting dates using only canopy cover observations before several cut off dates for example for a cut off date of july 31 only observations collected before july 31 were used and the other observations collected after this date were assumed unavailable the results are shown in fig 8 as expected the estimation accuracy improves gradually with late cut off dates i e the more observations used the better the estimates but the improvement is moderate when more observations are used when a cut off date of june 30 is used around 2 months after planting the estimation rmse could still reach 7 9 days mae 6 1 days which is slightly worse compared with that using a cut off date of late september rmse 7 1 days mae 5 4 days this may relate to the importance of an accurate depiction of the exponential vegetative growth stage in the determination of planting dates the results suggest that planting dates can be estimated with good accuracy using only early stage observations which lays a good foundation for subsequent crop modeling and yield prediction it is worth noting that despite the comparable planting date estimates the phenological scaling factors estimated using early stage and all season observations can differ since the early stage observations are incapable of characterizing the canopy senescence which is crucial for scaling the total length of the growing season 3 8 operational yield forecast an operational yield forecast simulation was performed using da smccb fig 9 for different cut off dates the corresponding planting date and phenological scaling factor estimated in section 3 7 were used and only observations collected before the cut off date were assimilated into the aquacrop osf model results suggest that the yield prediction accuracy improves with late cut off dates i e more observations lead to improved estimates the estimation nrmse is larger than 25 for a cut off date of june 30 which quickly reduces to less than 18 for a cut off date of july 15 on june 30 maize is at the vegetative growth stage in all growing seasons fig 5 and the canopy cover observations contain little information on the time required to reach maximum canopy cover which is important for the estimation of crop phenology as a result the crop phenology uncertainty leads to large errors in the yield prediction by contrast maize has reached maximum canopy cover by july 15 which leads to an improved characterization of the crop growth cycle consequently an evident improvement in yield estimation is observed from july 15 to august 31 the canopy cover is at the plateau stage in most growing seasons fig 5 hence more canopy cover observations do not provide much additional constraint on crop phenology determination and the improvement in yield prediction is mostly attributed to biomass assimilation in late september maize is at the end of senescence hence the crop phenology can be well depicted and the constraint by observations on the model simulation is also the strongest as a consequence the best yield estimates are obtained by late september as maize is mostly harvested between mid october and mid november table 1 the method is able to predict yield within an nrmse of 20 by mid july 3 5 months before harvest and within an nrmse of 15 by late july 3 months before harvest it is worth noting that these predictions are made without thorough model calibration or any prior knowledge of planting date plant density crop phenology or fertility stress which has potential for applications in other data sparse regions 4 discussion 4 1 impact of planting date estimates planting dates have a large impact on crop growth and yield production since they determine what environmental conditions the crops will experience during different growth stages flohr et al 2017 previous studies in the corn belt in the united states using field trial or crop modeling suggested an optimal planting window from late april to early may nafziger 1994 lauer et al 1999 baum et al 2019 2020 when maize is planted during the optimal planting window the impact on the final yield is typically less than 5 baum et al 2019 among the 9 growing seasons the actual as well as estimated planting mostly occurred within this optimal window consequently the impact of planting date estimates on the yield simulation should be limited the estimation accuracy using the proposed simulation based method is comparable with or better than the traditional rule based and observation based methods at field level for example a global study using the rule based method suggested that the estimation difference was less than 1 month for over 60 of the cultivated area waha et al 2012 this is understandable since the rule based methods are often used to generate a representative average planting date for a large area to maximize the yield or to give planting date input to crop models dobor et al 2016 which do not account for non climatic factors at field level some observation based studies reported similar or better estimates for example urban et al 2018 estimated planting date with an rmse 10 days using the enhanced vegetation index evi and the solar induced fluorescence sif data at county level and sadeh et al 2019 reported an rmse 2 days using the high resolution cubesat data for australian no tillage fields these studies were performed either at aggregated scales or over fields with unique management e g no tillage which reduces the applicability of the methods at field level by contrast the proposed method is not limited to certain crops models or field types and can be applied over other fields with different crop types for field level planting date estimation in this study the canopy cover observations were only available every 10 14 days given that remote sensing techniques have enabled high resolution and high frequency crop monitoring e g 10 m 5 day data from sentinel 2 and 3 m daily from planetscope the estimation accuracy may be further improved overall the proposed method can serve as a useful alternative for field level planting date estimation 4 2 impact of the simplified fertility stress simulation stress caused by low soil fertility nutrient deficiencies is often simulated using nutrient balance modules in process based crop models in contrast the aquacrop model adopts a semi quantitative approach that addresses the aggregated effects on canopy development and biomass accumulation to keep its relatively simple structure steduto et al 2009 this indirect approach still calls for local calibration and the user needs to have prior knowledge of the total biomass from stress free and low fertility treatments for calibration vanuytrecht et al 2014 in general the fertility stress is lowest at the beginning of the growing season when the nutrients are abundant and the requirements from the seedlings are low as the plant grows and biomass accumulates the requirements increase and nutrients deplete causing increasing fertility stress given this the aquacrop os model was coupled with a simplified fertility stress scheme which assumes a linear decrease of the fertility stress coefficient on wp from emergence to maturity it is worth noting that the aim was not to improve or further develop the aquacrop model but rather to provide a workaround to facilitate ensemble simulation with unknown fertility conditions at the field level this inevitably leads to biomass simulation difference with the original aquacrop model which is most evident under moderate fertility stress conditions and during the vegetative growth stage fig 4 the simplified scheme typically gives lower biomass production rate during the vegetative growth stage and higher biomass production rate towards the end of the growing season as a result of the different assumptions of the fertility stress coefficient dynamics as shown in fig 4 there exists an aquacrop osf simulation which could give a good approximation of the original aquacrop simulation of biomass under different fertility stress conditions the impact of the simplified scheme on biomass production is limited under all fertility conditions and the impact on crop yield is marginal it should be mentioned that the original aquacrop model also calibrates fertility stress impact on the maximum canopy cover the canopy growth coefficient and the decline of canopy cover once the maximum canopy cover is reached raes et al 2012 which are not explicitly addressed in the simplified scheme instead the impact on the maximum canopy cover and the canopy growth coefficient can be partly accounted for through the ensemble simulation which generates model estimates based on parameter combinations randomly generated within pre defined ranges when canopy cover observations are assimilated the uncertainties from all these aspects can be effectively constrained fig 5 4 3 respective contribution of different observations three types of observations were assimilated into the aquacrop osf model namely soil moisture canopy cover and biomass observations the added value of assimilating soil moisture and canopy cover separately was evaluated by lu et al 2021b both the soil hydrologic processes and canopy growth have an impact on the biomass and yield production under dry conditions soil moisture is the major limiting factor on crop growth and the water stress coefficient on canopy expansion is more sensitive to soil moisture variations compared to under wet conditions raes et al 2012 as a result the improvement from assimilating soil moisture data on biomass and yield estimation is more evident under wet conditions soil moisture is no longer a strong constraint on crop growth consequently assimilating canopy cover data to better characterize crop transpiration gives better results the joint assimilation of soil moisture and canopy cover outperforms single variable assimilation lu et al 2021b but cannot account for the uncertainty in soil fertility stress compared to soil moisture and canopy cover biomass is more closely linked to crop yield which provides a direct constraint on uncertainties caused by factors such as soil fertility conditions though only infrequently sampled every 10 14 days during the growing season additional biomass assimilation still led to evident improvement in yield estimation fig 7 biomass observations at early stages were also shown to improve yield forecast fig 9 since the assimilation corrects for accumulated biomass errors at the time of observation which provides a more accurate basis for biomass accumulation in the forecast period 4 4 potential for fine scale regional applications the methodology developed in this study mimicked a real application with remote sensing data and provided potential for crop modeling and forecasting at fine scale over data sparse regions the gridded forcing data derived from the daymet and gridmet data sets proved to be consistent and comparable with in situ forcing data and led to comparable planting date estimates for regions not covered by daymet and gridmet other observation or reanalysis based data sets may be used such as the mswep precipitation beck et al 2019 the gldas rodell et al 2004 the pgf sheffield et al 2006 the merra 2 gelaro et al 2017 and the era5 hersbach et al 2020 data sets forcing data from these sources are generally provided at coarser resolution 10 60 km which may not accurately characterize climate variability within the grid cell the impact on crop modeling however is expected to be limited when fine scale remote sensing observations are assimilated to update the model states precision agriculture applications usually benefit from soil moisture data at a spatial resolution finer than 1 km peng et al 2021 soil moisture measurements are available at 1 km resolution from synthetic aperture radar sar detection paloscia et al 2013 merging of multiple microwave data sources bauer marschallinger et al 2018 das et al 2019 or spatial downscaling of microwave based retrievals merlin et al 2012 portal et al 2018 abbaszadeh et al 2019 even finer resolution soil moisture data have also been derived by the synergistic use of different data sources escorihuela et al 2018 ma et al 2020 recently vergopolan et al 2020 combined remotely sensed soil brightness temperature information with a land surface model based on hydrologic response units hrus to derive 30 m soil moisture through data merging at such scales the soil moisture variability mainly comes from topographic features and soil texture crow et al 2012 unlike grid based models the hru based models cluster the spatial domain with similar hydrologic behaviors into different hrus which effectively reveals the fine scale soil moisture variability and at the same time reduces the computational demand this provides a potentially useful data source for fine scale soil moisture here soil moisture data were assimilated every 3 days to be consistent with the majority of remote sensing products but the improvement in crop modeling is still expected when soil moisture data are available at longer time intervals lu et al 2021b canopy cover data can be derived from empirical relations with different vegetation indices based on satellite measurements in the optical and near infrared bands in particular the 30 m landsat data irons et al 2012 the 10 m sentinel 2 data drusch et al 2012 and the 3 m planetscope data mccabe et al 2017 roy et al 2021 have been extensively used in agricultural applications some studies have also developed fusion algorithms for multiple data sources to generate gap free or spectrally consistent data products luo et al 2018 houborg and mccabe 2018 sadeh et al 2021 this enables potential planting date estimation at pixel level using the proposed method since the planting date is normally agricultural parcel specific the canopy cover data may be used to generate a parcel average canopy cover time series for more robust planting date estimation if the crop parcel boundary data are available remote sensing biomass products are less common but some examples include the dry matter productivity dmp data provided by the copernicus land service swinnen et al 2015 biomass data can be estimated using empirical models from vegetation indices han et al 2019 or sar data pichierri et al 2018 or calculated from variables related to light use efficiency such as net primary productivity npp yan and wu 2014 and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar moriondo et al 2007 the method can also be applied in a flexible manner for example if the phenological parameters of certain cultivars are known a priori the planting dates can be estimated using fixed phenological parameters if the fertility stress is relatively uniform over the study area the method can be implemented using narrower fertility stress ranges or fixed stress based on literature review or expert knowledge and only assimilate soil moisture and canopy cover data the results from the yield forecast simulation experiment also demonstrate potential to operationally predict the final yield during the growing season though the prediction accuracy using only early stage observations is lower the method is able to predict the final yield with an nrmse 15 three months before harvest the lead time and prediction accuracy are consistent with previous studies peng et al 2018 kang et al 2020 lu et al 2021b it is worth noting that this predictive ability is achieved without thorough calibration or prior knowledge of crop phenology or field management practices e g planting date plant density fertility condition this suggests that the method can be coupled with weather forecast data to operationally simulate crop growth at fine scale and assimilate observations as they become available to provide dynamic yield forecast during the growing season 4 5 transferability of the method here the test site is within the american corn belt which is historically a high yield region and features largely constant harvest index hi however hi values of tropical maize hybrids are generally 0 1 0 15 lower than those of temperate hybrids lorenz et al 2010 trachsel et al 2016 moreover hi is known to vary with environmental factors and management practices such as extreme temperature rainfall droughts floods and plant density sharma et al 1987 prihar and stewart 1990 unkovich et al 2010 huetsch and schubert 2017 causing large hi spatial variability in certain areas under such conditions the parameter ranges used in this study may not be valid expert knowledge and location relevant literature should be used to predefine reasonable parameter ranges as well as their variability under the local environment doing so will ensure that the ensemble simulation does not produce apparent bias which may skew the data assimilation implementation 5 conclusion field based information such as planting date plant density soil fertility condition and crop phenological parameters are generally required for effective field level crop modeling however such information is not routinely available at fine spatial and temporal scales this study builds upon previous research and further advances a data assimilation framework for maize simulation without the need for field based data support a monte carlo simulation based method was first proposed to estimate planting date and the quasi calibrated phenological parameters the original fertility stress scheme in the aquacrop model was then simplified to facilitate ensemble simulation under different fertility stress conditions the in situ soil moisture canopy cover and biomass measurements were subsequently assimilated into the modified aquacrop model to estimate maize yield and the potential for yield prediction was evaluated the results suggest that the proposed approach estimates planting date well using gridded forcing data the estimated rmse is 7 1 days and the mae is 5 4 days the simplified fertility stress scheme is able to deliver a good approximate of the biomass and yield simulation from the original aquacrop model under different fertility stress conditions when soil moisture and canopy cover data are assimilated the yield estimation is improved with an rmse of 1 62 mg ha compared to 2 14 mg ha from the no assimilation case when additional biomass data are assimilated the rmse is further reduced to 0 97 mg ha yield prediction experiments suggest that the method is able to predict the final yield during the growing season the yield can be predicted with a normalized rmse 15 around 3 months prior to harvest and the prediction improves as more observations become available the proposed methodology does not rely on field based data support suggesting that the assimilated observations can potentially be retrieved from remote sensing which illustrates the potential for field level crop modeling and yield forecasting at the regional scale

9557,a three year experiment 2015 2017 was conducted under the semiarid conditions of the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem spain using the optimized regulated deficit irrigation for a limited amount of irrigation water ordil methodology on barley five irrigation treatments were performed during the experiment no deficit nd 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net typical irrigation requirements 2500 m3 ha 1 in the area the aim was to determine the effect of ordil 1 on the quality of grain and malt 2 on the profitability and use of water at farm scale and 3 on the profitability and sustainability of the huem despite using less water ordil treatments showed no significant differences in grain quality with respect to nd while t80 achieved the highest economic water productivity average 0 17 m 3 thus by using t80 instead of nd and increasing the irrigated area of barley on the farm by 14 it is possible to save up to 31 of water with the same profitability this amount of water could be used for more profitable crops increasing the profitability of the farm the use of ordil at basin scale using t80 instead of nd and increasing the cultivated area by 9 could have saved up to 55 9 hm3 over the 3 experimental years 16 of annual extractions in the huem supplying this water to more profitable crops the profitability of the basin could have increased by up to 44 4 m in the case of saving this amount of groundwater piezometric levels would have risen decreasing the pumping costs and improving the environmental conditions in the area consequently applying ordil in low profit crops such as barley and in water scarce areas could improve the profitability and or the sustainability of agricultural systems maintaining the production keywords hordeum vulgare l mopeco model ordil malting process semiarid 1 introduction barley hordeum vulgare l is the fourth most important cereal in the world in terms of both quantity produced and cultivated area faostat 2020 on average the annual world harvest of barley is more than 141 mt obtained from nearly 48 mha faostat 2020 barley is well adapted to different global climates through its genetic evolution garstang et al 2011 ingvordsen et al 2015 and is generally produced in temperate winter and or spring planting and semiarid subtropical winter planting climates ullrich 2011 it is used in different economic sectors such as animal feed 70 malting brewing and distilling industries 21 human food 6 and recently in biofuel production tricase et al 2018 in spain 2 6 mha of this species is cropped producing around 9 2 mt year 1 of grain castilla la mancha clm is the second largest producing region with 28 of the national total cultivating around 0 78 mha of which 12 2 is irrigated mapa 2020 around 0 9 mt of the total production corresponds to brewing cultivars ce 2019 the spanish malting industries generate around 6000 direct jobs and invoice 175 m per year 1 through the production of 485 000 t year 1 of malt the annual needs are about 631 000 t of malting quality barley grains with current national production this demand is not covered forcing imports of around 10 ce 2019 this percentage is higher during dry seasons as occurred in 2017 where quality is more compromised and the rejection rate of national brewing barley productions exceeds 50 thus when the grain quality reaches malt category the price of the grain increases by an average of 15 mapama 2017 the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem located in the júcar basin fig 1 is one of the main irrigation areas in clm it has an extension of 8500 km2 with 110 000 ha of irrigable lands in huem irrigation depths of around 250 mm year 1 may triple the yield of rainfed barley jcrmo 2019 mapa 2020 barley requires a low depth of irrigation water compared to that applied to other annual crops such as onion maize or alfalfa 580 650 and 750 mm year 1 respectively pardo et al 2020 nevertheless the decreasing availability of irrigation water in the area and the global rise in production costs are accentuating the need to apply techniques that enhance water use efficiency such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi chai et al 2016 english 1990 the effect of water stress on barley yield is conditioned by both the intensity of the water deficit and the stage in which it occurs broadly speaking water deficit during plant development and around anthesis decreases yield due to a reduction in the potential number of kernels per unit of area abrha et al 2012 cossani et al 2009 de mezer et al 2014 fischer 1985 giunta et al 1993 marok et al 2021 savin and slafer 1991 in addition water deficit together with high temperatures during grain formation reduces the mean weight of kernels abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 carter and stoker 1985 oweis et al 2000 ugarte et al 2007 carter and stoker 1985 and qureshi and neibling 2009 reported that the quality of the grain for malting is also affected by water deficit mainly during grain formation in addition hong and zhang 2020 noted that a drought period during the grain filling stage of malting barley causes instability and deterioration of malt quality to address the lack of water and low profitability in the agricultural systems of clm the regional centre of water research crea of castilla la mancha university uclm is developing several models tools and methodologies to advise the productive sector on a more efficient profitable and sustainable use of irrigation water thus the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objectives are either to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012b or to allocate a limited irrigation water amount along the crop cycle ordil leite et al 2015a these methodologies were developed for the mopeco model ortega et al 2004 which was conceived to optimize the gross margin gm of irrigated farms located in water scarce areas the model has been calibrated for the main annual extensive crops in clm and others in different areas of the world carvalho et al 2014 domínguez et al 2012a 2012c 2013 leite et al 2015b léllis et al 2017 martínez romero et al 2019 lópez urrea et al 2020 mopeco is currently being used as part of the european project supromed focused on improving the sustainability of agroecosystems in the mediterranean basin www supromed eu considering the above the aims of this research were 1 to determine the effect of ordil on the quality parameters of barley grain and malt 2 to determine the effect of ordil on the profitability of barley and its use of water at farm scale and 3 to analyze the effect of applying ordil in barley on the profitability and sustainability of the huem agricultural system this paper complements the study published by pardo et al 2020 in which the effect of ordil on yield water productivity and water footprint of barley was analyzed in the area 2 material and methods 2 1 description of irrigated lands in hydrogeological unit eastern mancha the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem supplies water for irrigation to about 20 of total irrigable land in clm using modern irrigation techniques mainly drip sprinkler and center pivot systems and for urban consumption including industrial demand the average annual water draft for irrigation is about 334 hm3 of which around 85 is groundwater jcrmo 2019 the considerable development of irrigation systems between 1975 and 2000 caused a significant decrease in the piezometric levels of this aquifer currently more appropriate management of the aquifer has halted this trend although the system is still close to overexploitation martín de santa olalla et al 2007 the most common crops in the area are grape cereals garlic onion broccoli and others such as sunflower potato and alfalfa barley is the second most cultivated cereal occupying around 15 000 ha of irrigated lands jcrmo 2019 although irrigation water is free of charge in the area its use is administratively regulated and farmers must pay for the energy required for pumping as well as the amortization and maintenance of the irrigation systems accordingly the average water cost in the area is 0 12 m 3 which mainly depends on the depth of the piezometric level in the farm carrión et al 2016 the way water resources are managed by the huem does not favor the use of deficit irrigation in annual crops depending on the evolution of the piezometric levels of the aquifer in the last year the water authority known as the confederación hidrográfica del júcar chj hydrogrpahic confederation of the júcar basin establishes the theoretical volume of water that can be used for irrigation in the following campaign which is different each year to guarantee the sustainability of the huem the irrigators association known as junta central de regantes de la mancha oriental jcrmo general board of irrigation users of eastern la mancha distributes this volume among the farmers of the area based on a series of rights and rules established by the association itself jcrmo 2019 in the area the average seasonal gross irrigation water requirements have been determined for each crop jcrmo 2019 thus the area dedicated to each crop multiplied by the theoretical average amount of gross irrigation water cannot be higher than the volume assigned for the farm in this sense farmers must yearly submit a document their exploitation plan ep which reports the crops to be cultivated the total area dedicated to each crop and the cadastral reference of the plots where crops will be cultivated the document will be approved if the total estimated volume is lower or equal to the amount assigned for that season to the farmer in question however if the season is drier than average the farmer can apply a greater volume of irrigation water to fulfill the requirements of the crop while if the year is wetter it is assumed the farmer will save water to reduce the energy costs similarly if the farmer selects high irrigation requirement crops a considerable percentage of the irrigable area of the farm must possibly be left as fallow or cultivated under rainfed conditions therefore what is actually limited and controlled in the huem is the irrigated area of the farms rather than the real amount of water used in them jcrmo 2019 in the case of barley for the 2015 2017 period the average gross irrigation requirements established by jcrmo were 2450 m3 ha 1 jcrmo 2019 which is lower than the average endowment in the area 4000 m3 ha 1 this crop is cultivated because of its importance in the suitable rotation of horticultural crops and to compensate for the greater use of irrigation water by other crops nevertheless in years with dry winters and or dry springs crop needs can exceed 4000 m3 ha 1 which entails a greater than expected use of groundwater in the area this can negatively affect the profitability of the basin given that the cultivated area of barley in huem is around 15 000 ha and its water profitability 0 10 m 3 domínguez et al 2017 is low compared with the average water profitability of crops cultivated in the júcar river basin 0 80 m 3 chj 2018 2 2 field experiments a three year experiment 2015 2017 was conducted at the integrated center for vocational training in aguas nuevas longitude 1º 53 58 w latitude 38º 56 42 n at an altitude of 695 m above sea level albacete spain fig 1 five irrigation treatments were performed during the experiment no deficit nd control and four with different volumes of available irrigation water which corresponded to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net irrigation requirements for the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year 2500 m3 ha 1 pardo et al 2020 tmy hall et al 1978 domínguez et al 2013 the t100 volume was assumed to be sufficient to complete the crop cycle without water deficit pardo et al 2020 even though the weather conditions during the crop cycle are unknown therefore our initial hypothesis during the three years of the trial was that the irrigation schedule of t100 would coincide with that of nd treatment for a tmy intermediate if the climatic conditions were drier than those of a tmy intermediate t100 would stop irrigating when the available water was depleted i e before the crop reached physiological maturity the experimental area 4730 m2 was composed of four 51 m x 18 m plots each year 18 subplots of 2 5 m x 18 m sampling area of 2 5 m x 12 m and another two of 3 m x 18 m buffer were defined the soil is classified as calcixerrollic petrocalcic xerochrepts usda ncrs 2006 the average soil depth is 40 cm being classified as clay loam texture four randomly distributed repetitions of each treatment were established in each plot except in the case of no deficit and t100 treatments for which the number of repetitions was three water was applied by a square spacing drip irrigation system 0 5 0 5 m between pipes and emitters equipped with self compensating emitters providing 3 8 l h 1 of nominal flow a high accuracy 2 flowmeter per treatment was installed as well as soil moisture sensors volumetric and tensiometer for the water use monitoring the amount of fertilization applied to each treatment was determined according to the expected yield simulated by mopeco for a typical year a more detailed description of the experiment is included in pardo et al 2020 2 3 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water ordil the net irrigation requirements of a barley crop under the tmy intermediate conditions were estimated using the mopeco model which was calibrated for this crop in the area by lópez urrea et al 2020 table 1 the resulting amount of water was considered as the reference and was assigned to the t100 treatment 2500 m3 ha 1 three ordil strategies were then performed with three different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation requirements 2250 2000 and 1750 m3 ha 1 respectively in addition one treatment under no deficit conditions nd was carried out as control nd and t100 treatments received the same irrigation schedule up to harvest or until the depletion of the amount of irrigation water available for the t100 treatment 2500 m3 ha 1 the irrigation schedules of the three ordil treatments followed the methodology established by leite et al 2015a this methodology determines the deficit in terms of eta etm to be applied to the crop at each ky stage to maximize yield and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit using the tmy climatic data and the mopeco simulation model after the end of each ky stage a new optimization is carried out in order to take into account the actual amount of irrigation water applied to the crop and the actual eta etm therefore at each optimization the deficit to be reached in the following stages to maximize yield is updated according to the remaining available water a detailed description of how ordil works and the deficit reached in each development stage can be found in pardo et al 2020 table 2 shows the results in terms of yield global eta etm and amount of water received by the different treatments pardo et al 2020 2 4 analysis of harvest in the case of barley the harvest price is conditioned by the quality of the grain mapama 2017 affecting the profitability of the farm in order to quantify the combined effect of ordil and the level of deficit on the quality of the harvest a series of quality parameters was analyzed in the eight samples collected per treatment malting plants establish their own requirements for determining the quality of barley grains and malt coles et al 1991 in this case the criteria set by the intermalta malting factory located in albacete and belonging to malteurop group www malteurop com were used intermalta personal communication this company analyzed the malt parameters described below following the official methodology ebc analytica 2019 after the analysis the company only provided the average result for each parameter consequently these data could not be statistically analyzed grain parameters caliber of grains the minimum total weight percentage of grains with a caliber higher than 2 5 mm fraction ii must be 90 the maximum total weight percentage of grains with a caliber lower than 2 2 mm fraction iv must be 2 5 and the total weight percentage of broken grains must be lower than 4 grain calibre was measured using a sortimat pfeuffer device protein content the value must be compressed between 9 5 and 12 5 this parameter was measured using an infratec grain analyzer foss device moisture the value must be lower than 12 this parameter was measured using an infratec grain analyzer foss device malt parameters moisture values must be compressed between 4 and 5 extract values should be higher than 80 total protein values must be compressed between 9 5 and 12 5 soluble protein accepted values range from 4 to 6 depending on the type of malt sought kolbach index values must be compressed between 35 and 45 friability values must be higher than 80 viscosity values should be lower than 1 55 cp although values up to 1 57 cp may be accepted β glucan content values should be lower than 175 mg l 1 although values up to 200 mg l 1 may be accepted 2 5 effect of ordil on the profitability of barley at farm scale to calculate gross margin gm it is necessary to determine the

economic irrigation water productivity ewp defined as the gross margin produced by the crop per unit of gross irrigation water supplied in order to assess the effect of the results obtained in this experiment at farm scale the following scenarios were analyzed farm s the farmer was assumed to dedicate 15 ha of the total area of the farm to barley irrigating 10 ha by nd strategy and cultivating the remaining area under rainfed conditions under the climatic conditions of the three experimental years and extrapolating the yield and economic results obtained in the trials we calculated the increase in irrigated area of each ordil treatment that would have been necessary to reach a similar profitability to that obtained by the nd treatment the effect of ordil strategies on the total volume of water applied by the farmer was also analyzed the difference between the total available area for barley and the area occupied by nd and ordil treatments was assumed to be covered by rainfed barley with a profitability ranging between 68 and 104 ha 1 according to the average yield obtained in the area in the study years mapa 2017 2018 to calculate the gross irrigation requirements it was considered that losses due to evaporation and drift together with the lack of uniformity of the irrigation system generate a 12 increase in net irrigation water use ortiz et al 2009 2 6 effect of ordil on the profitability of barley and on the sustainability of the huem agricultural system this section aims to assess the economic and environmental impact of the most favorable ordil treatment section 2 5 on barley cultivation at huem scale if farmers decide to use this methodology in the entire cultivated and irrigated area of this crop in this scenario huem s the nd and ordil t80 strategies were compared thus in the case of nd it was assumed that the irrigation water requirements of the crop in the entire cultivated area were fulfilled given that the exploitation plan limits the area but not the actual amount of water supplied to the crop in the case of ordil t80 we calculated the total area that could have been irrigated during the three experimental years using the same theoretical amount of water used by nd in the comparison the water consumption yield and costs of each strategy were assumed to be similar to those obtained in the experiment however in order to avoid overestimates of the economic impact when calculating the gm differences we considered only 8 of the total production of both strategies reached malting quality which corresponds to the national average data ce 2019 2 7 statistical analysis of the results for every year duncan s test westfall and stanley 1993 was performed to determine whether significant differences p 0 05 existed between irrigation treatments 3 results 3 1 effect of ordil on the quality parameters of grain and malt although the global eta etm covered a wide range of values from 0 71 to 1 00 table 2 the 2015 and 2017 seasons obtained a very similar distribution of calibers however the calibers obtained during 2016 were significantly lower in the main fractions fraction i and ii around 16 and 6 less respectively table 3 nonetheless the size of more than 90 in weight of the harvested grains was greater than 2 5 mm for all treatments and years table 3 analyzing the distribution of calibers for fraction i 2 8 mm the t100 treatment obtained the worst values in the three years between 67 and 80 with the t90 and t80 treatments generally being the ones that achieved the highest percentages 83 and 82 respectively table 3 for fraction ii 2 5 mm the average intra year values were very similar and significant differences only appeared between t80 highest values and t70 in 2015 for the rest of the fractions t100 was the treatment with the poorest results for all the years table 3 as with the calibers during the three years and in all the treatments the protein content requirements were met since they did not exceed the 12 5 threshold established by the industry intermalta personal communication table 4 no significant differences in grain protein were found between treatments with the 2015 treatments being those with the lowest percentage of protein between 11 0 and 11 6 thanks to both the distribution of rainfall and temperatures together with the lower levels of water deficit achieved table 4 while in 2015 the t100 treatment showed the second lowest percentage of protein 11 2 in 2016 and 2017 it presented the highest content around 12 0 table 4 grain moisture in all treatments in the three seasons was below the threshold 12 table 4 there were slight differences between treatments with the lower content of t100 being justified by the early depletion of the irrigation water on the other hand the water deficit caused by ordil did not negatively affect the quality of the malt since all the parameters were within the ranges required by the malting plant in the three seasons table 5 finally as observed with grain size the climatic conditions of year 2016 negatively affected the results although they all fulfilled the requirements of the malting plant comparing ordil treatments with nd similar values were obtained for the majority of the parameters with some such as kolbach index only in 2015 friability and viscosity even improving table 5 3 2 effect of ordil on the profitability of farms in the three years of the study the cost of irrigation water represented between 22 for t70 and 27 of the total cost for t100 treatments reaching 33 in nd treatments table 6 the maximum gm per unit of area was obtained by nd in 2015 507 2 ha 1 when irrigation requirements were lower decreasing by 19 and 23 in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 6 for the same treatment the interannual differences were more pronounced in the non optimized treatments around 19 than in the ordil ones around 3 thus the maximum difference for nd was 23 2015 and 2017 and 18 for t100 2015 and 2016 while in the ordil treatments it was 11 for t70 in 2016 and 2017 years being 3 for t80 and t90 for 2015 and 2016 economic irrigation water productivity ewp increased with the water deficit reaching the maximum in the t80 treatment comparing t80 with nd the improvement in ewp was 10 4 53 3 and 79 9 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 as in the case of gm the optimized treatments presented a lower interannual ewp variability the irrigated barley area that a farmer should dedicate to each ordil treatment under the premises of the farm s scenario is shown in table 8 the area increased with water deficit being around 45 greater in the case of t70 in addition to reaching the same profitability as nd for the total barley area ordil strategies would have used a lower amount of irrigation water saving between 11 4 and 37 6 of total irrigation water supplied to barley depending on the year and ordil treatment thus the t80 strategy was the most successful for the 3 years studied saving on average 30 6 of irrigation water by increasing the irrigated area of barley 14 table 8 3 3 effect of ordil on the profitability and sustainability at huem scale during the 3 experimental years an average of 345 hm3 year 1 of water was theoretically supplied to crops cultivated in the huem with 15 000 ha year 1 around 14 of the total being the average area dedicated to irrigated barley jcrmo 2019 table 9 according to the irrigation requirements of barley established by the exploitation plan the theoretical volume of water supplied to barley in the area would have reached 110 2 hm3 the t80 strategy instead of nd during the 3 experimental years equaled the volume estimated by jcrmo by increasing the irrigated barley area by 9 table 10 in addition extrapolating the observed irrigation requirements table 6 to the total cultivated area of the huem the actual water consumption would have reached 166 1 hm3 this represents around 55 9 hm3 more than the theoretical value for the three campaigns table 9 the gm of the huem would have enhanced by up to 0 8 million euros in the 2016 and 2017 campaigns however it would have decreased by up to 0 30 million euros 2 in all three years table 10 nonetheless the ewp of barley would have improved by 47 on average 4 discussion 4 1 effect of ordil on the quality parameters of grain and malt in general although no minimum value is assigned to fraction i 2 8 mm by the malting industry it is considered the most interesting fraction since large grains usually have a higher starch content and thus produce a higher extract yield cozzolino et al 2021 nevertheless the fraction ii results for all treatments are similar to those obtained by martínez romero et al 2017 with a scarlett cultivar in clm 90 96 and higher than those observed by pržulj et al 2014 in serbia with eight malting cultivars 79 91 similarly pettersson and eckersten 2007 for two malting cultivars under different nitrogen fertilization doses in sweden 82 91 högy et al 2013 in germany with the quench cultivar 73 81 and marconi et al 2011 in italy with six different cultivars 47 84 achieved lower percentages in this fraction the lower caliber values obtained during 2016 can be justified because the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied that year was significantly higher compared to the other two thus the amount was increased 10 to reduce the risk of great nitrogen leaching losses caused by large forecast precipitations for the days after the application events that did not occur furthermore during the grain filling period all the treatments were subjected to a severe water deficit due to an 8 day failure in the pumping system in this regard in holland and with the prisma cultivar grashoff d antuono 1997 observed that the greater the nitrogenous fertilization the higher was the number of grains per m2 reducing the weight and size of the grains similarly qi et al 2006 in china for the logan and thompson cultivars and albrizio et al 2010 for the ponente cultivar in italy reported the same response on the other hand water deficit from anthesis to maturity accelerates leaf senescence reduces the duration and filling rate of the grain albrizio et al 2010 additionally it decreases the time of translocation of carbohydrate reserves to the grain oweis et al 2000 and reduces the average weight and size of the grain acevedo et al 2002 this explains why t100 obtained the worst fraction i 2 8 mm results since this treatment suffered severe stress during the last stages of development when the volume of irrigation water for this treatment was exhausted in any event the values obtained by this treatment 67 90 were higher than those documented by högy et al 2013 32 33 for this fraction high t100 protein content in 2016 and 2017 was caused by the early water depletion together with the high temperatures achieved during the grain filling stage this result coincides with the findings of several authors morgan and riggs 1981 varvel and severson 1987 grant et al 1991 weston et al 1993 eagles et al 1995 savin and nicolas 1996 birch et al 1997 despite some authors such as coles et al 1991 or macnicol et al 1993 observing that in the triumph and schooner cultivars water deficit reduced the protein content for the same fertilizer level subsequent works reported contrasting findings wu et al 2015 detected differences of more than four percentage points in the protein content in favor of the deficit treatments martínez romero et al 2017 identified significant differences with the same fertilizer level for a 30 deficit level while albrizio et al 2010 exceeded the limits established by the malting plants in the deficit treatments a comparison between the nd and t100 treatments shows that for the same amount of fertilizer the water deficit increased the percentage of protein table 4 however ordil treatments reached suitable protein contents likely thanks to the amount of water reserved for the last stage leite et al 2015a avoiding great deficits at any stage together with a nitrogen fertilization dose fitted to the expected yields the fact that no significant differences appeared between ordil treatments validates this methodology although no relationships between malt quality parameters were found in our study wang et al 2004 reported relationships between β glucans and viscosity extract kolbach index and diastatic power in addition no relationships were found either between these parameters and water deficit as was reported by jansen et al 2013 with the β glucans the former authors detected greater β glucan content in the treatments subjected to higher water deficit in contrast coles et al 1991 and wu et al 2015 revealed that β glucans decreased as water deficit increased finally henry 1985 and jansen et al 2013 found a positive relationship between grain protein and β glucan content the malt quality parameters obtained in this experiment were better than those documented by nielsen munck 2003 in european brewery convention ebc trials with 25 cultivars in denmark extract ranging between 79 and 83 kolbach index ranging between 32 and 39 friability ranging between 46 and 84 viscosity ranging between 1 61 and 1 91 cp and β glucans ranging between 267 and 853 mg l 1 they were also better than those observed by marconi et al 2011 with 6 cultivars in italy moisture ranging between 4 2 and 4 8 extract ranging between 78 and 80 friability ranging between 55 and 78 viscosity ranging between 1 52 and 1 68 cp and β glucans ranging between 245 and 452 mg l 1 and similar or slightly better than those achieved by pržulj et al 2014 in serbia for 8 different cultivars extract ranging between 76 and 80 kolbach s index between 33 and 43 viscosity between 1 44 and 1 61 cp 4 2 effect of ordil on the profitability of farms the costs of irrigation water in all treatments were in a similar range to those obtained by domínguez et al 2017 for this crop in the area between 21 and 26 which is a considerable percentage compared to other crops such as garlic between 4 and 6 domínguez et al 2013 or onion between 10 and 12 domínguez et al 2017 and similar to maize between 25 and 28 domínguez et al 2017 2011 due to the harvest price being low the efficient management of water in barley is essential to reach suitable profitability the ordil treatments decreased income variability as a result of a lower impact on the gross margin of the amount of irrigation water applied to the crop and reasonably stable yields table 6 in addition the year to year differences in gross margin of the nd and t100 treatments can be explained by the yield drop in the t100 treatment caused by the water deficit at the end of the cycle and the increased irrigation requirements in the dry years for nd despite nd achieving the highest yield this strategy did not always generate the highest gm for the total cultivated area of barley including under rainfed conditions table 8 thus in 2016 and 2017 the higher yield obtained by nd did not compensate for the drop of ewp caused by higher irrigation water requirements table 7 being t90 and t80 the most profitable strategies respectively table 8 4 3 effect of ordil on the profitability and sustainability at huem scale extrapolating the results of this trial the irrigation needs of barley were found to have been much higher than those considered by the water management authority jcrmo in the area 51 higher applying the t80 strategy instead of nd during the 3 experimental years up to 55 9 hm3 of water could have been saved in the huem by increasing the irrigated area by 9 in addition in dry years like 2016 and 2017 the gm would have improved by up to 20 table 10 although in other years under less severe climatic conditions such as 2015 the gm would have been significantly lower 18 on the other hand if the 55 9 hm3 of water had been used for irrigating other more profitable crops from the júcar system where the average ewp equals 0 8 m 3 chj 2018 the income of this area could have increased by up to 44 4 million more another option could be to use this volume of water to recover the piezometric levels of the eastern mancha aquifer which despite having been stabilized in recent years thanks to adequate management by the chj and the jcrmo are still below their reference levels this solution would mean an environmental improvement in the ecosystems of the area as well as a decrease in the costs of pumping irrigation water since it would be located at a lower depth moreover a decrease in the co2 footprint would be generated when using a conventional source of energy under real conditions the amount of water saved would probably not have been as large as that considered in tables 9 and 10 due to the low profitability of barley leading many farmers to apply deficit irrigation to reduce costs furthermore many pumping systems are unable to provide enough water during the peak demand period of the farm due to the high irrigation requirements of the total crops cultivated at the same time in this sense garrido rubio et al 2020 using remote sensing techniques in the huem estimated an average decrease of 38 ranging between 24 and 56 in the total amount of irrigation water supplied to this crop with respect to the potential requirements for year 2012 similarly nascimento 2018 stated an average 18 reduction ranging between 0 and 49 in the monitoring of 6 commercial plots in the same area during the 2015 and 2016 campaigns these results confirm that farmers decrease the amount of water supplied to this crop to reduce costs and save water for other crops consequently yields for the whole aquifer will also be lower than those considered for the whole aquifer for nd strategy table 10 in this sense the average yield of irrigated barley for the three study years was 6333 kg ha 1 mapa 2017 2018 well below the around 9000 kg ha 1 considered for the huem s scenario therefore the profitability of nd barley in the zone is also lower than that considered in table 10 although the profitability assigned to t80 as well as the consumption could be closer to reality under appropriate management conditions in addition it is necessary to take into account that the way farmers apply deficit to barley is based on their own criteria or is forced by the circumstances moreover it is usually carried out during the highest demand period of the year may and beginning of june which coincides with the formation and filling of the grains nascimento 2018 these stages are highly sensitive to water deficit abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 carter and stoker 1985 oweis et al 2000 ugarte et al 2007 with it being more advisable to generate deficit to save water during the vegetative development and or ripening stage in order to avoid a significant drop in the final yield and the irrigation water productivity as proposed by the ordil methodology pardo et al 2020 5 conclusions despite using a lower amount of irrigation water the ordil treatments showed no significant differences in the quality parameters of grains with respect to the no deficit and the t100 treatments the caliber was higher than 2 5 mm for 90 of the grains in weight and the protein and moisture content was lower than 12 the quality parameters of malt were also within the requirements of the malting plant in all the cases in this sense the ordil treatments improved some parameters such as the kolbach index friability and viscosity compared to the no deficit and the t100 treatments therefore the irrigation water allocation proposed by ordil combined with a suitable fertilization amount fitted to the yield forecasted by the mopeco model allowed the malt category to be reached in all the treatments and studied years thus the ordil methodology can distribute a volume of water lower than the crop needs throughout the crop cycle without knowing in which climatic conditions the crop will develop allowing suitable yields to be reached without compromising quality consequently ordil avoids supplying excessive amounts of irrigation water to low profitable crops as barley the amount of water saved could be used by more profitable crops or sectors to reduce the pressure on natural sources improve natural habitats increase the piezometric levels of aquifers and reduce the energy cost and the co2 footprint in other words to enhance profitability and sustainability at farm and basin level in the case of a typical farm of the area with a large non irrigated area due to low availability of irrigation water using the ordil t80 strategy the one that achieved the highest profitability instead of full irrigation nd the same profitability could be reached with barley saving up to 31 of water by increasing the irrigable barley area by around 14 this remaining water could be used to irrigate other more profitable crops thus increasing the total income of the farm moreover ordil decreases the impact of water cost and yield variability on the final profitability of barley at farm level in the case of the huem during the three experimental years which were drier than the average the amount of water saved by ordil in barley would have reached 55 9 hm3 16 of the total amount of water used every year in the area this volume could have increased the income of the júcar system by up to 44 4 million euros in the case of supplying that water to other more profitable crops tools such as ordil are essential to advise farmers in the management of available irrigation water and in controlling the deficit level of their crops this aspect is critical in dry years when actual irrigation needs are much higher than those set by regulators thus inappropriate allocation of water during the growing period can negatively affect the profitability of their farms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9557,a three year experiment 2015 2017 was conducted under the semiarid conditions of the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem spain using the optimized regulated deficit irrigation for a limited amount of irrigation water ordil methodology on barley five irrigation treatments were performed during the experiment no deficit nd 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net typical irrigation requirements 2500 m3 ha 1 in the area the aim was to determine the effect of ordil 1 on the quality of grain and malt 2 on the profitability and use of water at farm scale and 3 on the profitability and sustainability of the huem despite using less water ordil treatments showed no significant differences in grain quality with respect to nd while t80 achieved the highest economic water productivity average 0 17 m 3 thus by using t80 instead of nd and increasing the irrigated area of barley on the farm by 14 it is possible to save up to 31 of water with the same profitability this amount of water could be used for more profitable crops increasing the profitability of the farm the use of ordil at basin scale using t80 instead of nd and increasing the cultivated area by 9 could have saved up to 55 9 hm3 over the 3 experimental years 16 of annual extractions in the huem supplying this water to more profitable crops the profitability of the basin could have increased by up to 44 4 m in the case of saving this amount of groundwater piezometric levels would have risen decreasing the pumping costs and improving the environmental conditions in the area consequently applying ordil in low profit crops such as barley and in water scarce areas could improve the profitability and or the sustainability of agricultural systems maintaining the production keywords hordeum vulgare l mopeco model ordil malting process semiarid 1 introduction barley hordeum vulgare l is the fourth most important cereal in the world in terms of both quantity produced and cultivated area faostat 2020 on average the annual world harvest of barley is more than 141 mt obtained from nearly 48 mha faostat 2020 barley is well adapted to different global climates through its genetic evolution garstang et al 2011 ingvordsen et al 2015 and is generally produced in temperate winter and or spring planting and semiarid subtropical winter planting climates ullrich 2011 it is used in different economic sectors such as animal feed 70 malting brewing and distilling industries 21 human food 6 and recently in biofuel production tricase et al 2018 in spain 2 6 mha of this species is cropped producing around 9 2 mt year 1 of grain castilla la mancha clm is the second largest producing region with 28 of the national total cultivating around 0 78 mha of which 12 2 is irrigated mapa 2020 around 0 9 mt of the total production corresponds to brewing cultivars ce 2019 the spanish malting industries generate around 6000 direct jobs and invoice 175 m per year 1 through the production of 485 000 t year 1 of malt the annual needs are about 631 000 t of malting quality barley grains with current national production this demand is not covered forcing imports of around 10 ce 2019 this percentage is higher during dry seasons as occurred in 2017 where quality is more compromised and the rejection rate of national brewing barley productions exceeds 50 thus when the grain quality reaches malt category the price of the grain increases by an average of 15 mapama 2017 the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem located in the júcar basin fig 1 is one of the main irrigation areas

a low depth of irrigation water compared to that applied to other annual crops such as onion maize or alfalfa 580 650 and 750 mm year 1 respectively pardo et al 2020 nevertheless the decreasing availability of irrigation water in the area and the global rise in production costs are accentuating the need to apply techniques that enhance water use efficiency such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi chai et al 2016 english 1990 the effect of water stress on barley yield is conditioned by both the intensity of the water deficit and the stage in which it occurs broadly speaking water deficit during plant development and around anthesis decreases yield due to a reduction in the potential number of kernels per unit of area abrha et al 2012 cossani et al 2009 de mezer et al 2014 fischer 1985 giunta et al 1993 marok et al 2021 savin and slafer 1991 in addition water deficit together with high temperatures during grain formation reduces the mean weight of kernels abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 carter and stoker 1985 oweis et al 2000 ugarte et al 2007 carter and stoker 1985 and qureshi and neibling 2009 reported that the quality of the grain for malting is also affected by water deficit mainly during grain formation in addition hong and zhang 2020 noted that a drought period during the grain filling stage of malting barley causes instability and deterioration of malt quality to address the lack of water and low profitability in the agricultural systems of clm the regional centre of water research crea of castilla la mancha university uclm is developing several models tools and methodologies to advise the productive sector on a more efficient profitable and sustainable use of irrigation water thus the optimized regulated deficit irrigation ordi methodology maximizes the yield of annual crops when the objectives are either to reach a certain deficit for the whole growing period domínguez et al 2012b or to allocate a limited irrigation water amount along the crop cycle ordil leite et al 2015a these methodologies were developed for the mopeco model ortega et al 2004 which was conceived to optimize the gross margin gm of irrigated farms located in water scarce areas the model has been calibrated for the main annual extensive crops in clm and others in different areas of the world carvalho et al 2014 domínguez et al 2012a 2012c

sustainability of agroecosystems in the mediterranean basin www supromed eu considering the above the aims of this research were 1 to determine the effect of ordil on the quality parameters of barley grain and malt 2 to determine the effect of ordil on the profitability of barley and its use of water at farm scale and 3 to analyze the effect of applying ordil in barley on the profitability and sustainability of the huem agricultural system this paper complements the study published by pardo et al 2020 in which the effect of ordil on yield water productivity and water footprint of barley was analyzed in the area 2 material and methods 2 1 description of irrigated lands in hydrogeological unit eastern mancha the hydrogeological unit eastern mancha huem supplies water for irrigation to about 20 of total irrigable land in clm using modern irrigation techniques mainly drip sprinkler and center pivot systems and for urban consumption including industrial demand the average annual water draft for irrigation is about 334 hm3 of which around 85 is groundwater jcrmo 2019 the considerable development of irrigation systems between 1975 and 2000 caused a significant decrease in the piezometric levels of this aquifer currently more appropriate management of the aquifer has halted this trend although the system is still close to overexploitation martín de santa olalla et al 2007 the most common crops in the area are grape cereals garlic onion broccoli and others such as sunflower potato and alfalfa barley is the second most cultivated cereal occupying around 15 000 ha of irrigated lands jcrmo 2019 although irrigation water is free of charge in the area its use is administratively regulated and farmers must pay for the energy required for pumping as well as the amortization and maintenance of the irrigation systems accordingly the average water cost in the area is 0 12 m 3 which mainly depends on the depth of the piezometric level in the farm carrión et al 2016 the way water resources are managed by the huem does not favor the use of deficit irrigation in annual crops depending on the evolution of the piezometric levels of the aquifer in the last year the water authority known as the confederación hidrográfica del júcar chj hydrogrpahic confederation of the júcar basin establishes the theoretical volume of water that can be used for irrigation in the following campaign which is different each year to guarantee the sustainability of the huem the irrigators association known as junta central de regantes de la mancha oriental jcrmo general board of irrigation users of eastern la mancha distributes this volume among the farmers of the area based on a series of rights and rules established by the association itself jcrmo 2019 in the area the average seasonal gross irrigation water requirements have been determined for each crop jcrmo 2019 thus the area dedicated to each crop multiplied by the theoretical average amount of gross irrigation water cannot be higher than the volume assigned for the farm in this sense farmers must yearly submit a document their exploitation plan ep which reports the crops to be cultivated the total area dedicated to each crop and the cadastral reference of the plots where crops will be cultivated the document will be approved if the total estimated volume is lower or equal to the amount assigned for that season to the farmer in question however if the season is drier than average the farmer can apply a greater volume of irrigation water to fulfill the requirements of the crop while if the year is wetter it is assumed the farmer will save water to reduce the energy costs similarly if the farmer selects high irrigation requirement crops a considerable percentage of the irrigable area of the farm must possibly be left as fallow or cultivated under rainfed conditions therefore what is actually limited and controlled in the huem is the irrigated area of the farms rather than the real amount of water used in them jcrmo 2019 in the case of barley for the 2015 2017 period the average gross irrigation requirements established by jcrmo were 2450 m3 ha 1 jcrmo 2019 which is lower than the average endowment in the area 4000 m3 ha 1 this crop is cultivated because of its importance in the suitable rotation of horticultural crops and to compensate for the greater use of irrigation water by other crops nevertheless in years with dry winters and or dry springs crop needs can exceed 4000 m3 ha 1 which entails a greater than expected use of groundwater in the area this can negatively affect the profitability of the basin given that the cultivated area of barley in huem is around 15 000 ha and its water profitability 0 10 m 3 domínguez et al 2017 is low compared with the average water profitability of crops cultivated in the júcar river basin 0 80 m 3 chj 2018 2 2 field experiments a three year experiment 2015 2017 was conducted at the integrated center for vocational training in aguas nuevas longitude 1º 53 58 w latitude 38º 56 42 n at an altitude of 695 m above sea level albacete spain fig 1 five irrigation treatments were performed during the experiment no deficit nd control and four with different volumes of available irrigation water which corresponded to 100 t100 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of barley net irrigation requirements for the weather conditions of the intermediate typical meteorological year 2500 m3 ha 1 pardo et al 2020 tmy hall et al 1978 domínguez et al 2013 the t100 volume was assumed to be sufficient to complete the crop cycle without water deficit pardo et al 2020 even though the weather conditions during the crop cycle are unknown therefore our initial hypothesis during the three years of the trial was that the irrigation schedule of t100 would coincide with that of nd treatment for a tmy intermediate if the climatic conditions were drier than those of a tmy intermediate t100 would stop irrigating when the available water was depleted i e before the crop reached physiological maturity the experimental area 4730 m2 was composed of four 51 m x 18 m plots each year 18 subplots of 2 5 m x 18 m sampling area of 2 5 m x 12 m and another two of 3 m x 18 m buffer were defined the soil is classified as calcixerrollic petrocalcic xerochrepts usda ncrs 2006 the average soil depth is 40 cm being classified as clay loam texture four randomly distributed repetitions of each treatment were established in each plot except in the case of no deficit and t100 treatments for which the number of repetitions was three water was applied by a square spacing drip irrigation system 0 5 0 5 m between pipes and emitters equipped with self compensating emitters providing 3 8 l h 1 of nominal flow a high accuracy 2 flowmeter per treatment was installed as well as soil moisture sensors volumetric and tensiometer for the water use monitoring the amount of fertilization applied to each treatment was determined according to the expected yield simulated by mopeco for a typical year a more detailed description of the experiment is included in pardo et al 2020 2 3 optimized regulated deficit irrigation for limited volumes of irrigation water ordil the net irrigation requirements of a barley crop under the tmy intermediate conditions were estimated using the mopeco model which was calibrated for this crop in the area by lópez urrea et al 2020 table 1 the resulting amount of water was considered as the reference and was assigned to the t100 treatment 2500 m3 ha 1 three ordil strategies were then performed with three different volumes of available irrigation water corresponding to 90 t90 80 t80 and 70 t70 of net irrigation requirements 2250 2000 and 1750 m3 ha 1 respectively in addition one treatment under no deficit conditions nd was carried out as control nd and t100 treatments received the same irrigation schedule up to harvest or until the depletion of the amount of irrigation water available for the t100 treatment 2500 m3 ha 1 the irrigation schedules of the three ordil treatments followed the methodology established by leite et al 2015a this methodology determines the deficit in terms of eta etm to be applied to the crop at each ky stage to maximize yield and estimates the amount of irrigation water required to reach that level of deficit using the tmy climatic data and the mopeco simulation model after the end of each ky stage a new optimization is carried out in order to take into account the actual amount of irrigation water applied to the crop and the actual eta etm therefore at each optimization the deficit to be reached in the following stages to maximize yield is updated according to the remaining available water a detailed description of how ordil works and the deficit reached in each development stage can be found in pardo et al 2020 table 2 shows the results in terms of yield global eta etm and amount of water received by the different treatments pardo et al 2020 2 4 analysis of harvest in the case of barley the harvest price is conditioned by the quality of the grain mapama 2017 affecting the profitability of the farm in order to quantify the combined effect of ordil and the level of deficit on the quality of the harvest a series of quality parameters was analyzed in the eight samples collected per treatment malting plants establish their own requirements for determining the quality of barley grains and malt coles et al 1991 in this case the criteria set by the intermalta malting factory located in albacete and belonging to malteurop group www malteurop com were used intermalta personal communication this company analyzed the malt parameters described below following the official methodology ebc analytica 2019 after the analysis the company only provided the average result for each parameter consequently these data could not be statistically analyzed grain parameters caliber of grains the minimum total weight percentage of grains with a caliber higher than 2 5 mm fraction ii must be 90 the maximum total weight percentage of grains with a caliber lower than 2 2 mm fraction iv must be 2 5 and the total weight percentage of broken grains must be lower than 4 grain calibre was measured using a sortimat pfeuffer device protein content the value must be compressed between 9 5 and 12 5 this parameter was measured using an infratec grain analyzer foss device moisture the value must be lower than 12 this parameter was measured using an infratec grain analyzer foss device malt parameters moisture values must be compressed between 4 and 5 extract values should be higher than 80 total protein values must be compressed between 9 5 and 12 5 soluble protein accepted values range from 4 to 6 depending on the type of malt sought kolbach index values must be compressed between 35 and 45 friability values must be higher than 80 viscosity values should be lower than 1 55 cp although values up to 1 57 cp may be accepted β glucan content values should be lower than 175 mg l 1 although values up to 200 mg l 1 may be accepted 2 5 effect of ordil on the profitability of barley at farm scale to calculate gross margin gm it is necessary to determine the

economic irrigation water productivity ewp defined as the gross margin produced by the crop per unit of gross irrigation water supplied in order to assess the effect of the results obtained in this experiment at farm scale the following scenarios were analyzed farm s the farmer was assumed to dedicate 15 ha of the total area of the farm to barley irrigating 10 ha by nd strategy and cultivating the remaining area under rainfed conditions under the climatic conditions of the three experimental years and extrapolating the yield and economic results obtained in the trials we calculated the increase in irrigated area of each ordil treatment that would have been necessary to reach a similar profitability to that obtained by the nd treatment the effect of ordil strategies on the total volume of water applied by the farmer was also analyzed the difference between the total available area for barley and the area occupied by nd and ordil treatments was assumed to be covered by rainfed barley with a profitability ranging between 68 and 104 ha 1 according to the average yield obtained in the area in the study years mapa 2017 2018 to calculate the gross irrigation requirements it was considered that losses due to evaporation and drift together with the lack of uniformity of the irrigation system generate a 12 increase in net irrigation water use ortiz et al 2009 2 6 effect of ordil on the profitability of barley and on the sustainability of the huem agricultural system this section aims to assess the economic and environmental impact of the most favorable ordil treatment section 2 5 on barley cultivation at huem scale if farmers decide to use this methodology in the entire cultivated and irrigated area of this crop in this scenario huem s the nd and ordil t80 strategies were compared thus in the case of nd it was assumed that the irrigation water requirements of the crop in the entire cultivated area were fulfilled given that the exploitation plan limits the area but not the actual amount of water supplied to the crop in the case of ordil t80 we calculated the total area that could have been irrigated during the three experimental years using the same theoretical amount of water used by nd in the comparison the water consumption yield and costs of each strategy were assumed to be similar to those obtained in the experiment however in order to avoid overestimates of the economic impact when calculating the gm differences we considered only 8 of the total production of both strategies reached malting quality which corresponds to the national average data ce 2019 2 7 statistical analysis of the results for every year duncan s test westfall and stanley 1993 was performed to determine whether significant differences p 0 05 existed between irrigation treatments 3 results 3 1 effect of ordil on the quality parameters of grain and malt although the global eta etm covered a wide range of values from 0 71 to 1 00 table 2 the 2015 and 2017 seasons obtained a very similar distribution of calibers however the calibers obtained during 2016 were significantly lower in the main fractions fraction i and ii around 16 and 6 less respectively table 3 nonetheless the size of more than 90 in weight of the harvested grains was greater than 2 5 mm for all treatments and years table 3 analyzing the distribution of calibers for fraction i 2 8 mm the t100 treatment obtained the worst values in the three years between 67 and 80 with the t90 and t80 treatments generally being the ones that achieved the highest percentages 83 and 82 respectively table 3 for fraction ii 2 5 mm the average intra year values were very similar and significant differences only appeared between t80 highest values and t70 in 2015 for the rest of the fractions t100 was the treatment with the poorest results for all the years table 3 as with the calibers during the three years and in all the treatments the protein content requirements were met since they did not exceed the 12 5 threshold established by the industry intermalta personal communication table 4 no significant differences in grain protein were found between treatments with the 2015 treatments being those with the lowest percentage of protein between 11 0 and 11 6 thanks to both the distribution of rainfall and temperatures together with the lower levels of water deficit achieved table 4 while in 2015 the t100 treatment showed the second lowest percentage of protein 11 2 in 2016 and 2017 it presented the highest content around 12 0 table 4 grain moisture in all treatments in the three seasons was below the threshold 12 table 4 there were slight differences between treatments with the lower content of t100 being justified by the early depletion of the irrigation water on the other hand the water deficit caused by ordil did not negatively affect the quality of the malt since all the parameters were within the ranges required by the malting plant in the three seasons table 5 finally as observed with grain size the climatic conditions of year 2016 negatively affected the results although they all fulfilled the requirements of the malting plant comparing ordil treatments with nd similar values were obtained for the majority of the parameters with some such as kolbach index only in 2015 friability and viscosity even improving table 5 3 2 effect of ordil on the profitability of farms in the three years of the study the cost of irrigation water represented between 22 for t70 and 27 of the total cost for t100 treatments reaching 33 in nd treatments table 6 the maximum gm per unit of area was obtained by nd in 2015 507 2 ha 1 when irrigation requirements were lower decreasing by 19 and 23 in 2016 and 2017 respectively table 6 for the same treatment the interannual differences were more pronounced in the non optimized treatments around 19 than in the ordil ones around 3 thus the maximum difference for nd was 23 2015 and 2017 and 18 for t100 2015 and 2016 while in the ordil treatments it was 11 for t70 in 2016 and 2017 years being 3 for t80 and t90 for 2015 and 2016 economic irrigation water productivity ewp increased with the water deficit reaching the maximum in the t80 treatment comparing t80 with nd the improvement in ewp was 10 4 53 3 and 79 9 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively table 7 as in the case of gm the optimized treatments presented a lower interannual ewp variability the irrigated barley area that a farmer should dedicate to each ordil treatment under the premises of the farm s scenario is shown in table 8 the area increased with water deficit being around 45 greater in the case of t70 in addition to reaching the same profitability as nd for the total barley area ordil strategies would have used a lower amount of irrigation water saving between 11 4 and 37 6 of total irrigation water supplied to barley depending on the year and ordil treatment thus the t80 strategy was the most successful for the 3 years studied saving on average 30 6 of irrigation water by increasing the irrigated area of barley 14 table 8 3 3 effect of ordil on the profitability and sustainability at huem scale during the 3 experimental years an average of 345 hm3 year 1 of water was theoretically supplied to crops cultivated in the huem with 15 000 ha year 1 around 14 of the total being the average area dedicated to irrigated barley jcrmo 2019 table 9 according to the irrigation requirements of barley established by the exploitation plan the theoretical volume of water supplied to barley in the area would have reached 110 2 hm3 the t80 strategy instead of nd during the 3 experimental years equaled the volume estimated by jcrmo by increasing the irrigated barley area by 9 table 10 in addition extrapolating the observed irrigation requirements table 6 to the total cultivated area of the huem the actual water consumption would have reached 166 1 hm3 this represents around 55 9 hm3 more than the theoretical value for the three campaigns table 9 the gm of the huem would have enhanced by up to 0 8 million euros in the 2016 and 2017 campaigns however it would have decreased by up to 0 30 million euros 2 in all three years table 10 nonetheless the ewp of barley would have improved by 47 on average 4 discussion 4 1 effect of ordil on the quality parameters of grain and malt in general although no minimum value is assigned to fraction i 2 8 mm by the malting industry it is considered the most interesting fraction since large grains usually have a higher starch content and thus produce a higher extract yield cozzolino et al 2021 nevertheless the fraction ii results for all treatments are similar to those obtained by martínez romero et al 2017 with a scarlett cultivar in clm 90 96 and higher than those observed by pržulj et al 2014 in serbia with eight malting cultivars 79 91 similarly pettersson and eckersten 2007 for two malting cultivars under different nitrogen fertilization doses in sweden 82 91 högy et al 2013 in germany with the quench cultivar 73 81 and marconi et al 2011 in italy with six different cultivars 47 84 achieved lower percentages in this fraction the lower caliber values obtained during 2016 can be justified because the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied that year was significantly higher compared to the other two thus the amount was increased 10 to reduce the risk of great nitrogen leaching losses caused by large forecast precipitations for the days after the application events that did not occur furthermore during the grain filling period all the treatments were subjected to a severe water deficit due to an 8 day failure in the pumping system in this regard in holland and with the prisma cultivar grashoff d antuono 1997 observed that the greater the nitrogenous fertilization the higher was the number of grains per m2 reducing the weight and size of the grains similarly qi et al 2006 in china for the logan and thompson cultivars and albrizio et al 2010 for the ponente cultivar in italy reported the same response on the other hand water deficit from anthesis to maturity accelerates leaf senescence reduces the duration and filling rate of the grain albrizio et al 2010 additionally it decreases the time of translocation of carbohydrate reserves to the grain oweis et al 2000 and reduces the average weight and size of the grain acevedo et al 2002 this explains why t100 obtained the worst fraction i 2 8 mm results since this treatment suffered severe stress during the last stages of development when the volume of irrigation water for this treatment was exhausted in any event the values obtained by this treatment 67 90 were higher than those documented by högy et al 2013 32 33 for this fraction high t100 protein content in 2016 and 2017 was caused by the early water depletion together with the high temperatures achieved during the grain filling stage this result coincides with the findings of several authors morgan and riggs 1981 varvel and severson 1987 grant et al 1991 weston et al 1993 eagles et al 1995 savin and nicolas 1996 birch et al 1997 despite some authors such as coles et al 1991 or macnicol et al 1993 observing that in the triumph and schooner cultivars water deficit reduced the protein content for the same fertilizer level subsequent works reported contrasting findings wu et al 2015 detected differences of more than four percentage points in the protein content in favor of the deficit treatments martínez romero et al 2017 identified significant differences with the same fertilizer level for a 30 deficit level while albrizio et al 2010 exceeded the limits established by the malting plants in the deficit treatments a comparison between the nd and t100 treatments shows that for the same amount of fertilizer the water deficit increased the percentage of protein table 4 however ordil treatments reached suitable protein contents likely thanks to the amount of water reserved for the last stage leite et al 2015a avoiding great deficits at any stage together with a nitrogen fertilization dose fitted to the expected yields the fact that no significant differences appeared between ordil treatments validates this methodology although no relationships between malt quality parameters were found in our study wang et al 2004 reported relationships between β glucans and viscosity extract kolbach index and diastatic power in addition no relationships were found either between these parameters and water deficit as was reported by jansen et al 2013 with the β glucans the former authors detected greater β glucan content in the treatments subjected to higher water deficit in contrast coles et al 1991 and wu et al 2015 revealed that β glucans decreased as water deficit increased finally henry 1985 and jansen et al 2013 found a positive relationship between grain protein and β glucan content the malt quality parameters obtained in this experiment were better than those documented by nielsen munck 2003 in european brewery convention ebc trials with 25 cultivars in denmark extract ranging between 79 and 83 kolbach index ranging between 32 and 39 friability ranging between 46 and 84 viscosity ranging between 1 61 and 1 91 cp and β glucans ranging between 267 and 853 mg l 1 they were also better than those observed by marconi et al 2011 with 6 cultivars in italy moisture ranging between 4 2 and 4 8 extract ranging between 78 and 80 friability ranging between 55 and 78 viscosity ranging between 1 52 and 1 68 cp and β glucans ranging between 245 and 452 mg l 1 and similar or slightly better than those achieved by pržulj et al 2014 in serbia for 8 different cultivars extract ranging between 76 and 80 kolbach s index between 33 and 43 viscosity between 1 44 and 1 61 cp 4 2 effect of ordil on the profitability of farms the costs of irrigation water in all treatments were in a similar range to those obtained by domínguez et al 2017 for this crop in the area between 21 and 26 which is a considerable percentage compared to other crops such as garlic between 4 and 6 domínguez et al 2013 or onion between 10 and 12 domínguez et al 2017 and similar to maize between 25 and 28 domínguez et al 2017 2011 due to the harvest price being low the efficient management of water in barley is essential to reach suitable profitability the ordil treatments decreased income variability as a result of a lower impact on the gross margin of the amount of irrigation water applied to the crop and reasonably stable yields table 6 in addition the year to year differences in gross margin of the nd and t100 treatments can be explained by the yield drop in the t100 treatment caused by the water deficit at the end of the cycle and the increased irrigation requirements in the dry years for nd despite nd achieving the highest yield this strategy did not always generate the highest gm for the total cultivated area of barley including under rainfed conditions table 8 thus in 2016 and 2017 the higher yield obtained by nd did not compensate for the drop of ewp caused by higher irrigation water requirements table 7 being t90 and t80 the most profitable strategies respectively table 8 4 3 effect of ordil on the profitability and sustainability at huem scale extrapolating the results of this trial the irrigation needs of barley were found to have been much higher than those considered by the water management authority jcrmo in the area 51 higher applying the t80 strategy instead of nd during the 3 experimental years up to 55 9 hm3 of water could have been saved in the huem by increasing the irrigated area by 9 in addition in dry years like 2016 and 2017 the gm would have improved by up to 20 table 10 although in other years under less severe climatic conditions such as 2015 the gm would have been significantly lower 18 on the other hand if the 55 9 hm3 of water had been used for irrigating other more profitable crops from the júcar system where the average ewp equals 0 8 m 3 chj 2018 the income of this area could have increased by up to 44 4 million more another option could be to use this volume of water to recover the piezometric levels of the eastern mancha aquifer which despite having been stabilized in recent years thanks to adequate management by the chj and the jcrmo are still below their reference levels this solution would mean an environmental improvement in the ecosystems of the area as well as a decrease in the costs of pumping irrigation water since it would be located at a lower depth moreover a decrease in the co2 footprint would be generated when using a conventional source of energy under real conditions the amount of water saved would probably not have been as large as that considered in tables 9 and 10 due to the low profitability of barley leading many farmers to apply deficit irrigation to reduce costs furthermore many pumping systems are unable to provide enough water during the peak demand period of the farm due to the high irrigation requirements of the total crops cultivated at the same time in this sense garrido rubio et al 2020 using remote sensing techniques in the huem estimated an average decrease of 38 ranging between 24 and 56 in the total amount of irrigation water supplied to this crop with respect to the potential requirements for year 2012 similarly nascimento 2018 stated an average 18 reduction ranging between 0 and 49 in the monitoring of 6 commercial plots in the same area during the 2015 and 2016 campaigns these results confirm that farmers decrease the amount of water supplied to this crop to reduce costs and save water for other crops consequently yields for the whole aquifer will also be lower than those considered for the whole aquifer for nd strategy table 10 in this sense the average yield of irrigated barley for the three study years was 6333 kg ha 1 mapa 2017 2018 well below the around 9000 kg ha 1 considered for the huem s scenario therefore the profitability of nd barley in the zone is also lower than that considered in table 10 although the profitability assigned to t80 as well as the consumption could be closer to reality under appropriate management conditions in addition it is necessary to take into account that the way farmers apply deficit to barley is based on their own criteria or is forced by the circumstances moreover it is usually carried out during the highest demand period of the year may and beginning of june which coincides with the formation and filling of the grains nascimento 2018 these stages are highly sensitive to water deficit abrha et al 2012 acevedo et al 2002 carter and stoker 1985 oweis et al 2000 ugarte et al 2007 with it being more advisable to generate deficit to save water during the vegetative development and or ripening stage in order to avoid a significant drop in the final yield and the irrigation water productivity as proposed by the ordil methodology pardo et al 2020 5 conclusions despite using a lower amount of irrigation water the ordil treatments showed no significant differences in the quality parameters of grains with respect to the no deficit and the t100 treatments the caliber was higher than 2 5 mm for 90 of the grains in weight and the protein and moisture content was lower than 12 the quality parameters of malt were also within the requirements of the malting plant in all the cases in this sense the ordil treatments improved some parameters such as the kolbach index friability and viscosity compared to the no deficit and the t100 treatments therefore the irrigation water allocation proposed by ordil combined with a suitable fertilization amount fitted to the yield forecasted by the mopeco model allowed the malt category to be reached in all the treatments and studied years thus the ordil methodology can distribute a volume of water lower than the crop needs throughout the crop cycle without knowing in which climatic conditions the crop will develop allowing suitable yields to be reached without compromising quality consequently ordil avoids supplying excessive amounts of irrigation water to low profitable crops as barley the amount of water saved could be used by more profitable crops or sectors to reduce the pressure on natural sources improve natural habitats increase the piezometric levels of aquifers and reduce the energy cost and the co2 footprint in other words to enhance profitability and sustainability at farm and basin level in the case of a typical farm of the area with a large non irrigated area due to low availability of irrigation water using the ordil t80 strategy the one that achieved the highest profitability instead of full irrigation nd the same profitability could be reached with barley saving up to 31 of water by increasing the irrigable barley area by around 14 this remaining water could be used to irrigate other more profitable crops thus increasing the total income of the farm moreover ordil decreases the impact of water cost and yield variability on the final profitability of barley at farm level in the case of the huem during the three experimental years which were drier than the average the amount of water saved by ordil in barley would have reached 55 9 hm3 16 of the total amount of water used every year in the area this volume could have increased the income of the júcar system by up to 44 4 million euros in the case of supplying that water to other more profitable crops tools such as ordil are essential to advise farmers in the management of available irrigation water and in controlling the deficit level of their crops this aspect is critical in dry years when actual irrigation needs are much higher than those set by regulators thus inappropriate allocation of water during the growing period can negatively affect the profitability of their farms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9558,drainage water recycling dwr is an emerging practice that has the potential to increase crop yield and improve water quality dwr involves capturing and storing subsurface drainage water and surface runoff in ponds or reservoirs and using this water for supplemental irrigation during dry periods of the growing season the main objective of this study was to enhance drainmod model to simulate the hydrology and crop yield of dwr systems the expanded model named drainmod dwr has a new module that conducts a water balance of the storage reservoir and simulates the interaction between the reservoir and the field irrigated from and or draining into the reservoir the model predicts the long term performance of dwr as affected by weather conditions soil type crop rotation reservoir size and irrigation and drainage management three performance metrics were defined based on model predictions to quantify irrigation crop yield and water capture benefits of dwr to demonstrate the new features of the model uncalibrated drainmod dwr was applied to a hypothetical dwr system with continuous corn using a 50 yr 1970 2019 weather record in eastern north carolina u s different reservoir sizes were simulated to demonstrate how the model can predict the effect of storage capacity on the system s performance the model predicted that a 3 0 m deep reservoir with a surface area of 4 of the field area would optimize corn yield for the simulated conditions the model application clearly demonstrated the drainmod dwr model s capability of optimizing the dwr system design to avoid under sizing or over sizing the storage reservoir which reduces system s performance and increases implementation cost research is needed to test drainmod dwr using field measured data and to develop routines for simulating the fate and transport of nutrients and sediment in the storage reservoir which would enable the model to predict the water quality benefits of dwr keywords subsurface drainage supplemental irrigation on farm water storage irrigation reservoir drainage water reuse drainmod dwr 1 introduction attaining highly productive and environmentally sustainable agriculture in humid and sub humid regions in the u s presents a challenge due to weather uncertainty crop production in these regions is vulnerable to too wet and dry conditions during the growing season hay et al 2021 vories and evett 2010 walthall et al 2013 even when the total precipitation during a growing season is sufficient its timing does not usually coincide with the crop water demand causing stresses on the plant and reduction in crop yield additionally the yield losses caused by water related stresses reduce the fertilizer use efficiency as less nutrients are taken up by stressed and low yielding crops consequently more nutrients are lost from agricultural fields contaminating groundwater and surface water bodies the weather related challenges facing agriculture are expected to intensify as more intensive rainfall and more frequent and longer dry periods are projected in the future ipcc 2014 in humid regions agricultural drainage is necessary for crop production on naturally poorly drained soils with frequently shallow water tables drainage lowers the water table removes excess soil water from the root zone and improves soil trafficability which enhances crop yield improved drainage is needed on nearly 25 of the agricultural land in the u s and on over 50 of cropland in some states to sustain crop production skaggs et al 1994 however subsurface drainage has been a major source of nutrient losses to surface water david et al 1997 keeney and deluca 1993 elevated nutrient levels in surface water bodies have increased harmful algae growth and caused eutrophication problems in major u s water bodies including the gulf of mexico goolsby et al 1999 rabalais et al 2007 the chesapeake bay boesch et al 2001 zedler and kercher 2005 and the great lakes forster and rausch 2002 smith et al 2015 this led to the development of conservation drainage practices for maintaining subsurface drainage benefits while reducing nutrient loss to receiving water evans et al 1995 jaynes and isenhart 2014 schipper et al 2010 supplemental irrigation has been shown to protect crops by providing sufficient water during dry periods of the growing season troy et al 2015 several studies have reported that supplemental irrigation increased crop yield and decreased the year to year yield variability for different crops grown in the humid and sub humid regions of the u s adamsen 1992 garcia et al 2010 jordan et al 2014 lamb et al 1997 spivey et al 2018 however expanding water use for irrigation can lead to depletion of groundwater aquifers hellerstein et al 2019 such as the ogallala aquifer in the great plains region of the u s haacker et al 2016 drainage water recycling dwr is an emerging conservation drainage practice that captures and stores subsurface drainage water and surface runoff in relatively small reservoirs and uses this water for supplemental irrigation during dry periods of the growing season frankenberger et al 2017 hay et al 2021 this practice has the potential to increase crop yield by mitigating drought stresses while conserving the water resource it can also improve water quality as it recycles nutrients back into the field increases plant uptake and reduces nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural fields to downstream surface water there is a limited number of studies that investigated the benefits of dwr systems it was reported that dwr increased corn yield by 14 50 and soybean yield by 7 29 in the states of ohio and missouri u s allred et al 2014 nelson et al 2011 nelson and smoot 2012 in a regional synthesis paper willison et al 2021 reported that dwr increased the resiliency of corn yield to low and normal precipitation during corn critical growth stages v9 r2 compared to corn grown under free drainage and no irrigation dwr increased corn yields by an average of 3 6 mg ha 1 compared to non irrigated and freely drained field in 77 of the 53 site years included in the study the water quality benefits of the practice were studied by tan et al 2007 who reported that dwr reduced mass loads of nitrate and dissolved inorganic phosphorous by 41 and 18 respectively several models have been developed to simulate the water budgets and determine the optimum size of on farm irrigation reservoirs in well drained areas that use only surface runoff arnold and stockle 1991 ouyang et al 2017 palmer et al 1982 saxton and willey 2006 vico et al 2020 these models simulate the hydrologic processes of a coupled field and reservoir system and estimate reservoir water availability irrigation demand and crop yield response typically the nrcs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 has been used to estimate surface runoff the main source of inflow water to the reservoir other methods have also been used including estimating surface runoff as the difference between precipitation and infiltration with the latter estimated using approximate solution of richards s equation kim et al 1996 other models simply distributed precipitation into infiltration and surface runoff based on an assumed constant ratio jarboe and haan 1974 irrigation timing and amount were determined based on the total available water taw in the root zone and a specified soil moisture threshold two key characteristics differentiate dwr systems from the traditional on farm reservoirs simulated by the models mentioned in the last paragraph the reservoir of the dwr system receives water from both surface runoff and subsurface drainage while traditional on farm irrigation reservoirs receive water from surface runoff only models that can simulate both surface and subsurface water movement and estimate drainage flow from the field into the reservoir are needed the second key characteristic of the dwr systems is that these systems are implemented on subsurface drained agricultural landscapes with shallow water table soils the traditional on farm reservoirs are used to irrigate fields on well drained soils with deep water tables for modeling these systems a simple water balance for the plant root zone is adequate for keeping track of plant available water and determining irrigation requirements in dwr the shallow water table of the irrigated field interacts with the root zone and the upward flux from this water table partially contributes to meeting crop et demand irrigation water management and scheduling for this landscape requires a model that represents the interaction between the water table and vadose zone none of the existing models adequately simulates the hydrology and crop yield response for dwr systems reinhart et al 2019 developed a spreadsheet model using microsoft excel visual basic for applications to simulate the storage benefits and nutrient reduction of dwr systems and applied the model to two artificially drained sites in indiana and iowa reinhart et al 2020 developed the algorithm of this model into an open source online tool referred to as edwrd which can be accessed online https github com transformingdrainageproject edwrd edwrd conducts a daily water balance for the two main components of the dwr system the irrigated field and the reservoir the reservoir water balance was based on measured precipitation and tile drainage assumed constant seepage rate and calculated evaporation and irrigation demand reservoir evaporation was estimated using penman monteith equation irrigation withdrawn from the reservoir was scheduled based on a defined soil water deficit soil water depletion and readily available water difference threshold that is equivalent to the maximum daily water consumption of corn the field water balance was based on estimating the daily change in soil water depletion in the layer above the tile drains the main components of the field water balance were precipitation runoff irrigation upward and downward fluxes and evapotranspiration runoff was estimated using nrcs curve number approach allen et al 2007 crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 upward flux was estimated using the soil utility tool of drainmod that generates a relationship between water table depth and upward flux based on the soil properties downward flux was based on estimating the amount of water drained through deep percolation when soil water content is above field capacity more information about the edwrd tool can be found at https transformingdrainage org tools edwrd edwrd is an easy to use tool but has limitations it requires a long term record of measured tile drainage flow water table and nutrient concentration data as inputs to assess the dwr system performance which are not readily available in addition edwrd does not predict the direct impact of dwr systems on crop yield moreover nutrient reductions were estimated based on drainage flow captured by the system without considering nutrient assimilation due to biochemical processes occurring in the reservoir e g denitrification and uptake by aquatic vegetation a model that can address these limitations is necessary for simulating dwr systems in this study we enhanced drainmod model skaggs et al 2012a to simulate dwr systems and predict their irrigation water conservation and crop yield benefits this version of the model referred to as drainmod dwr simulates the water balance of the storage reservoir and the hydrology and crop yield of the field irrigated from and or draining into the reservoir the model simulates the interaction between field hydrology and reservoir water budget the model can be used to predict the long term performance of dwr systems as affected by weather conditions soil type crop rotation reservoir size and irrigation and drainage management to demonstrate the new features of the model and its use we applied drainmod dwr to a hypothetical dwr system in eastern north carolina u s the specific objectives of this paper were to i provide a relatively detailed description of the theoretical basis for the model enhancement simulated processes and model structure ii describe the input requirements to run the newly developed model iii and demonstrate how to use the model outputs to evaluate the performance of dwr systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the hydrological component of drainmod model drainmod skaggs 1978 skaggs et al 2012a is a distributed field scale hydrological model that was originally developed in late 1970s and early 1980s for the design and evaluation of agricultural drainage and related water management systems for naturally poorly drained high water table soils over the past four decades drainmod has become a widely used whole system model that simulates the hydrology carbon nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics and plant growth and productivity for agricultural and forested lands with poorly drained high water table soils askar et al 2021 negm et al 2014 tian et al 2012 2016 youssef et al 2005 additional notable enhancements to the model include modeling the effect of irrigation and drainage management on soil salinity in arid and semi arid regions kandil et al 1995 modeling the hydrologic processes in cold regions where snow accumulation and melt freezing and thawing processes affect field hydrology luo et al 2001 and modeling macropore flow askar et al 2020 following the guidelines by saraswat et al 2015 on documenting and reporting modeling studies we are providing in this section a brief description of the hydrologic component of the model skaggs et al 2012a is an excellent source that provides a detailed description of the hydrologic component of drainmod the literature describing other model components is given in the previous paragraph for readers who are interested in knowing more about other model features the model uses the water balance approach and empirical relationships to describe hydrological processes affecting the hydrology of naturally poorly drained soils with drainage the model conducts water balance at hourly and daily time steps of a soil section of unit surface area located midway between two parallel drains and extends from the soil surface to the top of a restrictive soil layer fig 1 eq 1 describes the water balance at the soil surface and eq 2 describes the water balance in the soil profile 1 δ s p i f ro 2 δ v a d et vls f si where δs is the change in the stored water on the soil surface cm p is precipitation cm i is surface irrigation cm f is infiltration cm ro is surface runoff cm δv a is the change in water free pore space in the soil profile cm d is subsurface drainage flow cm et is evapotranspiration cm vls is vertical and lateral seepage cm si is subirrigation cm infiltration is estimated by the green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 surface depression storage is characterized by the maximum depression storage depth s m that must be filled before surface runoff starts and kirkham depth s 1 that represents micro depressions that prevent water from flowing freely at the soil surface to the vicinity of the subsurface drains surface runoff is estimated based on the surface water balance eq 1 when s m is filled and δs becomes zero ro p i f subsurface drainage flow is calculated with the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer and schilfgaarde 1963 when the water table is at or below the soil surface when water is ponded on the surface at a depth greater than s 1 and less than s m kirkham equation kirkham 1957 is used to estimate subsurface drainage flow vertical and lateral seepage are estimated using a simple approach based on darcy s equation and the dupuit forchheimer assumptions skaggs et al 2012a potential evapotranspiration pet can be estimated by the user and provided as an input to the model or directly estimated by the model using the temperature based thornthwaite 1948 method if thornthwaite method is used daily or monthly correction factors should be used to improve the accuracy of pet estimation the model checks whether evapotranspiration et is limited by soil water conditions upward flux from the water table and available soil water in the root zone if pet is less than upward flux et is set equal to pet if pet is higher than upward flux a thin layer of the soil will be dried down to a minimum allowable water content slightly greater than the wilting point until it satisfies pet as long as this dry zone is not deeper than the root zone if pet is greater than the upward flux and the dry zone depth reached the root zone depth et will be set equal to upward flux drainmod also predicts the relative crop yield response to weather drainage design and management conditions relative yield is estimated as the ratio of the actual crop yield to the potential yield yield occurred when no water related stresses existed expressed as a percentage drainmod uses the stress day index sdi approach evans et al 1991 hiler 1969 to predict the yield reduction caused by excessive soil water deficient soil water planting delay and soil salinity excessive water stress is estimated in the model based on the number of days during which the water table is above a defined threshold e g 30 cm the model uses an approach suggested by shaw 1974 to estimate deficient water stress which is a function of the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration planting delay stress is calculated based on the number of days planting was delayed past the optimum day skaggs et al 1982 water related stresses are also a function of crop susceptibility that varies depending on crop growth stage and crop species hiler 1969 soil salinity stress is computed using approaches presented by kandil et al 1995 2 2 drainmod dwr model development 2 2 1 model structure drainmod dwr model has been developed to simulate on a daily basis the hydrology and water balance of the two main components of a dwr system the reservoir capturing and storing drainage water surface and subsurface and the field irrigated from and draining into the reservoir fig 2 the model structure fully integrates the field and reservoir components and simulates the interaction between the two components model predictions can be used to quantify the water conservation and crop yield benefits of dwr for various reservoir sizes soil types crop rotations weather conditions and water management practices the hydrology and crop yield for the field draining into and or irrigated from the reservoir is simulated using the original version of drainmod which is briefly described in section 2 1 a new module was developed to conduct the water balance of the storage reservoir and simulate the interaction and feedback between the field and the reservoir the modifications were made to the source code of drainmod using the fortran programming language when dwr simulation is conducted the model simulates first the hydrologic processes and predicts water balance components of the field including subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff flowing from the field into the reservoir in case of subirrigation the model estimates the irrigation amount that could be applied to the field based on the weir setting at the drain outlet if other irrigation methods are used the timing and amount of irrigation are inputs to the model and should be defined by the user based on crop water requirements then a water balance is conducted for the reservoir to keep track of the water volume in the reservoir for every day of the simulation the model checks if irrigation is scheduled on that day for each scheduled irrigation event the model limits the irrigation amount based on the available water volume in the reservoir if the water volume calculated from the reservoir water balance exceeds the reservoir storage capacity water will discharge from the reservoir at a rate qout equals the difference between the calculated water volume and the reservoir storage capacity a logic diagram representing the structure of drainmod dwr model is shown in fig 3 drainmod dwr has two modes of operation by turning off the dwr option the standard model simulates field hydrology and relative crop yield if irrigation is simulated while dwr is turned off drainmod does not limit irrigation by the availability of water supply when the dwr option is on the model limits irrigation based on the water availability in the reservoir the model is designed to allow the user to easily switch back and forth between the modified and the original models 2 2 2 reservoir water balance in drainmod dwr a daily water balance is conducted to estimate the water volume in the reservoir as a function of the daily water volumes received by and lost from the reservoir the reservoir water balance equation can be expressed as 3 v t v t 1 a r p t e t a f ro t d t ir t qout t se t qin t where v is the water volume in the reservoir l3 p is the precipitation l e is the evaporation from the surface of the reservoir l ro and d are the surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow respectively entering the reservoir from the field l ir is the water withdrawn from the reservoir to irrigate the dwr field l q in is the volume of inflow water from other sources e g upstream contributing area l3 q out is the volume of the outflow from the reservoir when it reaches maximum storage capacity l3 se is seepage volume from the reservoir m3 a r is the surface area of the reservoir l2 a f is the area of the field l2 and the subscripts t and t 1 denote the current and previous days of the simulation respectively in eq 3 surface runoff subsurface drainage flow and irrigation are estimated from drainmod simulation of the field hydrology precipitation and inflow from other sources are inputs to the model the model assumes a user defined constant seepage flux from the storage reservoir daily evaporation from the reservoir is estimated using a simplified penman equation eq 4 which was proven to give reliable estimates with readily available weather data valiantzas 2006 4 e 0 047 r s t 9 5 2 4 r s r a 2 0 09 t 20 1 rh 100 where e is evaporation mm day r s is solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 r a is extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 t is mean air temperature c and rh is relative humidity if relative humidity and solar radiation data are not available valiantzas 2006 provided simplified formulae to estimate these parameters in terms of the minimum and maximum air temperatures and site latitude the daily evaporation rate is distributed during a 12 h period 6 00 a m to 6 00 p m and adjusted to zero during the hours of rainfall and when the reservoir is dry if the water in the reservoir is less than the evaporation demand the evaporation is set equal to the available water in the reservoir 2 2 3 model inputs and outputs along with the weather soil crop and drainage system inputs required by the standard drainmod model drainmod dwr requires a few additional inputs table 1 these inputs include the area of the field irrigated from and draining to the reservoir the area of the reservoir as a percentage of the field area and the maximum and minimum depths of water in the reservoir and the reservoir seepage flux if applicable a time series of daily inflow from other upstream sources is also required by the model for drainage systems with subsurface pipe drains the model gives the user the options to either route subsurface drainage flow only or route both surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow to the storage reservoir for drainage systems with field open ditches the model routes both surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow to the reservoir since field open ditches collect both surface and subsurface flows from the field in addition to the outputs generated by the standard drainmod model drainmod dwr predicts the daily monthly and annual components of the reservoir water balance 2 3 dwr evaluation criteria based on drainmod predictions drainmod dwr predictions can be used for dwr systems design and evaluation three indices were defined based on drainmod dwr predictions to quantify benefits and evaluate performance of dwr these indices are described in this section the annual relative irrigation supply aris index compares the amount of irrigation water that can be withdrawn from the reservoir in a specific year to the amount of irrigation water from unlimited water supply eq 5 this index was defined by malano and burton 2001 and used by reinhart et al 2019 5 aris i irr i iru i where aris i is the annual relative irrigation supply index for year i irr i is the irrigation amount that can be withdrawn from the reservoir during year i and iru i is the irrigation amount needed by the crop from unlimited water supply during the year i the values of aris i range from 0 to 1 with larger values indicating more water is provided for supplemental irrigation from the dwr system and vice versa when ari s i 1 the reservoir is large enough to provide sufficient supplemental irrigation in year i since the design of the system is site specific weather conditions soil type drainage and irrigation design aris i can be used as one of the design metrics for determining the proper size of the reservoir that can provide enough supplemental irrigation the water capture index wci defines the proportion of the total inflow water that is captured and stored in the reservoir in a specific year eq 6 a similar index was used by reinhart et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of dwr systems for reducing nutrient losses based on the reduction in subsurface drainage flow but it did not include surface runoff and other inflow sources 6 wci i 1 qout i d i ro i qin i where wci i is the water capture index in year i qout i is the outflow from the reservoir in year i d i and ro i are the subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff from the field to the reservoir in year i respectively and qin i is the volume of inflow water from other upstream sources in year i the wci i values range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating all received water is captured and stored by the reservoir and 0 indicating no water is captured the larger the reservoir size the larger the value of wci i and vice versa this index can have multiple uses including i the evaluation of the storage potential of the reservoir should this practice is used for flood mitigation ii the evaluation of the hydrologic effects of dwr particularly on stream flow and iii indirect evaluation of dwr effect on surface water quality by reducing nutrient and sediment enriched surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow that reach downstream surface water bodies the dwr crop yield dwrcy index is the ratio of the crop yield for a dwr field to crop yield for a non irrigated field 7 dwrcy i ircy i 1 lr 100 nicy i 1 where dwrcy i is the crop yield index for crop i ircy i is the relative yield for crop i that was irrigated from a reservoir nicy i is the relative yield of a non irrigated crop i lr is the percent of the surface area of the reservoir to the field area if the reservoir was constructed on land taken out of production a positive dwrcy i indicates an increase in the crop yield of dwr system compared to a non irrigated field while a negative dwrcy i indicates the dwr system reduced the overall crop yield using this index the size of the reservoir that maximizes the yield can be identified as the reservoir size increases it provides more water for supplemental irrigation alleviating plant stresses due to dry conditions and increasing crop yield however increasing the reservoir size takes more land out of production and causes yield loss if lr 0 at a specific reservoir size the system would reach an inflection point where the yield increase due to irrigation is offset by the yield loss due to taking more land out of production beyond this point larger reservoir sizes will cause an overall yield reduction dwrcy i 0 2 4 model application we present a case study for a subsurface drained agricultural field in eastern north carolina u s to demonstrate drainmod dwr application and use the daily precipitation and temperature data used in the model simulations were based on 50 year 1970 2019 weather record retrieved from a noaa weather station plymouth 5 e 35 8723 n 76 6592 w the simulated soil is portsmouth sandy loam which is poorly drained under natural conditions the simulated drainage system consists of subsurface drains installed at a depth of 125 cm and a spacing of 30 m good surface drainage e g maximum surface storage of 0 5 cm was assumed in this simulation to represent common practices in north carolina since good surface drainage is needed to effectively remove excess water following large storm events that frequently occur during the growing season the area of the simulated field is 13 8 ha drainmod soil properties and other site input parameters were based on values reported by skaggs et al 2012b key drainage system input parameters and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity values for the soil profile are listed in table 2 two water table management scenarios were simulated 1 free drainage with no irrigation and dwr which represents the baseline scenario 2 dwr system with adaptive water table management scenario that consists of controlled drainage during the fallow season free drainage before planting and harvesting and subirrigation during the crop growing season the site is irrigated through a subirrigation system water is delivered to the soil through the perforated subsurface drains the water table management mode and the weir settings of the control structure at the drain outlet are given in table 3 simulations were conducted for a continuous corn rotation the simulated target planting day of the year is 100 and the simulated length of the growing season is 130 days drainmod was set to estimate pet using the thornthwaite method monthly pet correction factors determined by amatya et al 1995 were used to correct pet values calculated by the thornthwaite method these monthly factors were obtained by comparing the pet values calculated by thornthwaite method and penman monteith equation at multiple locations in eastern north carolina drainmod inputs needed to simulate crop yield were based on values reported by evans et al 1991 to predict the crop yield and water conservation benefits of the simulated dwr system reservoirs with various storage capacities were simulated including 3 0 m deep reservoirs with surface areas ranging from 2 to 10 of field area reservoir sizes selection followed a similar approach that was presented by reinhart et al 2019 so the results of the two studies can be easily compared the reservoir minimum depth was assumed 0 30 m table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 distinguishing dry and wet years over the 50 year simulation period average annual precipitation was 134 1 cm and ranged from 85 5 cm to 190 1 cm the highest monthly precipitation occurred during the growing season months fig 4 precipitation during the growing season accounted for 47 63 2 cm of annual precipitation the year to year variability in monthly precipitation was high particularly during the summer months fig 4 for example monthly precipitation for july ranged from 2 3 cm in 1993 to 35 8 cm in 1984 this high variability in the timing and amount of precipitation increases the crop vulnerability to water stresses and signifies the need for using dwr systems to mitigate these stresses we used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 to describe the dryness and wetness of each simulated year since the simulated water management included subirrigation during may through july we based our calculations of the spi on the monthly precipitation during this period the spi is a widely used drought index that quantifies dry and wet conditions based on the deviation of precipitation from the long term average the variability of the spi values of may june and july months for the 50 year simulation is graphically depicted in fig 5 negative spi values indicate dry conditions while positive values indicate wet conditions when the value of the spi is less than 2 it indicates extremely dry conditions while an spi greater than 2 indicates extremely wet conditions based on the drought categories defined by mckee et al 1993 18 years were classified as mildly dry 4 years as moderately dry and one year as severely dry in contrast 24 years were classified as mildly wet 2 years as moderately wet and one year as severely wet the month to month and year to year variation of precipitation is visualized on the vertical and horizontal axes of fig 5 respectively the 3 months listed on the vertical axis represent categories the entire month is represented by one value each month in each year has an estimated spi value and the figure shows the interpolated spi values across the 3 months for example 2011 was extremely dry at the beginning of the growing season spi of may 2 2 and became less drier by the end of the growing season spi of july 0 14 despite total precipitation in 2011 140 6 cm exceeded the long term average 134 1 cm precipitation during the period of may july 22 0 cm was below average 38 7 cm 3 2 field water balance the long term simulation of the field water balance indicated that 87 117 cm of average annual precipitation infiltrated into the soil and the other 13 17 cm was routed to the reservoir as surface runoff the annual irrigation withdrawn from the reservoir averaged across all simulated reservoir sizes was 11 cm evapotranspiration was the main water loss from the field 54 while subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff accounted for 34 and 12 respectively 3 2 1 subsurface drainage flow the two main water sources for filling the reservoir were subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff understanding the variability of both components of the field water balance is important to the design and management of the reservoir subsurface drainage flow varied throughout the year depending on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration patterns and the management settings of the drainage control structure fig 6 on average the highest monthly subsurface drainage flow occurred during march 9 cm when pet was still low and the drainage system was still in the free drainage mode during the last half of the month on the other hand the lowest average monthly subsurface drainage flow occurred during november 1 3 cm when monthly precipitation was lowest and the drainage system was managed in controlled drainage mode although most of precipitation occurred during the growing season as discussed in section 3 1 subsurface drainage flow was low this was because of the high evapotranspiration during this period furthermore the drainage system was set in controlled drainage mode during this period which allowed for more water storage in the soil profile and less drainage flow 3 2 2 surface runoff surface runoff also varied throughout the year depending on the duration and intensity of precipitation soil moisture condition and weir settings fig 6 surface runoff tended to be higher with less variability during winter months and when controlled drainage was in effect average monthly surface runoff was highest in january 2 8 cm and lowest in april 0 cm these results suggest that relying on surface runoff only to fill the reservoir would increase the uncertainty of the reservoir storage compared to subsurface drainage flow that has less variability 3 3 reservoir water balance the water budget of the reservoir was simulated for five reservoir sizes 2 4 6 8 and 10 of the field area and each component of the water balance was estimated fig 7 the values were normalized by the field area the water volume of each component was divided by the field area so that the water balance of the field and the reservoir can be related on average subsurface drainage flow from the agricultural field accounted for most of the reservoir s water inflow 67 while runoff and collected rainfall accounted for only 23 and 10 respectively reservoir outflow accounted for 71 of the total water outflow while subirrigation and evaporation accounted for 16 and 13 respectively as expected larger reservoirs were able to provide more irrigation and release less water than smaller reservoirs larger reservoirs stored more precipitation and lost more water via evaporation than smaller reservoirs subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff were almost the same and were not significantly affected by the reservoir size the small change in subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff values were mainly because of the amount and timing of irrigation monthly average of predicted storage volumes for the simulated reservoir sizes were calculated to describe the temporal variation in reservoir storage reservoir storage volumes were expressed in depth units cm by dividing the water volume in the reservoir by the field area fig 8 regardless of timing monthly reservoir storage increased as reservoir size increased reservoir storage was lowest during summer because of water withdrawn for irrigation interannual variation of reservoir storage was lowest during spring months and highest during summer and early fall this can be explained by the difference in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation that depends on weather conditions for example storage variation was lowest in april which was the second month with lowest precipitation variability in contrast storage variation was highest in august which was the second month with highest precipitation variability 3 4 predicted effect of reservoir size on water availability for irrigation the performance of the dwr system was investigated through quantifying its ability to provide the needed irrigation during different weather conditions the predicted reservoir water depth for different reservoir sizes during wet and dry years is given in fig 9 in all weather conditions the reservoir water depth varied between the maximum 3 0 m and minimum water depth 0 30 m all reservoirs with different sizes were almost full before the growing season which supports our hypothesis to study the precipitation deficit during the growing season rather than during the entire year as fig 9 suggests the water stored in the reservoirs was depleted earlier as the reservoir size gets smaller and weather gets drier during wet years all reservoirs stored enough water for irrigation except for the 2 and 4 reservoir sizes which were depleted in 19 and 3 of the 24 mildly wet years respectively reservoir size of 6 was depleted in 4 of the 18 mildly dry years 3 of the 4 moderately dry years and the only year classified as severely dry reservoir size of 8 was able to provide irrigation during all weather conditions except during the severely dry year the only reservoir size that was able to store enough water for irrigation during all weather conditions was the 10 size the annual irrigation applied during wet growing seasons less than 10 cm was much less compared to irrigation applied during dry growing seasons as high as 18 cm the annual relative irrigation supply aris index was estimated for the 50 year simulation period fig 10 based on the simulation results a reservoir size of 8 or larger can store enough water for providing irrigation during all weather conditions for this study site 3 5 predicted effect of reservoir size on crop yield the impact of dwr on corn yield was quantified by comparing the yield of irrigated and non irrigated corn two scenarios were simulated to predict crop yield benefits of dwr with different storage reservoir sizes in the first scenario the reservoir was assumed to be constructed on an area that was not productive e g marginal land the second scenario assumed the reservoir was constructed on a land that was taken out of production the model predicted that supplemental irrigation from the 2 reservoir size increased average corn yield by 13 for scenario 1 and 11 for scenario 2 fig 11 increasing the reservoir size from 2 to 4 of the irrigated field resulted in a large increase in average corn yield 22 for scenario 1 and 17 for scenario 2 the model predicted that reservoir sizes larger than 4 of the irrigated field area will slightly increase corn yield for scenario 1 and reduce corn yield for scenario 2 fig 11 for example the model predicted that the 6 reservoir size will increase average corn yield by 1 for scenario 1 and reduce corn yield be 2 for scenario 2 compared to yield corresponding to the 4 reservoir size average corn yield decreased when irrigating from reservoirs with size larger than 4 in the second scenario because the yield loss due to taking larger field area out of production was greater than the yield increase due to irrigation based on model predictions a reservoir with 4 size would be recommended at this study site to optimize corn yield as model predictions indicate designing a dwr system with a large reservoir i e 8 size that can maintain enough storage for irrigation under all weather conditions does not always increase crop production in addition to the availability of the water in the reservoir the yield increase is also limited by how irrigation is managed timing and rate of irrigation if the field is irrigated using subirrigation the rate at which water can be delivered to crops is highly limited by soil type and the design of the drainage system e g spacing and depth of laterals 3 6 predicted effect of reservoir size on water capture the water capture benefits of dwr were quantified by estimating the reduction in surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow amounts that reached the downstream surface water fig 12 as indicated by the values of the annual wci the water capture increased with the increase of the reservoir size on average over the 50 year simulation period the reservoir with 2 size captured 15 of total reservoir inflow wci 0 15 increasing the reservoir sizes to 4 and 6 of the field area resulted in considerable increases in water capture the average values of the annual wci were 0 2 and 0 24 for the 4 and 6 reservoir sizes respectively further increase in reservoir size leads to only slight increase in annual water capture average annual wci 0 25 and 0 26 for 8 and 10 reservoirs sizes respectively the model predicted that most of the water capture occurred during the months of june july and august when a large portion of the reservoir was empty due to water use for supplemental irrigation during the corn growing season fig 13 the water capture during the non growing season was small and did not exhibit large variation across dry and wet years when evaporation was relatively small and no water was withdrawn for irrigation while the water quality benefits of dwr systems were not quantified in this study the water storage benefits of the system can clearly demonstrate the potential of the system for reducing nutrients and sediment losses from drained agricultural fields to downstream surface water using drainmod nii model youssef et al 2005 skaggs et al 2012b estimated the 35 year average annual nitrate flow weighted concentrations in subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff as 6 0 mg l and 0 8 mg l respectively for continuous corn growing on the same study site therefore the water capture by a 4 size reservoir at the case study site and the associated reduction in outflow to receiving surface water could lead to a yearly reduction in nitrate loss by an average of 20 or 7 7 kg no3 n ha 1 yr 1 it should be noted that the removal and assimilation processes occurring in the reservoir e g denitrification and settling are expected to further reduce nutrient and sediment losses to receiving surface water beyond the levels estimated based on the outflow reduction mechanism only 4 conclusions this paper presented an expanded version of the drainmod model that simulates the hydrology and crop yield for dwr systems this version of the model requires a few inputs to describe the storage reservoir in addition to the inputs required by the standard version of drainmod the model can be used to predict the performance of dwr systems as affected by weather conditions soil type crop rotation reservoir size and irrigation and drainage management utilizing model predictions three indices were suggested as design and performance evaluation metrics for dwr these indices provide quantitative assessment for simulated reservoir sizes with regards to meeting irrigation demand increasing crop yield and reducing total runoff to downstream surface water bodies based on these indices the user can identify the reservoir size that would optimize the system benefits currently a new version of the drainmod model is being developed that includes drainmod dwr along with other recent developments askar et al 2021 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 negm et al 2014 tian et al 2012 2016 additionally the source code of drainmod dwr can be shared with interested researchers upon request the model application underscored the importance of understanding the inter and intra annual variation of precipitation for determining the optimum size of the storage reservoir this application demonstrated the potential of the expanded model for optimizing the design and management of drainage water recycling systems further research is needed to test drainmod dwr using field measured data also adding a water quality component to the model that simulates the fate and transport of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment in the storage reservoir would further enhance the model and make it capable of predicting the water quality benefits of dwr declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9558,drainage water recycling dwr is an emerging practice that has the potential to increase crop yield and improve water quality dwr involves capturing and storing subsurface drainage water and surface runoff in ponds or reservoirs and using this water for supplemental irrigation during dry periods of the growing season the main objective of this study was to enhance drainmod model to simulate the hydrology and crop yield of dwr systems the expanded model named drainmod dwr has a new module that conducts a water balance of the storage reservoir and simulates the interaction between the reservoir and the field irrigated from and or draining into the reservoir the model predicts the long term performance of dwr as affected by weather conditions soil type crop rotation reservoir size and irrigation and drainage management three performance metrics were defined based on model predictions to quantify irrigation crop yield and water capture benefits of dwr to demonstrate the new features of the model uncalibrated drainmod dwr was applied to a hypothetical dwr system with continuous corn using a 50 yr 1970 2019 weather record in eastern north carolina u s different reservoir sizes were simulated to demonstrate how the model can predict the effect of storage capacity on the system s performance the model predicted that a 3 0 m deep reservoir with a surface area of 4 of the field area would optimize corn yield for the simulated conditions the model application clearly demonstrated the drainmod dwr model s capability of optimizing the dwr system design to avoid under sizing or over sizing the storage reservoir which reduces system s performance and increases implementation cost research is needed to test drainmod dwr using field measured data and to develop routines for simulating the fate and transport of nutrients and sediment in the storage reservoir which would enable the model to predict the water quality benefits of dwr keywords subsurface drainage supplemental irrigation on farm water storage irrigation reservoir drainage water reuse drainmod dwr 1 introduction attaining highly productive and environmentally sustainable agriculture in humid and sub humid regions in the u s presents a challenge due to weather uncertainty crop production in these regions is vulnerable to too wet and dry conditions during the growing season hay et al 2021 vories and evett 2010 walthall et al 2013 even when the total precipitation during a growing season is sufficient its timing does not usually coincide with the crop water demand causing stresses on the plant and reduction in crop yield additionally the yield losses caused by water related stresses reduce the fertilizer use efficiency as less nutrients are taken up by stressed and low yielding crops consequently more nutrients are lost from agricultural fields contaminating groundwater and surface water bodies the weather related challenges facing agriculture are expected to intensify as more intensive rainfall and more frequent and longer dry periods are projected in the future ipcc 2014 in humid regions agricultural drainage is necessary for crop production on naturally poorly drained soils with frequently shallow water tables drainage lowers the water table removes excess soil water from the root zone and improves soil trafficability which enhances crop yield improved drainage is needed on nearly 25 of the agricultural land in the u s and on over 50 of cropland in some states to sustain crop production skaggs et al 1994 however subsurface drainage has been a major source of nutrient losses to surface water david et al 1997 keeney and deluca 1993 elevated nutrient levels in surface water bodies have increased harmful algae growth and caused eutrophication problems in major u s water bodies including the gulf of mexico goolsby et al 1999 rabalais et al 2007 the chesapeake bay boesch et al 2001 zedler and kercher 2005 and the great lakes forster and rausch 2002 smith et al 2015 this led to the development of conservation drainage practices for maintaining subsurface drainage benefits while reducing nutrient loss to receiving water evans et al 1995 jaynes and isenhart 2014 schipper et al 2010 supplemental irrigation has been shown to protect crops by providing sufficient water during dry periods of the growing season troy et al 2015 several studies have reported that supplemental irrigation increased crop yield and decreased the year to year yield variability for different crops grown in the humid and sub humid regions of the u s adamsen 1992 garcia et al 2010 jordan et al 2014 lamb et al 1997 spivey et al 2018 however expanding water use for irrigation can lead to depletion of groundwater aquifers hellerstein et al 2019 such as the ogallala aquifer in the great plains region of the u s haacker et al 2016 drainage water recycling dwr is an emerging conservation drainage practice that captures and stores subsurface drainage water and surface runoff in relatively small reservoirs and uses this water for supplemental irrigation during dry periods of the growing season frankenberger et al 2017 hay et al 2021 this practice has the potential to increase crop yield by mitigating drought stresses while conserving the water resource it can also improve water quality as it recycles nutrients back into the field increases plant uptake and reduces nutrient and sediment losses from agricultural fields to downstream surface water there is a limited number of studies that investigated the benefits of dwr systems it was reported that dwr increased corn yield by 14 50 and soybean yield by 7 29 in the states of ohio and missouri u s allred et al 2014 nelson et al 2011 nelson and smoot 2012 in a regional synthesis paper willison et al 2021 reported that dwr increased the resiliency of corn yield to low and normal precipitation during corn critical growth stages v9 r2 compared to corn grown under free drainage and no irrigation dwr increased corn yields by an average of 3 6 mg ha 1 compared to non irrigated and freely drained field in 77 of the 53 site years included in the study the water quality benefits of the practice were studied by tan et al 2007 who reported that dwr reduced mass loads of nitrate and dissolved inorganic phosphorous by 41 and 18 respectively several models have been developed to simulate the water budgets and determine the optimum size of on farm irrigation reservoirs in well drained areas that use only surface runoff arnold and stockle 1991 ouyang et al 2017 palmer et al 1982 saxton and willey 2006 vico et al 2020 these models simulate the hydrologic processes of a coupled field and reservoir system and estimate reservoir water availability irrigation demand and crop yield response typically the nrcs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 has been used to estimate surface runoff the main source of inflow water to the reservoir other methods have also been used including estimating surface runoff as the difference between precipitation and infiltration with the latter estimated using approximate solution of richards s equation kim et al 1996 other models simply distributed precipitation into infiltration and surface runoff based on an assumed constant ratio jarboe and haan 1974 irrigation timing and amount were determined based on the total available water taw in the root zone and a specified soil moisture threshold two key characteristics differentiate dwr systems from the traditional on farm reservoirs simulated by the models mentioned in the last paragraph the reservoir of the dwr system receives water from both surface runoff and subsurface drainage while traditional on farm irrigation reservoirs receive water from surface runoff only models that can simulate both surface and subsurface water movement and estimate drainage flow from the field into the reservoir are needed the second key characteristic of the dwr systems is that these systems are implemented on subsurface drained agricultural landscapes with shallow water table soils the traditional on farm reservoirs are used to irrigate fields on well drained soils with deep water tables for modeling these systems a simple water balance for the plant root zone is adequate for keeping track of plant available water and determining irrigation requirements in dwr the shallow water table of the irrigated field interacts with the root zone and the upward flux from this water table partially contributes to meeting crop et demand irrigation water management and scheduling for this landscape requires a model that represents the interaction between the water table and vadose zone none of the existing models adequately simulates the hydrology and crop yield response for dwr systems reinhart et al 2019 developed a spreadsheet model using microsoft excel visual basic for applications to simulate the storage benefits and nutrient reduction of dwr systems and applied the model to two artificially drained sites in indiana and iowa reinhart et al 2020 developed the algorithm of this model into an open source online tool referred to as edwrd which can be accessed online https github com transformingdrainageproject edwrd edwrd conducts a daily water balance for the two main components of the dwr system the irrigated field and the reservoir the reservoir water balance was based on measured precipitation and tile drainage assumed constant seepage rate and calculated evaporation and irrigation demand reservoir evaporation was estimated using penman monteith equation irrigation withdrawn from the reservoir was scheduled based on a defined soil water deficit soil water depletion and readily available water difference threshold that is equivalent to the maximum daily water consumption of corn the field water balance was based on estimating the daily change in soil water depletion in the layer above the tile drains the main components of the field water balance were precipitation runoff irrigation upward and downward fluxes and evapotranspiration runoff was estimated using nrcs curve number approach allen et al 2007 crop evapotranspiration was calculated using the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 upward flux was estimated using the soil utility tool of drainmod that generates a relationship between water table depth and upward flux based on the soil properties downward flux was based on estimating the amount of water drained through deep percolation when soil water content is above field capacity more information about the edwrd tool can be found at https transformingdrainage org tools edwrd edwrd is an easy to use tool but has limitations it requires a long term record of measured tile drainage flow water table and nutrient concentration data as inputs to assess the dwr system performance which are not readily available in addition edwrd does not predict the direct impact of dwr systems on crop yield moreover nutrient reductions were estimated based on drainage flow captured by the system without considering nutrient assimilation due to biochemical processes occurring in the reservoir e g denitrification and uptake by aquatic vegetation a model that can address these limitations is necessary for simulating dwr systems in this study we enhanced drainmod model skaggs et al 2012a to simulate dwr systems and predict their irrigation water conservation and crop yield benefits this version of the model referred to as drainmod dwr simulates the water balance of the storage reservoir and the hydrology and crop yield of the field irrigated from and or draining into the reservoir the model simulates the interaction between field hydrology and reservoir water budget the model can be used to predict the long term performance of dwr systems as affected by weather conditions soil type crop rotation reservoir size and irrigation and drainage management to demonstrate the new features of the model and its use we applied drainmod dwr to a hypothetical dwr system in eastern north carolina u s the specific objectives of this paper were to i provide a relatively detailed description of the theoretical basis for the model enhancement simulated processes and model structure ii describe the input requirements to run the newly developed model iii and demonstrate how to use the model outputs to evaluate the performance of dwr systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the hydrological component of drainmod model drainmod skaggs 1978 skaggs et al 2012a is a distributed field scale hydrological model that was originally developed in late 1970s and early 1980s for the design and evaluation of agricultural drainage and related water management systems for naturally poorly drained high water table soils over the past four decades drainmod has become a widely used whole system model that simulates the hydrology carbon nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics and plant growth and productivity for agricultural and forested lands with poorly drained high water table soils askar et al 2021 negm et al 2014 tian et al 2012 2016 youssef et al 2005 additional notable enhancements to the model include modeling the effect of irrigation and drainage management on soil salinity in arid and semi arid regions kandil et al 1995 modeling the hydrologic processes in cold regions where snow accumulation and melt freezing and thawing processes affect field hydrology luo et al 2001 and modeling macropore flow askar et al 2020 following the guidelines by saraswat et al 2015 on documenting and reporting modeling studies we are providing in this section a brief description of the hydrologic component of the model skaggs et al 2012a is an excellent source that provides a detailed description of the hydrologic component of drainmod the literature describing other model components is given in the previous paragraph for readers who are interested in knowing more about other model features the model uses the water balance approach and empirical relationships to describe hydrological processes affecting the hydrology of naturally poorly drained soils with drainage the model conducts water balance at hourly and daily time steps of a soil section of unit surface area located midway between two parallel drains and extends from the soil surface to the top of a restrictive soil layer fig 1 eq 1 describes the water balance at the soil surface and eq 2 describes the water balance in the soil profile 1 δ s p i f ro 2 δ v a d et vls f si where δs is the change in the stored water on the soil surface cm p is precipitation cm i is surface irrigation cm f is infiltration cm ro is surface runoff cm δv a is the change in water free pore space in the soil profile cm d is subsurface drainage flow cm et is evapotranspiration cm vls is vertical and lateral seepage cm si is subirrigation cm infiltration is estimated by the green ampt equation green and ampt 1911 surface depression storage is characterized by the maximum depression storage depth s m that must be filled before surface runoff starts and kirkham depth s 1 that represents micro depressions that prevent water from flowing freely at the soil surface to the vicinity of the subsurface drains surface runoff is estimated based on the surface water balance eq 1 when s m is filled and δs becomes zero ro p i f subsurface drainage flow is calculated with the steady state hooghoudt equation bouwer and schilfgaarde 1963 when the water table is at or below the soil surface when water is ponded on the surface at a depth greater than s 1 and less than s m kirkham equation kirkham 1957 is used to estimate subsurface drainage flow vertical and lateral seepage are estimated using a simple approach based on darcy s equation and the dupuit forchheimer assumptions skaggs et al 2012a potential evapotranspiration pet can be estimated by the user and provided as an input to the model or directly estimated by the model using the temperature based thornthwaite 1948 method if thornthwaite method is used daily or monthly correction factors should be used to improve the accuracy of pet estimation the model checks whether evapotranspiration et is limited by soil water conditions upward flux from the water table and available soil water in the root zone if pet is less than upward flux et is set equal to pet if pet is higher than upward flux a thin layer of the soil will be dried down to a minimum allowable water content slightly greater than the wilting point until it satisfies pet as long as this dry zone is not deeper than the root zone if pet is greater than the upward flux and the dry zone depth reached the root zone depth et will be set equal to upward flux drainmod also predicts the relative crop yield response to weather drainage design and management conditions relative yield is estimated as the ratio of the actual crop yield to the potential yield yield occurred when no water related stresses existed expressed as a percentage drainmod uses the stress day index sdi approach evans et al 1991 hiler 1969 to predict the yield reduction caused by excessive soil water deficient soil water planting delay and soil salinity excessive water stress is estimated in the model based on the number of days during which the water table is above a defined threshold e g 30 cm the model uses an approach suggested by shaw 1974 to estimate deficient water stress which is a function of the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration planting delay stress is calculated based on the number of days planting was delayed past the optimum day skaggs et al 1982 water related stresses are also a function of crop susceptibility that varies depending on crop growth stage and crop species hiler 1969 soil salinity stress is computed using approaches presented by kandil et al 1995 2 2 drainmod dwr model development 2 2 1 model structure drainmod dwr model has been developed to simulate on a daily basis the hydrology and water balance of the two main components of a dwr system the reservoir capturing and storing drainage water surface and subsurface and the field irrigated from and draining into the reservoir fig 2 the model structure fully integrates the field and reservoir components and simulates the interaction between the two components model predictions can be used to quantify the water conservation and crop yield benefits of dwr for various reservoir sizes soil types crop rotations weather conditions and water management practices the hydrology and crop yield for the field draining into and or irrigated from the reservoir is simulated using the original version of drainmod which is briefly described in section 2 1 a new module was developed to conduct the water balance of the storage reservoir and simulate the interaction and feedback between the field and the reservoir the modifications were made to the source code of drainmod using the fortran programming language when dwr simulation is conducted the model simulates first the hydrologic processes and predicts water balance components of the field including subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff flowing from the field into the reservoir in case of subirrigation the model estimates the irrigation amount that could be applied to the field based on the weir setting at the drain outlet if other irrigation methods are used the timing and amount of irrigation are inputs to the model and should be defined by the user based on crop water requirements then a water balance is conducted for the reservoir to keep track of the water volume in the reservoir for every day of the simulation the model checks if irrigation is scheduled on that day for each scheduled irrigation event the model limits the irrigation amount based on the available water volume in the reservoir if the water volume calculated from the reservoir water balance exceeds the reservoir storage capacity water will discharge from the reservoir at a rate qout equals the difference between the calculated water volume and the reservoir storage capacity a logic diagram representing the structure of drainmod dwr model is shown in fig 3 drainmod dwr has two modes of operation by turning off the dwr option the standard model simulates field hydrology and relative crop yield if irrigation is simulated while dwr is turned off drainmod does not limit irrigation by the availability of water supply when the dwr option is on the model limits irrigation based on the water availability in the reservoir the model is designed to allow the user to easily switch back and forth between the modified and the original models 2 2 2 reservoir water balance in drainmod dwr a daily water balance is conducted to estimate the water volume in the reservoir as a function of the daily water volumes received by and lost from the reservoir the reservoir water balance equation can be expressed as 3 v t v t 1 a r p t e t a f ro t d t ir t qout t se t qin t where v is the water volume in the reservoir l3 p is the precipitation l e is the evaporation from the surface of the reservoir l ro and d are the surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow respectively entering the reservoir from the field l ir is the water withdrawn from the reservoir to irrigate the dwr field l q in is the volume of inflow water from other sources e g upstream contributing area l3 q out is the volume of the outflow from the reservoir when it reaches maximum storage capacity l3 se is seepage volume from the reservoir m3 a r is the surface area of the reservoir l2 a f is the area of the field l2 and the subscripts t and t 1 denote the current and previous days of the simulation respectively in eq 3 surface runoff subsurface drainage flow and irrigation are estimated from drainmod simulation of the field hydrology precipitation and inflow from other sources are inputs to the model the model assumes a user defined constant seepage flux from the storage reservoir daily evaporation from the reservoir is estimated using a simplified penman equation eq 4 which was proven to give reliable estimates with readily available weather data valiantzas 2006 4 e 0 047 r s t 9 5 2 4 r s r a 2 0 09 t 20 1 rh 100 where e is evaporation mm day r s is solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 r a is extraterrestrial radiation mj m 2 d 1 t is mean air temperature c and rh is relative humidity if relative humidity and solar radiation data are not available valiantzas 2006 provided simplified formulae to estimate these parameters in terms of the minimum and maximum air temperatures and site latitude the daily evaporation rate is distributed during a 12 h period 6 00 a m to 6 00 p m and adjusted to zero during the hours of rainfall and when the reservoir is dry if the water in the reservoir is less than the evaporation demand the evaporation is set equal to the available water in the reservoir 2 2 3 model inputs and outputs along with the weather soil crop and drainage system inputs required by the standard drainmod model drainmod dwr requires a few additional inputs table 1 these inputs include the area of the field irrigated from and draining to the reservoir the area of the reservoir as a percentage of the field area and the maximum and minimum depths of water in the reservoir and the reservoir seepage flux if applicable a time series of daily inflow from other upstream sources is also required by the model for drainage systems with subsurface pipe drains the model gives the user the options to either route subsurface drainage flow only or route both surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow to the storage reservoir for drainage systems with field open ditches the model routes both surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow to the reservoir since field open ditches collect both surface and subsurface flows from the field in addition to the outputs generated by the standard drainmod model drainmod dwr predicts the daily monthly and annual components of the reservoir water balance 2 3 dwr evaluation criteria based on drainmod predictions drainmod dwr predictions can be used for dwr systems design and evaluation three indices were defined based on drainmod dwr predictions to quantify benefits and evaluate performance of dwr these indices are described in this section the annual relative irrigation supply aris index compares the amount of irrigation water that can be withdrawn from the reservoir in a specific year to the amount of irrigation water from unlimited water supply eq 5 this index was defined by malano and burton 2001 and used by reinhart et al 2019 5 aris i irr i iru i where aris i is the annual relative irrigation supply index for year i irr i is the irrigation amount that can be withdrawn from the reservoir during year i and iru i is the irrigation amount needed by the crop from unlimited water supply during the year i the values of aris i range from 0 to 1 with larger values indicating more water is provided for supplemental irrigation from the dwr system and vice versa when ari s i 1 the reservoir is large enough to provide sufficient supplemental irrigation in year i since the design of the system is site specific weather conditions soil type drainage and irrigation design aris i can be used as one of the design metrics for determining the proper size of the reservoir that can provide enough supplemental irrigation the water capture index wci defines the proportion of the total inflow water that is captured and stored in the reservoir in a specific year eq 6 a similar index was used by reinhart et al 2019 to evaluate the performance of dwr systems for reducing nutrient losses based on the reduction in subsurface drainage flow but it did not include surface runoff and other inflow sources 6 wci i 1 qout i d i ro i qin i where wci i is the water capture index in year i qout i is the outflow from the reservoir in year i d i and ro i are the subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff from the field to the reservoir in year i respectively and qin i is the volume of inflow water from other upstream sources in year i the wci i values range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating all received water is captured and stored by the reservoir and 0 indicating no water is captured the larger the reservoir size the larger the value of wci i and vice versa this index can have multiple uses including i the evaluation of the storage potential of the reservoir should this practice is used for flood mitigation ii the evaluation of the hydrologic effects of dwr particularly on stream flow and iii indirect evaluation of dwr effect on surface water quality by reducing nutrient and sediment enriched surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow that reach downstream surface water bodies the dwr crop yield dwrcy index is the ratio of the crop yield for a dwr field to crop yield for a non irrigated field 7 dwrcy i ircy i 1 lr 100 nicy i 1 where dwrcy i is the crop yield index for crop i ircy i is the relative yield for crop i that was irrigated from a reservoir nicy i is the relative yield of a non irrigated crop i lr is the percent of the surface area of the reservoir to the field area if the reservoir was constructed on land taken out of production a positive dwrcy i indicates an increase in the crop yield of dwr system compared to a non irrigated field while a negative dwrcy i indicates the dwr system reduced the overall crop yield using this index the size of the reservoir that maximizes the yield can be identified as the reservoir size increases it provides more water for supplemental irrigation alleviating plant stresses due to dry conditions and increasing crop yield however increasing the reservoir size takes more land out of production and causes yield loss if lr 0 at a specific reservoir size the system would reach an inflection point where the yield increase due to irrigation is offset by the yield loss due to taking more land out of production beyond this point larger reservoir sizes will cause an overall yield reduction dwrcy i 0 2 4 model application we present a case study for a subsurface drained agricultural field in eastern north carolina u s to demonstrate drainmod dwr application and use the daily precipitation and temperature data used in the model simulations were based on 50 year 1970 2019 weather record retrieved from a noaa weather station plymouth 5 e 35 8723 n 76 6592 w the simulated soil is portsmouth sandy loam which is poorly drained under natural conditions the simulated drainage system consists of subsurface drains installed at a depth of 125 cm and a spacing of 30 m good surface drainage e g maximum surface storage of 0 5 cm was assumed in this simulation to represent common practices in north carolina since good surface drainage is needed to effectively remove excess water following large storm events that frequently occur during the growing season the area of the simulated field is 13 8 ha drainmod soil properties and other site input parameters were based on values reported by skaggs et al 2012b key drainage system input parameters and lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity values for the soil profile are listed in table 2 two water table management scenarios were simulated 1 free drainage with no irrigation and dwr which represents the baseline scenario 2 dwr system with adaptive water table management scenario that consists of controlled drainage during the fallow season free drainage before planting and harvesting and subirrigation during the crop growing season the site is irrigated through a subirrigation system water is delivered to the soil through the perforated subsurface drains the water table management mode and the weir settings of the control structure at the drain outlet are given in table 3 simulations were conducted for a continuous corn rotation the simulated target planting day of the year is 100 and the simulated length of the growing season is 130 days drainmod was set to estimate pet using the thornthwaite method monthly pet correction factors determined by amatya et al 1995 were used to correct pet values calculated by the thornthwaite method these monthly factors were obtained by comparing the pet values calculated by thornthwaite method and penman monteith equation at multiple locations in eastern north carolina drainmod inputs needed to simulate crop yield were based on values reported by evans et al 1991 to predict the crop yield and water conservation benefits of the simulated dwr system reservoirs with various storage capacities were simulated including 3 0 m deep reservoirs with surface areas ranging from 2 to 10 of field area reservoir sizes selection followed a similar approach that was presented by reinhart et al 2019 so the results of the two studies can be easily compared the reservoir minimum depth was assumed 0 30 m table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 distinguishing dry and wet years over the 50 year simulation period average annual precipitation was 134 1 cm and ranged from 85 5 cm to 190 1 cm the highest monthly precipitation occurred during the growing season months fig 4 precipitation during the growing season accounted for 47 63 2 cm of annual precipitation the year to year variability in monthly precipitation was high particularly during the summer months fig 4 for example monthly precipitation for july ranged from 2 3 cm in 1993 to 35 8 cm in 1984 this high variability in the timing and amount of precipitation increases the crop vulnerability to water stresses and signifies the need for using dwr systems to mitigate these stresses we used the standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 to describe the dryness and wetness of each simulated year since the simulated water management included subirrigation during may through july we based our calculations of the spi on the monthly precipitation during this period the spi is a widely used drought index that quantifies dry and wet conditions based on the deviation of precipitation from the long term average the variability of the spi values of may june and july months for the 50 year simulation is graphically depicted in fig 5 negative spi values indicate dry conditions while positive values indicate wet conditions when the value of the spi is less than 2 it indicates extremely dry conditions while an spi greater than 2 indicates extremely wet conditions based on the drought categories defined by mckee et al 1993 18 years were classified as mildly dry 4 years as moderately dry and one year as severely dry in contrast 24 years were classified as mildly wet 2 years as moderately wet and one year as severely wet the month to month and year to year variation of precipitation is visualized on the vertical and horizontal axes of fig 5 respectively the 3 months listed on the vertical axis represent categories the entire month is represented by one value each month in each year has an estimated spi value and the figure shows the interpolated spi values across the 3 months for example 2011 was extremely dry at the beginning of the growing season spi of may 2 2 and became less drier by the end of the growing season spi of july 0 14 despite total precipitation in 2011 140 6 cm exceeded the long term average 134 1 cm precipitation during the period of may july 22 0 cm was below average 38 7 cm 3 2 field water balance the long term simulation of the field water balance indicated that 87 117 cm of average annual precipitation infiltrated into the soil and the other 13 17 cm was routed to the reservoir as surface runoff the annual irrigation withdrawn from the reservoir averaged across all simulated reservoir sizes was 11 cm evapotranspiration was the main water loss from the field 54 while subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff accounted for 34 and 12 respectively 3 2 1 subsurface drainage flow the two main water sources for filling the reservoir were subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff understanding the variability of both components of the field water balance is important to the design and management of the reservoir subsurface drainage flow varied throughout the year depending on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration patterns and the management settings of the drainage control structure fig 6 on average the highest monthly subsurface drainage flow occurred during march 9 cm when pet was still low and the drainage system was still in the free drainage mode during the last half of the month on the other hand the lowest average monthly subsurface drainage flow occurred during november 1 3 cm when monthly precipitation was lowest and the drainage system was managed in controlled drainage mode although most of precipitation occurred during the growing season as discussed in section 3 1 subsurface drainage flow was low this was because of the high evapotranspiration during this period furthermore the drainage system was set in controlled drainage mode during this period which allowed for more water storage in the soil profile and less drainage flow 3 2 2 surface runoff surface runoff also varied throughout the year depending on the duration and intensity of precipitation soil moisture condition and weir settings fig 6 surface runoff tended to be higher with less variability during winter months and when controlled drainage was in effect average monthly surface runoff was highest in january 2 8 cm and lowest in april 0 cm these results suggest that relying on surface runoff only to fill the reservoir would increase the uncertainty of the reservoir storage compared to subsurface drainage flow that has less variability 3 3 reservoir water balance the water budget of the reservoir was simulated for five reservoir sizes 2 4 6 8 and 10 of the field area and each component of the water balance was estimated fig 7 the values were normalized by the field area the water volume of each component was divided by the field area so that the water balance of the field and the reservoir can be related on average subsurface drainage flow from the agricultural field accounted for most of the reservoir s water inflow 67 while runoff and collected rainfall accounted for only 23 and 10 respectively reservoir outflow accounted for 71 of the total water outflow while subirrigation and evaporation accounted for 16 and 13 respectively as expected larger reservoirs were able to provide more irrigation and release less water than smaller reservoirs larger reservoirs stored more precipitation and lost more water via evaporation than smaller reservoirs subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff were almost the same and were not significantly affected by the reservoir size the small change in subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff values were mainly because of the amount and timing of irrigation monthly average of predicted storage volumes for the simulated reservoir sizes were calculated to describe the temporal variation in reservoir storage reservoir storage volumes were expressed in depth units cm by dividing the water volume in the reservoir by the field area fig 8 regardless of timing monthly reservoir storage increased as reservoir size increased reservoir storage was lowest during summer because of water withdrawn for irrigation interannual variation of reservoir storage was lowest during spring months and highest during summer and early fall this can be explained by the difference in the amount of water withdrawn for irrigation that depends on weather conditions for example storage variation was lowest in april which was the second month with lowest precipitation variability in contrast storage variation was highest in august which was the second month with highest precipitation variability 3 4 predicted effect of reservoir size on water availability for irrigation the performance of the dwr system was investigated through quantifying its ability to provide the needed irrigation during different weather conditions the predicted reservoir water depth for different reservoir sizes during wet and dry years is given in fig 9 in all weather conditions the reservoir water depth varied between the maximum 3 0 m and minimum water depth 0 30 m all reservoirs with different sizes were almost full before the growing season which supports our hypothesis to study the precipitation deficit during the growing season rather than during the entire year as fig 9 suggests the water stored in the reservoirs was depleted earlier as the reservoir size gets smaller and weather gets drier during wet years all reservoirs stored enough water for irrigation except for the 2 and 4 reservoir sizes which were depleted in 19 and 3 of the 24 mildly wet years respectively reservoir size of 6 was depleted in 4 of the 18 mildly dry years 3 of the 4 moderately dry years and the only year classified as severely dry reservoir size of 8 was able to provide irrigation during all weather conditions except during the severely dry year the only reservoir size that was able to store enough water for irrigation during all weather conditions was the 10 size the annual irrigation applied during wet growing seasons less than 10 cm was much less compared to irrigation applied during dry growing seasons as high as 18 cm the annual relative irrigation supply aris index was estimated for the 50 year simulation period fig 10 based on the simulation results a reservoir size of 8 or larger can store enough water for providing irrigation during all weather conditions for this study site 3 5 predicted effect of reservoir size on crop yield the impact of dwr on corn yield was quantified by comparing the yield of irrigated and non irrigated corn two scenarios were simulated to predict crop yield benefits of dwr with different storage reservoir sizes in the first scenario the reservoir was assumed to be constructed on an area that was not productive e g marginal land the second scenario assumed the reservoir was constructed on a land that was taken out of production the model predicted that supplemental irrigation from the 2 reservoir size increased average corn yield by 13 for scenario 1 and 11 for scenario 2 fig 11 increasing the reservoir size from 2 to 4 of the irrigated field resulted in a large increase in average corn yield 22 for scenario 1 and 17 for scenario 2 the model predicted that reservoir sizes larger than 4 of the irrigated field area will slightly increase corn yield for scenario 1 and reduce corn yield for scenario 2 fig 11 for example the model predicted that the 6 reservoir size will increase average corn yield by 1 for scenario 1 and reduce corn yield be 2 for scenario 2 compared to yield corresponding to the 4 reservoir size average corn yield decreased when irrigating from reservoirs with size larger than 4 in the second scenario because the yield loss due to taking larger field area out of production was greater than the yield increase due to irrigation based on model predictions a reservoir with 4 size would be recommended at this study site to optimize corn yield as model predictions indicate designing a dwr system with a large reservoir i e 8 size that can maintain enough storage for irrigation under all weather conditions does not always increase crop production in addition to the availability of the water in the reservoir the yield increase is also limited by how irrigation is managed timing and rate of irrigation if the field is irrigated using subirrigation the rate at which water can be delivered to crops is highly limited by soil type and the design of the drainage system e g spacing and depth of laterals 3 6 predicted effect of reservoir size on water capture the water capture benefits of dwr were quantified by estimating the reduction in surface runoff and subsurface drainage flow amounts that reached the downstream surface water fig 12 as indicated by the values of the annual wci the water capture increased with the increase of the reservoir size on average over the 50 year simulation period the reservoir with 2 size captured 15 of total reservoir inflow wci 0 15 increasing the reservoir sizes to 4 and 6 of the field area resulted in considerable increases in water capture the average values of the annual wci were 0 2 and 0 24 for the 4 and 6 reservoir sizes respectively further increase in reservoir size leads to only slight increase in annual water capture average annual wci 0 25 and 0 26 for 8 and 10 reservoirs sizes respectively the model predicted that most of the water capture occurred during the months of june july and august when a large portion of the reservoir was empty due to water use for supplemental irrigation during the corn growing season fig 13 the water capture during the non growing season was small and did not exhibit large variation across dry and wet years when evaporation was relatively small and no water was withdrawn for irrigation while the water quality benefits of dwr systems were not quantified in this study the water storage benefits of the system can clearly demonstrate the potential of the system for reducing nutrients and sediment losses from drained agricultural fields to downstream surface water using drainmod nii model youssef et al 2005 skaggs et al 2012b estimated the 35 year average annual nitrate flow weighted concentrations in subsurface drainage flow and surface runoff as 6 0 mg l and 0 8 mg l respectively for continuous corn growing on the same study site therefore the water capture by a 4 size reservoir at the case study site and the associated reduction in outflow to receiving surface water could lead to a yearly reduction in nitrate loss by an average of 20 or 7 7 kg no3 n ha 1 yr 1 it should be noted that the removal and assimilation processes occurring in the reservoir e g denitrification and settling are expected to further reduce nutrient and sediment losses to receiving surface water beyond the levels estimated based on the outflow reduction mechanism only 4 conclusions this paper presented an expanded version of the drainmod model that simulates the hydrology and crop yield for dwr systems this version of the model requires a few inputs to describe the storage reservoir in addition to the inputs required by the standard version of drainmod the model can be used to predict the performance of dwr systems as affected by weather conditions soil type crop rotation reservoir size and irrigation and drainage management utilizing model predictions three indices were suggested as design and performance evaluation metrics for dwr these indices provide quantitative assessment for simulated reservoir sizes with regards to meeting irrigation demand increasing crop yield and reducing total runoff to downstream surface water bodies based on these indices the user can identify the reservoir size that would optimize the system benefits currently a new version of the drainmod model is being developed that includes drainmod dwr along with other recent developments askar et al 2021 2020 lisenbee et al 2020 negm et al 2014 tian et al 2012 2016 additionally the source code of drainmod dwr can be shared with interested researchers upon request the model application underscored the importance of understanding the inter and intra annual variation of precipitation for determining the optimum size of the storage reservoir this application demonstrated the potential of the expanded model for optimizing the design and management of drainage water recycling systems further research is needed to test drainmod dwr using field measured data also adding a water quality component to the model that simulates the fate and transport of nitrogen phosphorus and sediment in the storage reservoir would further enhance the model and make it capable of predicting the water quality benefits of dwr declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

9559,irrigation is vital in bangladesh in order to meet the growing food demand as a result of the increasing population during the dry season groundwater irrigation is the main source of water for agriculture however excessive abstraction of groundwater for irrigation causes groundwater level depletion at the same time the loss from excessive irrigation could end up contributing to aquifer recharge as return flow therefore investigating the influence of irrigation on groundwater is important for the sustainable management of this resource this study aims to assess the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge in the northwest rajshahi district in bangladesh a semi physically based water balance model was used to simulate spatially distributed groundwater recharge with two scenarios with and without irrigation to evaluate the effect of irrigation groundwater recharges from these two scenarios were compared the result showed that the use of groundwater for irrigation increased over the study period whereas there was a persistent trend of decrease in groundwater level during the study period groundwater provides 91 of overall irrigation in the study area however on average about 33 of the total irrigation becomes return flow and contributes to groundwater recharge in the dry season irrigation return flow is around 98 of the total recharge during the dry season in this region the spatially distributed seasonal return flow varies from 305 to 401 mm in brief irrigation has a significant role in groundwater recharge in the study area during the dry season hence proper irrigation water measurement and management are necessary for sustainable groundwater resource management in this region keywords groundwater recharge irrigation irrigation return flow water

request syed mustafa abdn ac uk 1 introduction groundwater has always been an important and reliable source of water providing around 97 of freshwater around the world jakeman et al 2016 in semi arid regions groundwater is often the only constant source of water throughout the year usman et al 2015 groundwater recharge is one of the governing factors of the regional groundwater system groundwater recharge variation in spatial and temporal aspects as well as difficulties in its direct measurement healy 2010 makes it one of the least understood components of the hydrological system groundwater is mainly recharged by rainfall and surface water sources like reservoirs and rivers liu and yamanaka 2012 besides these irrigation and irrigation return flow could be a significant source of aquifer recharge in agriculture dominated areas jiménez martínez et al 2009 séraphin et al 2016 irrigation return flow is defined as the excess of irrigation water that is not evapotranspirated or evacuated by direct surface drainage and which finally returns to an aquifer dewandel et al 2008 and could contribute a substantial quantity to regional water resources cruz fuentes et al 2014 kendy et al 2004 scanlon et al 2007 irrigation water is usually obtained from surface water or groundwater sources a certain portion of irrigation water is evaporated from the soil surface or transpirated by plants while a part of is discharged from agriculture fields as surface runoff to streams or drainage canals the remaining water infiltrates into the soil and percolates to the groundwater this excess water returning to the underlying aquifer is referred to as irrigation return flow rushton et al 2020 in shallow aquifers a large part of irrigation returns to groundwater neumann et al 2009 irrigated agriculture in bangladesh relies heavily on groundwater as of 2019 groundwater is the source of irrigation water in 79 of irrigated areas in bangladesh mainuddin et al 2019 in the northwest region groundwater which is extracted mainly by shallow and deep tube wells supplies about 95 of the total irrigation water mojid et al 2019 the adoption of dry season boro rice and other crops substantially increased the groundwater demand in this region peña arancibia et al 2020 the cultivation of boro rice is important for national food security as it supplies over 55 of the total national production of rice mainuddin et al 2019 mainuddin and kirby 2015 on average boro rice covers 61 of the total cropped area of bangladesh during the rabi season october january bbs 2012 in the boro season water loss can be up to 45 in rice fields mainuddin et al 2020 rashid et al 2009 dey et al 2013 found that 21 3 of water abstracted for boro rice irrigation is unnecessary in the northwest region the excess water from irrigation could percolate from rice fields and reach the underlying aquifer as irrigated recharge during the dry season rushton et al 2020 moreover this excessive irrigation may act as an important source of replenishing aquifer levels however this is not clear yet study on the contribution of this excess water to the water budget system is scarce worldwide therefore a detailed investigation of irrigation and its influence on recharge is vital in policy making to ensure groundwater sustainability globally as well as in the semi arid region like bangladesh researchers have taken various attempts to find out the influence and contribution of irrigation return flow to groundwater recharge liu et al 2004 showed that 21 2 23 4 of irrigation water contributes to recharging in terraced paddy fields dewandel et al 2008 found that return flow ranged from 43 to 59 for rice and 15 37 for vegetables from pumped irrigation water ebrahimi et al 2016 observed that 15 2 of the total irrigation water returns to aquifer as return flow in western iran vallet coulomb et al 2017 quantified irrigation return flow and reported that annual return flow was 1190 140 mm constituting 51 86 of the total irrigation other studies around the world have also shown that the irrigation return flow coefficients vary from 2 to over 50 for different crops under various management practices bethune et al 2001 causapé et al 2004 jafari et al 2019 jalota and arora 2002 kim et al 2009 meyer et al 1987 meyer and mateos 1990 steiner et al 1985 willis et al 1997 most of the studies mentioned above measured only an annual value of irrigation return flow in the respective study area and spatial and temporal variation of the irrigation return flow has not been considered however understanding the spatio temporal variation of different hydrological components is important to ensure sustainable groundwater resources management taie semiromi and koch 2019 nevertheless very limited studies have been conducted so far on spatio temporal variation of irrigation return flow and its impact on groundwater recharge more research is needed to understand the spatio temporal variation of irrigation return flow and its impact on the groundwater system mair et al 2013 waibel et al 2013 researchers in hydro geo logy have been using spatially distributed groundwater models to understand climatic and anthropogenic influences on groundwater systems to provide sufficient decision making information barbosa et al 2022 mustafa et al 2019 a spatially distributed return flow is an essential variable for a groundwater flow model parameterization in an overexploited aquifer mustafa et al 2018 nolte et al 2021 however there is very limited information available about that research with details on the spatio temporal variation of the return flow would also be very helpful for the hydrological modeler community to improve the reliability of the model prediction by reducing the uncertainty on the other hand although researchers around the world have investigated the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge as far as the authors are aware a very limited study has been conducted in bangladesh so it is crucial to study on the estimation of spatially distributed irrigation return flow and their impact on groundwater recharge in that region estimating recharge is a complicated process as it varies with different factors like soil climate land cover and topography batelaan and de smedt 2007 groundwater recharge estimation can be accomplished by the water table fluctuation wtf method water budget method darcy s law empirical relationships groundwater models and tracer techniques islam et al 2016 the water table fluctuation method is only applicable for unconfined aquifers and tracer techniques are very time consuming for this reason the water budget method was used in this study because of its application over a wide range of space and time variables scanlon et al 2002 a semi physically based water balance model wetspass water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state abdollahi et al 2017 batelaan and de smedt 2007 is used in this study to measure spatial and temporal variability of monthly groundwater recharge which makes it suitable for the objectives of this study therefore the general objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge in the rajshahi district of bangladesh specific objectives of this study are to i evaluate the current status of irrigation and its impact on groundwater level ii simulate recharge considering irrigation as input with other input variables and also without irrigation iii simulate recharge without irrigation iv assess simulated recharge relation with rainfall and soil texture v assess the contribution of irrigation in the total water balance vi estimate the irrigation return flow and evaluate its impact on the groundwater recharge vii quantify the spatial and temporal variation of the irrigation return flow and evaluate its impact on the groundwater system furthermore maps of various resolutions are used as inputs to investigate the scaling effects of raster resolution the results of the study will deliver information on the influences of irrigation on spatially distributed recharge and help with effective irrigation planning in northwest bangladesh especially in the rajshahi district 2 methodology a multi step methodology was applied in this study to evaluate the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge at first hydrometeorological soil elevation land use and irrigation data were collected from various sources secondly these data were processed and grid maps were prepared to use as model inputs thirdly the monthly groundwater recharge was simulated by wetspass finally the effects of irrigation return flow were analyzed from irrigated and non irrigated recharge fig 1 shows the conceptual methodology of this study 2 1 study area the agriculture dominated rajshahi district in northwestern bangladesh was chosen for this study the geographic location of the study area is between 24 12 and 24 72 northern latitude and 88 28 and 88 97 eastern longitude the total area is 2407 km2 approximately 1588 km2 of the total area is under cultivation whereas 1229 km2 of agricultural land has a proper irrigation facility the district is divided into 9 upazila sub district as depicted in fig 2 the study area is situated in the sub tropical climate region the mean annual rainfall for the period of 1964 2009 is 1505 mm which is lower than the national average of 2408 mm ghosh et al 2015 the temperature rises above 40 c during the summer but falls below 5 c in winter the mean relative humidity varies from 60 to 88 haque et al 2012 the area is a part of the ganges basin consisting primarily of riverine alluvium the soil textures include sand silty loam loam clay loam etc the aquifer formation is of unconsolidated sedimentary type allison et al 2003 according to several hydrogeological studies conducted in the region the upper aquifers are unconfined or semi confined with thicknesses varying from 10 to 40 m asad uz zaman and rushton 2006 faisal et al 2005 jahani and ahmed 1997 michael and voss 2009 rahman and shahid 2004 the digital elevation model dem shows that rajshahi is 23 m above the mean sea level although the elevation varies up to 62 m over the last two decades the study area is facing a decreasing trend in groundwater level the water table of most of the shallow tubewells in this area falls below the suction lift limit 6 m mojid et al 2019 although some of them maintain a cycle of fluctuation most of the tubewells fail to lift water in the dry season dey and ali 2010 moreover the introduction of high yield rice varieties has expanded irrigation fed agriculture in the study area adhikary et al 2013 and increased crop intensity rahman and mahbub 2012 2 2 wetspass model monthly groundwater recharge is simulated using a semiphysically based water balance model wetspass water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state abdollahi et al 2017 batelaan and de smedt 2007 the model uses climatic data together with topography land cover and soil mapping to estimate average spatial patterns of surface run off actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge batelaan and de smedt 2001 the model recognizes any region as a regular pattern of raster cells each raster cell is divided into four fractions vegetated bare soil open water and impervious the water balance components are calculated individually for each cell from the inputs the water balance equation for a cell can be expressed as 1 p ir sr et int r where p is precipitation ir is irrigation sr is surface runoff et is evapotranspiration int is interception and r is groundwater recharge according to eq 1 precipitation and irrigation are considered the source of water in the model depending on the land use of the simulating cell the model at first calculates interception as a percentage of water input p ir after that sr is calculated considering various factors such as land use slope soil moisture condition soil texture etc then et is estimated from the sum of actual evapotranspiration of the four land use subdivisions open water vegetated bare soil and impervious for each cell et is the sum of evaporation from soil surface and transpiration from plants in bare soil and open water land use only evaporation is considered the actual evapotranspiration of each land use subdivision is estimated from the pet of the cell finally recharge is estimated from the residual part of the water balance equation the grids are not horizontally connected and therefore there is no horizontal movement of water like a process based model however slope is a variable in water balance calculation so there is an indirect effect of horizontal movement of water abdollahi et al 2017 batelaan and de smedt 2007 fig 3 shows the water balance components in this study each raster cell resolution was taken 30 m 30 m this model has been effectively used in different climatic conditions around the world abdollahi et al 2017 armanuos and negm 2016 meresa and taye 2019 mustafa et al 2017 2018 2019 salem et al 2019 in order to use this kind of model spatially distributed higher resolution raster data is required resolution plays a vital role in raster data analysis arnone et al 2016 coarser resolution often leads to lower accuracy in results cama et al 2016 however finer resolution might require higher computational performance arnone et al 2016 on the other hand time is valuable in policy planning especially when results are required within a short time therefore researchers have to consider the computational performance as well as the required accuracy level of their analysis calder and mayer 2003 maleika 2015 2 3 irrigation irrigation data from dry season november to april agricultural activities was collected and analyzed in the study to evaluate the effect of irrigation on groundwater recharge supplemental irrigation data from wet months may to october were excluded from the analysis of groundwater recharge estimation due to unpredictable pumping for rainfed agriculture upazila sub district wise number of irrigation pumps i e deep tube wells dtw shallow tube wells stw and low lift pumps llps and their irrigated area for the period of 2006 2016 were collected from minor irrigation survey report recorded by bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc barind multipurpose development authority bmda and department of agricultural extension dae and published as a report by badc in general pumping capacities for shallow tubewells depth 80 m below ground level deep tubewells depth 80 m below ground level and low lift pumps are assumed to be 0 5 2 and 1 cusec respectively badc 2019 bbs 2009 undp 1982 irrigation map layers were produced assuming that only cultivated vegetated land types would need irrigation irrigation was considered zero for the remaining 3 land cover types i e bare soil open water and impervious based on stakeholder discussion details in section 2 3 1 the total pumping period per month was generated using pumping period per month and pumping capacity average monthly pumped water was computed which was considered as the monthly average irrigation in this study monthly irrigation monthly pumped water pumping period per month pumping capacity spatially distributed monthly irrigation maps were produced from this data using the spline interpolation method with barriers ascii irrigation maps were produced from this data using the spline interpolation method with barriers for the model as inputs this interpolation method was used because it has a higher tolerance to the effects of errors and needs fewer observations resulting in improved results in practice zong et al 2018 irrigation data was obtained upazila wise which means the same set of data prevails within a particular upazila so an additional barrier technique was used with spline interpolation to distribute the same raster value within each upazila boundary 2 3 1 estimation of discharge upazila wise monthly irrigation depth was computed from the total monthly discharge of a pump and irrigated area monthly discharge was calculated from pumping capacity average daily pumping hour and number of pumping days in each month actual pump capacity was estimated considering 80 pumping efficiency because the pumping efficiency is decreasing day by day with respect to time pumping capacity pumping efficiency and information on average daily pumping hours and number of pumping days table 1 were collected and verified through stakeholders discussions a face to face stakeholder s workshop was not possible because of the ongoing pandemic so several one to one discussions were performed with different stakeholders including representatives of local farmers bangladesh government irrigation management authorities like bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc barind multipurpose development authority bmda department of agricultural extension dae and researchers from bangladesh agricultural university bau the stakeholders shared their practical experiences and provided information about the number performance discharge and existing conditions of irrigation equipment based on the per day pumping hours the minimum range of pump operating time was used to calculate minimum irrigation maps and maximum range of pump operating time used to prepare maximum irrigation maps 2 3 2 current irrigation status fig 4 illustrates the annual total irrigated area of rajshahi district by different irrigation equipment from 2006 to 2016 the data showed the total irrigated area remained somewhat constant throughout the study period an increase in area under deep tubewells dtw operated irrigation was observed 112 530 ha from 78 949 ha in contrast the total amount of irrigated area under shallow tubewells stw decreased over the 11 years amounting to 42 114 ha from 72 567 ha the irrigation supply from the low lift pump llp showed a considerable decline 7869 ha from 16 414 ha over the study period in general groundwater fed irrigated area increased 154 644 ha from 151 516 ha over the period even though the number of shallow tubewells declined this might be caused by the widespread use of deep tubewell water for agriculture also bmda badc and dae developed new deep tubewells in these 11 years as a result the use of dtws increased drastically to get the necessary irrigation water mainuddin et al 2019 reported similar findings in northwestern bangladesh overall the groundwater fed irrigated area was greater than the surface water fed irrigated area however the rate of change in total irrigated areas was inconsistent fig 5 illustrates the upazila wise average irrigation application rate the highest average irrigation rate was applied in puthia upazilla 150 mm month closely followed by charghat 136 mm month conversely the lowest average irrigation was in tanore 60 mm month fig 5 shows the average irrigation application rate for the dry season in which january has the highest irrigation rate which amounted to 357 mm month january was followed by march 344 mm month february 302 mm month april 130 mm month december 89 mm month and finally november 59 mm month monthly variation in irrigation is closely connected with crop type november and december months need low irrigation because various winter crops like pulses potato mustard winter vegetables etc which requires less water are cultivated in these two months from january farmers start rice cultivation in this area irrigation water requirement increases in january as rice requires great amount of water in that time due to puddling however irrigation requirement decreases again in april as crop water requirement decreases in the harvesting stage fig 6 the monthly average irrigation depths of the rajshahi district are shown in fig 7 groundwater fed irrigation and fig 8 surface water fed irrigation the average minimum and maximum irrigation depths were 94 mm month and 119 mm month respectively and the mean irrigation depth was 107 mm month however the depth of irrigation requirement was different in different locations and different months of the season the rate of groundwater and surface water irrigation was vastly different figs 7 and 8 show the monthly distribution of groundwater and surface water irrigation in different upazilas in the rajshahi district in january the highest average groundwater irrigation was observed in the whole district to be 327 mm month in contrast to only 30 mm month from surface water for groundwater irrigation puthia and charghat had the highest average rates of 150 and 135 mm month respectively in contrast these two upazilas showed little to almost no surface water irrigation 0 and 1 mm month respectively the lowest average groundwater irrigation was found in tanore 51 mm month and mohanpur 67 mm month tanore had moderately low surface water irrigation 9 mm month on the other hand mohanpur topped the surface water irrigation rate at 53 mm month this variability was mainly because of the number of the irrigation equipments i e dtw stw llp etc in different upazilas different sources of surface water irrigation are river ponds and reservoirs in this region in general groundwater irrigation out quantified surface water irrigation over the rajshahi district around 91 of the total irrigation was extracted from groundwater while the remaining 9 was from surface water sources csiro 2014 reported that nearly 100 of the total irrigation in the northwest zone was being supplied from a groundwater source 2 4 model inputs the required input data of the wetspass model groundwater depth rainfall temperature windspeed soil irrigation were collected for a period of 11 years 2006 2016 groundwater depth data were collected from the barind multipurpose development authority bmda and bangladesh water development board bwdb meteorological data rainfall temperature and wind speed recorded by bangladesh meteorological department bmd and bwdb were collected from the water resources planning organization warpo of bangladesh reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated from maximum and minimum temperature using the et0 calculator based on the fao penman monteith equation eq 2 fao 2009 2 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2

evapotranspiration pet in this study et0 was used to avoid crop related ambiguities derived from pet and et0 is also far more widely used in agriculture and irrigation studies xiang et al 2020 table 2 summarizes the data used in this study along with their sources all data were processed using gis software arcmap 10 5 for interpolation in this case inverse distance weighting idw method was used for its simplicity and good performance compared to other methods hodam et al 2017 a multi step spatial data processing tool using arcgis model builder was developed to automate the creation process of raster maps the soil texture map of soil resource development institute srdi was collected from warpo and reclassified according to wetspass soil classes the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was used as the elevation model the slope map was prepared from the dem dry seasonal land use map of 2016 processed by siddik 2021 was used as land use input of the model the model inputs are described in table 2 2 5 calibration of the model in situ data of actual evapotranspiration aet and discharge in the study area are not present the generated data sets were evaluated using 1 available groundwater recharge from other studies in the same study area and 2 available remote sensing rs aet products at first the simulated recharge was evaluated using the available groundwater recharge from other studies in the same area details in section 3 2 additionally the model performance has been evaluated using available remote sensing evapotranspiration products research shows that rs based aet can be a suitable alternative to actual data in areas where in situ measurements are not available weerasinghe et al 2020 this study used three widely used rs aet products to assess the model performance the products are the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod16 algorithm modis mu et al 2007 2011 simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2013 and terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 the result shows that rs aet and simulated aet are in good agreement fig 9 it is observed that the model is slightly underestimating the low values of the aet however temporal and seasonal variation of the aet is very well captured by the model which confirms an acceptable simulation capacity of the wetspass model 2 6 2 6 irrigation impact analysis a spatially distributed water balance model wetspass was used to evaluate the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge groundwater recharge was simulated with two scenarios irrigation was considered as an additional input along with other inputs in the first scenario while in the second scenario groundwater recharge was simulated without considering irrigation as input finally the impact of irrigation was evaluated by comparing the simulated groundwater recharge in the two scenarios fig 1 net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation has been calculated using the following equation to evaluate the overall impact of irrigation on the aquifer net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation irrigation water returned irrigation return flow irrigation water pumped from groundwater the positive value of the equation means the increase of groundwater level of the aquifer and negative value indicated depletion of groundwater level in the aquifer 2 7 effects of resolution all the input grid maps having a resolution of 30 m 30 m were resampled into 300 m 300 m to examine the impact of resolution differences the complete modeling methodology and analytical processes were repeated with the newly resampled maps time required for simulation process for both 30 m and 300 m resolution were recorded then the results and time requirement were compared with the results of 30 m resolution 2 8 methods and tools used for different analyses the statistical significance of the results was checked by mann whitney and kruskal wallis tests using the python scipy module for various data and result analysis and plotting python packages like numpy pandas and matplotlib were used for geospatial analysis and mapping gis applications arcgis 10 5 and qgis 3 6 and python package rasterio were used the modeling simulations were performed using a computer having an intel core i5 4210 u 1 70 ghz processor and 4 gb ram 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of abstraction for irrigation on groundwater depth fig 10 represents the time series of different hydrological components including trend of groundwater irrigation and corresponding groundwater depth from 2006 to 2016 of rajshahi district and also standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at the timescale of 3 months the figure shows that irrigation rate and groundwater depth increase over the years fig 10a b the average groundwater depth was 8 4 m in 2006 and increased to 25 5 m in 2016 a noteworthy increase in groundwater depth was noticed in 2010 2011 this might be as a result of combined effect of overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation in 2010 11 season and multi year meteorological drought in 2009 2010 afrin et al 2019 there was an increase in groundwater irrigation in the 2007 08 season even though the depth remained somewhat the same this was likely due to the prolonged period of surplus water from rainfall during 2007 2008 the use of groundwater for irrigation increased significantly from 2010 11 with the exception of 2012 13 the decrease in groundwater use for irrigation in 2012 13 could be explained by the wet weather positive spei in the 2012 13 season as shown in fig 10c this study used spei calculator developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 to estimate monthly spei the software takes monthly total rainfall and mean temperature as inputs monthly potential evapotranspiration pet was computed from temperature by the thornthwaite method sellinger 1996 thornthwaite 1948 in the spei calculator finally monthly spei was estimated from rainfall and pet series in general the rate of groundwater irrigation was observed to have some effects on changes in groundwater depth therefore groundwater abstraction for irrigation is one of the main factors but not the only factor influencing increase in groundwater depth or overall groundwater level depletion in this region 3 2 groundwater recharge without considering irrigation fig 11 shows the monthly rainfall in secondary axis and monthly groundwater recharge aet and surface runoff without consideration of irrigation it indicates that recharge aet and runoff had a similar trend to rainfall over the study period recharge was relatively higher in the wet season may to october than in the dry season november to april this was due to more significant rainfall in wet season and little to no rainfall in the dry season rushton et al 2020 also reported similar results considering a similar pumping period average monthly recharge varied between 0 2 mm january and 83 mm july averaging at 28 mm month average annual recharge ranged from 221 mm to 524 mm the average being 330 mm these findings are similar to shamsudduha et al 2011 in which they reported that the annual groundwater recharge varied from 250 mm to 600 mm mustafa et al 2017 also observed annual recharge to be in between 230 mm and 660 mm in northwest bangladesh however the recharge rate was not uniform over the study area 3 3 irrigation return flow monthly average irrigation along with irrigation return flow actual evapotranspiration aet surface runoff are presented in fig 12 it shows a similar pattern between these entities there was no return flow aet and runoff in the wet months may to october as no irrigation was considered in the wet months in these months there was usually enough rainfall for crops thus agriculture in the wet period was rain fed and no irrigation application was assumed which meant no return flow during the wet period on the other hand irrigation was the only source of water during the dry season because of insufficient rainfall the average annual return flow was 353 mm the average monthly return flow was highest in january 120 mm and lowest in november 10 mm highest and lowest values of aet was found in january 88 65 mm and november 30 86 mm similarly highest and lowest values of runoff were also found in january 90 91 mm and november 14 56 mm respectively this was likely because january has the highest rate of irrigation and november has the lowest the return flow was 20 50 of irrigation on average 33 of irrigation returned to groundwater as recharge dewandel et al 2008 reported 44 52 and 20 28 return flow from total irrigation for rice and vegetables respectively during the dry season in semi arid india ebrahimi et al 2016 and jafari et al 2019 reported that the rate of return flow is 15 2 and 15 respectively in arid west and southeast iran the months with high irrigation had a higher return flow percentage compared to the months with lower irrigation supplies the monthly average rates of irrigation along with return flow are shown in fig 13 from the study approximately one third of the applied irrigation went back to the aquifer as return flow this indicates excess amount of irrigation water loss rashid et al 2009 found that water loss could be up to 45 in boro season while dey et al 2013 found that 21 3 of irrigation water was unnecessary this unwarranted lift of water decreased the overall irrigation efficiency fig 14 illustrates monthly average groundwater recharge and return flow from the rainfall and irrigation respectively the results show that aquifers are mainly recharged from rainfall during the monsoon and return flow from irrigation is the main source of groundwater recharge during the dry season in the dry seasons irrigation is the main source of water for different crops groundwater recharge is also predominant from this irrigation in the dry season the rainfall amount is very small during the dry season and thus groundwater recharge from rainfall is also very insignificant on the other hand in the wet season there are adequate amount of rainfall occurs in that region that s why groundwater recharge is mainly from rainfall in the wet season the amount of rainfall in the wet season is very similar to the amount of irrigation in the dry season the average maximum rainfall was occurred in july having 262 mm rainfall the groundwater recharge was 83 mm which was mainly from rainfall the average maximum irrigation was found in january having 261 mm the irrigation return flow this month was 144 mm although having similar values for rainfall in july and irrigation in january the recharge value is much higher for irrigation than rainfall this happened because the value of surface runoff is insignificant for irrigation because this is applied only to agricultural fields on the other hand a large portion of rainfall is diverted as surface runoff which results in less recharge a report published by international rice research institute stated that bangladesh has the lowest irrigation efficiency in the region 117 60 hectare compared to india thailand and vietnam the daily star 2008 hence water saving methods are necessary to reduce loss and increase efficiency borrell et al 1997 experimented with raised beds in australia and reported 34 water saving over flooded rice fahong et al 2004 used furrow irrigation during winter in china and found 30 water saving over flood irrigation cao et al 2019 showed that irrigation scheduling could significantly reduce the amount of irrigation for rice cultivation compared to conventional irrigation rainwater harvesting velasco muñoz et al 2019 alternative cropping systems zhao et al 2021 and deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2006 can also be used as water savings methods for sustainable groundwater water management other measures like alternate wetting and drying awd flush sprinkler drip irrigation could also be useful for water saving bouman et al 2007 however mojid and mainuddin 2021 and mainuddin et al 2020 claimed that groundwater level is not depleted due to excessive groundwater abstraction for irrigation because excess irrigation water goes back to groundwater as return flow they also highlighted the negative impact of the different water saving technologies on groundwater dynamics indeed excess irrigation water returns to groundwater as a return flow however in this study area net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation was negative as groundwater abstraction for irrigation is higher than the irrigation return flow meaning the depletion of groundwater level in the dry season detailed investigation on the influence of different irrigation water saving methods on groundwater systems has been done including probable negative impacts 3 4 impact of irrigation on spatially distributed recharge recharge was simulated considering the minimum and maximum rate of irrigation for the six dry months november april without irrigation the average recharge was 8 mm year in the dry season with irrigation the average recharge was found to be 313 and 409 mm year for minimum and maximum rates respectively in the dry season spatially distributed monthly average groundwater recharge for maximum irrigation minimum irrigation and without irrigation are shown in fig 15 fig a1 appendix and fig 16 respectively the contribution of irrigation as irrigation return flow was 305 and 401 mm year for minimum and maximum rates respectively the results revealed that there is a significant p 0 05 95 confidence level influence of irrigation return flow on groundwater recharge in the dry season over the whole study area spatially varied irrigation return flow rates for both maximum and minimum irrigation are shown in figs 17 and a2 appendix respectively from both figures the central east upazilas puthia and durgapur had the most pronounced effects of return flow on recharge the northern upazilas such as tanore and bagha in contrast has the lowest contribution of return flow the difference was caused by the difference in irrigation rates in the upazilas the upazilas with higher irrigation showed greater influence of irrigation return flow on recharge considering the months january showed the highest return flow rates due to highest irrigation rate on the other hand november had a smaller contribution due to lower irrigation rate 3 5 3 5 impact of irrigation return flow on the groundwater system fig 18 illustrates the monthly average total recharge and the contribution of the irrigation return flow to the groundwater recharge system in the dry season november april irrigation return flow was the main source of the groundwater recharge system the month of november and april had a lower return flow percentage compared to other dry seasons because these two months had little rainfall that contributed to the groundwater recharge the average total groundwater recharge in the dry season was 428 mm where the contribution of return flow was 420 mm 98 20 jafari et al 2019 have also reported that the contribution of return flow to groundwater recharge was 81 3 in the arid part of iran 3 6 net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation fig 18 shows the mean monthly net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation from 2006 to 2016 the net recharge from irrigation is calculated from the groundwater recharge from irrigation minus irrigation water pumped from groundwater it is observed that net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation is always negative indicating the depletion of groundwater level in the aquifer although on average 33 of the irrigation water returned to the aquifer the rest 67 of the water remains in the surface environment discussed in 3 3 irrigation return flow this causes the groundwater level declining day by day in the dry season as the water pumped from the groundwater is higher than the recharge from irrigation the values of net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation are negative here the values from may to october are ignored as this study is done considering dry months november to april only it shows there is a very large depletion of groundwater levels during the dry season fig 19 on the other hand the aquifer is partially replenishing again in the rainy season fig 14 as groundwater recharge in the rainy season is adding to the aquifer and the is only very limited abstraction of groundwater from supplemental irrigation however overall depletion of groundwater is higher than replenishment and that s why groundwater depth is continuously increasing in this area fig 10 fig 20 shows the spatial and temporal variation of monthly average net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation during dry season nov to april average monthly net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation is changing from 392 mm month to 0 mm month the negative value indicates depletion of groundwater level of an aquifer although excessive irrigation water can be returned back to the aquifer as a return flow however net recharge to the aquifer is negative due to overexploitation of the aquifer for irrigation so groundwater abstraction for irrigation should be reduced by adopting different water saving methods details on section 3 3 in the agricultural fields to reduce the depletion of groundwater levels additionally excessive abstraction of groundwater cause a steady increase in sulphur and calcium that worsen the water quality gejl et al 2019 excessive abstraction of groundwater can also have a negative impact on carbon footprint long term excessive abstraction of groundwater contributes to an increase ch4 budget gooddy and darling 2005 kulongoski and mcmahon 2019 different irrigation improvement measures should be adopted and details study on the effect of irrigation return flow on overall groundwater effect should be done and simulated to obtain more accurate results a detailed study should be conducted to know the actual amount of carbon and other materials mix up with the groundwater due to excessive abstraction 3 7 effect of spatial scaling fig 21 shows average groundwater recharge maps considering the irrigation of january of both 30 m and 300 m resolution overall the results indicated that the difference in average recharge was 0 6 mm year and 0 05 mm month while the difference due to average irrigation was 0 3 mm year when impact of irrigation was considered the simulation time for one year groundwater recharge using 300 m resolution inputs was 15 2 min which was 22 times faster than the time required for simulation using 30 m resolution inputs 339 4 min year ovarall the changes from different resolutions were relatively small eventhough simulation with 300 m resolution was much faster and less time consuming however the lower resolution irrigation maps had problems with accurate representation of irrigation rates a raster cell had only one specific value within its area so a 300 m raster grid having an area of 90000 sq m is homogeneous for specific input on the other hand for a raster of 30 m resolution the area of homogeneity is 900 sq m grid area areas with a smaller size than 90000 sq m were not included and represented precisely in a raster of 300 m resolution this results in smaller areas of a certain irrigation rate beign lumped into another irrigation rate value in a lower resolution raster map which in turn results in incorrect groundwater recharge calculations in those smaller areas for example fig 22 portrays some of the comparisons between maps of both resolutions the black circles indicates the special interest zones the small areas black circle marked in the raster map of 30 m having 0 mm month irrigation fig 22 a and recharge fig 22 c were absent in the corresponding raster maps of 300 m fig 22 b and 21 d respectively this was a misrepresentation of spatially distributed irrigation and result of recharge for example in the airport area where there is no chance of irrigation and recharge 300 m maps may misinterpret the built up zone with the vegetative region so the heterogeneity of spatial irrigation value was lost to some degree in the lower resolution maps hence studies requiring high precision on small areas will need raster maps of higher resolution 4 conclusions the study focused on assessing the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge in the northwest bangladeshi district of rajshahi groundwater recharge was estimated using a water balance model wetspass considering two different scenarios i irrigation as an additional input and ii without irrigation as an input finally the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge and the contribution of irrigation return flow to the groundwater system was analyzed deep tube wells fed irrigated area increased in the rajshahi area from 2006 2016 however the total irrigated area in rajshahi remained constant surface water fed irrigated area decreased slightly the highest irrigation rate was in puthia upazila sub district while the lowest was found in tanore around 91 of overall irrigation came from groundwater with the remaining 9 originating from surface water the trends of irrigation rate and groundwater depth revealed an increase in irrigation and groundwater depth the parallel trend showed that groundwater abstraction for irrigation could be a reason for water table depletion the average return flow was 353 mm year it was highest in january and lowest in november 20 50 of the total irrigation was observed to be return flow 33 on average around 98 of the groundwater recharge came from irrigation return flow during the dry season the spatially distributed return flow ranged from 305 to 401 mm year it contributed significantly during the dry season to groundwater recharge in the study area the highest return flow was in central right upazilas puthia and charghat and the lowest was in northern upazilas tanore and bagha the scaling analysis showed a very small change in model simulation results for both 30 m and 300 m spatial resolutions there was a substantial reduction in recharge simulation time with 300 m resolution inputs compared to 30 m raster maps however the raster maps of the lower resolution were not good for detailed analysis therefore the use of lower resolution inputs can only be recommended when a quick investigation is required over precision analysis finally it could be concluded that irrigation has a significant impact on groundwater recharge during the dry season in rajshahi district of bangladesh and that irrigation return flow was the main source of groundwater recharge in the dry season however a huge quantity of groundwater still leaves the system due to excessive pumping therefore effective irrigation management including efficient irrigation application methods and better irrigation scheduling is necessary to keep the groundwater sustainable in the study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix see fig a1 a2 
9559,irrigation is vital in bangladesh in order to meet the growing food demand as a result of the increasing population during the dry season groundwater irrigation is the main source of water for agriculture however excessive abstraction of groundwater for irrigation causes groundwater level depletion at the same time the loss from excessive irrigation could end up contributing to aquifer recharge as return flow therefore investigating the influence of irrigation on groundwater is important for the sustainable management of this resource this study aims to assess the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge in the northwest rajshahi district in bangladesh a semi physically based water balance model was used to simulate spatially distributed groundwater recharge with two scenarios with and without irrigation to evaluate the effect of irrigation groundwater recharges from these two scenarios were compared the result showed that the use of groundwater for irrigation increased over the study period whereas there was a persistent trend of decrease in groundwater level during the study period groundwater provides 91 of overall irrigation in the study area however on average about 33 of the total irrigation becomes return flow and contributes to groundwater recharge in the dry season irrigation return flow is around 98 of the total recharge during the dry season in this region the spatially distributed seasonal return flow varies from 305 to 401 mm in brief irrigation has a significant role in groundwater recharge in the study area during the dry season hence proper irrigation water measurement and management are necessary for sustainable groundwater resource management in this region keywords groundwater recharge irrigation irrigation return flow water

request syed mustafa abdn ac uk 1 introduction groundwater has always been an important and reliable source of water providing around 97 of freshwater around the world jakeman et al 2016 in semi arid regions groundwater is often the only constant source of water throughout the year usman et al 2015 groundwater recharge is one of the governing factors of the regional groundwater system groundwater recharge variation in spatial and temporal aspects as well as difficulties in its direct measurement healy 2010 makes it one of the least understood components of the hydrological system groundwater is mainly recharged by rainfall and surface water sources like reservoirs and rivers liu and yamanaka 2012 besides these irrigation and irrigation return flow could be a significant source of aquifer recharge in agriculture dominated areas jiménez martínez et al 2009 séraphin et al 2016 irrigation return flow is defined as the excess of irrigation water that is not evapotranspirated or evacuated by direct surface drainage and which finally returns to an aquifer dewandel et al 2008 and could contribute a substantial quantity to regional water resources cruz fuentes et al 2014 kendy et al 2004 scanlon et al 2007 irrigation water is usually obtained from surface water or groundwater sources a certain portion of irrigation water is evaporated from the soil surface or transpirated by plants while a part of is discharged from agriculture fields as surface runoff to streams or drainage canals the remaining water infiltrates into the soil and percolates to the groundwater this excess water returning to the underlying aquifer is referred to as irrigation return flow rushton et al 2020 in shallow aquifers a large part of irrigation returns to groundwater neumann et al 2009 irrigated agriculture in bangladesh relies heavily on groundwater as of 2019 groundwater is the source of irrigation water in 79 of irrigated areas in bangladesh mainuddin et al 2019 in the northwest region groundwater which is extracted mainly by shallow and deep tube wells supplies about 95 of the total irrigation water mojid et al 2019 the adoption of dry season boro rice and other crops substantially increased the groundwater demand in this region peña arancibia et al 2020 the cultivation of boro rice is important for national food security as it supplies over 55 of the total national production of rice mainuddin et al 2019 mainuddin and kirby 2015 on average boro rice covers 61 of the total cropped area of bangladesh during the rabi season october january bbs 2012 in the boro season water loss can be up to 45 in rice fields mainuddin et al 2020 rashid et al 2009 dey et al 2013 found that 21 3 of water abstracted for boro rice irrigation is unnecessary in the northwest region the excess water from irrigation could percolate from rice fields and reach the underlying aquifer as irrigated recharge during the dry season rushton et al 2020 moreover this excessive irrigation may act as an important source of replenishing aquifer levels however this is not clear yet study on the contribution of this excess water to the water budget system is scarce worldwide therefore a detailed investigation of irrigation and its influence on recharge is vital in policy making to ensure groundwater sustainability globally as well as in the semi arid region like bangladesh researchers have taken various attempts to find out the influence and contribution of irrigation return flow to groundwater recharge liu et al 2004 showed that 21 2 23 4 of irrigation water contributes to recharging in terraced paddy fields dewandel et al 2008 found that return flow ranged from 43 to 59 for rice and 15 37 for vegetables from pumped irrigation water ebrahimi et al 2016 observed that 15 2 of the total irrigation water returns to aquifer as return flow in western iran vallet coulomb et al 2017 quantified irrigation return flow and reported that annual return flow was 1190 140 mm constituting 51 86 of the total irrigation other studies around the world have also shown that the irrigation return flow coefficients vary from 2 to over 50 for different crops under various management practices bethune et al 2001 causapé et al 2004 jafari et al 2019 jalota and arora 2002 kim et al 2009 meyer et al 1987 meyer and mateos 1990 steiner et al 1985 willis et al 1997 most of the studies mentioned above measured only an annual value of irrigation return flow in the respective study area and spatial and temporal variation of the irrigation return flow has not been considered however understanding the spatio temporal variation of different hydrological components is important to ensure sustainable groundwater resources management taie semiromi and koch 2019 nevertheless very limited studies have been conducted so far on spatio temporal variation of irrigation return flow and its impact on groundwater recharge more research is needed to understand the spatio temporal variation of irrigation return flow and its impact on the groundwater system mair et al 2013 waibel et al 2013 researchers in hydro geo logy have been using spatially distributed groundwater models to understand climatic and anthropogenic influences on groundwater systems to provide sufficient decision making information barbosa et al 2022 mustafa et al 2019 a spatially distributed return flow is an essential variable for a groundwater flow model parameterization in an overexploited aquifer mustafa et al 2018 nolte et al 2021 however there is very limited information available about that research with details on the spatio temporal variation of the return flow would also be very helpful for the hydrological modeler community to improve the reliability of the model prediction by reducing the uncertainty on the other hand although researchers around the world have investigated the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge as far as the authors are aware a very limited study has been conducted in bangladesh so it is crucial to study on the estimation of spatially distributed irrigation return flow and their impact on groundwater recharge in that region estimating recharge is a complicated process as it varies with different factors like soil climate land cover and topography batelaan and de smedt 2007 groundwater recharge estimation can be accomplished by the water table fluctuation wtf method water budget method darcy s law empirical relationships groundwater models and tracer techniques islam et al 2016 the water table fluctuation method is only applicable for unconfined aquifers and tracer techniques are very time consuming for this reason the water budget method was used in this study because of its application over a wide range of space and time variables scanlon et al 2002 a semi physically based water balance model wetspass water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state abdollahi et al 2017 batelaan and de smedt 2007 is used in this study to measure spatial and temporal variability of monthly groundwater recharge which makes it suitable for the objectives of this study therefore the general objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge in the rajshahi district of bangladesh specific objectives of this study are to i evaluate the current status of irrigation and its impact on groundwater level ii simulate recharge considering irrigation as input with other input variables and also without irrigation iii simulate recharge without irrigation iv assess simulated recharge relation with rainfall and soil texture v assess the contribution of irrigation in the total water balance vi estimate the irrigation return flow and evaluate its impact on the groundwater recharge vii quantify the spatial and temporal variation of the irrigation return flow and evaluate its impact on the groundwater system furthermore maps of various resolutions are used as inputs to investigate the scaling effects of raster resolution the results of the study will deliver information on the influences of irrigation on spatially distributed recharge and help with effective irrigation planning in northwest bangladesh especially in the rajshahi district 2 methodology a multi step methodology was applied in this study to evaluate the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge at first hydrometeorological soil elevation land use and irrigation data were collected from various sources secondly these data were processed and grid maps were prepared to use as model inputs thirdly the monthly groundwater recharge was simulated by wetspass finally the effects of irrigation return flow were analyzed from irrigated and non irrigated recharge fig 1 shows the conceptual methodology of this study 2 1 study area the agriculture dominated rajshahi district in northwestern bangladesh was chosen for this study the geographic location of the study area is between 24 12 and 24 72 northern latitude and 88 28 and 88 97 eastern longitude the total area is 2407 km2 approximately 1588 km2 of the total area is under cultivation whereas 1229 km2 of agricultural land has a proper irrigation facility the district is divided into 9 upazila sub district as depicted in fig 2 the study area is situated in the sub tropical climate region the mean annual rainfall for the period of 1964 2009 is 1505 mm which is lower than the national average of 2408 mm ghosh et al 2015 the temperature rises above 40 c during the summer but falls below 5 c in winter the mean relative humidity varies from 60 to 88 haque et al 2012 the area is a part of the ganges basin consisting primarily of riverine alluvium the soil textures include sand silty loam loam clay loam etc the aquifer formation is of unconsolidated sedimentary type allison et al 2003 according to several hydrogeological studies conducted in the region the upper aquifers are unconfined or semi confined with thicknesses varying from 10 to 40 m asad uz zaman and rushton 2006 faisal et al 2005 jahani and ahmed 1997 michael and voss 2009 rahman and shahid 2004 the digital elevation model dem shows that rajshahi is 23 m above the mean sea level although the elevation varies up to 62 m over the last two decades the study area is facing a decreasing trend in groundwater level the water table of most of the shallow tubewells in this area falls below the suction lift limit 6 m mojid et al 2019 although some of them maintain a cycle of fluctuation most of the tubewells fail to lift water in the dry season dey and ali 2010 moreover the introduction of high yield rice varieties has expanded irrigation fed agriculture in the study area adhikary et al 2013 and increased crop intensity rahman and mahbub 2012 2 2 wetspass model monthly groundwater recharge is simulated using a semiphysically based water balance model wetspass water and energy transfer between soil plants and atmosphere under quasi steady state abdollahi et al 2017 batelaan and de smedt 2007 the model uses climatic data together with topography land cover and soil mapping to estimate average spatial patterns of surface run off actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge batelaan and de smedt 2001 the model recognizes any region as a regular pattern of raster cells each raster cell is divided into four fractions vegetated bare soil open water and impervious the water balance components are calculated individually for each cell from the inputs the water balance equation for a cell can be expressed as 1 p ir sr et int r where p is precipitation ir is irrigation sr is surface runoff et is evapotranspiration int is interception and r is groundwater recharge according to eq 1 precipitation and irrigation are considered the source of water in the model depending on the land use of the simulating cell the model at first calculates interception as a percentage of water input p ir after that sr is calculated considering various factors such as land use slope soil moisture condition soil texture etc then et is estimated from the sum of actual evapotranspiration of the four land use subdivisions open water vegetated bare soil and impervious for each cell et is the sum of evaporation from soil surface and transpiration from plants in bare soil and open water land use only evaporation is considered the actual evapotranspiration of each land use subdivision is estimated from the pet of the cell finally recharge is estimated from the residual part of the water balance equation the grids are not horizontally connected and therefore there is no horizontal movement of water like a process based model however slope is a variable in water balance calculation so there is an indirect effect of horizontal movement of water abdollahi et al 2017 batelaan and de smedt 2007 fig 3 shows the water balance components in this study each raster cell resolution was taken 30 m 30 m this model has been effectively used in different climatic conditions around the world abdollahi et al 2017 armanuos and negm 2016 meresa and taye 2019 mustafa et al 2017 2018 2019 salem et al 2019 in order to use this kind of model spatially distributed higher resolution raster data is required resolution plays a vital role in raster data analysis arnone et al 2016 coarser resolution often leads to lower accuracy in results cama et al 2016 however finer resolution might require higher computational performance arnone et al 2016 on the other hand time is valuable in policy planning especially when results are required within a short time therefore researchers have to consider the computational performance as well as the required accuracy level of their analysis calder and mayer 2003 maleika 2015 2 3 irrigation irrigation data from dry season november to april agricultural activities was collected and analyzed in the study to evaluate the effect of irrigation on groundwater recharge supplemental irrigation data from wet months may to october were excluded from the analysis of groundwater recharge estimation due to unpredictable pumping for rainfed agriculture upazila sub district wise number of irrigation pumps i e deep tube wells dtw shallow tube wells stw and low lift pumps llps and their irrigated area for the period of 2006 2016 were collected from minor irrigation survey report recorded by bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc barind multipurpose development authority bmda and department of agricultural extension dae and published as a report by badc in general pumping capacities for shallow tubewells depth 80 m below ground level deep tubewells depth 80 m below ground level and low lift pumps are assumed to be 0 5 2 and 1 cusec respectively badc 2019 bbs 2009 undp 1982 irrigation map layers were produced assuming that only cultivated vegetated land types would need irrigation irrigation was considered zero for the remaining 3 land cover types i e bare soil open water and impervious based on stakeholder discussion details in section 2 3 1 the total pumping period per month was generated using pumping period per month and pumping capacity average monthly pumped water was computed which was considered as the monthly average irrigation in this study monthly irrigation monthly pumped water pumping period per month pumping capacity spatially distributed monthly irrigation maps were produced from this data using the spline interpolation method with barriers ascii irrigation maps were produced from this data using the spline interpolation method with barriers for the model as inputs this interpolation method was used because it has a higher tolerance to the effects of errors and needs fewer observations resulting in improved results in practice zong et al 2018 irrigation data was obtained upazila wise which means the same set of data prevails within a particular upazila so an additional barrier technique was used with spline interpolation to distribute the same raster value within each upazila boundary 2 3 1 estimation of discharge upazila wise monthly irrigation depth was computed from the total monthly discharge of a pump and irrigated area monthly discharge was calculated from pumping capacity average daily pumping hour and number of pumping days in each month actual pump capacity was estimated considering 80 pumping efficiency because the pumping efficiency is decreasing day by day with respect to time pumping capacity pumping efficiency and information on average daily pumping hours and number of pumping days table 1 were collected and verified through stakeholders discussions a face to face stakeholder s workshop was not possible because of the ongoing pandemic so several one to one discussions were performed with different stakeholders including representatives of local farmers bangladesh government irrigation management authorities like bangladesh agricultural development corporation badc barind multipurpose development authority bmda department of agricultural extension dae and researchers from bangladesh agricultural university bau the stakeholders shared their practical experiences and provided information about the number performance discharge and existing conditions of irrigation equipment based on the per day pumping hours the minimum range of pump operating time was used to calculate minimum irrigation maps and maximum range of pump operating time used to prepare maximum irrigation maps 2 3 2 current irrigation status fig 4 illustrates the annual total irrigated area of rajshahi district by different irrigation equipment from 2006 to 2016 the data showed the total irrigated area remained somewhat constant throughout the study period an increase in area under deep tubewells dtw operated irrigation was observed 112 530 ha from 78 949 ha in contrast the total amount of irrigated area under shallow tubewells stw decreased over the 11 years amounting to 42 114 ha from 72 567 ha the irrigation supply from the low lift pump llp showed a considerable decline 7869 ha from 16 414 ha over the study period in general groundwater fed irrigated area increased 154 644 ha from 151 516 ha over the period even though the number of shallow tubewells declined this might be caused by the widespread use of deep tubewell water for agriculture also bmda badc and dae developed new deep tubewells in these 11 years as a result the use of dtws increased drastically to get the necessary irrigation water mainuddin et al 2019 reported similar findings in northwestern bangladesh overall the groundwater fed irrigated area was greater than the surface water fed irrigated area however the rate of change in total irrigated areas was inconsistent fig 5 illustrates the upazila wise average irrigation application rate the highest average irrigation rate was applied in puthia upazilla 150 mm month closely followed by charghat 136 mm month conversely the lowest average irrigation was in tanore 60 mm month fig 5 shows the average irrigation application rate for the dry season in which january has the highest irrigation rate which amounted to 357 mm month january was followed by march 344 mm month february 302 mm month april 130 mm month december 89 mm month and finally november 59 mm month monthly variation in irrigation is closely connected with crop type november and december months need low irrigation because various winter crops like pulses potato mustard winter vegetables etc which requires less water are cultivated in these two months from january farmers start rice cultivation in this area irrigation water requirement increases in january as rice requires great amount of water in that time due to puddling however irrigation requirement decreases again in april as crop water requirement decreases in the harvesting stage fig 6 the monthly average irrigation depths of the rajshahi district are shown in fig 7 groundwater fed irrigation and fig 8 surface water fed irrigation the average minimum and maximum irrigation depths were 94 mm month and 119 mm month respectively and the mean irrigation depth was 107 mm month however the depth of irrigation requirement was different in different locations and different months of the season the rate of groundwater and surface water irrigation was vastly different figs 7 and 8 show the monthly distribution of groundwater and surface water irrigation in different upazilas in the rajshahi district in january the highest average groundwater irrigation was observed in the whole district to be 327 mm month in contrast to only 30 mm month from surface water for groundwater irrigation puthia and charghat had the highest average rates of 150 and 135 mm month respectively in contrast these two upazilas showed little to almost no surface water irrigation 0 and 1 mm month respectively the lowest average groundwater irrigation was found in tanore 51 mm month and mohanpur 67 mm month tanore had moderately low surface water irrigation 9 mm month on the other hand mohanpur topped the surface water irrigation rate at 53 mm month this variability was mainly because of the number of the irrigation equipments i e dtw stw llp etc in different upazilas different sources of surface water irrigation are river ponds and reservoirs in this region in general groundwater irrigation out quantified surface water irrigation over the rajshahi district around 91 of the total irrigation was extracted from groundwater while the remaining 9 was from surface water sources csiro 2014 reported that nearly 100 of the total irrigation in the northwest zone was being supplied from a groundwater source 2 4 model inputs the required input data of the wetspass model groundwater depth rainfall temperature windspeed soil irrigation were collected for a period of 11 years 2006 2016 groundwater depth data were collected from the barind multipurpose development authority bmda and bangladesh water development board bwdb meteorological data rainfall temperature and wind speed recorded by bangladesh meteorological department bmd and bwdb were collected from the water resources planning organization warpo of bangladesh reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated from maximum and minimum temperature using the et0 calculator based on the fao penman monteith equation eq 2 fao 2009 2 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 et0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2

evapotranspiration pet in this study et0 was used to avoid crop related ambiguities derived from pet and et0 is also far more widely used in agriculture and irrigation studies xiang et al 2020 table 2 summarizes the data used in this study along with their sources all data were processed using gis software arcmap 10 5 for interpolation in this case inverse distance weighting idw method was used for its simplicity and good performance compared to other methods hodam et al 2017 a multi step spatial data processing tool using arcgis model builder was developed to automate the creation process of raster maps the soil texture map of soil resource development institute srdi was collected from warpo and reclassified according to wetspass soil classes the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was used as the elevation model the slope map was prepared from the dem dry seasonal land use map of 2016 processed by siddik 2021 was used as land use input of the model the model inputs are described in table 2 2 5 calibration of the model in situ data of actual evapotranspiration aet and discharge in the study area are not present the generated data sets were evaluated using 1 available groundwater recharge from other studies in the same study area and 2 available remote sensing rs aet products at first the simulated recharge was evaluated using the available groundwater recharge from other studies in the same area details in section 3 2 additionally the model performance has been evaluated using available remote sensing evapotranspiration products research shows that rs based aet can be a suitable alternative to actual data in areas where in situ measurements are not available weerasinghe et al 2020 this study used three widely used rs aet products to assess the model performance the products are the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer mod16 algorithm modis mu et al 2007 2011 simplified surface energy balance model ssebop senay et al 2013 and terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 the result shows that rs aet and simulated aet are in good agreement fig 9 it is observed that the model is slightly underestimating the low values of the aet however temporal and seasonal variation of the aet is very well captured by the model which confirms an acceptable simulation capacity of the wetspass model 2 6 2 6 irrigation impact analysis a spatially distributed water balance model wetspass was used to evaluate the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge groundwater recharge was simulated with two scenarios irrigation was considered as an additional input along with other inputs in the first scenario while in the second scenario groundwater recharge was simulated without considering irrigation as input finally the impact of irrigation was evaluated by comparing the simulated groundwater recharge in the two scenarios fig 1 net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation has been calculated using the following equation to evaluate the overall impact of irrigation on the aquifer net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation irrigation water returned irrigation return flow irrigation water pumped from groundwater the positive value of the equation means the increase of groundwater level of the aquifer and negative value indicated depletion of groundwater level in the aquifer 2 7 effects of resolution all the input grid maps having a resolution of 30 m 30 m were resampled into 300 m 300 m to examine the impact of resolution differences the complete modeling methodology and analytical processes were repeated with the newly resampled maps time required for simulation process for both 30 m and 300 m resolution were recorded then the results and time requirement were compared with the results of 30 m resolution 2 8 methods and tools used for different analyses the statistical significance of the results was checked by mann whitney and kruskal wallis tests using the python scipy module for various data and result analysis and plotting python packages like numpy pandas and matplotlib were used for geospatial analysis and mapping gis applications arcgis 10 5 and qgis 3 6 and python package rasterio were used the modeling simulations were performed using a computer having an intel core i5 4210 u 1 70 ghz processor and 4 gb ram 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of abstraction for irrigation on groundwater depth fig 10 represents the time series of different hydrological components including trend of groundwater irrigation and corresponding groundwater depth from 2006 to 2016 of rajshahi district and also standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at the timescale of 3 months the figure shows that irrigation rate and groundwater depth increase over the years fig 10a b the average groundwater depth was 8 4 m in 2006 and increased to 25 5 m in 2016 a noteworthy increase in groundwater depth was noticed in 2010 2011 this might be as a result of combined effect of overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation in 2010 11 season and multi year meteorological drought in 2009 2010 afrin et al 2019 there was an increase in groundwater irrigation in the 2007 08 season even though the depth remained somewhat the same this was likely due to the prolonged period of surplus water from rainfall during 2007 2008 the use of groundwater for irrigation increased significantly from 2010 11 with the exception of 2012 13 the decrease in groundwater use for irrigation in 2012 13 could be explained by the wet weather positive spei in the 2012 13 season as shown in fig 10c this study used spei calculator developed by vicente serrano et al 2010 to estimate monthly spei the software takes monthly total rainfall and mean temperature as inputs monthly potential evapotranspiration pet was computed from temperature by the thornthwaite method sellinger 1996 thornthwaite 1948 in the spei calculator finally monthly spei was estimated from rainfall and pet series in general the rate of groundwater irrigation was observed to have some effects on changes in groundwater depth therefore groundwater abstraction for irrigation is one of the main factors but not the only factor influencing increase in groundwater depth or overall groundwater level depletion in this region 3 2 groundwater recharge without considering irrigation fig 11 shows the monthly rainfall in secondary axis and monthly groundwater recharge aet and surface runoff without consideration of irrigation it indicates that recharge aet and runoff had a similar trend to rainfall over the study period recharge was relatively higher in the wet season may to october than in the dry season november to april this was due to more significant rainfall in wet season and little to no rainfall in the dry season rushton et al 2020 also reported similar results considering a similar pumping period average monthly recharge varied between 0 2 mm january and 83 mm july averaging at 28 mm month average annual recharge ranged from 221 mm to 524 mm the average being 330 mm these findings are similar to shamsudduha et al 2011 in which they reported that the annual groundwater recharge varied from 250 mm to 600 mm mustafa et al 2017 also observed annual recharge to be in between 230 mm and 660 mm in northwest bangladesh however the recharge rate was not uniform over the study area 3 3 irrigation return flow monthly average irrigation along with irrigation return flow actual evapotranspiration aet surface runoff are presented in fig 12 it shows a similar pattern between these entities there was no return flow aet and runoff in the wet months may to october as no irrigation was considered in the wet months in these months there was usually enough rainfall for crops thus agriculture in the wet period was rain fed and no irrigation application was assumed which meant no return flow during the wet period on the other hand irrigation was the only source of water during the dry season because of insufficient rainfall the average annual return flow was 353 mm the average monthly return flow was highest in january 120 mm and lowest in november 10 mm highest and lowest values of aet was found in january 88 65 mm and november 30 86 mm similarly highest and lowest values of runoff were also found in january 90 91 mm and november 14 56 mm respectively this was likely because january has the highest rate of irrigation and november has the lowest the return flow was 20 50 of irrigation on average 33 of irrigation returned to groundwater as recharge dewandel et al 2008 reported 44 52 and 20 28 return flow from total irrigation for rice and vegetables respectively during the dry season in semi arid india ebrahimi et al 2016 and jafari et al 2019 reported that the rate of return flow is 15 2 and 15 respectively in arid west and southeast iran the months with high irrigation had a higher return flow percentage compared to the months with lower irrigation supplies the monthly average rates of irrigation along with return flow are shown in fig 13 from the study approximately one third of the applied irrigation went back to the aquifer as return flow this indicates excess amount of irrigation water loss rashid et al 2009 found that water loss could be up to 45 in boro season while dey et al 2013 found that 21 3 of irrigation water was unnecessary this unwarranted lift of water decreased the overall irrigation efficiency fig 14 illustrates monthly average groundwater recharge and return flow from the rainfall and irrigation respectively the results show that aquifers are mainly recharged from rainfall during the monsoon and return flow from irrigation is the main source of groundwater recharge during the dry season in the dry seasons irrigation is the main source of water for different crops groundwater recharge is also predominant from this irrigation in the dry season the rainfall amount is very small during the dry season and thus groundwater recharge from rainfall is also very insignificant on the other hand in the wet season there are adequate amount of rainfall occurs in that region that s why groundwater recharge is mainly from rainfall in the wet season the amount of rainfall in the wet season is very similar to the amount of irrigation in the dry season the average maximum rainfall was occurred in july having 262 mm rainfall the groundwater recharge was 83 mm which was mainly from rainfall the average maximum irrigation was found in january having 261 mm the irrigation return flow this month was 144 mm although having similar values for rainfall in july and irrigation in january the recharge value is much higher for irrigation than rainfall this happened because the value of surface runoff is insignificant for irrigation because this is applied only to agricultural fields on the other hand a large portion of rainfall is diverted as surface runoff which results in less recharge a report published by international rice research institute stated that bangladesh has the lowest irrigation efficiency in the region 117 60 hectare compared to india thailand and vietnam the daily star 2008 hence water saving methods are necessary to reduce loss and increase efficiency borrell et al 1997 experimented with raised beds in australia and reported 34 water saving over flooded rice fahong et al 2004 used furrow irrigation during winter in china and found 30 water saving over flood irrigation cao et al 2019 showed that irrigation scheduling could significantly reduce the amount of irrigation for rice cultivation compared to conventional irrigation rainwater harvesting velasco muñoz et al 2019 alternative cropping systems zhao et al 2021 and deficit irrigation fereres and soriano 2006 can also be used as water savings methods for sustainable groundwater water management other measures like alternate wetting and drying awd flush sprinkler drip irrigation could also be useful for water saving bouman et al 2007 however mojid and mainuddin 2021 and mainuddin et al 2020 claimed that groundwater level is not depleted due to excessive groundwater abstraction for irrigation because excess irrigation water goes back to groundwater as return flow they also highlighted the negative impact of the different water saving technologies on groundwater dynamics indeed excess irrigation water returns to groundwater as a return flow however in this study area net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation was negative as groundwater abstraction for irrigation is higher than the irrigation return flow meaning the depletion of groundwater level in the dry season detailed investigation on the influence of different irrigation water saving methods on groundwater systems has been done including probable negative impacts 3 4 impact of irrigation on spatially distributed recharge recharge was simulated considering the minimum and maximum rate of irrigation for the six dry months november april without irrigation the average recharge was 8 mm year in the dry season with irrigation the average recharge was found to be 313 and 409 mm year for minimum and maximum rates respectively in the dry season spatially distributed monthly average groundwater recharge for maximum irrigation minimum irrigation and without irrigation are shown in fig 15 fig a1 appendix and fig 16 respectively the contribution of irrigation as irrigation return flow was 305 and 401 mm year for minimum and maximum rates respectively the results revealed that there is a significant p 0 05 95 confidence level influence of irrigation return flow on groundwater recharge in the dry season over the whole study area spatially varied irrigation return flow rates for both maximum and minimum irrigation are shown in figs 17 and a2 appendix respectively from both figures the central east upazilas puthia and durgapur had the most pronounced effects of return flow on recharge the northern upazilas such as tanore and bagha in contrast has the lowest contribution of return flow the difference was caused by the difference in irrigation rates in the upazilas the upazilas with higher irrigation showed greater influence of irrigation return flow on recharge considering the months january showed the highest return flow rates due to highest irrigation rate on the other hand november had a smaller contribution due to lower irrigation rate 3 5 3 5 impact of irrigation return flow on the groundwater system fig 18 illustrates the monthly average total recharge and the contribution of the irrigation return flow to the groundwater recharge system in the dry season november april irrigation return flow was the main source of the groundwater recharge system the month of november and april had a lower return flow percentage compared to other dry seasons because these two months had little rainfall that contributed to the groundwater recharge the average total groundwater recharge in the dry season was 428 mm where the contribution of return flow was 420 mm 98 20 jafari et al 2019 have also reported that the contribution of return flow to groundwater recharge was 81 3 in the arid part of iran 3 6 net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation fig 18 shows the mean monthly net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation from 2006 to 2016 the net recharge from irrigation is calculated from the groundwater recharge from irrigation minus irrigation water pumped from groundwater it is observed that net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation is always negative indicating the depletion of groundwater level in the aquifer although on average 33 of the irrigation water returned to the aquifer the rest 67 of the water remains in the surface environment discussed in 3 3 irrigation return flow this causes the groundwater level declining day by day in the dry season as the water pumped from the groundwater is higher than the recharge from irrigation the values of net recharge to the aquifer from the irrigation are negative here the values from may to october are ignored as this study is done considering dry months november to april only it shows there is a very large depletion of groundwater levels during the dry season fig 19 on the other hand the aquifer is partially replenishing again in the rainy season fig 14 as groundwater recharge in the rainy season is adding to the aquifer and the is only very limited abstraction of groundwater from supplemental irrigation however overall depletion of groundwater is higher than replenishment and that s why groundwater depth is continuously increasing in this area fig 10 fig 20 shows the spatial and temporal variation of monthly average net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation during dry season nov to april average monthly net recharge to the aquifer from irrigation is changing from 392 mm month to 0 mm month the negative value indicates depletion of groundwater level of an aquifer although excessive irrigation water can be returned back to the aquifer as a return flow however net recharge to the aquifer is negative due to overexploitation of the aquifer for irrigation so groundwater abstraction for irrigation should be reduced by adopting different water saving methods details on section 3 3 in the agricultural fields to reduce the depletion of groundwater levels additionally excessive abstraction of groundwater cause a steady increase in sulphur and calcium that worsen the water quality gejl et al 2019 excessive abstraction of groundwater can also have a negative impact on carbon footprint long term excessive abstraction of groundwater contributes to an increase ch4 budget gooddy and darling 2005 kulongoski and mcmahon 2019 different irrigation improvement measures should be adopted and details study on the effect of irrigation return flow on overall groundwater effect should be done and simulated to obtain more accurate results a detailed study should be conducted to know the actual amount of carbon and other materials mix up with the groundwater due to excessive abstraction 3 7 effect of spatial scaling fig 21 shows average groundwater recharge maps considering the irrigation of january of both 30 m and 300 m resolution overall the results indicated that the difference in average recharge was 0 6 mm year and 0 05 mm month while the difference due to average irrigation was 0 3 mm year when impact of irrigation was considered the simulation time for one year groundwater recharge using 300 m resolution inputs was 15 2 min which was 22 times faster than the time required for simulation using 30 m resolution inputs 339 4 min year ovarall the changes from different resolutions were relatively small eventhough simulation with 300 m resolution was much faster and less time consuming however the lower resolution irrigation maps had problems with accurate representation of irrigation rates a raster cell had only one specific value within its area so a 300 m raster grid having an area of 90000 sq m is homogeneous for specific input on the other hand for a raster of 30 m resolution the area of homogeneity is 900 sq m grid area areas with a smaller size than 90000 sq m were not included and represented precisely in a raster of 300 m resolution this results in smaller areas of a certain irrigation rate beign lumped into another irrigation rate value in a lower resolution raster map which in turn results in incorrect groundwater recharge calculations in those smaller areas for example fig 22 portrays some of the comparisons between maps of both resolutions the black circles indicates the special interest zones the small areas black circle marked in the raster map of 30 m having 0 mm month irrigation fig 22 a and recharge fig 22 c were absent in the corresponding raster maps of 300 m fig 22 b and 21 d respectively this was a misrepresentation of spatially distributed irrigation and result of recharge for example in the airport area where there is no chance of irrigation and recharge 300 m maps may misinterpret the built up zone with the vegetative region so the heterogeneity of spatial irrigation value was lost to some degree in the lower resolution maps hence studies requiring high precision on small areas will need raster maps of higher resolution 4 conclusions the study focused on assessing the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge in the northwest bangladeshi district of rajshahi groundwater recharge was estimated using a water balance model wetspass considering two different scenarios i irrigation as an additional input and ii without irrigation as an input finally the impact of irrigation on groundwater recharge and the contribution of irrigation return flow to the groundwater system was analyzed deep tube wells fed irrigated area increased in the rajshahi area from 2006 2016 however the total irrigated area in rajshahi remained constant surface water fed irrigated area decreased slightly the highest irrigation rate was in puthia upazila sub district while the lowest was found in tanore around 91 of overall irrigation came from groundwater with the remaining 9 originating from surface water the trends of irrigation rate and groundwater depth revealed an increase in irrigation and groundwater depth the parallel trend showed that groundwater abstraction for irrigation could be a reason for water table depletion the average return flow was 353 mm year it was highest in january and lowest in november 20 50 of the total irrigation was observed to be return flow 33 on average around 98 of the groundwater recharge came from irrigation return flow during the dry season the spatially distributed return flow ranged from 305 to 401 mm year it contributed significantly during the dry season to groundwater recharge in the study area the highest return flow was in central right upazilas puthia and charghat and the lowest was in northern upazilas tanore and bagha the scaling analysis showed a very small change in model simulation results for both 30 m and 300 m spatial resolutions there was a substantial reduction in recharge simulation time with 300 m resolution inputs compared to 30 m raster maps however the raster maps of the lower resolution were not good for detailed analysis therefore the use of lower resolution inputs can only be recommended when a quick investigation is required over precision analysis finally it could be concluded that irrigation has a significant impact on groundwater recharge during the dry season in rajshahi district of bangladesh and that irrigation return flow was the main source of groundwater recharge in the dry season however a huge quantity of groundwater still leaves the system due to excessive pumping therefore effective irrigation management including efficient irrigation application methods and better irrigation scheduling is necessary to keep the groundwater sustainable in the study area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared
